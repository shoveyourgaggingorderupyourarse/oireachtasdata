    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#B00200"><p>I have received apologies from Deputy Whitmore.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the implementation of the new retrofitting plan, the built environment generally and embodied emissions and emissions generally from the built environment, including construction and demolition, and everything relating to the built environment with respect to climate, including recycling and reuse of materials.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome: from Technology University of the Shannon, Mr. Seamus Hoyne; from the University of Lincoln, Dr. Cathy Daly, archaeological and ethnographic conservator; and from Carrig Conservation International Limited, Dr. Caroline Engel Purcell, head of research.  Mr. Hoyne is joining us online and Dr. Daly and Dr. Engel Purcell are present with us in the committee room.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice whereby they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For the witness who is attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, he may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask any member joining us online to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Hoyne to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to engage with committee members today.  In preparing my statement, I have sought to provide insights from three different perspectives to support the committee&rsquo;s work.  First, the context of research, development and innovation will be vital if we are to deliver on our emissions reduction targets.  It is imperative that in Ireland we take every opportunity to co-operate with European partners in order that we can gain insights into models, technologies and systems which can support the delivery of our current emissions targets and, indeed, plan for future targets which will arise out of the EU Fit for 55 legislative package and the re-powered EU action plan.  Extensive funds are being provided via Horizon Europe, LIFE and other EU funding programmes but more needs to be done to mobilise Irish companies and researchers to access these funds.  Communities of practice on areas such as deep retrofit, embodied carbon and related areas which engage researchers with industry partners need to be established to share best practice and drive innovation.  All arms of the State, including the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, Enterprise Ireland and others need to continue to expand their efforts and have funding available to grow the knowledge base and deliver innovative solutions into the market.</p><p>Compared with many other countries, our bank of building performance data, specifically operational data, is limited and much more needs to be done to conduct research and share such data to facilitate analysis and benchmarking and stimulate further innovation.  Data repositories, data-sharing agreements and the clear dissemination of results will increase sectoral know-how and expertise.  Just one example of this is research completed by TUS on the performance of air source heat pumps in retrofits, which highlighted opportunities to optimise heat pump performance through appropriate design approaches and the important role that commissioning plays.  Improvements of up to 10% on the heat pump coefficient of performance were achieved, leading directly to reduced building emissions, and the results were published in a good-practice guide to inform industry.</p><p> The proposed research action within the national retrofit plan on the heat loss indicator, HLI, has become a critical issue.  The HLI is an indicator of the overall performance of the building fabric and is currently used to indicate whether a building is eligible for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, heat pump support.  Achieving the required HLI level of 2.3 can sometimes result in significant increased retrofit costs, which have limited energy and emissions benefits.  This research task, identified with the retrofit plan, must be completed urgently to unlock the retrofit opportunities for a significant cohort of buildings.</p><p> The second perspective I would like to share comes from my role as chairperson of the board of directors of the Tipperary Energy Agency.  The agency, which is a social enterprise, was established in 1998 and is a partnership between Tipperary County Council, TUS and other regional actors.  It established the Superhomes one-stop shop pilot in 2015.  From completing ten retrofits in 2015, it grew to a point where in 2021, it entered into a joint venture with Electric Ireland, with the ambition to deliver more than 8,500 retrofits annually by 2031.  Critical to Electric Ireland Superhomes and other one-stop shops will be growing the quantity and expertise of staff within the one-stop shop and of the contractors they work with.</p><p> While the national retrofit plan provides the basis on which companies can chart career paths for workers within the sector, there is clear challenge at present within the construction sector to recruit and retain staff.  Ireland risks not achieving our proposed emissions targets unless we consider further innovations to attract people to work in construction, and specifically within the sustainable built environment.</p><p> The final area I raise relates to education, training and skills development.  TUS is leading a consortium to deliver the digital academy for sustainable built environment, DASBE, initiative with the ambition of scaling up the delivery of upskilling in the interconnected areas of energy efficiency, digitisation and the circular economy.  DASBE partners already have developed new programmes related to the circular economy, energy infrastructure, digital tools and community energy systems.  It recently validated programmes in residential energy retrofit management and the energy renovation of traditional buildings.  The majority of these programmes will be offered in online or blended learning formats to facilitate access and have been designed with strong engagement from industry stakeholders.  Using a unique digital platform, DASBE will enable those seeking to upskill to target their specific requirements and understand progression pathways and opportunities.  Critically, DASBE is co-operating with the further education sector and initiatives such as Build Digital to maximise synergies and impacts.</p><p> The challenge of upskilling our workforce cannot be underestimated given the resource constraints that exist, and our plumbers, electricians, construction workers, engineers and architects will be at the forefront of delivering emission reductions in the built environment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathy Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation.  I am a senior lecturer in conservation of cultural heritage at the University of Lincoln in the UK and a senior research consultant with Carrig Conservation International Limited in Ireland.  My research focuses on both understanding and responding to the impacts of climate change from a heritage conservation perspective.  My colleague, Dr. Caroline Engel Purcell, is the head of research and energy at Carrig Conservation International and her work focuses on climate change mitigation in the historical built environment.  Our statement will focus on how the adaptation of built heritage and the inclusion of heritage in wider policies and planning can contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.  We will also point out some of the challenges facing the sector in fully realising this potential.</p><p> While the cultural heritage sector has in the past primarily been focused on managing monuments and landscapes, it is increasingly turning its attention to the question of sustainability and climate action.  In 2019, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, ICOMOS, international working group on climate change published The Future of our Pasts.  The 2021 European Cultural Heritage Green Paper builds on this with recommendations for both heritage operators and policymakers.</p><p> Cultural resources such as built heritage provide societies with meaningful links to their urban, rural, and natural surroundings and help communicate the impacts of climate change and localise climate action.  The consideration of culture therefore has the potential to orient different social practices, such as individual behaviour, and to develop place-based solutions that legitimise climate policies.  In the Heritage in Climate Planning, HiCLIP, research project we analysed climate action plans from nine different countries and identified 17 thematic activities where culture had a strategic role, including waste reduction, energy efficiency and planning methodologies.  However, despite the acknowledgment of cultural resources in visions for sustainable climate action, specific targets were found to be lacking.  This identifies a need for more explicit inclusion of cultural heritage and the parallel identification of relevant stakeholders who can ensure the implementation of actions.</p><p> In Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Built &amp;amp; Archaeological Heritage 2019, CCSAP, we worked with stakeholders to identify nine priority impacts, one of which is maladaptation, that is, human responses to the changing climate that result in negative, though often unintended, outcomes.  One of the main causes of maladaptation for heritage is inappropriate energy retrofit works.  This may be due to a lack of awareness of the heritage significance, a lack of technical understanding, or both.  While the current emphasis on energy retrofitting is important, the integrity of traditional buildings with cultural heritage value also needs to be respected.  The challenge, therefore, is to formulate individual building retrofit strategies that create a balance between the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the preservation of cultural heritage.  The specific physical properties and existing thermal performance of traditional buildings must be considered as part of the retrofit strategy.  The risks of applying insulation materials and methods designed for use on modern construction to traditional structures include damage both to the building fabric and to the health of the occupants.</p><p> The sectoral adaptation plan suggested several research and capacity-building actions which are relevant to the current discussion.  These include establishing and demonstrating green ways of working within historic buildings, preparing case studies that demonstrate good practice in energy efficiency and climate resiliency, providing training to fill identified skills shortages and gaps in capacity and the creation of a green heritage or green communities award for sustainable reuse and energy saving within historic buildings and towns.</p><p> In 2019, Carrig was commissioned by Historic England to compare the whole-life carbon of retrofit versus new construction meeting the current building regulations and nearly-zero energy building, NZEB, standards.  This study found it would take approximately 60 years for a new NZEB to recoup the embodied carbon spent in construction.  In other words, the greenest building is the one that is already built.  According to the 2016 census,16% of all private homes in Ireland were constructed prior to 1945.  A large majority of these buildings were, therefore, likely built using traditional materials and methods.  Often, the most appropriate insulation for traditional buildings is of a natural type, such as wood fibre, hemp and so on.  However, their use is limited by confusion around Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant qualification stipulations, a lack of requirement to account for embodied carbon in the construction industry, and cost.  It may be years before we truly understand the impact of retrofitting works being undertaken today.</p><p> Hygrothermal analysis and pre- and post-retrofit monitoring are essential to reduce maladaptation.  However, their importance is not yet widely understood by the construction industry.  We would like to see specific grants introduced to cover the costs of hygrothermal modelling and monitoring on retrofits of traditional buildings.  This could come with a requirement for anonymised case studies to be made publicly available.  In our experience, private homeowners often do not have the resources to commission such works and this is, in our view, the quickest way to start building up a national resource of actual retrofit case studies.  The tools, knowledge and skills required to drive the sustainable adaptation of historic buildings are held by small cohort of building professionals within Ireland and support is required to enable broader knowledge dissemination and the upskilling of specifiers and installers.</p><p> Our cultural heritage is a resource that holds many lessons in the context of sustainable, low-energy ways of living.  In addition, through its capacity for adaptive reuse, the historic built environment can make a significant contribution to a low-carbon society through compatible, energy-efficiency upgrades and the revitalisation of our historic town and city centres, both of which will lower dependency on fossil fuels.  This transformation needs to be based on a sound understanding of heritage values and traditional building physics.  It requires research and the development of place-based approaches.  It also has great potential for engaging communities in bottom-up climate action.</p><p> Professional heritage conservation is centred around the concept of managed change using a negotiated, values-based approach.  Increased integration of the sector into wider climate strategies would, therefore, be an advantage as Ireland strives to undertake transformational social change in a short period of time.</p></speech>

I understand you are guests of Deputy Bruton.  I hope the session will be as educational for you as I believe it will be for us.  You are all very welcome.</p> <p>  This meeting is confined to three hours and, as usual, I propose that members take two minutes to put their questions to the witnesses and then the witnesses will have much more latitude and can take as much time as they need to answer the questions.  If we have time, we will have a second and third round.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I will be brief with my questions in order to give them some opportunity to answer.  Will Mr. Hoyne expand on the importance of the HLI studies and the potential impact of that in our approach to the use of heat pumps and other technologies?  He stated that further innovations are needed in order to attract people to work in construction.  Has Mr. Hoyne some ideas on that, and specifically in the context of the sustainable built environment?</p> <p>  Will Dr. Daly reflect on Ireland's approach to the retrofitting scheme?  Is there a gap or an opportunity there with our approach?  We have a tiered number, or a menu, of options.  Does Dr. Daly feel the need for a more tailored approach for the types of properties that she has identified in pre-1945 buildings or in a lot of one-off housing?  Does she believe there is a need for a more nuanced approach?  If so, would that require a different skill set?  What might that look like?  Do we have enough heritage officers or conservationists?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#E00400"><p>I will take the HLI question first.  HLI is a measure of heat lost through the building fabric.  The original benchmark was set at 2.3 units, or watts per degree Kelvin per metre squared.  Essentially, it is a method of measuring the heat lost through the building.  It was decided, based on initial modelling, that for a heat pump to work the heat loss indicator should be below 2.3.  There are sound physics bases for that.  Through the retrofit projects that have been done to date, and the assessments that have been done of buildings, it became clear that for some buildings - and generally this is on a case-by-case basis depending on the building typology and particular physical aspects of building - to get to the heat loss indicator of 2.3 in an existing retrofit could require investment, for example in taking up pavements outside to reduce the heat loss.  We could add significant investment onto the retrofit and maybe only achieve a 1% or 2% energy efficiency reduction, or emissions reduction, in that building.</p><p>The level of investment required to achieve that is potentially outside the scope of the building owner or homeowner and so, in many cases, those retrofits are not progressing.   The proposed study is to look at the efficiency of retrofitting with a heat pump where the heat loss indicator, HLI, is between 2.3 and 2.6.  Initial evidence indicates that, with such a HLI, a heat pump will still work very efficiently and achieve a suitable coefficient of performance, COP, and there will be very minimal impacts on the overall running costs and emissions of the building in question.  The HLI issue has been being raised for a number of years.  The industry is very keen for research to be done urgently to address this issue so that we can potentially amend the guidelines and regulations in respect of the national retrofit plan and funding grant schemes to allow retrofits to progress on buildings whose HLIs fall within the 2.3 and 2.6 band.  That is the critical piece of work that needs to be done.  The great thing is that we now have a significant number of retrofits done.  All of those retrofitted buildings will have a building energy rating, which involves a calculation of the HLI.  We can now look at the performance of those buildings and look at the impact of heat pump running costs within the 2.3 to 2.6 band.  The numbers need to be crunched to inform the policy decision.  That is what is urgent now.</p><p> As to the Deputy's second question, which was on innovations to attract new people into construction and particularly the area of sustainable built environment, we need to change the messaging with regard to attracting people into the construction sector, particularly in respect of the sustainable built environment area.  We are moving into a space in which a great amount of digital tools are being used.  There is an image of the construction or built environment sector as being highly labour intensive.  We are now looking at modular systems and a lot of design work being done in offices by very skilled designers, researchers, engineers and architects.  On site, we are moving towards much cleaner systems.  That is the first aspect we need to get across with regard to the construction and sustainable built environment sectors.  That image and messaging needs to be very clear if we are to attract people in.  </p><p> The other critical issue is that there is simply a lack of workers in the country.  We need to again consider looking across Europe to attract people to come to the country and to encourage people who gained really valuable skills after moving abroad in recent years to return to Ireland.  A concerted effort is needed.  With regard to plumbers and electricians, a very significant amount of work is going on in terms of attracting people into apprenticeships and scaling up the number of apprenticeships but we need to scale those efforts up even further to achieve the numbers we need to achieve.</p></speech>

The short answer is that we do believe there are some small changes that could be made that would make a big difference but, if the Deputy does not mind, I will hand over to Dr. Engel Purcell, who will answer in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caroline Engel Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#F00300"><p>I thank Dr. Daly.  The short answer is that a more nuanced approach is required.  A few years ago, in 2019 and 2020, we worked with the Heritage Council to design a lecture series.  It was very well attended and sold out within two days.  We kept expanding numbers.  Approximately 120 specifiers attended that five-day lecture series.  We brought together a host of professionals, covering all aspects of retrofit in traditional and historic buildings.  That was the first step.  We now need to move onto training and, possibly, accreditation.  To begin, anyone specifying works on traditional buildings needs to understand how they are constructed, how the buildings' physics work and how heat and moisture move through them.  This is commonly referred to as the hydrothermal performance of the building.  That is the basic conservation training required to understand how these buildings work.</p><p>We now have hygrothermal risk assessment, which is condensation risk assessment using modelling and thermal bridge modelling.  These are skills professionals will need into the future in order to make sure specifications for the retrofit of these buildings are safe and appropriate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#G00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  As this conversation continues, I am sure we will learn much more and tease out more of the issues.  Mr. Hoyne mentioned that he had experience of this in Tipperary.  Regarding the proposed working of the retrofitting scheme, warmer homes scheme and the setting up of the one-stop shops, the last update we had from the SEAI and the Department was that two of the proposed 19 one-stop shops have been approved.  I am not sure if that number may have increased at this point.  Given the scale of what needs to be done, are 19 one-stop shops nationwide enough to cover the potential demand and need?  Given there will be 19, I imagine quite large geographical regions would be covered by each.  Would that potentially lead to a lack of competition and a lack of value for money in the carrying out of retrofitting works?  Mr. Hoyne might address that.</p> <p>  Dr. Daly mentioned that, for many reasons, the greenest building is the one which is already built.  Many heritage buildings of historical value were town centre, high street buildings.  If those buildings were inhabited, that would add to their green value and a reduction in emissions because people would be living in town centres and that would reduce the need for car journeys.  We are all familiar with these buildings.  Many of them, particularly their interiors, are in a bad state of disrepair.  To make them habitable would require a great deal of work, involving thousands upon thousands of euro.  There would also be the challenge of making them energy and heat efficient, and retrofitting would be needed.  It is easier to imagine how stand-alone houses could be deep retrofitted and heat pumps installed.  Would these high street buildings pose a bigger challenge?  I am referring to high street terrace buildings, some of which include accommodation above shop premises, that, in many cases, were built at the end of the 19 century.  Is there a challenge with deep retrofitting these buildings and maintaining their historical and heritage value?  I am not sure if Dr. Daly is familiar with the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund and the proposal to grant-aid the purchase of vacant premises by people who want to buy and live in them.  I am not sure what figure is being talked about and I do not know if it will go towards covering the cost of retrofitting.  I hope that is clear.  If Dr. Daly needs me to clarify the question, she can let me know.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for that great question.  The most recent update I have is that there are now five fully registered one-stop shops through the SEAI registration system.  I understand that the SEAI is working through the process with others.  To give some more comprehensive information on the one-stop shops, from Electric Ireland's perspective, it has grown from a Tipperary-based activity.  The vision now for Electric Ireland Superhomes is that we operate nationally.  The majority of the one-stop shops that are through the registration system are on a national basis.  It is open for a potential homeowner in Cork, Tipperary, Donegal or Dublin to engage with any of the one-stop shops to obtain a service.  Critical to the one-stop shops is that they will work with contractors in the regions and localities that  the homeowner is in.  For example, we in Electric Ireland Superhomes are building up that bank of contractors we work with, as are many other of the one-stop shops.  Regarding the ambition for Electric Ireland Superhomes, we have a very challenging growth scenario to get to 8,500 retrofits per annum by 2031.  That is a cumulative figure of 35,000 to 40,000 between now and 2031.</p><p>That equates to approximately 8% of the target of 500,000.  As for whether 19 or 20 one-stop shops are enough, in general they should be if there is an equal spread.</p><p> In regard to whether there will be a disadvantage depending on the geographical distribution of those one-stop shops, I honestly do not think so because the one-stop shops are working to develop the capacity of the contractors in localities and the regions.  It is important that we get that retrofitting expertise throughout the country.  It cannot be dependent on a limited number of contractors.  These are minor works for existing buildings and we need to do them well.  We need to design the systems properly and get them installed, and get the upgrade works done properly within the buildings.  To do that, we need to upskill and develop the capacity of existing small and medium enterprises, SMEs, within the regions.  That is where the economic benefit will come into the country and the regions through the national retrofit plan.  The one-stop shops will scale up the delivery, but the retrofits will be delivered on the ground by the construction companies and the SMEs.  On balance, the analysis shows that 20 one-stop shops will be able to deliver the capacity needed, but behind those one-stop shops will have to be a large number of contractors to be able to deliver that work.</p></speech>

When we talk about heritage conservation, we are talking about managed change.  In order for these buildings to have a future, they need to be comfortable and people need to want to live in them.  It is not about the heritage values preventing adaptation and change within these buildings but rather about finding the correct balance and appropriate ways to do it.  As the Deputy said, there are also many co-benefits to having people living in towns and revitalising these buildings.  The Heritage Council has its town centre health check programme, which deals with this as well.  I will hand over to Dr. Engel Purcell, who has more specifics on the retrofitting of these buildings.</p></speech>

The case studies were given to us by Historic England, and we did not design the retrofits.  One of the retrofits related to Victorian terraced housing.  Dr. Davey mentioned embodied carbon.  The retrofit works, which were quite extensive and which I would call a deep retrofit, accounted for only 2% of the total embodied carbon versus 30% for a new build.  In terms of carbon savings, therefore, retrofitting is definitely something we should pursue.</p> <p>  There are risks and we need to be careful, but this may be an instance where, if a local authority were in possession of a run of terraced houses, it could pursue solid-wall insulation across them.  The risk in not retrofitting the entire terrace is that there might be thermal bridging or there might develop some condensation risks around those junctions.  We need to be sure, therefore, about the types of insulation we are using such that it is vapour-open and will not trap moisture.  We need to be sure about the specification details such that there is no break in insulation that could become a thermal bridge.  Moreover, we need to be cognisant of the impact of these works on the heritage value.  We must ask whether what we are doing will change the value, look or heritage of the building to too great an extent.  I am afraid the issue has to be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

What I am trying to get at is how challenging, but also how realistic, is the idea that a first-time buyer or someone who is looking for a home can look at one of these vacant on-street premises and perhaps avail of a Government grant to renovate it and an SEAI grant to deep retrofit it.  Is that doable on a large scale?  Mr. Hoyne might wish to come in on this as well.</p></speech>

We need more data on the retrofit of these traditional buildings through the hydrothermal modelling if we are to develop some sort of library of common construction details or better renovation details, as people have called them, in order that specifiers such as us can go to it, see whether the details are similar to what we have in a building and model ourselves to double-check.  It is about guiding the profession to know where to go.</p></speech>

It is very appealing to us to try to reactivate so much of this stock that is in our towns, villages and cities throughout the country.  There is a help-to-buy scheme which is geared towards new buildings for first-time buyers.  It has been mooted by members of this committee and others that a help-to-renovate scheme, targeted at first-time buyers, might make sense though I am sure it is not as easy as it sounds.  Has Dr. Engel Purcell considered this?  Mr. Hoyne may also want to come in on this.  If the Government did come out with such a scheme, would the system have capacity to deal with the shift of the workforce towards the existing housing stock?  It sounds as though many of these renovations are very difficult.  There needs to be a very nuanced and careful approach to them.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' views.</p></speech>

Dr. Engel Purcell and Dr. Daly made a point about capacity building.  We have built on the experience of the original programme developed by the Heritage Council and we have just validated a new certificate in energy renovation of traditional buildings.  It takes that original lecture series, as Dr. Engel Purcell termed it.  That is now a validated module but we have also added a module in terms of digital tools for defect analysis in traditional buildings.  The first point is to build up the capacity in the sector.  We are launching that programme which will start again in June.  We hope to have more than 100 people on that.  There is considerable knowledge in the sector in terms of retrofitting and renovation of buildings.</p> <p>  In essence, every retrofit, whether it is on a traditional building or a non-traditional building, is actually unique because it is a home.  It is a building.  The people who want to occupy it have particular requests or demands and there are particular energy targets.  The traditional or culture building brings in additional technical considerations that need to be taken care of.  It is those nuances for which capacity in the sector needs to be built in.  There will certainly be a percentage of buildings that need expert people and maybe a limited number of those.  The first point is to bring existing architects, engineers and specifiers up to speed on the different approaches that need to be taken and the right and appropriate approaches.  For the traditional buildings, it is the appropriate solution rather than the technical physics solution that needs to be considered.</p> <p>  Work is ongoing on capacity.  The Heritage Council is very committed to this agenda and there is considerable interest.  Marrying that with the policy initiatives to allow us to focus on these buildings in town centres will open up capacity for people to live there.  We need to make sure we align the policy and the incentives for people to purchase these homes and then retrofit them in an energy-efficient, emission-reduction-friendly and appropriate manner.</p><p>The higher education and education and training spaces are certainly very committed to supporting capacity building.  There is considerable experience among people in Ireland and internationally on which we can build to address these types of buildings.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses give us some of the numbers, in terms of the embodied carbon in a standard three-bedroom home or wherever, that one would save being expended by going for reconstruction, refurbishment and renewal, versus site clearance and starting from scratch?  One of the difficulties is that embodied carbon is not on our inventory and many of our international obligations do not refer to it.  However it would be useful for us to know, in terms of framing subsidies, what the embodied carbon value is and whether that could be factored in some way into the policy design.</p><p>Mr. Hoyne made the point about the risk of overspecification in terms of the spec we have for heat pumps.  I wonder, given the gaps in our knowledge and our current capacity, whether this is a more general issue of a tendency to go for overspecification of what should be done in one visit to a building, instead of trying to do all the shallow retrofits early with the capacity we have.  I know Grace Park Heights in my constituency does not have great insulation.  One could go in and do a shallow retrofit, put in heat controls and try to do the whole estate at once with the capacity we have.  Given the state of knowledge and what Mr. Hoyne has said, should we be doing that as an alternative to having one visit and getting the absolute premium product done in one session?</p><p>In terms of the scale of labour and the professional, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said he is planning to spend &euro;8 billion over a decade.  That would be matched to become &euro;16 billion over a decade.  If we are talking about &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion <i>per annum</i>, that is only less than 1% of GDP.  Is it really that great a challenge for us to free up the capacity to do that?  I know it is coming at a time when we are trying to push house building to levels at which it has not been for years but are we overstating the challenge of capacity?  Mr. Hoyne has been close to the ground in Tipperary to try to do this.  I am very interested in the refurbishment-demolition balance and what we should do to nudge towards refurbishment.</p></speech>

In general, refurbishment would have much lower embodied carbon because one is using fewer materials.  One is improving what is already there.  There would be great embodied carbon savings, especially with traditional buildings, if one was using more natural materials which tend to be vapour open and more appropriate for the buildings.  Wood fibre is technically considered carbon neutral.  If one is using wood fibre insulation throughout, then the embodied carbon uplift will be minimal, but I was not primary researcher on that study.  I will contact the primary researcher and get back to the Deputy with more details.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#K00500"><p>It is a very good question.  Certainly as experience in retrofitting has developed, the original focus for retrofit has been a fabric-first approach, then airtightness, ventilation and introduction of, for example, heat-pump technology, as the mechanism to get one's deep retrofit into the A or B category.</p><p>Certainly, in Ireland, as we are greening our grid and decarbonising our grid and the focus moves away from saving kilowatt hours to reducing tonnes of CO2, one can start to have the debate on the analysis where we ask do we need to go for very high specifications in terms of the fabric retrofit measures or can we reduce those slightly or not do the ones that cause significant challenges in terms of implementation, either from a technical or a cost perspective, and get the benefit of the grid to decarbonise the heating, in particular, in the building.  There is an evolving debate around that topic in the sector at present and that is happening across Europe.  I am secretary general of the European federation of local and regional energy agencies and I work with energy agencies all across Europe.  Like most of the engineers in the energy agencies, we would have been very much fabric first and in favour of proper specification for the fabric but now there is that debate that if we really need to reduce our carbon emissions, maybe in some cases we can do a less stringent fabric retrofit and focus on carbon reduction through the heat pump.</p><p> Having said that, in the majority of the one-stop shops and, certainly, from the Electric Ireland Superhomes approach, we have very much a design-led approach where we go room by room in terms of the upgrades required in the heating distribution system, and based on the fabric upgrade, the airtightness and ventilation.  The other witnesses mentioned that it is important that the homes are comfortable, safe and healthy and those are considerations that we need to be aware of.</p><p> Much research has been done on so-called "retrofit passports" where we look at measures over a longer period of time rather than an immediate fix.  As Deputy Bruton said of the example the Deputy was speaking about in his constituency, we may go in and do attic insulation, some wall insulation and some heating controls but we are not doing significant upgrades to the heating distribution system or the heating system itself.  What is really important in designing those retrofit passports or that staged retrofit is that we avoid locking-in carbon at that stage and we make sure that we design that retrofit so that in another 12 months, when we want to come back in to upgrade the heating systems or install heat pumps that we have not implemented a measure that restricts that.</p><p> On balance, however, given the urgency in terms of addressing the emission reductions we have to achieve, certainly, my personal view would be that we go in, do a proper assessment, do the design and try to get that retrofit completed once.  For the homeowners, they end up in a more comfortable building much more quickly.  We have a lot of experience of being able to do those retrofits very efficiently.</p><p> In terms of the capacity, Deputy Bruton correctly pointed out that a significant challenge at present is that we also have the ambition in terms of new builds.  The data from the Construction Industry Federation and anecdotally on the ground from a design and engineer and architect perspective, and the quantity surveyor, QS, perspective, and the people on the ground are that it is very competitive to attract and retain staff.  The additional complication is that the retrofit agenda is now paramount across Europe and there is mobility of workers, who would have traditionally perhaps come to Ireland to work in the construction sector and who now are attracted to work in any of the other EU member states.  There is a capacity issue on the ground.  We lost expertise in terms of people who left the country or maybe changed careers during the downturn.  We need to bring that expertise back.  In saying that, the SME constructive companies are now very engaged in the retrofit agenda because of the multi-annual funding that is in place.</p><p>That is critical.  The big challenge of engaging them in the retrofit market was that they did not know if there was work next year.  Now, through the one-stop shops, they should have a pipeline of work which helps them to retain their workers and have 12 months of work rather than a six months' stop-start agenda.  Hopefully, that is useful.</p></speech>

We all realise that we need to get more apprenticeships into the field to be able to deal with our big retrofit plans.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is keen to do that.  Mr. Hoyne has seen that the Minister is doing a great deal of work there.  The Minister's target is the creation of 10,000 apprenticeships a year.  Is that enough or what number do we need to reach to have the number of apprentices coming into the market to be able to carry out these retrofits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#M00400"><p>That figure of 10,000 was based on analysis done by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, SOLAS and others.  The spread of those apprenticeships is important.  We have significant capacity ongoing in terms of electricians who are very important in terms of the electrification of the grid but we also need to increase the quantum of apprenticeships in the plumbing field because we are talking about changing out heating systems in 500,000 homes and installing heat pumps in a large number of new buildings.</p> <p>  We also potentially have, apart from apprenticeships, other opportunities for education and development in terms of existing craftworkers - electricians, plumbers and plasterers - who can take the roles of retrofit co-ordinators.  They will then start to ply the expertise that they have built over five or ten years as expert craftspeople to become site managers, site leaders and retrofit co-ordinators.  That builds a career pathway.  That is part of the messaging that we need to get across, coming back to my earlier point, that the image of the apprenticeship or the craftworker has to change.  Previously, going into a craft or a trade, one potentially saw it becoming a dead end for a number of years.  We now have many development opportunities for those people who may wish to progress their careers.  Having served their time as an apprentice and worked as a plumber or electrician, now they can become site managers or expert retrofit co-ordinators.  It is important that we develop that pipeline of progression pathways and part of our work certainly is working with the further education sector to see how we develop those pathways.</p></speech>

Not only is it about creating new apprenticeships and attracting people into the market, it is also about, as Mr. Hoyne stated earlier, trying either to get people to return from abroad or to take them back home.  It is important then that people who are currently in those sectors can segue into the retrofitting market and, as Mr. Hoyne said, play a leading role as project site managers or the managers of a retrofit scheme.  More emphasis on that is useful.</p> <p>  The retrofit scheme is excellent.  A small issue I have with it is my discovery that there is no real update for people who live in protected structures.  For example, the street that I live on is all protected structures.  There are so many cases where people cannot put in double-glazed windows; they have to stick with single-glazed windows.  Such people are at a severe disadvantage and are not able to get their homes retrofitted.  It is something I brought up with the Minister previously where it was said that they are trying to look at a steering group to oversee within the Department, the objective of which is to finalise guidance for public consultation later in the year.  That will try to give advice to people about how best to retrofit a home when they live in a protected structure.  In Dr. Purcell's experience, how does that go about?  If I am living in a protected structure, the home is 100 years old and I want to have energy efficient savings and retrofit it, is that an extremely difficult process?  The Department is trying to put together something for those people.  What is Dr. Purcell's professional view on that?</p></speech>

It is difficult in a way, but there are processes one goes through, including the regular planning process or a section 5 application, to gain a better understanding of whether certain retrofit works are going to require planning permission.  Typically, we engage with the local conservation officer from the outset of a project when the building is protected.  We have the discussions early on before we get too far down the road.  Where there is no local conservation officer, I imagine it is harder.  Certain counties do not have one.  We need further guidance on how to proceed with the retrofitting of protected structures, again working on heritage value and retaining it in the process.</p></speech>

The sooner there is clarity on how people who live in such homes can avail of retrofitting, the better.  It would be really useful.  I thank the delegates for the information.

I have one point for Drs. Daly and Engel Purcell.  The opening statement mentioned confusion over the grant qualification stipulations and the use of more natural fabrics for insulation.  What needs to happen?  What are the blockages affecting the use of natural materials?</p> <p>  On the 19 one-stop shops getting up and running, previous witnesses have expressed concern over the standard of the work and stated we might be walking ourselves into the self-regulation model, which has been so damaging in the construction industry.  Could Mr. Hoyne state whether we should be concerned?  Will there be appropriate oversight?  If we have 19 one-stop shops operating, who will ensure the work is of a standard such that we will not be retrofitting the retrofits in ten years?  I put in a pellet stove in the early days of the SEAI grant.  It cost me thousands of euro in repairs because the person who fitted it was not properly trained to fit a pellet stove where there was a back boiler.  I am concerned that in a few years we will find ourselves asking whether we should have had more regulation or oversight of the 19 one-stop shops.</p></speech>

The issue is that insulations that are most appropriate for traditional buildings generally just have a CE mark.  I will not go into the detail on how an agr&eacute;ment certificate is acquired and the process.  We just need better clarity on whether a CE mark is enough for the SEAI grants.</p></speech>

We have heard from some about the Energiesprong model, which involves prefabrication off-site.  This is regarded as more appealing in that one does not necessarily have to come from the construction industry.  One is more likely to get women applying for the jobs.  Should we be considering this also?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#O00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  With regard to quality assurance, there were issues with grant schemes in terms of renewable energy systems in that there was a mismatch between knowledge and experience and the types of systems installed.  The registration process for the one-stop shops requires a detailed quality assurance process.  From our experience in Tipperary, the typical approach is that where we work with a contractor doing a retrofit for the first time, we shadow him or her.  A member of our design team works with the contractor to help him or her to ensure the work is done to the standard set out in all the specifications and guidelines of the SEAI.  We also have to produce a BER before and after.  As I mentioned in one of my previous contributions, we take a design-led approach.  We do room-by-room assessments so we know that what is specified is appropriate for the building.  Options for the retrofit are then agreed with the homeowner and the contractor is recruited to deliver them at the price agreed.</p> <p>  The one-stop shops are required to have quality assurance and oversight.  Behind that is upskilling of the construction workers.  Several education and training boards are now running courses on airtightness, ventilation system installation, external wall installation and all the installation products.  We have national training centres.  There are to be six around the country.  The courses are short courses of one to three days.  We put the relevant contract workers through the training.  We also have training and education programmes for the engineers.  Therefore, there is a multilayered approach to achieving quality assurance.  It is a question of the right product in the right place in the right building, designed appropriately.</p> <p>  We have learned many lessons from the past.  The SEAI has taken a very diligent approach.  Getting through the one-stop shop registration process is rigorous.  The board of Electric Ireland Superhomes has had much input into that with the team.  Considering how the scheme is designed, I am confident we are avoiding risks.</p> <p>  On the supplementary question on Energiesprong, the theory is perfect.  It certainly works in the Dutch model in that much of the housing is very similar.  There are many terraced buildings and houses that are exact replicas.  We can do a design, prefabricate off site and do a row of terraced buildings relatively easily.  It is more expensive, in principle, in some cases.  The application of the model in Ireland is not as easy as it might seem initially because we have a significant number of detached and semi-detached buildings.  Therefore, we do not have the scale.  Notwithstanding that, the principle of the Energiesprong model is one we will certainly see growing in the market.  It will be driven not just by the materials that can be developed but also by the radical development of digitisation tools.  We are getting to a point where we can survey our house externally using virtual tools on a mobile phone or drone technology.  The data end up in an engineer's office.  He or she does the analysis and the resulting data are used to prefabricate all the materials to go into the house.  In parts of Ireland, we will see the application of that type of methodology, whether it is Energiesprong or something similar, but unfortunately it is not a silver bullet.</p></speech>

It is reassuring to hear that there is a high bar to qualify as a one-stop shop.  The fear is that once a place is approved, standards might slip.  Will there be unannounced, ongoing, on-the-spot quality assurance to make sure that those one-stop shops retain the standard?  Does anyone who is not working out of a one-stop shop have to go through the same criteria of quality assurance to be approved to carry out the works?</p></speech>

The precursor to the national retrofit plan would have had inspections by SEAI-appointed inspectors, who would check everything.  That process will continue.  My understanding of the national retrofit plan is that the majority of work will go through one-stop shops.  The warmer home schemes or social housing schemes will have a different process and quality assurance measures within them.  If a contractor wants to work within a one-stop shop, it will have to align with the quality assurance standards that the one stop shop has signed up to.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.  I had another meeting to attend.  My first question is for Dr. Daly, about the impact of what she calls inappropriate energy retrofitting works and the confusion about what is correct and available.  We started with a maladapted system, as Dr. Daly called it.  There is certainly urgency but are we anxious to be seen to do something, rather than doing it right?</p> <p>  Mr. Hoyne talked about data collection and performance.  Last week, we had speakers on retrofitting and there was the alarming phrase, "retrofitting the retrofits", and all that goes with that.  We have much data on carbon and emissions but there does not seem to be any one person or body in charge of those data.  I asked the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications about appointing a carbon tsar.  What are the witnesses' views on the data and the future?  I recognise that they are operating a competent business with plenty of oversight and checks.  Is that being fed into something national, where we can use the data that we recover to make sure that we are not making any mistakes and that we will not end up having to retrofit the retrofits?</p></speech>

The stakeholders were concerned that it was happening.  As part of the adaptation plan, we provided case studies on the different impacts, but we were unable to find case studies on maladaptation, because it tends not to be published.  There are case studies in the UK.  We have seen houses basically become uninhabitable and it is very expensive to put right.  These buildings tend to be breathable and if non-breathable insulation is installed, it creates many problems for the buildings and the people who occupy them.  It can be serious and it is expensive, so it is important to get it right.  We were talking about vacancy in town centres earlier.  Some of this is a matter of maintenance on these buildings, because a wet building is a cold building, so upgrading rainwater goods and having good maintenance is key to this issue.  There are many simple non-interventive things that people can do to make their homes warmer and more comfortable.</p><p>A stepwise approach also can be taken.</p></speech>

One starts with an understanding of how the building is currently performing.  We started a new project with Dr. Kinnane, who I believe was at the committee's last session, to measure the U-values of the walls of 50 different traditional buildings.  There are different build-ups, thicknesses and materials.  By doing that, we will have a better understanding of where we are starting.  At a building I have been working on, we got an <i>in situ</i>U-value measurement of 0.836 for one of the walls, which is far below the default 2.1 for a solid wall.  If people think the situation is worse than it is, then they will over-insulate and not get the savings that they expect.  People should understand the fabric first approach at the beginning of any project.  Doing that, collecting these data and making them publicly available is a good first step to make sure that we do not do things that we regret down the road.</p></speech>

With respect to windows, in Part L for nearly zero energy building, NZEB,  is 2.0 the requirement?  I might have that wrong; I used to know more about this.  We believe that single-glazed windows in heritage buildings conduct heat straight through them.  Is it the case that our information on windows, as well as walls, and the starting point, is just not good enough?  Since we make assumptions about that starting point that may be incorrect, we may then take inappropriate measures.  Is it true of windows as well as walls?</p></speech>

U-value testing for windows is much more complicated than for walls.  Historic Environment Scotland has done a few technical studies on this.  It did the work about ten years ago.  One paper, by Dr. Paul Baker, contains a list of measures that can be taken to improve the thermal efficiency of traditional windows.  Part of that involves decreasing draughts.  Another option is secondary glazing.  An option for highly-protected structures that one does not wish to mess with is to have heavy thermal curtains.  Historic Environment Scotland calculated the U-value improvements from that mix of steps to improve windows.  Those studies have not been done here, but they could be.</p></speech>

From a fabric first approach, one must understand how the building operates, particularly in the case of traditional buildings.  I refer to one of my earlier comments.  Sometimes, with traditional buildings, we need to consider that we can leave a large portion of the building alone and still achieve carbon reductions by potentially connecting to district heating systems, low temperature heating systems or other systems.  We need to think about these buildings in different ways and focus on carbon reduction rather than just kilowatt hours of energy.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the Deputy asked about data.  This is a bugbear of mine.  As a principal investigator and researcher, when I speak with colleagues across Europe, they have a wealth of data on the actual energy performance of buildings, which we are only starting to develop now.  Our building energy rating database is one of the best in Europe and the envy of many other countries.  Many researchers using that database understand the profile of buildings and the energy performance after a retrofit, but the building energy rating is an asset rating and does not tell us the actual energy consumption.</p><p>There are lots of research projects, both ongoing and completed, which have gathered operational data from residential and non-residential buildings, but, typically and traditionally, that building sits in that research project and the information may not be shared or collated.  Part of my message is that, as researchers and project developers, we need to figure out how we can collate this data.  I am not sure yet what is the best mechanism, but we need additional data to that available in the BER data.  We are continuing to gather data on those 20 buildings I mentioned earlier.  We will have five years of minute-by-minute energy data on the heat pumps operating in those retrofits.  One of those homes is mine, so I am the energy geek looking at my own data to understand what is going on.  The process of sharing the data can become complicated because of data protection and research agreements, but we really need to crack that because by sharing the data we can then develop quicker solutions and new innovations.</p><p> In the future, our homes are going to very much have interconnected systems.  My home is a guinea pig.  I have seven different pieces of equipment being tested in my home: one is looking at air quality and one is looking at PV, but they are all different systems that do not talk to each other.  We have a lot of work to do to get smarter in how we use data.  That is an opportunity for our IT experts, of whom we have hundreds and thousands in this country.</p></speech>

The discussion is very interesting.  I was struck by a few matters, one of which relates to the information on the case studies.  I am conscious Dr. Daly and Dr. Engel Purcell also mentioned information.  In terms of public leadership regarding public buildings, there is perhaps not as much as I would like, but there are conversations about social housing retrofit - possibly not as much as it could be - but there is a public-first approach, which the renovation wave is talking about at an EU level.  Then we have a creation of a new market.  We have had some very good discussion on the need for it to have proper oversight.  There is also the issue of retrofitting public buildings.  I am interested in hearing about what would ideally be a public renovation or retrofitting service which for the next few years would front-load work in terms of social housing and public buildings.  That would be a preferred option but, at a minimum, we could have a public procurement contract whereby a lot of public refurbishment, renovation and retrofitting would be happening.  In that context, it was mentioned that a lot of risk goes on the individual, especially in areas where the data are not there to the same extent, such as in historic buildings and in older buildings, but if the State was leading in terms of doing a substantial amount of renovation and retrofitting of public buildings, including historic buildings, and then sharing that information it would raise standards in the sector.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the case studies they are tracking.  It strikes me that this is a matter in respect of which we need to move on quite fast.  It is useful to have the information from Scotland, and to hear about thermal curtains and shutters.  So many shutters all around the country were painted shut at a certain point, but they were one of the most efficient pieces that were there.  Do we need to have a public programme of retrofitting public buildings, and not just that but their being renovated and repurposed, in order that the information is gathered and that we are not just talking about a specific product people are trying to fit into a listed building?</p><p> A related issue is skills development.  We talked a lot about the progression pathways in retrofitting and about security of employment, which is very important.  In terms of some of the crafts, there has been a push in a particular direction.  There seems to be a need for what might have been regarded as heritage crafts or traditional crafts.  I refer to the skills associated with repair and refurbishment, both which are often quite time-intensive activities.  Should that be part of the new skills development in terms of the environment and energy efficiency so that we can keep buildings in use for the future?</p></speech>

Yes, definitely, we would love to see public buildings take the lead, provide leadership in the sector, and create those best-practice case studies which could then be rolled out.  It is also the case that there are a lot of historic buildings in public ownership.  This was something we identified in the adaptation plan.  We looked at other sectors.  In the transport sector, for example, there are a lot of railway stations.  All the Departments are in ownership of historic buildings, and they need to be adapted and become more energy-saving.  That would be an easy way to go and to provide those best-practice case studies that we need.</p> <p>  In response to her question about heritage skills, the answer is "Yes".  That is another element that we were looking for in terms of capacity building: that heritage skills should be part of that story.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins mentioned shutters.  The fact is that we have forgotten how our buildings work and we are also losing a lot of the skills needed to make them work.  Both need to go hand in hand.  I do not know if Dr. Engel Purcell wants to add anything.</p></speech>

In terms of the public sector leading, the OPW is definitely looking into the properties that are in its ownership.  Dublin City Council put out a very detailed and good request for tenders recently for the retrofit of housing.  In that, it required <i>in situ</i>U-value tests and hygrothermal risk analysis.  What it does with that is up to it.  Dublin City Council has been quite forthright in other retrofit works that it has done to help inform the process, but some sort of centralised database where the data can be collected or the case studies can be reviewed and put out for public consumption would be valuable to the sector.</p></speech>

It is a really good question.  There are two points to make.  Not all public buildings are traditional.  There is a great deal of work ongoing.  I was involved in a study, which was completed last year, looking at the cost of bringing public buildings across all sectors of the State to a B2 energy rating.  That brings us back to our data question.  It was incredibly difficult to gather data on the quantum, size and energy consumption of our public buildings.  This included schools, hospitals, etc.  There was differing availability of data.  It was an incredible challenge to gather the data.</p> <p>  There are some leading areas in the context of public buildings.  The HSE has a very ambitious plan in terms of retrofitting and upgrading buildings.  It has done significant work on energy conservation and energy management and the next scale is decarbonisation of its buildings, which vary from large hospitals right down to smaller medical centres.</p> <p>  We are working with the Department of Education at the moment.  We are doing benchmarking and energy assessments of more than 500 schools in the south east.</p><p>We have good data on the location of all the schools and the quantum of students.  However, the energy performance data is patchy across their building stock.  That data set will inform their investment plan for the next ten years.  Dr. Engle Purcell mentioned the local authorities.  Certainly in Tipperary, we have done a huge decarbonisation agenda for public buildings including swimming pools, local authority and municipal district offices.  There are examples of really good work for traditional and non-traditional buildings or standard buildings.  It is happening and in some cases <i>ad hoc.  </i>We are not telling enough people about it and sharing the data.  It returns to the point: do the assessment, do the project, share the knowledge as much as possible and collate the data so that we can do it bigger, better and faster the next time.</p></speech>

Apologies as I have had some technical difficulties in my office and I was unable to turn on my camera or keep my hand up.  However, I have been participating in the meeting from the beginning.  It has been a thoroughly interesting conversation.  I will return to the efficiency of heat pumps which we touched on at the very start of the meeting.  There is a lot of rumour out there around heat pumps.  There are reputation issues around, I assume, inappropriate installation or the property simply not being suitable for a heat pump because of a lack of quality finish and so on in the past.  Could the witnesses put the mind at ease of any person watching this in relation to the technology and the advancements in heat pumps that have been made over the last decade or so?  Many people are interested in pursuing it to get rid of their fossil fuel boiler whether gas, oil or otherwise.</p> <p>  I am interested in the efficiency or effectiveness of the BER system.  Taking on board the conversation we had earlier about the other measurements that are really appropriate for near energy zero targets that are there, in addition to the suggestions that were made at this meeting, are there opportunities for us to review the BER to make it more fit for purpose?  Maybe that is a bit harsh on the BER.  My terminology might not be right.</p> <p>  The Chair touched on windows a few minutes ago.  Windows in a retrofit are obviously really important, particularly if you are moving from wooden or single-glaze windows.  As one of the witnesses mentioned earlier, many properties, maybe 16%, are pre-1946.  I am open to correction but I understand that about 80% of properties are 1990 onwards.  My question relates to the numbers of double glazed windows that might have been installed in the last 20 to 30 years in particular and their effectiveness or efficiency in relation to retrofitting.  Considering the costs involved and difficulties with obtaining contractors because we are all moving at the same time for the same thing when it comes to roof insulation, cavity wall insulation where a property owner may not be able to afford to replace their windows but it is an objective, has the State done enough on this?  Has the technology really advanced so far?  Take double glazing that was installed in the mid-2000s.  There would have been enormous developments since then.  Should they be replaced when we think of the windows available today?  Does anyone have relevant expertise or have an experienced best-guess as to what we should aim for on this area?  Is the State doing enough in this area of the potential energy lost through windows in particular?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#U00100"><p>That is another great question.  This also relates to the question about windows.  There has been huge technical development around heat pumps in recent years.  Research in TUS and the team that works with me here have seen various reasons for what I might call the under-performance of a heat pump.  First is that they might be over-sized.  That returns to a point made by Deputy Bruton earlier.  There was a tendency for over-specification for heat pumps in some cases.  Where a 6.5KW heat pump was needed one of 8.5KW was installed.  In some cases that is a safety measure put in by the engineer or it could be a cultural thing where if we put in an oil or gas boiler the price difference between a 20KW or a 25KW boiler is minimal so we just put in the 25KW boiler, for example.  However, over-specification for a heat pump has implications for its operation.  Without getting too technical there is a cycling of that heat pump and its overall efficiency drops.  Our longitudinal study found that in some cases the heat pump was oversized and its heat curve was inappropriate for the building.</p> <p>  The second issue is on commissioning.  Typically in a retrofit we are moving from a solid fuel heating system or an oil or gas system to a heat pump.  We hear people say that you just leave the heat pump on all the time versus the oil boiler coming on for two hours in the morning or four hours in the afternoon.  In fact, typically a heat pump is controlled by a heat curve that looks at temperature.  The heat pump is available to be on the majority of the time but the controls are such that the heat pump will just provide enough heat into the building to keep it at a particular temperature.  One challenge is communicating the operation of the heat pump to the building owner in the retrofit because it is a new way of living in your home and heating your building.  Sometimes well fall down on that.  There is an onus on the installers and contractors who are delivering the work to make sure they understand.  Our research found evidence where the homeowner was blissfully unaware that the heat pump was underperforming but they were perfectly happy because they were living in a very comfortable retrofitted home compared with where they were previously.  We were able to do tweaks in the back end for those homeowners that improved the performance of their heat pump but that did not effect their overall comfort levels.  There is still a lot of new product technology emerging onto the market.  We need to make sure, and manufacturers are very keen on this, that if I am installing a particular heat pump type that I am trained on that particular technology.  They have their own training centres and programmes to make sure their heat pumps are installed correctly and commissioned appropriately because if not their warranties can be voided.</p> <p>  Generally, I would say that the operational performance of heat pumps is very good.  Our study found that they were operating with coefficient of performance, COP, of over 3.4 which for air-source heat pumps is very good.  That means that for every one unit of electricity put in they we get 3.4 units of heat into the building.</p> <p>  My colleagues may wish to respond on the building energy rating, BER, system in traditional buildings.  The system and the methodology has changed in recent years.</p><p>The SEAI and the working group that oversee it have brought in many changes.  We see very different profiles of buildings now.  This is because we are reducing heat loss through the fabric and the energy consumption from lighting and from domestic hot water, which is now much more important.  The BER tool, or the dwelling energy assessment procedure, DEAP, has been modified to take that into account.  Can it be improved?  Absolutely.  It is important to understand that the BER tool is what we call an asset tool, which means it is based on an assessment of the assets of the building, on the specification of the heating system and on the fabric of the building, such as the windows, the walls and the distribution system.</p><p> As Dr. Engel Purcell mentioned, in some cases we may have to use default values that do not represent the reality on the ground.  This is because of the standards that are required by the DEAP tool.  We therefore get what are called energy performance gaps, between what our dwelling energy assessment procedure tool tells us and the actual energy performance.  Overall, a working group is continuously looking at upgrading the BER and the DEAP tool.</p><p> My final point is on windows.  Without getting too technical, it important to think of the window as being made up of a couple of components.  The first of those is the glazing, the second is the frame and the third is how the window is connected to the building.  The glazing is therefore only one part of the energy performance of the overall window.  There have been huge advancements in the overall performance of the window components and the entire window frame and glazing.  Some of our companies in Ireland are at the forefront of that.  We look at this on a case-by-case basis.  A building that was built before 2006 might have poorly installed frames and windows that might be introducing thermal bridging, infiltration or poor air tightness into the building.  It makes a lot of sense to consider an upgrade of the windows in those situations.  When we look at traditional buildings, it is much more complex to make those decisions.</p><p> We talk about double glazing versus triple glazing.  In many cases, there are now products on the market where a double-glazing product is as effective, as efficient and has a U-value that is comparable to triple glazing solutions.  Therefore, there are good technical products out there.  If installed, they can give multiple benefits not just for the fabric but also for the overall efficiency.  They also start to address air tightness issues and thermal bridging issues around the openings in buildings.</p></speech>

I mentioned a study a little while ago about the U-value testing of traditional wall materials, such as masonry.  The objective of that study is to inform the national calculation methodology that is used for the BER.  This would make it more representative of the different types of walls that one might find in traditional buildings.  That may result in a U-value for different typical Irish limestone, and materials like that.  It may be adjustable to the thickness of the wall.  That research has just started.  I am afraid it will be a little while before we have that information.  However, that is one of the objectives of the study.  Another objective of the study is to do laboratory testing on all of the material samples we collect, so that we have better data to use in the hygrothermal modelling tools.  This is because models are only as good as the data that are used.  At present, as far as I know, there are not any Irish material data sets in the existing modelling tools.  Having the thermal conductivity, the vapour diffusion resistance factors and those kinds of material aspects factored into those models will only make them more accurate.</p></speech>

The first of these is in relation to windows.  I ask that the witnesses please forgive me for my non-technical phraseology.  On the basis that the assessment needs to be made on a case-by-case basis for each property, and given that the air seal is probably one of the most important aspects, can a retrofit be successful in sealing up a property and in ensuring the thermal values of a given property that was built before 2011 are high enough to support the effective use of a heat pump?</p><p>Can window taping be simply enough in a context that is specific to the windows, assuming there are reasonable seals on their openable parts?  Can this be a solution?  There is a level of technical expertise that is needed to evaluate a property.  On that basis, from a homeowner&rsquo;s perspective, is being aware of thermal bridging or of cold bridging at a window, and-or air intake as a result of a poor seal, part of the solution?</p><p> My second question is in relation to the data, or to the lack thereof.  Is there an opportunity for us to task the one-stop shops?  Would they have the expertise to do this?  Could we task them through the home retrofitting scheme, or the deep retrofitting scheme, to begin an evaluation that would assist us in improving the scheme and targeting it where we need to go?  Rather than just saying there is no source of information and we will let academia sort it out for us, we could be the driver of that data analysis and what it could mean for future schemes.</p></speech>

Tasking the one-stop shops might be an avenue by which to do it.  Dr. Daly works with the University of Lincoln and with private practice through Carrig Conservation International.  The type of work that we are doing in these assessments, which are <i>in situ</i>U-value assessments, is generally done through private commissions and publicly procured projects.  The study with UCD is separate to that.  Another way that one could go about this is by earmarking funding for this particular testing or modelling so that it will be part of retrofit projects going forward.  Not every client will commission it or set aside money for it.  They would prefer to go with what they feel is best.  However, that might push the budget up too high, especially for private homeowners.  However, if there was a grant to do the U-value testing and the hygrothermal modelling, that data could then be anonymised and gathered in some sort of centralised library database.  That might be a way to go about it.  Mr. Hoyne might have more ideas about the one-stop shops.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#W00300"><p>I will continue on that point.  Then I will return to the question about windows.  In the deep retrofit pilot scheme that was run by the SEAI, there was a requirement for the retrofit co-ordinator organisation to install monitoring and metering equipment in a percentage of the deep retrofit buildings.  There is experience of doing that.  One of the challenges in installing metering and monitoring equipment is that it becomes quite expensive.  A potential approach, which could be pursued through the one-stop shops or a parallel SEAI scheme, would be to look at the funding, monitoring and metering systems that we would put into a portion of buildings in order to gather data.  That would become available for use by researchers and would also be provided to the industry, to the manufacturers and to the contractors in a useable manner.  Then we could start to get the segregated data that could also look at traditional buildings.</p> <p>  I will return to the question about windows and what the best approach is.  The typical approach for a one-stop shop is that the assessor who visits the home will do the survey and look at the fabric.  As part of that, they will look at the window condition and at the conditions in terms of airtightness, the seals of windows and other aspects.</p><p>That information feeds into the overall assessment of the building and the retrofit measures that are proposed to the homeowner.  The typical model is that we do the survey, we make the suggestions to the homeowner, we give them an indication of the investments costs for the particular measure and the carbon and the energy-saving benefit of those measures, and recommend a suite of measures for that homeowner, which may or may not include window replacement.  I will give a practical example.  My home was already at a C3 energy rating when I did my Superhomes retrofit, which was my guinea pig retrofit in 2015.  I was one of the first homes to do so.  My assessment of the window conditions, and working with the assessor, was that a full replacement was going to be prohibitively expensive because my energy consumption was relatively low already.  We did a glazing upgrade and we did an airtightness upgrade around the building.  We have issues with thermal bridging but the cost of fixing those was going to be prohibitive.  My building is now an A3 rating from both a BER assessment and from an operational energy consumption assessment because I marry the two.  It is possible to do a deep retrofit without upgrading the full glazing, but it is case by case and is advised by the energy assessor who does that work with the homeowner at that particular time.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on the heat pumps.  Mr. Hoyne mentioned a fair point.  When we are talking about retrofitting, one-stop shops and all of the various workers who are needed to facilitate the volume of retrofitting, a fair point was made that some of the contractors are trained by the manufacturers of many of those products, independently of a national training programme.  This is something we should consider when we talk about the retrofitting scheme.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the apprenticeships and the need for those.  It is incumbent on all of us in the Oireachtas to ensure that we encourage more apprenticeships.  This has not been done for quite some time.  I was at an event yesterday where this was being done.  We need to see more of that to encourage people to take up apprenticeships.</p> <p>  On the one-stop shops specifically, from our perspective and given the popularity of the retrofitting scheme, it has been oversubscribed.  There is an inability to respond to the volume of queries.  Mr. Hoyne mentioned the assessors.  I already have had contact from people who are unhappy with assessors' reports and want a mechanism by which to feed back in to try to liaise or negotiate certain elements.  Specifically, these are issues around older buildings and how to retrofit those.  Some of those buildings present certain challenges, as I am sure Mr. Hoyne would appreciate.  How does Mr. Hoyne believe we can get around that?  Straightforward projects may, for example, be the semi-detached home that was built in the 1950s and the 1960s.  When one goes back further than that, and the other witnesses were talking about the 1930s and 1940s buildings, it presents a challenge.  The low-hanging fruit is straightforward but I would welcome Mr. Hoyne's views on the more complex buildings.</p> <p>  In his contribution Mr. Hoyne pointed to the pipeline and the guarantee of work.  There is a guarantee here for companies that specialise in the area of retrofitting, given the investment.  Also in his opening statement, Mr. Hoyne referred to a digital academy for the sustainable built environment and how it was validating programmes on residential energy, retrofitting, management, and energy renovation of traditional buildings.  Perhaps Mr. Hoyne will elaborate a little bit on that for us.</p> <p>  I realise that the time remaining to me is zero, and I ask the Chairman for one second please.  We could speak about this all day.  The inputs and suggestions from Dr. Daly and Dr. Engel Purcell around this are very interesting, including the research project mentioned in their opening statement, which was the Climate Heritage Network, HiCLIP, study of nine different countries and 17 thematic activities.  Perhaps the witnesses might elaborate on that for us please.  If they could send a note on to the committee, that would be of interest to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#Y00100"><p>On the heat pump training, a number of education and training boards, ETBs, and a number of higher education institutions are also developing heat pump training courses.  The vision is that we would be able to provide - if I can use the generic terms - the core training on the heat pump, the physics, the overall technology and the typical performance parameters that heat pumps work with, both for new build and retrofit, through the sector.  The manufacturers can just top this up with specific knowledge for their relevant heat pump technologies.  This is being worked on at the moment.  Currently, the manufacturers are also constrained with demand to provide training and sometimes they are having to find basic training on building physics for potential installers.  That could be taken care of centrally through our education system.</p> <p>  Absolutely, the apprenticeship system is evolving all of the time.  We now have the Apprenticeship Council and new mechanisms to create new apprenticeships.  We are going to see new types of apprentices and apprenticeship models in the coming years as the climate agenda becomes centre forward.  For those who are interested in getting into the sector, they can look at the traditional apprenticeships, and the industry and others are also looking at new apprenticeship models where a person can be working and earning at the same time.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the assessor's report.  If the building is an unusual typology or has particular differences that do not fit into the majority of the boxes that a dwelling energy assessment procedure tool provides, then it causes challenges for the assessor to provide a report that is non-standard.  We have all been in those buildings where a home probably has a 1940s component, a 1950s component, a 1970s component and an add-on that was done in the 2000s.  There can be four different building types in one location.  It becomes somewhat complex.  It is absolutely the case that we can deal relatively easily with the standard homes such as the semi-detached or detached buildings.  Certainly, the approach in Electric Ireland Superhomes is that where a building is bespoke, we must nuance and manage the assessor's report in a particular way to reflect that particular building's requirements.  That is an evolving process.  The advice for those people who are unhappy would be to go back to their one-stop shop and engage with them further.</p> <p>  The digital academy for sustainable built environment, DASBE, came about from ten years of research and activity around education, training and sustainable building.  The overall ultimate vision is that we must speed up how we educate and train the people working.  We cannot wait for the traditional process to deliver the education and training that we need.  This is because of the urgency around retrofitting and new build, dealing with traditional buildings, renewable energy development, and the digitisation agenda.  This is viewed as a partnership between the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS; what was GMIT and is now Atlantic Technological University, ATU; the Tipperary Energy Agency and the Irish Green Building Council.  Ultimately, we are trying to develop programmes faster.  For example, the industry sector came to us for our new higher diploma in residential retrofit management.  The one-stop shops we engage with have said to us that they need to upskill their engineers to be able to manage the scale of retrofits that we are going to be doing.  We worked collectively with the industry to develop and validate the programme in a seven-month period, which in academia is relatively fast, while still meeting our quality assurance requirements.  We will be launching that programme in September.  In the example I referred to earlier, and which was mentioned, we took an existing continuing professional development programme that was developed with the Heritage Council.</p><p>We have attached academic credits to that.  We have added additionality so we now have our certificate in energy renovation of traditional buildings and lots more.  DASBE is trying to provide the programmes in a flexible way so people can access education, upskill themselves and work in the sector, and so people who do not have the skills acquire them and get employment in the sector.  By using the digital academy, meaning online learning or in some cases blended learning where the majority is on line but we bring them in for workshops, practical demonstrations and site visits, we can access more people within Ireland and internationally to upskill and come to work in the sector.  It is an industry-academia collaboration funded through the Higher Education Authority, HEA's human capital initiative and our job is to disrupt education and training activity so we can deliver efficient, effective, high-quality programmes in a new way.</p></speech>

We did it with the Climate Heritage Network, an international group of institutions and organisations concerned with this issue.  We looked at climate actions for their inclusion of heritage.  We looked at plans from Cameroon, Colombia, New Zealand, Scotland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Norway at national level.  We also looked at California's state plan and the plans from Yarra, a city in Australia, San Antonio in Texas, and Lagos in Nigeria.  We analysed those plans for a number of keywords and for the level at which cultural heritage was being integrated.  Many plans mentioned it at a strategic level and acknowledged the importance of it, but it did not filter to the implementation level and showed up very little at the monitoring of actions level.  There were 17 thematic areas where it came up and in the statement I mentioned, because they are of most interest to this committee, waste reduction, energy mitigation and so on.</p> <p>  We found a dichotomy between the fact it was being recognised by other sectors as being important and it not filtering into actions.  We think that is because cultural heritage stakeholders were not being involved in the drawing up of the plan.  The other side of the dichotomy is that many cultural heritage people did not identify they had anything to offer in these areas so the intersections were being missed.  There is a gap that needs to be bridged but there is a lot of potential.</p></speech>

Part of that is because we are responding to a crisis.  We are in the middle of a revolution akin to the industrial revolution and having to respond on a whole-of-society basis.  I sit on the education committee as well as this one, so I am interested in much of the conversation.</p> <p>  A piece has been done around leaving certificate reform by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The Minister for Education has added climate as one of the subjects in the leaving certificate, though that will take time to work its way through.  There have been changes to the CAO whereby people can apply for apprenticeships directly through the same method.  All of these things are very important.  I would like to see more practical experience, particularly in the three last years of secondary school as people prepare.  One of the difficulties previously was only 5% of girls, for instance, took up apprenticeships.  That needs to shift.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions concerning that important transition?</p><p>There are indications that some courses have greater demand than others.  What can we, as a Government, do to respond?</p><p> I was interested in the data collection piece around schools.  There are co-benefits when it comes to schools because young people may not have energy efficiency in their homes but there is a democratic nature to being in a school where they have the benefits and are living through something, which is more likely to mean they will go into that industry.  Is there something we could do to expedite that data collection to fund that and get it working faster?</p><p> Mr. Hoyne mentioned Ireland's housing density and one-off housing.  He is looking at how to respond to Ireland's uniqueness from the point of view of culture, heritage and housing density.  Is there something he can teach us and our planning regulators about what changes need to be made to make retrofitting better and improve energy efficiency so we get up and running faster?  What do we need to see in county development plans to enable us to do it faster and better?  Do we need to look at whether continuing with one-off housing is the best thing, given that it is more difficult to service, even from a retrofitting point of view?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#AA00400"><p>I will try to capture them all and my colleagues will probably be able to contribute on some of the education questions.  The critical piece in terms of education is reframing the discussion around careers in the construction sector in the context of the environmental and climate emergency.  I welcome the work on leaving certificate reform.  The CAO, apprenticeships and higher and further education being more closely linked and the agenda from the Department for further and higher education are welcomed from our perspective.  When a leaving certificate student is looking at careers, does he or she see a career in retrofit management or where he or she is addressing the climate agenda?  We need further engagement with guidance counsellors and educators in schools so they understand the types of careers available and the changing careers, and that by going down the apprenticeship, engineering or other routes, people can work in the climate and retrofit sectors.  We have talked about technical training, programmes and careers.  It is important to note, given what one-stop shops are doing at the moment, that they need sales managers, finance expertise and quality assurance people.  There are jobs for many types of careers in the retrofit and construction sectors.  We need to frame those and show examples of those type of careers.</p> <p>  In terms of demand, we see through the CAO numbers increased interest this year in environmental programmes broadly, whether that is environmental science, renewable energy etc.  The figures nationally look like there is growth in those areas.  We will see when the final numbers come out at the end of June.</p> <p>  On the question about working with schools, that data work is ongoing.</p><p>The ambition is to have the assessment of the 500 or so schools completed by September.  That work is feeding into the Department of Education, which, in line with one of the actions in the climate action plan, is putting together an investment plan for retrofitting and decarbonising schools.  This is an important task and the Department has secured funding from the European Investment Bank, EIB, to complete it.  It will use then that work to leverage additional investment.  As such, addressing schools in this regard is high on the Department's agenda.  This work links in with the broader educational activity within green schools.</p><p> Regarding housing density and the broader strategic decisions being made at local authority level, for example, through county development plans, TUS has worked with the climate action regional offices for the past year and a half on delivering a climate awareness training programme to all senior managers and councillors in every local authority.  That half-day training programme was specifically on climate mitigation and climate adaptation.  It looked at the science and driving policies and involved workshops where councillors and senior managers worked together to see what was happening in their respective counties and regions and what priorities they needed to address.</p><p> As part of that, we gathered data, which we fed back, on county development plans.  A strong move to address settlement patterns is evident.  This is being driven by multiple different agendas, with the climate and energy agenda one of those.  Many local authorities are reviewing their county development plans at the moment and are taking an active role in addressing the environment and the climate agenda.  Housing provision is a multifaceted and complex matter and they have to balance competing actions.  From our engagement with local authorities through training programmes, though, they are aware of this issue and having good discussions about the balance that is appropriate in housing settlement plans.</p><p> I recommend that committee members examine the outcomes of the heat study completed by the SEAI.  It makes strong recommendations on how district heating could be deployed, not just in our cities, but in towns across the country with a view to cost-benefit investment opportunities.  Such district heating can be installed in existing developments as well as new ones.</p><p> The housing agenda has a large number of moving parts.  Critically, for retrofitting current housing, such buildings are typically off the gas grid and dependent on oil, solid fuel or liquid petroleum gas heating systems.  They are the priority houses that we can access in terms of decarbonising and retrofitting.  It becomes a different proposition in areas that are on the gas grid and where we have to consider competing fuel costs, etc.</p><p> I hope that my comments have been useful.</p></speech>

In the UK, there is a push for apprenticeship degrees &ndash; we have a masters level apprenticeship degree, for example &ndash; so that is not just an issue in Ireland.  There is also a move to more transdisciplinary degrees.  Climate change is a cross-cutting issue and one that should be taught regardless of what degree someone does.  I teach the conservation of museum objects and we talk about climate change.  It impacts everyone, and it is important that the education system reflect this.</p> <p>  Through sites, monuments and museums, the cultural heritage sector can play a strong role in educating people about climate change and our response to same.</p><p>According to research in the UK, certain sectors of society respond more to the threat of climate change when they are told about the impacts on cultural heritage as opposed to, for example, natural heritage because of their particular personal values.  A great deal of education can be done through that sector to communicate the issues.  There are also opportunities around citizen science to involve and educate the public via a wider public education platform.</p><p> We will be working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on designing training for local authorities.  This is coming about through the adaptation plan for heritage and will happen in the next year.</p></speech>

In preparing to deliver to a local authority, we took its existing county development plan or the revisions being considered and performed a high-level identification of measures that were particular to that local authority's region.  We were considering broader climate action, adaptation and mitigation.  If it was a coastal local authority region, for example, it would have had different priorities than the Laois-Offaly area.</p> <p>  I would not call it a comprehensive analysis.  It was a mechanism to engage participants in the training programme.  We were feeding back data from their particular regions.</p></speech>

Perhaps the committee might consider inviting the regulator to appear before us again.  It is the bones of a year since we spoke to Mr. Cussen during our sessions on transport-oriented development and so on.</p> <p>  I will ask some questions.  I received a note a few minutes ago that the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage is watching this session.  If the witnesses feel that there is something very important that needs to be said, they should say it now.  He is very interested.  He says that he is a former student of Mr. Hoyne's.  We must be in good hands if a Minister of State with responsibility in this area has been guided by Mr. Hoyne.</p> <p>  Dr. Daly's opening statement was very interesting.  What came through was a passion for our heritage building stock and an acknowledgement of the challenges in this climate crisis.</p><p>It seems to me that if we are trying to protect our heritage buildings, we have to strike a balance between protecting them and encouraging people to live in them, because living in them is protection in many ways.  Having said that, no matter what we do, and the witnesses mentioned some very important initiatives around how we can reduce energy costs in heritage buildings, they are still heritage buildings and they are very difficult to work with.  I wonder if they need to be treated very differently by the State.  No matter what we do, these are going to be expensive buildings to own and run.  Does the State need to become more creative with regard to how it supports people who own heritage buildings, both in terms of purchase to some extent and in terms of the maintenance and operation of those buildings?  There are grants but the evidence is that the State has not been supporting those people enough because there are so many buildings vacant currently.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.</p><p> A related point is district heating, which was mentioned by Mr. Hoyne.  I wonder about the potential for district heating for our city centre heritage stock in particular, where there might be waste heat opportunities.  It is a question of how to integrate that with buildings.  I come from Limerick city centre, which is both medieval in character and also Georgian and there are two separate sides to the city.  The Georgian buildings in particular are very big, with huge windows and old stone walls.  These are difficult to retrofit and one can only go so far before it becomes cost-prohibitive to own them because of the operational costs.  There is a discussion about photovoltaic, PV, for these buildings and whether we should be more generous in the supports we give to these owners for renewable technologies that they might be able to incorporate.  Not every building is going to be suitable for a PV installation on its roof and we have to be sensitive to the aesthetic at the street level.  However, perhaps there are bigger opportunities for photovoltaics in those buildings.</p><p> I want to mention something that has come up a few times in the sessions and to give the witnesses an opportunity to discuss it, namely, how we account for embodied carbon.  It is something that is going to happen through the recasting of the energy performance in buildings directive.  We are hearing it will not be until 2030 that it is required that countries have an accounting system - an assess and report system, I believe it is called - for embodied carbon.  Some countries are moving ahead quickly and it seems to me that, as Deputy Bruton said, if we want to nudge the people and the sector towards renovation and retrofitting, and away from demolition and new build, then it goes back to that point made by Dr. Engel Purcell about knowing what we are starting with.  Can we do more, and quickly, with regard to developing those accounting systems?  The witnesses might have UK experience in this regard.  We understand from speaking with the Irish Green Building Council that the UK is further ahead than us and maybe there is learning from across the water.</p><p> I want again to raise the idea of a help to renovate scheme.  I do not know if it has been given consideration by the witnesses but it is something that we talk about.  The State helps young people and first-time buyers to buy new homes, primarily, and this has driven a lot of new building construction, particularly on the edge of our urban areas.  However, an idea that has frequently been mooted in this committee and probably in others is a help to renovate scheme.  Have the witnesses given much thought to that?  They said earlier they would support it but I cannot imagine it is as straightforward as it sounds.  If they have any further thoughts on that, we would certainly like to hear them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathy Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#EE00100"><p>I might make some general points and I will let Dr. Engel Purcell deal with the specifics.  In general terms, the Chairman mentioned a passion for heritage and that is true.  The heritage sector has recognised that limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C is the best way to preserve heritage, so we are fully on board this train.  We have a tradition of stewardship and we want to preserve heritage for future generations, so we do take a long-term view.  It is important to apply that long-term view to the buildings.  They have been standing there, housing people, for possibly hundreds of years and they can do the same for another few hundred years if they are treated right.</p> <p>  Retrofitting is possible.  Perhaps we cannot do as deep a retrofit and we are not going to get to net zero, but that does not mean that these buildings are energy-inefficient necessarily, that there is nothing we can do or that it is terribly difficult.  It is just perhaps not an off-the-peg solution or a solution that is the same as we would apply to a modern building.  That is an important point to make.</p> <p>  The other point is that we value heritage buildings for a reason.  They have a lot of other benefits that we need to recognise as well in terms of sense of place, identity and tourism, and all of those things need to be put in the pot as well when looking at these buildings.  I will pass to Dr. Engel Purcell for the more specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caroline Engel Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#EE00200"><p>The Chairman referenced Georgian Limerick.  There are certainly things that can be done to those types of buildings to reduce draughts and improve airtightness.  A lot of it goes back to the traditional crafts and working up from those and maybe upskilling people from their original skillset.  Photovoltaic, PV, and district heating are options.  We may not be able to put PV panels on the front-facing roof but perhaps on an outbuilding or a new extension to the back.  Although I do not do modelling for solar PV, the knowledge is there to find a way to make it work.</p> <p>  With regard to life-cycle assessment, we would love to do a bigger study.  I was thinking about where we could get data.  Perhaps the deep retrofit pilot programme might have the type of data we need to do a larger study to look at how much embodied carbon is actually associated with the retrofit of different types of buildings.  A lot of that will come down to the amount of materials used, the carbon intensity of those materials and their use across the board.</p> <p>  I would certainly like to look further into the help to renovate scheme.  Is there anything published on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#EE00300"><p>Unfortunately not.  It is something we are pushing for.  Before I go to Mr. Hoyne, I want to ask about the idea of supporting owners of heritage buildings who, notwithstanding all the great things they can do with their buildings to mitigate energy use, are probably going to have higher energy costs.  It seems to me that, in order to incentivise people to own and live in these buildings, we have to protect them against those costs to some degree.  That seems fair but I do not think anything like that is being done.  The owner of a Georgian building in Limerick is treated in the same way as the owner of a brand-new A-rated home in any of our towns and cities and there is no discrimination in terms of the operational costs.  This is something we need to start thinking about.  We are going to have a situation where swathes of the population live in energy-efficient buildings and are not subject to those costs and, then, we have this very valuable housing stock that is there but the people who own it are going to be prone to very significant costs.</p></speech>

It may be due to financial reasons, but there may be other reasons why they chose not to live in these buildings.  It could be a size issue.  The ideal scenario is that we make them attractive and desirable.  Some of that is financial and some of that involves education and, as I said, more sociocultural work.</p></speech>

By bringing that approach and melding it with the SEAI's grant for retrofitting, the Heritage Council might be in a prime position to advise or help facilitate a grant programme for the retrofit of these buildings.  It may be more costly if ornate plasterwork, or such works, needs to be done.</p> <p>  I refer to Senator Pauline O'Reilly's question about kick-starting retrofitting for traditional buildings.  We have SR 54, which is for the energy retrofitting of existing modern construction.  In the plan, it is stated that this is due to be revised.  I do not know if that has started.  If there was more technical guidance and a clear pathway to compliance for specifiers for these buildings, which are not protected and do not have such leeway, it would certainly help in giving guidance to the practitioners in this space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hoyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022051000002#FF00300"><p>I will come in on the district heating component.  District heating is a system designed for heating multiple heat loads in residential and non-residential public buildings.  On balance, the district heating systems I have seen across Europe are equally used to heat traditional or heritage buildings as they can be in more modern buildings.  That is down to sensible design.</p> <p>  In some cases, low-temperature district heating and low-temperature heating within a traditional or heritage building is the ideal heating provision.  In some cases, this need not be more expensive than fossil fuel heating provision.  This is because we are providing a small amount of heat into those buildings at low levels over a constant period, which tends to suit those types of buildings rather than the cycling of temperature changes within them.  There is no technical reason why these types of buildings cannot be connected to district heating.  It can certainly fit in as one of the heat loads in an overall system.</p> <p>  As was mentioned, PV is becoming a standard across Europe.  In a recent meeting I had with the European Commission, it was stated that we should be able to drive around in a number of years and look at buildings that do not have PV and try to figure out why that is the case, as opposed to now where we look at buildings and say it is amazing that they have PV.  Depending on planning, as well as aesthetic and other reasons, there is no technical reasons why PV cannot be applied to these types of buildings.</p> <p>  The embodied carbon issue is certainly one about which we need more knowledge and capacity building in the country.  Even in academic circles, there are a limited number of people with expertise in the area.  We are developing education programmes in that space.  We need the tools and legislative mechanisms to drive the industry to require that.  The challenge is trying to do it on top of the huge retrofitting programme we have.</p> <p>  In the evolution of products and the evolution of knowledge in embodied carbon, as was mentioned, we can learn a massive amount from the UK where they are more advanced in that knowledge.  I am certainly not an expert on the subject matter.  We are working on another project on green procurement that looks at low embodied carbon solutions for green roofs and other systems, for example.  There is a lot of knowledge across Europe.  How we apply that in Ireland and how we procure those types of systems are pieces of the system we have to upgrade.</p><p>As for the comment made about the help-to-renovate scheme, the principle of it seems to be a good one to pursue.  The ideal solution for building owners who fit within those brackets is that they can take advantage of individual supports, such as one from the Heritage Council and one from the SEAI, as well as from other sources.  Sometimes they can be in conflict, in that if a person gets one support, he or she cannot get the other or they do not line up in series.  Collective discussion across the various Departments might find a solution whereby the help-to-renovate scheme could be supported and enabled through various funding schemes across Government channels.</p></speech>

I have another message from the Minister.  He points out that we were one of the first countries in Europe that developed a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for built and archaeology heritage.

An argument has been put forward, some of which will have been heard this morning, on the approach taken by the Government in terms of the efficiency of reaching the emissions reduction target and the question around what we are actually measuring, in addition to the piece on social justice and equity.  In his contribution, Mr. Hoyne outlined the one-stop shop and provided some reassurance in terms of quality assurance.  He indicated that a majority of works will go through that system.  However, that is a demand-led system and there is a question around who will be in a position to avail of the supports and whether they are the people in most need.  We can define what "need" means but there is certainly a question about the poorest people in the coldest homes, for example, and whether the system can be reoriented to immediately direct those and others here.  Senator Higgins talked about a public-led approach initially.  I know there are trade-offs in that and I do not want to put Mr. Hoyne in the position of making a value judgment on it.  What data gaps exist if we want to reorient the system and direct it, in the first instance, to the poorest people in the coldest homes?</p></speech>

The challenge with the schemes that are working - for example, the warmer homes and local authority social housing upgrade schemes - is implementation.  We know where the buildings are.  The majority of local authorities have very good knowledge of their housing stock.  They have done condition surveys over a number of years.  They know the tenants and clients they are dealing with.  That carries across for other social housing providers and, in many cases, for those who are in private housing and suffering from fuel poverty.  We know where they are and what needs to be done.  The challenge is implementation.</p></speech>

We seem to use a lot of proxy indicators, such as who is living in social housing and who is in receipt of fuel allowance, as indications of income.  Neither of those is a function of the quality of the house the person lives in.  He or she could be in social housing that is A-rated.  I think of this in the context of the working poor living in rural Ireland.  Do we have that level of granular detail?</p></speech>

Anecdotally, there is a cohort of building owners who perhaps sit outside the traditional cohorts the Deputy has spoken about, namely, those who are in social housing, those who are on fuel supports, etc., and who potentially live in buildings that could be upgraded, but their particular circumstances make it very challenging for them to engage in a retrofit process.  Do we know where all those buildings are and who those homeowners are?  Certainly not.  We have, through the various mechanisms of the State and the other providers, a reasonably good handle on those buildings.  The real challenge is implementation.  From engaging with local authorities, I understand that the procurement and implementation of projects can be a challenge because of lack of capacity within a local authority to deliver retrofits and, similarly, due to the fact that the approved housing providers have a very ambitious plan in respect of the retrofitting and upgrading of buildings because they realise the importance of that and the overall benefits to them.  For those homeowners who do not qualify for supports through the traditional means and for whom engaging with a one-stop shop or a retrofit scheme is beyond their means at the moment, the mechanism to engage with them will have to involve different financial tools other than the grant-led demand scheme the Deputy has spoken about.  We are looking at loan schemes, as are the Minister and the Government.  There have been previous discussions about other mechanisms to pay back the investment.  As we ramp up the scale of retrofits, we can see that the inquiries the one-stop shops are getting are coming from those who are willing and able to afford the retrofits.  In addition, however, they are starting to identify those who would like retrofits and who do not qualify through another scheme and for whom the national retrofit plan and the one-stop shop are the only avenue.  A piece of work that could be done over the next year is to start looking at those people making inquiries to the one-stop shop who are not in a position to progress and what other mechanisms might be needed to address the needs of those homeowners.</p></speech>

That measure has been clearly identified for a number of years but has not happened.  I am pointing out that we do not have those data and it would be helpful if we had them.  The benefit of retrofitting is not only that we reduce our emissions but also energy poverty.  I am highlighting that point of interest.</p></speech>

They are all welcome to the meeting.  It is great to have them here in person.  The last few times Mr. Gloster has been before the committee it has been in virtual meetings due to Covid-19.  It is great to have him back in person.</p><p> We are encouraging people to wear masks apart from when they are speaking.  I ask for people to be respectful of others' physical space.  I also advise anyone who is joining us online through Microsoft Teams that the chat function is only to be used if there is a need to tell us about any technical issues or urgent matters that may arise.  It should not be used to make general comments or statements during the meeting.</p><p> Witnesses who are participating from the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p><p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I note that in his opening statement, Mr. Gloster has advised he would like to briefly update the committee on a few key activities of the agency.  I have no issue with him briefing members.  However, I advise our members when putting questions to the witnesses that they keep to the agenda items under consideration.  If members are of the opinion we need to examine some of the other activities performed by Tusla, we can arrange a follow-up meeting.  I invite Mr. Gloster to deliver his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, who have already been introduced by the Chair.<br/><br/>Prior to addressing the two specific matters raised in the committee's invitation, I would like to briefly update the committee on a few key activities for the agency, although by no means all of them.<br/><br/>The agency will shortly publish the annual report in respect of 2021.  In a year that saw the continued impact of the pandemic and the added major challenge of the cyberattack, the agency continued to provide increasing levels of services and responsiveness across a range of statutory functions.  There were 73,069 referrals to our child protection and welfare service alone, which was a 5% increase on the figures for 2020.  That is but one of several indicators of not only the demand for our services but also the complexity of the lives of many children and families.  Our full activity report for 2021 will be available shortly and will, of course, be briefed to the committee.<br/><br/>The agency is well advanced in its three-pillar change programme regarding its practice, culture and structure.  While there is no doubt there are many complex issues, historical and contemporaneous, to be responded to, there are also clear signs of steady and continuous improvements on several issues against the backdrop of the heightened concern of 2018 and 2019.  The agency has had, since February, a new national management structure and six new regions, modelled broadly on the Sl&aacute;intecare analysis.  Each new region with its own chief officer will by the summer be established with significant devolved authority and responsibility to be achieved incrementally at local level.  This will substantially improve the governance of the agency creating the right conditions within which many issues can be tackled.<br/><br/>Following discussion in 2020 and at the start of 2021, a sub-committee of the board of Tusla commissioned the executive to produce a plan for residential childcare.  This area of care is not only extremely complex with an increasing demand but it is also resource intensive and the board required a plan to set out the approach for the coming years.  I will refer to this later as it is directly relevant to the committee's invitation today.<br/><br/><i></i>The agency has a long-standing role in respect of separated children seeking international protection and many of those young people are in our care or supported in an aftercare context.  Children presenting at the ports from war-torn countries, such as Somalia and Afghanistan, as well as those arriving through structured international programmes, are now an integral part of our work.  The situation in Ukraine has seen an exponential growth in demand for these services and by 4 May, we had received 128 referrals resulting in 70 care admissions, with 50 remaining in care, from Ukraine alone.  The agency also has dedicated resources linking all Tusla protection and support services available in each local authority area to the local inter-agency responses.  We are working closely with our line Department and the Department of An Taoiseach to make the best possible contribution to the State response in what is a traumatic time for so many Ukrainian children and families.  I am aware there has been reportage of an issue unfolding in respect of a large number of people arriving at Dublin Airport today.  I will not be in a position to comment until I receive more information on that issue.  I only heard about it as I was coming into the committee room.<br/><br/>The agency continued to function as an essential service throughout the phases of Covid-19.  While there were many challenges working in this environment and maintaining a workforce, I record my thanks to all the staff of Tusla and our funded partners for ensuring the safety and support of so many over an unprecedented and demanding two years.  The agency now has in place a proactive blended working policy and many new ways of working adopted during the restrictions on movement, although not all of them, have been adapted and used for future responses to need.<br/><br/>The agency is making solid progress on permanently securing its own ICT infrastructure and I anticipate by the autumn that we will be 90% independent and have our own security system of the latest standards in place.  We are also this year developing a complete new replacement for the national childcare information system, NCIS, and this will make us unique internationally in having such an up-to-date national case management system for child protection and other critical services.  As previously reported, there was data theft during the cyberattack which we are currently assessing and I anticipate that in the next few weeks we will communicate publicly our plans for appropriately and privately notifying individual people whose sensitive data were compromised.<br/><br/>Early years registration has been a concern of this committee for a number of years.<i></i>The end of 2022 will see the next three-year cycle of registration for the majority of some 4,000 providers of these services.  Our regulation service will this year, with the support of the Minister and the Department, ensure a slimmer and more user-friendly process which will be publicised in June, six months ahead of the registration date, giving providers the maximum time to achieve their continued approval.<br/><br/>The committee will be aware of the agency position on adoption legislation from the pre-legislative scrutiny stage in 2021.  In anticipation of the final stages to commencement of the legislation, we have advanced planning and significant additional resources in recruitment to respond to this new context.<br/><br/>Turning to the matters raised in the committee's invitation to today's meeting, I want to make the following opening remarks.  I will speak first to challenges facing foster carers and general foster care issues.  The committee will be aware from my previous appearances of the significant role played by foster care in the overall response to children who, for a variety of reasons, cannot live at their own home for a period or indeed for all of childhood.  Ireland is an international leader with a prevalence of alternative care placements being at more than 90% for foster care.  It is equally the case that maintaining this has proved difficult in recent times.  Tusla had 4,039 foster carers on the approved panel at the end of 2021, down from 4,324 in 2018.  The proportion of this in the private sector offering is 542, having grown only by 39 in the same period, and this is very satisfactory from a dependency perspective.<br/><br/>An indication of the in-year growth and loss rate of foster carers overall is in the context of 281 new approvals in 2021 and 208 cessations, leaving a net increase of just over 70.  Tusla has targeted an improvement plan for foster care for the next three to five years which will be concluded in June.  We have just completed the plan for residential care and in the autumn, we will conclude the third part, which is aftercare.  Significant direct engagement has taken place with foster carers to listen to their experiences, issues and suggestions.  Responding to many challenges, the next phase of improvement will focus on changes that will lead to continued improvement of foster care for children by also improving the support mechanisms for foster carers.</p><p>The agency is concerned that if we cannot maintain the high level of foster care as a model in the overall alternative care system, the outcomes for children will deteriorate and the attractiveness of fostering as an option will not keep pace with demand.  Foster carers have reported satisfaction with our assessment process, the training provided and the role of the link worker.  However, they have also described some of the key challenges they face, including turnover of social workers, difficulty accessing therapeutic services for children in their care, poor communication, delays in permanency planning, and failure to increase allowances in line with inflation.  The Minister specifically raised foster carer improvements with the agency at a recent engagement and is anxious to support those improvements.  I look forward to finalising and advancing these plans in the coming months.</p><p> I will move to the loss of services provided by Positive Care.  Tusla has engaged in an updated procurement process since 2021 that is aimed at further ensuring the quality and appropriateness of private provision, both in residential and foster care.  The purpose of the exercise is much more focused on quality, staffing and other compliances of service providers than it is on a competitive pricing process.  I am aware of recent narrative, particularly since February of this year, on one private provider, Positive Care Ireland, PCI, which was unsuccessful in the third attempt at a rolling process.  Tusla does not control either the external narrative or the commercial decisions of private companies, and some of the commentary has been concerning and created, more than once, a level of instability for children in the care of the provider and its many fine staff.  The latest position advised to us by the company as of 5 May is its intention regarding the potential sale of its business and that it is at an advanced stage of same.  However, should this materialise or not, it is and remains the position of Tusla that the least disruption possible to the children and to those caring for them is our sole objective.</p><p> I assure the committee that I am satisfied that all the processes that have been and continue to be utilised are appropriate and necessary.  I further want to make it clear to the committee that there is no prejudiced view towards this individual provider being in or remaining in the market.  The company is fully aware of the exact requirements it needs to fulfil to comply with a new contract from the current procurement process.  It is a matter for it or any new commercial arrangement it makes to ensure it fulfils those requirements.  I am more than satisfied that what has been required of it is neither unreasonable nor different from any other provider in the procurement process.  In the final analysis of any such situation, and as I have previously advised another committee of the Oireachtas, there is a role for private provision across many parts of health and social care.  However, if a service fails or ceases, the State ultimately must step in to do whatever is necessary to minimise the impact.  This is not unique to children&rsquo;s residential care.  It is our hope the services currently provided by PCI will continue regardless of the provider, but always and only within the prescribed rules of such a sensitive service.</p><p> This scenario is one that arises in the wider debate about private provision in residential child care.  I have previously indicated the concern of the agency that our level of dependency, rather than the existence of private provision, is a problem.  At present we operate at a public to private ratio of approximately 40:60, that is to say, 40% public and 60% private.  As I mentioned earlier in my statement, the board of Tusla requested a plan for the coming years and has recently approved a plan for residential care.  In the plan, we aim to address the dependency to an achievable rather than an aspirational level, and we have targeted a 50:50 split in three years with desired reversal of the 40:60 split in five years.  This will be achieved through increasing public provision as distinct from any intentional erosion of existing private provision, which has an important role.  This is an important clarification considering some of the narrative that there is a correlation between this plan and decisions by the agency regarding PCI.  I assure the committee this is not the case.</p><p> It is a fact that demand for residential care is likely to increase, regardless of any successes achieved in foster care.  Therefore, to respond to this demand, increased public provision alongside existing levels of private provision will achieve the rebalance.  The decisions of private enterprise to exit or enter the market are secondary to this.  To demonstrate the detail of this plan, I am attaching for the committee a copy of the approved plan which we are working towards.  It is my intention after this committee meeting to publish the plan on the Tusla website as chapter 1 of our alternative care improvement, noting, as mentioned earlier, that chapter 2 will be about foster care, and then chapter 3 will focus on aftercare where there are also many challenges to be addressed.  All planned changes are based on the Tusla principle of the past two years, namely, continuous improvement.</p><p> I thank the Chair for the opportunity to make this opening statement and I am happy, as are my colleagues, to address any questions from members.</p></speech>

Fostering is the backbone of our child protection system.  We are lucky to have such high numbers of foster carers for children in care, as Mr. Gloster has pointed out.  I have met excellent foster carers in my time, both in Tusla placements and in private placements.  However, the system is struggling overall and I say that from personal experience of being that fostering link worker trying to find a placement and struggling to get it.  We have seen in the childcare law reporting project a child who should have come into care but did not do so because there was no foster placement.  The child had to come in later on an emergency basis because the safety plan put in place to manage what was at home was not good enough.  There have been other cases and I know there are various legal actions in some of these cases that we will not necessarily talk about.</p> <p>  The system is struggling and we are barely above a replacement rate for foster carers when it comes to the national growth and loss number Mr. Gloster talked about.  I am curious about the regional disparities.  Are there some regions that are losing foster carers overall?  There is a significant risk that there will be a collapse in foster caring because it is the backbone, it provides excellent care and we have seen, through the childcare law reporting project and others, what happens when it goes wrong.</p> <p>  I am concerned by the growth of private foster care.  Before I get into it I want to differentiate between the individual carers, many of whom are excellent and whom I could not fault in any way, and the companies that have come into the marketplace.  Even to use the word "marketplace" around children in care sticks in my throat a little.  Private foster carers cost more - about three times as much as public ones.  There is evidence from other jurisdictions to suggest private foster care company placements produce worse outcomes for young people.  Let us look at out-of-area placements, young people who are placed a distance away from their local social work office.  This involves greater levels of trauma, displacement, educational dropout and all these sorts of things.  In the one area of Dublin and mid-Leinster, the percentage of private foster placements outside of the area is 84%, whereas in Tusla it is 18%.  In Dublin north-east, 90% of private foster placements are out of the area compared with 20% of public placements.  In the south east, 66% of private foster care placements are out of the area compared with 2% in Tusla.  In the south west, 25% of private placements are out of the area versus 2.5% in public placements.  In the west and north west, 14% of private placements are out of the area versus 3.5% of public placements.  I seem to have forgotten the number for the midlands.  That ends up not only having an impact on the child but also costing time for any social workers who have to visit this placement and child.  Time is the most significant and precious resource the agency has and it is the most difficult one to hold.</p> <p>  There is a growth in foster care provision.  There is private foster care provision that costs more in money and time.  Both of those weaken the agency's ability to recruit and support its foster carers.  This is the behaviour of a parasite weakening its host.  All the while, these agencies are still making healthy profits at the end of it, and that steady growth in private foster care really concerns me.</p><p>That is especially so in view of the fact that foster care is the backbone of the child protection system.</p><p> We are here to talk about solutions.  One thing I look at is kinship and relative care.  It varies from region to region but about 20% to 30% are relative carers.  In the Six Counties, it is the other way around.  The vast majority of placements are with relatives.  What are they doing differently?  I appreciate that relative care brings complexity and is not simple, but what are they doing to tap into this resource and recruit carers that we are not doing?</p><p> I ask about in-house therapeutic supports for children in care and foster carers.  The survey about foster carers has been mentioned and it refers to the difficulty accessing therapeutic supports.  We know that from dealing with unmet needs on the committee, which we do a lot, but for children in care it is more complex, given the levels of trauma and the adverse childhood experiences that led them to be in care.  In Dublin North-Central, excellent in-house therapeutic supports are provided.  It is a flexible service, and it is mentioned in the programme for Government that it is an ambition to roll this out.  This enables us to meet the needs the foster carers are crying out for.  Many carers I have met said they would be slow to recommend fostering to their friends or anyone who asked.  That is a terrible pity because as well as being the best placement for young people, they are our best recruiters.</p><p> Will the witnesses speak to the concern about the growth of private foster care?  What is going on with kinship care and can we do it better?  Will they speak on in-house therapeutic supports?</p></speech>

Many of his observations were suggestive of solutions and I do not disagree with the thrust of those observations.  There are two or three points that I think are critical.  First, I agree and have supported the view since I came to the agency that having 20% of our approved carers as relatives something we should continue to build on.  It is difficult because it depends on the individual family and child circumstances but there is no slack on our side on that.  We have focused on the link worker prioritised to relatives, particularly relatives who are unapproved in the early phase of a placement, to ensure the additional safeguarding and support systems are there.</p> <p>  I will let Ms Duggan address therapeutics but it is not only the time factor of the distance of out-of-area placements that is a concern.  We are increasingly seeing concern in relation to foster care and private residential care that a child on a care placement, albeit important for their safety and well-being, is increasingly distanced from their network and community.  That is a particular challenge on the private residential side and, for foster care, in the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>  We will have to make many improvements for foster carers in a short time.  I have spoken with the Minister about that and he is committed to it.  He is waiting for the final piece from us in terms of the plan.  We had to try to deal with the residential first.  I do not think anybody would dispute that.  From the feedback we have got from foster carers, one of our biggest challenges is consistency in supporting Tulsa foster carers.  No matter how good the rule set is, the interpretation of supporting them in Donegal will be different to Dingle but we are seeing increased consistency.  This year, for the first time, we have made a decision about in-house therapeutics that I think the Deputy will find encouraging.  It is not enough yet because we have to do it in step.  I will ask Ms Duggan to talk about that.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the percentage of foster carers being the limit to which we should go because the dependency is small.  I take on board his general concern.  Family life and patterns have changed, as have many other things.  I have no difficulty saying we have an out-of-hours social work team and even for very small children who might be considered easy to care for in an emergency, we increasingly find that, for Dublin emergency admissions, we have to go further and further.  That concerns me and we will have to find a way to address that.  As I said earlier, that probably rests in our ability to support foster carers in practical ways.</p></speech>

I, with my therapy background, support the need for Tusla to develop its own ìn-house therapeutic services.  We have committed as part of our 2022 business plan to the establishment of therapeutic services.  We are looking at having in place by the end of the year six therapeutic teams within Tusla.  As the CEO stated, we need to do this incrementally in order that every new child coming into care will receive a trauma-informed multidisciplinary assessment which will inform their care plan.  Our plan is to, incrementally over the next three years, replicate that in all 17 areas as they stand today.  That will be overseen by a regional therapeutic co-ordinator who will be responsible not only for directing that service and the quality thereof, but also for more tightly governing how we commission private therapeutic services and how we engage with our community and voluntary partners around the provision of therapeutic services to children in care.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about Dublin North-Central, and there is a variation in Waterford.  There are variations in therapeutic definitions and we will not look to absolutely standardise that because there are different good examples around the country.  We will look for basic standards to be met but have long since decided on the need to move on and have our own ìn-house therapeutic input.  We have committed 15 posts to that this year alone and they are going into the recruitment process now.</p></speech>

I presume that includes foster care.  Can the pressure on foster carers lead to the practice of placing children in hotel-like accommodation?</p></speech>

The Deputy has previously indicated concern to me.  It would be of no benefit to the committee if I was not on the level with it.  Pressure on care placements, both foster care and residential, leads to placement disruption and breakdown.  That does not reflect on the people providing the care but on the context from which children come to us to present for care, including the level of trauma they have experienced and the level of influence in their lives.  I will be careful not to engage in stereotyping because we have many children in care with good things going for them.  However, many of them are now coming from a context where there are serious influences in the context of to addiction, crime and insidious forms of abuse.  When they become safe, it inevitably leads to various expressions of that, which challenges their carers.  Foster carers are telling us they need more support and, rather than saying we will give this or that for the sake of looking like we gave a support, we are focused in the coming weeks of ascertaining what is the best level of support we can give them and producing a plan to deliver it.</p></speech>

We have some bespoke settings which are very much adequate and heavily resourced and, in fact, would cost more to run than private residential centres, so they are appropriate.  We had roughly 127 people the last time I counted - the number varies between 120 and 150 - in bespoke arrangements.  While many of those arrangements will prove to be quite good, we are now moving on to focus on those of the big private providers, having done the procurement.  Within that there is a group of young people who require staff to be with them.  Because we cannot ground them or connect them safely to any suitable care placement for any prolonged period, they often end up moving between a variety of settings, including hotels, over a period of months.  As far as I am aware, Tusla never places a child in something like a hotel without appropriate staffing, oversight and supervision, but that does not make the arrangement appropriate.</p></speech>

This varies greatly.  We are concentrating on matching much more now, particularly with HIQA.  We are conscious of a child's need in developing that.  Some days, if we cannot find a matching placement, the child may be placed in a bespoke placement in the short term and we will match him or her in the longer term.  Such children may not have significant needs.  Some children, though, have very complex needs, as has been said, and for a variety of reasons our residential care providers will not be able to provide placements that match their needs so we provide bespoke placements for them.  In many cases children aged 16 to 18 will age out and will be able to move on to more independent placements, so that is relatively short-term.  Some of those children might be under the supervision of the High Court or other courts.  A placement is provided but, generally speaking, it does not go beyond that.  We make every effort to move them on to some of our own placements or standard residential placements.  It may be a one-to-one placement as opposed to a placement that involves living with other young people, but we move them into those placements as soon as we possibly can.  Generally, such situations do not go on long-term.</p></speech>

I know that this is not where the Deputy is going, but in the context of having spoken earlier about private care, to be clear, in none of these arrangements is money an issue.  That is just not the question.  The question is the appropriateness of the placement versus the best possible option we can provide on a given day, given where the child finds himself or herself and where we find ourselves.</p></speech>

There is little doubt about the increasing synergies now for children who require State intervention in their lives.  That is not unique to Tusla or the HSE; it involves all of us together.  There is no question but that CAMHS is a feature of that.</p></speech>

Parents have told me that social workers in Tusla often sit in on the consultations between the psychiatrist and the child.  I have spoken to parents whose children were mistreated.  I met those families in Tralee.  They feel they were mistreated or the parents feel that their children were misdiagnosed.  They told me they feel not only that CAMHS failed their children but also that Tusla let them down with this process.  Were there any conversations between the HSE and Tusla about south Kerry and the Maskey report?</p></speech>

A number of children have been involved in that case.  Certainly, where it has been appropriate, social workers from Tusla have accompanied those children who were in care on some of those visits.</p></speech>

CAMHS have their own social workers, but sometimes when people hear the term "social worker" they automatically assume he or she is a Tusla worker.  There are a number of children who would have been known to or in the care of Tusla and who were also patients of CAMHS and, as part of the investigation and review, were being considered.  The normal role of a Tusla social worker in such a context is to ensure that the CAMHS professionals have the social work assessment and social care profile of the child, as Tusla knows it, to assist in the CAMHS assessment.</p></speech>

I think we all appreciate the incredible work that foster families offer to young people.  It is an invaluable service that is often, I think, underappreciated.  It happens quietly in communities all over Ireland, and it is important to acknowledge the work of those families and the difference they make in the lives of individuals as well as in reaching families themselves.  As this is a public meeting, it is really important to highlight that.  When I was a child I had a teenage foster sister.  It was one of the best things that ever happened to our family.</p> <p>  In Mr. Gloster's opening statement he indicated concerns about the growth in the loss of foster carers overall, and Tusla's engagement with current foster families indicated some of the challenges in that regard.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the challenges of delays in permanency planning and the failure to increase allowances in line with inflation?  What are the difficulties around permanency planning and their impact?  Should the committee seek for allowances to increase in line with inflation?</p> <p>  Mr. Gloster spoke about some of the practical ways to support foster families.  What are they?  He also highlighted difficulty in accessing therapeutic services for children.  That is an intersectional issue because the waiting lists for assessments of need and therapies are absolutely disgraceful.  He spoke a little about occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, but without the assessment of needs it is not possible to get those therapies.  Will the witnesses give us an insight into how that is impacting the fostering system?</p> <p>  Finally, will the witnesses discuss the specific challenges around recruiting and retaining foster carers for children and adolescents and older children?</p></speech>

The rate is set by the Department in a regulation context.  Tusla does not set the rate; it pays it.  The Minister has asked me that question.  To be upfront, it is our intention, in the context of our foster care improvement plan, to put forward an amendment to the foster care allowance that is provided to try to reflect more globally the modern-day demands involved in supporting a child in foster care.  Maybe Mr. Smyth could clarify the rates.</p></speech>

I think most foster carers would be aware of the period involved.  There are two rates: one for under-12s of &euro;325 a week and one for 13- to 18-year-olds of &euro;352 a week.</p><p>There are some additional supports that can be brought in exceptional cases but they are the standard rates and they have not increased since then.</p></speech>

The assessment of need is part of it, but therapeutic services come in two streams in the health service, namely, primary care, which is not associated with disability or assessment of need, and disability assessment of need.  Ms Duggan, who was previously one of those therapists, might explain that better.</p></speech>

An assessment of need is almost like an identification of need.  The model we are putting forward is not an assessment of need under a legislative basis but rather where we meet a young child, with the foster or birth parents if required, necessary or appropriate, to assess where that child stands developmentally.  From that, we look at designing a care plan and appropriate therapeutic supports to ensure that when the child is in care, all his or her needs are being met.  It is not just physical and safety needs but also developmental needs, whether through motor skills or speech and language skills or psychological supports the child may require.</p></speech>

I have met a group of foster parents who left me in doubt as to their view.  Many of them correspond with me individually and we try to respond on an individual basis, but we have to try to change the system rather than just individualise the response.  This year, Ms Duggan directly invited every foster carer in Ireland to come and talk to her in regional sessions.  She might paraphrase what they have been telling us we would could do better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022051000002#F00500"><p>As part of informing this plan the CEO referenced for foster care that we are finalising, we engaged not only with foster carers but also with various stakeholders such as academics and relevant departmental officials.  Foster carers were very clear that they really believe in foster care as a placement option for children and can see the benefits of it.  They were positive about our assessment process and the training provided, and where there was consistency with the social worker, they were very positive about their experience.  The challenges very much related to the turnover of staff, an issue Mr. Gloster will speak to later in the context of recruitment and retention.  Where there is a change in a young child's social worker, that causes disruption to both the child and the foster carer.  There is also the lack of access to therapeutic supports we have just described.  Moreover, if we are trying to promote and retain foster carers, the model of the different types of supports they need to sustain a placement is the key, especially if a child is having some significant difficulties.  A further issue relates to the lack of a standardised approach to payments, which we have referenced.</p> <p>  Those engagements concluded in February and we immediately sent out some direction to the system, particularly regarding the payment of medical expenses associated with assessment, to ensure some clarity and consistency was brought to that.  Foster carers also talked about not being adequately involved in care planning for the young people in their care and, again, that was inconsistent.  In some areas it was more positive, while in others it was not.  We are very committed to ensuring that will become a much more consistent approach to care planning such that foster carers will be seen as partners in care planning for the children.</p> <p>  We have talked about the fostering allowance.  On permanency planning, it is very much foster carers' wish that where it is understood a child will be in care for a longer period, that be recognised early on and that we look to more permanency planning regarding a placement for the child.  As will be seen in that plan, we are, as an agency, significantly looking to address our approach to permanency planning for all children and young people in our care.</p></speech>

Foster carers individually have had experiences where they have felt we have not responded appropriately to the problem or the issue and that is where a complaint can arise.  This is associated with the issue of safeguarding in foster care.  We hear reports periodically from the sentencing courts where things have gone wrong.  I might ask the chief social worker to address what we do about safeguarding in foster care.  Conversely, foster carers sometimes experience that as not being supportive but, in fact, it is an essential part of it.</p></speech>

We screen all those concerns through the intake, just as we would any concern that comes in.  We try to take an independent and objective approach to the matter.  Where concerns are founded and an investigation begins, they will form part of the new child abuse substantiation procedure we are introducing in June and have been part of an independent process up to now.  That will be a new approach.  The details will be clearly stated and there will be clear information for the carers as they go into the process.  There will also be clear information for the children and it will be an independent investigation.  It is important that while we are independent, we will support the carers as part of that, and we try to take that balanced approach.</p> <p>  Obviously, when we look at the complaints, they can be unfounded or founded.  Where they are founded, we take the appropriate steps to, first, safeguard the child and if the child has to be removed, we do that quickly where we find there is a need, and in the longer term, we support the family to move on.  Often, it can be upsetting for the foster family to be under considerable inspection and that can present difficulties for the family to continue fostering.  We are conscious of achieving a balance in that for carers and, as my colleagues said, appreciating the significant work families do.  A foster home is not a workplace.  It is a place where children grow and live and parents parent their children.  It is not a work environment and we very much appreciate that.</p></speech>

As I said in response to Deputy Costello, family life, working life and the construct of the family changes and keeps changing, and people live busier and different lives.  The cohort of separated children seeking international protection, such as those coming from Ukraine, is not as challenging to recruit for because there is a group of people who have a specific interest in that work.  It comes down to the matching of the child.  It is not that foster carers have a prejudiced view against teenagers but rather it comes down to the matching of the child with foster carers.  Some, although not all, of the teenagers who present as needing our care might present too great a challenge, and foster carers may opt not to proceed with a placement in that context.  We are not giving up on that, however, and we want to find specific ways in the coming weeks that will support foster carers to do that, but I do not want to give any false expectation about the issue.  It is a big challenge.</p></speech>

The foster care allowance helps the carer support the child, and access to therapeutic supports for that young person must be presented in a way in which he or she will be able to engage.  There might be the best therapeutic supports in the world, but if a 15- or 16-year old whose life is fairly chaotic and who has had some dreadfully traumatic experiences cannot interact with them, they will not meet the need that exists.</p></speech>

Often, foster carers may need more access to respite to be able to sustain a placement.  It is about looking at what foster carers have told us would help them with the placements they have at the moment.  Foster carers who foster teenagers or older children have identified the need for some additional respite.  The shared-care approach is something that, as well as the therapeutic supports, we see as supporting that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will see in the plan, shared care can be provided within a foster carer's network of supports.  There could be almost a second foster family within that network who support the foster carer.  I would be delighted to meet the Deputy or any other members to discuss in greater detail the plan we are developing, once we have written it, and to talk through the implementation we are going to carry out.</p></speech>

There are cases in my area that I am concerned about but that is for another day.  Two thirds of the recommendations have been implemented.  What about the other third?  It is important that we know the scale of that.  Foster carers provide an invaluable contribution to the State.  They are the people on the front line yet after years of service to the State they are not entitled to a full State pension.  They are told they do not have enough contributions.  Is that something Tusla finds puts foster carers off?  That is something we need to address.  Deputy Cairns asked about the fostering allowance.  There has not been an increase since 2009.  Does Tusla support an increase?</p> <p>  The next issue is one I am working on.  What steps are being taken for foster carers to advocate on or question decisions made by Tusla?  What supports are there for them to be the voice of the child if the child cannot speak for themselves?</p> <p>  Are many foster carers walking away from the service?  I see huge barriers in accessing supports for families, particularly for family members.  A family I know very well is fostering the child of a member of the family.  It was so hard fighting for payments and access to counselling for the child and there was even an issue around the communication coming back.  I worked with the family for some months and I felt there really was no encouragement for a family member to do this.  They were the nicest family you would ever come across.  I was struck by the barriers.  They came to me and I was trying to work with them to help them and support them.  We got it sorted but I had to get past many barriers myself.  What if a family feels they have no one to go to or they need advice?  It is something that we need to address so that no matter who fosters a child, they fully believe that the supports are there for them.  I understand that Tusla is doing its best and I am certainly not here to give out about the system, as such.  Everyone is working understaffed and there is a huge issue with staff.  However, we need to examine this so that families in that situation feel that the supports are there.</p></speech>

The simple answer on the rate of foster care allowance, which is there to enable people to create that home setting for children, is that I agree.  To be fair to the Minister and his officials, we want to give an informed view as to what we think that is and what it should be rather than just making it up for the sake of it.  That recommendation will be with the Department and the Minister in the coming weeks.  That will be subject to regulatory decision and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and so on.</p> <p>  The pensions question is very interesting.  Whether the foster care allowance could be subject to a PRSI deduction that would in turn lead to the potential of a contributory State pension has been raised with me.  I have no particular prejudiced view of that but equally when the foster care allowance was introduced, it was hard fought that it would be defined as not-income so that it would not affect people's entitlements to jobseekers' payments, assessment for SUSI grants for their own children and so on.  You could go one way and it would cause an unintended consequence.  I do not have a prejudiced view about foster carers being supported after 30 or 40 years or fostering.</p> <p>  Leaving aside the advocating for services that are not there or that cost money, I think the Deputy made a point around a foster carer who fundamentally feels that they are at odds with Tusla around the care plan for the child and the decisions around them.  We are into the whole nature versus nurture debate and all of that.  The policy position in the State is, of course, that children should if possible be cared for within their own family and community, and care is the last option.  I will ask Mr. Brophy to mention how we try to balance that.  To be honest, we have foster carers who fundamentally disagree with us at times on decisions about children.  Ultimately we are always trying to balance what the consequences for the child will be if we go in one direction or another.  It is quite a sensitive issue.</p></speech>

That is immensely helpful to us.  We want to get the message out there all the time that we would really like people to volunteer to foster.  We want people to have that positive experience.  I am sorry that the Deputy was working with a family where that had not happened.</p></speech>

I know as a team leader, principal and social worker over the years that differences of opinion can occur.  Tusla's role is to advocate for that child.  You have a dedicated social worker although I know we have problems with unallocated children.  That may happen and cause one of the blocks in these situations.  You advocate for the child's rights.  That can be difficult in a family because you have the natural family and parents who may want a particular way or style for the child to be brought up.  The length of time a child is in care, or the engagement with the natural parents, can be one thing.  There may also be a difference of opinion.  Parents in the natural family may have a very established pattern of dealing with children and it may take a while for that pattern to change or it may take time for Tusla to adapt and see how the particular foster parents parent best.  There is a process.  We try to achieve that balance.  It is a very personal thing.  We talk a lot in child protection and welfare about creating a network.  Basically we are doing that in foster care all the time.  These carers are becoming that network.  You are involving the school and if there are therapies involved we also try to involve those too.  Increasingly, as well as the emphasis on providing therapeutic hubs we are providing all sorts of support to foster carers.  It could be equine therapy or other support.  It may be short term or long term but we try and provide it as it is needed.</p></speech>

Advocacy, from our perspective, has to be supported for everyone in the relationship.  For children in care we have three forms of advocacy.  There is the child's social worker who is an advocate.  People often forget that and think that the Tusla social worker is the big bad person but actually they advocate for the child.  Many children increasingly have a guardian <i>ad litem </i>and their care is subject to supervision of the courts.  We also fund a national NGO, Empowering People in Care, which increasingly provides advocacy to children in care.  We would like to see more on that.  That is on the child.<br/><br/>We fund direct supports to foster carers through the Irish Foster Care Association.  Not everyone is a member of that.  People come in and out of associations like any other club or so on.  We are well over 90% in this case.  Separate to the child social worker, foster carers have a direct link social worker.  That is a social worker who specialises in fostering and foster parents.  The third part of the advocacy is a group which sometimes gets forgotten in the debate or the narrative, namely the parents of the children in care themselves.  There are small support systems in different parts of the country for parents of children in care but they are very sporadic.  Over the last six months I commissioned the Children's Rights Alliance, independently of Tusla - although we will fund it - to commission a support service for parents of children in care which will grow nationally over the next three years.  We have committed to investing very significant resources in that.  By then, trying to take the combination of all that advocacy, you hope that ultimately you get the best outcome for the child and the carers.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge foster carers and the crucial role they play along with others.  Tusla foster carers provide a safe, secure and stable environment for the most vulnerable children.</p><p>I would like to go back and forth on the initial recommendations going to the Minister on increasing allowances, which I welcome.  I also want to touch on the perceived two-tier system in the model involving Tusla and the private agencies.  Perhaps we could run through the different rates and allowances currently being provided and get thoughts on those.  Mr. Smyth stated that for children under 12, the Tusla rate is 325, and that for those aged 12 and over, it is &euro;352.  The agency is at a set rate of &euro;450.  Is that correct or what is the current rate now for private agencies?</p></speech>

For anybody, &euro;325 and &euro;352 are the standard rates for us.  Any other rates are not approved rates in that context.  We pay just over &euro;1,000 to private foster care companies for the services and the comparative all-in cost for us for those services is in or around &euro;800.  The private company gets back &euro;200 per week more than we believe it would cost us with the rate added in.  The Deputy's question was specific to the rate and &euro;325 and &euro;352 are the standard set rates.</p></speech>

Private foster care bodies are obliged to pay the same to their carers.  Those rates at &euro;325 and &euro;352.  That is out of the money we give them.  The rest of what we give them is tided up in their costs of providing social work and support services, foster carer training and other elements.  There is a perception, and I have no doubt that there are some examples of other supports being provided or paid outside the rates of &euro;325 and &euro;352.  Ultimately, they might equate to what might be seen to be and in some cases the experience would be a two-tier system.  Only in recent weeks the companies have been written to again to remind them of their obligations in that regard.  Essentially, while the experience of a foster carer in a private company might feel and be different to the experience of a foster carer in a Tusla area, the rate that the foster carer receives in the foster care allowance should be the exact same.  The regulations do not allow for it to differ.</p></speech>

What are we doing to ensure we do not have a two-tier system?  We have increased the number of private operators by 39 this year and 12% of the current foster care offerings are private.  The difficulty for many foster carers is the fact that the allowance is meant to belong to the child, which is not disputed, and foster carers are unpaid volunteers.  Mr. Brophy said earlier that the role of Tusla is to advocate on behalf of a child's rights.  Why do we have more money being allocated to the private sector and not Tusla operators?</p></speech>

Perhaps the child might need additional therapeutic supports not available to them in the public system.  In such a case, we would support a foster carer to pay to access those privately.  Orthodontic treatment is an example.  The enhanced payment has been set at a maximum of twice the weekly rate.  The maximum to be paid for a child under 12 is &euro;650.  It is important to say those enhanced payments must be for an identified medical or educational need.  They must be assessed by the social worker as required and they must be approved.</p> <p>  I will speak to the chief executive officer's earlier point.  We recognise and have heard over the past couple of months that there are some inconsistencies across our areas with the approval of those enhanced payments.  The Deputy will see in the forthcoming plan very set guidelines around the standardisation of those enhanced payments.  Where a child or young person is in foster care, there may be a requirement for modification to a house, either to support a child with a disability or medical needs or where a foster family is willing to take a child in placement, Tusla will also support modification of building works required for a house.</p></speech>

There had been a discrepancy or issue with the payment of the fostering allowance while a child was on respite.  That has been resolved.

There are many children in foster care today who do not need access to respite.  It is part of the care plan.  Do we have adequate respite?  No, and it is something we must look at.  It is back to the point around shared care placement and increasing not just the number of respite places we have available but our model of respite.

They live at home with families and we pay respite carers to look after them.  We then have children in care who go for respite.  If they are children with a disability, they go to a HSE respite service.  We now continue the foster care allowance for foster carers while they are in the respite service.  When I came here, that was raised with me by many foster carers and the ombudsman and application was sporadic.  That has been resolved.</p> <p>  We have children in care who do not have a disability but either the child or the foster carers might need respite, or a break.  Do we have enough of that?  I would not think so.  Where we have it and where we can work it into the care plan, we support the foster carer as well as the respite carer to do that.  There were debates about that before.</p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy's fundamental point about what we are doing to standardise.  This will involve a question on which we have not yet landed on a final decision.  If we set out the rules by which foster carers are supported, whether public or private, and we pay for one, two, three, four or five, it would be great but I can guarantee that within a day of those being published a need would emerge to push the system to go outside those rules.  The minute we go outside those rules, there is inconsistency.  The question will be how much discretion we can give our local teams versus how much rigidity we bring to the rules.  The more discretion we have, the more inconsistency there will be.  That is the challenge for us but we can make a fundamental improvement.</p> <p>  I am very confident that any absence of standardisation in the apparent or experienced difference of foster carers between public and private can be eradicated or reduced.  The child in care with a private foster carer or a Tusla foster carer always has a Tusla social worker.  The experience is on a supported level.</p><p>I am certainly keen for us to take out any possibility of that being different.</p></speech>

I have questions, some of which have been covered.  I was going to raise the issue of the pension today.  I know it is more of a social welfare issue.  It also applies to carers.  Once people are in receipt of an allowance payment, they fall outside this.  Maybe there should be an option for people to opt in or out.  I have come across it in a different context.  People who may have been caring for a number of years, contract an illness and then do not qualify for the invalidity pension because they have been caring.  I know that is not foster care but it is a similar scenario.  It might encourage people if they knew that they could opt into something.  Will the witnesses speak on relative care and how we might encourage that?</p> <p>  While my other question might seem basic, who can actually become a foster parent?  My experience is that people think they are not qualified or cannot do it, or they might think they have to have a traditional two-parent family with 2.5 children, when as far as I am aware, many people who are parenting alone are also foster parents, as are people who are working outside the home.  Many people think foster parents have to be available at home all the time.  Will the witnesses clarify that, while we have the chance, to encourage people to come forward to foster?  I am conscious that this is a public meeting.  If people are watching who want to get involved, Tusla could use this opportunity to tell them how to go about it.</p></speech>

People do not have to be single, married or have a partner.  We try to match needs, as I referred to earlier.  We would try to ensure there is at least one carer at home if the child is very young.  Many children need placements and they have a variety of needs.  They are aged between zero and 18.  We mentioned education supports earlier.  Education is important for those children and for carers, so that there is a place for them during the day.  Anyone can do it.  We welcome couples who are married, who are not married or who are in same-sex relationships.  We have had real success with providing diverse placements.  We are also trying to encourage more members of the Traveller community and Roma community to take up placements.  We have a special project to involve them.  We are open to that diversity and want to encourage it.  I am delighted to have the opportunity today to invite people to come forward and to ring their local office or our fostering helpline to have a conversation with us.  We work hard to get back to people as quickly as we can to respond to those inquiries.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say that.</p></speech>

Relative carers are a connection to where fostering originated in the Brehon law period.  It arose from the concept of a village raising a child.  Relative carers make up about 20% of our approved carers.  I hope that research or a study can be done on what the outcomes look like.  It is important.  People have a perception of an adversarial relationship between Tusla and a family.  In our modern-day approach to practice, there are about 5,800 people in our care, with about 16,000 open cases of children at home in our child protection system.  Social workers visit those children, engage with those families and work well to support the parents to keep the children safe.  We have a good national approach to practice, using safety plans.  In safety plans, we bring relatives in to be part of the ongoing support system of the child.  We hope that, should that child require a carer for a period, we will rely on the relative.  It is important that we emphasise that.  It is not an adversarial thing with the State going to take a child off a family and the family being cut out of the child's life.  In our experience, most children in care eventually determine the level of contact and engagement they want.  Relatives have a significant part to play in that.</p></speech>

Twenty-nine young people are still in its care.  It still exists and is not gone.  There is an indication that there will be a transition.  We will work with it.  This is a problem with dependency on private care.  If it ceases or is disrupted in any way, the State has no choice but to do certain things.  It is the same in nursing homes for older people.  It is not unique to children.  I ask Dr. O'Leary to speak on the 29 and our regulation and oversight of private residential care providers, though not specifically Positive Care Ireland, to ensure that we keep children safe, because we have an important role in it.</p></speech>

It is one of the greatest possible contradictions of governance.  To be fair to the relevant Departments, they are trying to resolve it.  We are the provider of public residential care, the funder of all residential care, the overseer of the placement of children in all residential care, the commissioner of private residential care, and the regulator and inspection and registration service for private services.  It is a fundamental contradiction and it is problematic.  That said, our inspection and monitoring team does the job very well and ensures the safety of children in those contexts.</p></speech>

He talked about many different areas in his opening statement.  Things are becoming more and more complex, with many more legislation and governance issues.  What challenges does Tusla have with recruitment, notwithstanding current operations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022051000002#J01600"><p>When I saw Deputy Costello coming back in, I thought he was going to raise that.  There is good news and not-so-good news.  The good news is that we have increased the resource profile to be able to staff Tusla in recent years.  Tusla has never had as large a workforce employed as in the three-year period including Mr. Pat Smyth's tenure as interim CEO for a year, before I came, and in my own time.  There were many years in which the agency could not fill jobs at all.  That said, we reached full employment at the end of 2020.  We got significant additional resources thanks to the Minister.  We struggled with recruitment due to the pandemic and the cyberattack.</p><p>We also struggle in our retention of staff regardless of the pandemic or the cyberattack and I do not want to be hiding behind those.  Roughly speaking, we have approximately 4,800 employees and with whole-time equivalents that might number 5,000 people.  We are trying to have approximately 5,150 people by the end of this year.  It is a big ask.  Within that we are down approximately 150 social workers.  Essentially, we would not have been down that number but in quarter 3 of 2021 we took one of our biggest retention hits not because there was anything particularly wrong with Tusla other than that, as I have said, this work is extremely complex.  I do not think the social work profession would dispute the fact it is probably the most complex area of social work.  It is not for everybody.  We took a big hit last year in the third quarter because of something that is a good development but which is challenging.  All  the health and social care sectors have now grown to multidisciplinary teams.  In the health service, for example, there are doctors, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists and now every team has a social worker, including child and mental health service, CAMHS, teams and mental health teams.  There is a limited base.  </p><p> Approximately 238 students will graduate this year in Ireland as social workers.  For the past two years, with the support of the Minister and the board, I have taken the decision to offer them all jobs before they graduate.  My fellow employers in the health service and other places would say what is there for them but people make choices.  Out of 238 who will graduate this year, 181 applied for posts with Tusla, 140 have been panelled and we have commenced offers.  As I said, we are down 150 social workers and the members can note the pattern there.  We will lose people this year as well, which will be a challenge.  The answer to having staff into the future, apart from growing additional social work places, is to have a diversity of the workforce at the front line, more social care workers and more therapeutic staff working in social work-led teams.  That is a longer-term bigger policy change.  For now we are doing everything we can to grow the number of social workers in order to recruit them.  We have got good at recruiting.  We need to find ways to get better at retaining staff.  We must also accept there will be a level of retention challenge in this type of work.  I could not but say, and I know that Deputy Costello will know this better than I do, we have the most committed and dedicated people working for us in every staff grade, be it clerical staff supporting social workers on the front line, social care staff or social work staff.  It is the most rewarding but the most demanding and challenging work and it is not the easiest.  We are in a good place compared to where we were but we are under pressure.</p></speech>

Two points strike me from what Mr. Gloster said.  The first relates to the retention issue.  Many people who get into social work do so longing to work directly with children.  If there are multidisciplinary teams and if it is a social work-led team, the social worker becomes, and this is already a complaint of some staff, a case manager and does not do the direct work.  When I have spoken to some social workers about the in-house therapeutic supports, they argue if there were more social workers they could do that work.  There is a danger that reducing that direct work with children in order to address the retention crisis will feed a retention crisis.  My second question is on what is the figure of 5,150 based.  We know the number of children in care.  We have a tool to measure the pressure and from that we can gauge how many social workers we need.  There is demographic information and from that we can estimate the likely number of children who will come into care and anticipate the demand.  Based on measuring the pressure, we will know the number of social workers that will be needed.  Has Tusla done that type of workforce planning exercise?  I have one or two follow-up questions on fostering, which I will come back to later.</p></speech>

First, regarding social workers having time to work with children directly, the Deputy is 100% correct on that point.  Social workers say that to me all the time.  Young social workers, in particular, who come to work for us get very frustrated about that.  Some of them record up to 60% of time is spent either on administrative work or on other matters.  Two elements drive that.  The first is the regulatory compliance levels the agency now has to meet.  In saying that, I am not saying regulation is a bad thing.  We all know where it came from.  It is a very important part of the feature of safe personal social services given our history but there is no doubt our laborious methodologies make that worse than it is.  As I referenced in my opening statement, this year we will introduce the new replacement national childcare information system, NCCIS.  We estimate that will reduce computer screen time for a social worker managing a case by approximately 20%.  I could stand to be corrected on that.  It is social workers who have been involved in designing that and I hope that in time, that will contribute.  There is also a second element, which the Deputy will probably know about, which has made a difference.  Social workers have told us this.  In the past two years we have assigned 45 or 50 extra clerical staff to directly supporting teams.  This year we will assign more.  Because we cannot get all the social workers we want we have asked social workers what would help with that and it is more administrative support.  However, the Deputy and I both know the administrative support can only do so much.  The social worker will still be pulled on.  </p> <p>  On the 5,150 figure, I would dearly love to say to the Deputy it is a direct target linked to a direct assessed level of need and response to need.  It is not.  It is an incremental growth from what we know is well below what we need.  We still need to do more of that.  Regarding starting to introduce some evidence-base to that, Ms Duggan will speak briefly on the resource allocation model we now use for that.</p></speech>

It has been very much, as the Deputy said, looking at the demographics of the number of children by age profile and it also involves taking account of the number of social workers, the number of commissioned services within an area and the socioeconomic profile of the area.  We also need, in consultation with Dr. Anthony O'Leary and Mr. Pat Smyth, to define further a resource allocation model.  We have an immature version of it at the moment that is bringing transparency to how we are allocating.  We are dealing with legacy issues where posts evolved over time.  We are trying to bring a consistency to the number of social workers we would have per child population in the context of the socioeconomic factors that are at play.  That is something we are committed to developing and refining over time.  However, as Mr. Gloster said, the supply of social workers coming through the educational system is another focus we have.  He has had engagements with the Deputy of Further and Higher Education-----</p></speech>

I am sure Deputy Costello will be well versed on it already.  Mr. Brophy might make reference to that because it is stark.</p></speech>

The North has a particularly trauma informed need and requires a trauma informed practice for a portion of its general population.  We have approximately half of what they have in the UK.  If we take that as a general population, and these are figures produced by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, now the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and beyond that we do not have exact figures.  That is our general position.  We know there is huge need.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me today not to take the opportunity to say that as a social worker of more than 20 years standing, I have enjoyed every day I have been in it.  I get what Deputy Costello said about the taking away from direct practice.  Having been a team leader for 12 years in Athy, the days I enjoyed most were the ones where I was involved in a child in care review and I got to engage with that child in care.  There is so much engagement to be done.  We want to put our social workers in that place where they meet those children but we still need to rely on speech and language therapists, CAMHS, physiotherapists and all the other professions who work with us to inform that child&rsquo;s care plan.  I enjoyed those days and I enjoy it just as much now.  I would say to anybody who is interested in helping other people to come and join Tusla, apply to be a social worker, a social care worker, or a family support worker.  We have many positions for people who have other qualifications or who are married and have experience.  There are many opportunities to help.  We want to engage those people and get them into our workforce.  </p></speech>

We talked a good deal about the reform of alternative care services in terms of foster care and residential care.</p><p>We have talked about the development of our therapeutic services.  The third strand of that for us is around developing integrated response pathways which are very much our commitment to ensure that we are moving away from a system of thresholds and a child or young person not meeting a threshold for a child protection response and instead of getting no response, that they get a different response.  It is that different response that may not require a social work response.  It is a response that requires perhaps somebody who has experience in working in and engaging with families with addiction issues where the person has experience of working, maybe, with young people between 16 and 18 years of age.  It may be a youth worker who is able to support those children to remain at home and to support those families to parent and look after those children safely.  When we talk about the social work-led teams, it is, of course, the social work teams but it is the other teams we need within areas to respond to those children and families that need a response from Tusla, and not only a child protection response.</p></speech>

To be fair, because we are trying to commence it this year, I do not want to overstate it either.  Let us see.</p></speech>

We have gone out and we have looked at that profile of children and young people who have not met a threshold and who are not receiving a service at present, looking at what their needs are and what is the best skill mix to put in place to respond to those needs.</p></speech>

Fifty-two per cent of them were non-abuse suspected cases.  They were welfare cases.  That means somebody was sufficiently worried about those children to say the State needed to be aware that they needed some support.  It does not matter whether it is Tusla, CAMHS or the local NGO, but that is indicative of how far we have to go.</p></speech>

As they say, it is important that when most people hear child protection their minds go to abuse, and particularly sexual abuse, whereas the vast majority of children are in care for neglect and there are much deeper societal issues in terms of addiction, poverty and mental health that we must address beyond Tusla's remit.  Anyway, I will stop with my soapbox.</p></speech>

It will be in two sessions.  In the first session we are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Ms Caroline Timmons, acting assistant secretary, Ms Catherine Comer, principal officer, and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, principal officer.  From the Department of Health, we are joined by Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, assistant secretary, and Ms Fiona Larthwell, principal officer.  The opening statements and briefing have been circulated to members.</p><p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamatory action arising from their remarks at the meeting.  There are some limitations on parliamentary privilege for witnesses who are attending remotely from outside Leinster House and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p><p> Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I thank our guests for their attendance.  We hoped to host this meeting in February but I believe there was work ongoing between the Departments, especially in respect of fair deal.  We hope to discuss that scheme today.  I invite Ms Timmons and then Ms McArdle to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan, principal officer in the social inclusion area, and Ms Comer, principal officer in the rental market area.  Our colleagues from the Department of Health are also in attendance.  We work closely with them in a number of areas across the social inclusion spectrum and, in particular, we have collaborated strongly in the area of older people for several years.</p> <p>  The number of people over the age of 65 is expected to reach 1.4 million, or approximately 23% of the total population, by 2040.  The implications of that for areas of public policy including housing, health, urban and rural planning, transport, policing, the workplace and the business environment are considerable.</p> <p>  Government policy in respect of housing for older people, as set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, is to support people to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In short, it is to allow them to age in place, close to their families and friends and in their community.  It is recognised, however, that some older people, no less than any other age group, may want or need to move to alternative accommodation.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us as policy makers to ensure there are options to allow older people to choose the housing solution that is best for them.</p> <p>  Housing for All confirms the commitment to the principles and actions of the 2019 joint policy statement entitled Housing Options for Our Ageing Population.  That policy statement was delivered jointly with the Department of Health,.  The implementation group set up to progress the actions in the statement was very successful.  I look forward to updating the committee on progress in that regard during the meeting.  Housing for All reflects and aligns with the policy and actions in Housing Options for Our Ageing Population because it targets delivery of more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.  It commits to delivering more than 300,000 new homes by 2030, including 54,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent and more than 90,000 social homes.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history and is financed by the biggest State funding commitment ever.  Pathway 2 of Housing for All commits to expanding the housing options available for older persons and sets out specific actions on housing for older people, including a commitment to implementing the 40 actions that were contained in the policy statement.</p> <p>  A successful housing outcome for older people requires an effective blending of housing and health policy and, as a Department, we are already collaborating very productively with our colleagues in the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities to plan for the delivery of services to meet the needs of older people.  We also work closely with, and jointly fund, Age Friendly Ireland, the local authority shared service delivering the World Health Organization, WHO, programme that promotes the development of age-friendly policies across eight thematic policy areas, including housing and health.  The shared service is a unique resource within the local government system, targeted to the needs of older people and supporting the Departments and agencies in the development of their programmes.  It has a representative in each local authority across the country.  </p> <p>  My Department delivers on housing options for older people by both stimulating supply in the private sector and directly funding social housing.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, are key partners in this regard.  Housing for older people is funded from the mainstream capital programmes for social housing in local authorities, as well as the capital assistance scheme, which provides funding to approved housing bodies for specialist housing, including AHBs such as Clann, which specialises in housing for older people.  There are many excellent examples of the results of this funding, such as the age-friendly development provided by Meath County Council as in-fill housing on a previously derelict site at Proudstown, County Meath, and the Broome Lodge apartment development by Clann in Cabra, Dublin 7, which incorporates universal design principles.  Both of these developments have changed the lives of the older people who live in them.  They are living in the heart of their own communities in safety and security.</p> <p>  For older people who wish to remain living in their existing dwelling, the housing adaptation grant scheme for people with a disability and older people, the mobility aids grants scheme and the housing aid for older people scheme allow older people in private housing to make adaptations and improvements to their homes to enable them to go on living there in comfort.  Funding totalling &euro;81 million is available to local authorities for these grant schemes in 2022 and, in line with the Housing for All commitment, the Department will be finalising a review of these grants this year.</p> <p>  My Department is committed to improving housing for older people, working with our colleagues in the Department of Health and other stakeholders within the framework of Housing for All.  We will continue to work with them to achieve the ambition of making Ireland a great country in which to grow old, as a truly age-friendly country works for society as a whole. </p> <p>  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Ms Larthwell, principal officer from the social care and mental health division in the Department.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s demographics are changing.  Welcome improvements in health outcomes and extended life expectancy have changed our expectations for how older people should live within their communities.  For the most part, older citizens clearly indicate their preference to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  The programme for Government 2020 commits to creating an age-friendly Ireland, while Sl&aacute;intecare aims to provide the right care in the right place and at the right time.<br/><br/>The Department of Health aims to support the will and preference of older people to live and age well in their own communities.  The provision of enhanced integrated health services in the community, with a focus on prevention and early intervention of chronic disease conditions, aims to support older people to live well at home and to reduce the likelihood of hospital admission.  Through the HSE national service plan for 2022, the Department of Health has invested approximately &euro;670 million in home support provision and reform and a further &euro;195 million to enable the continued delivery of the enhanced community care programme across all community healthcare organisations.<br/><br/>The Department of Health and the HSE, partnered by Age Friendly Ireland and ALONE, also provide complementary support co-ordination models to link older people with services such as befriending and signposting to local community groups.  As highlighted by the health and housing joint policy statement, Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, these initiatives play an important role in connecting older people to their communities, reducing the poor outcomes associated with social isolation and helping people to quickly and easily access services they need. <br/><br/>Although the direction for Government policy is to support individuals to remain in their homes, long-term residential care will continue to be necessary for some older people in order to meet their healthcare needs.  The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, also known as the fair deal scheme, is the State&rsquo;s means-based system of financial support for people who are not in a position to pay privately for their long-term residential care.  Its aim is to ensure that when residential care is necessary, it is accessible, affordable and regulated to provide a high quality of professional care.  Although we expect there will be an increased diversion from residential care as community supports improve, population ageing will continue to drive a high demand for residential care.<br/><br/>To avail of the NHSS, older people must have their care needs assessed to determine that they require full-time residential care.  Residents contribute to the cost of their care at a basic rate of 80% of their income and 7.5% <i>per annum</i>of the value of their assets, with the State making up the balance of the cost.</p><p> The nursing homes support scheme is worth &euro;1.4 billion.  The core tenet of the scheme, and the reason that it is called the fair deal, is that those who have more pay more and those who have less pay less.</p><p> At this time of housing crisis, the Department is acutely aware that access to housing is one of the key social determinants of health.  Providing people with a home of their own enables them to access a range of community supports, including, where required, health services in their community.</p><p> Some older people who avail of the NHSS leave their homes vacant while accessing care.  While there are many reasons for this, it is probable that the standard financial assessment rules have acted as a disincentive to some who would otherwise have chosen to sell or rent out their home.  This must now be balanced against the national priority to maximise the use of the existing housing stock, including the homes of those who are in care.  To address this, in line with departmental policy commitments, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021 removed a disincentive to selling a home left vacant by changing the way in which those sale proceeds were assessed.</p><p> The Department of Health, in collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is now developing a further amendment to reduce a disincentive for participants in the scheme to rent out their home.  As committed in Housing for All, it is important to ensure that this incentive is developed "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people".  The proposed amendment will reduce the rate of assessment on rental income from the home to 40% rather than the previous 80%.  The Department and stakeholders have highlighted concerns about the unintended consequences of this measure.  Many of these impacts are expected to be mitigated by the partial nature of the exemption and will be monitored through a review.  This review will also provide for an ability to amend the rate of assessment further, should it prove necessary and appropriate.</p><p> In conclusion, it is a key objective of the Government and the Department of Health to ensure, where possible, that older people can live and age well in their own homes and communities.  The Department is also committed to supporting equitable and affordable access to safe, high-quality long-term residential care for older people when and where required.  Now, by rebalancing the incentives created by the fair deal scheme, the Department is also delivering actions to increase the number of potential properties available in the State thus further supporting access to housing for all.</p></speech>

Certainly during the years 2000 to 2010 the local authority built a lot of complexes in the area.  Every time a complex was built one's phone would melt from the number of phone calls from people who were either in local authority homes and wanted to downsize or were in private homes and wished to avail of the new form of housing.  We know that the scheme is universally popular, provides density, allows people to stay in their communities and generates a huge amount of positives.  We also know that the scheme is subject to far fewer objections by existing communities.  It is an easy button for local authorities to press yet in a time when we are building significantly more local authority housing I do not see a pipeline of senior homes coming through.  That being said, there was a very significant one in my own community yesterday in Ballymun, which I acknowledge.</p> <p>  I want the Department to communicate the prioritisation of senior citizen housing to local authorities because there is a feeling that it is about family homes and maybe senior housing does not add to that picture.  I believe that it does.  The scheme frees up local authority homes for people who want to downsize and creates a much greater social mix, particularly in areas where there might be a high level of concentrated low-income housing.  We know that whether it is mixed tenure or mixed income when one concentrates on low-income housing there can be significant resource issues.  What is the Department doing to provide local authority senior citizen housing?</p> <p>  One of the successes of the Dublin City Council schemes was one called a financial contribution scheme.  People could sell their home to the council and that did not give them priority on the list but allowed them to buy a way on to the list or become eligible for the list and then they would be housed in the normal way.  Often, if one were selling one's home one could then access the scheme.  Until very recently I know that nearly 140 people in my area alone wanted to avail of the financial contribution scheme.  It would be a source of funding available to they local authorities but they were not in a position to do this because of the priority that I talked about earlier.  Now I have heard that the Department might have this as a priority but because of a prohibition on the purchase of properties the financial contribution scheme in Dublin City Council will now end.</p> <p>  I ask the officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to clarify the following.  Does the prohibition or limitation on the purchase of homes by local authorities restrict schemes such as the financial contribution scheme?  What is the Department doing to encourage local authorities to provide more homes for senior citizens? </p></speech>

Since 2019, we have had the Housing Options for our Ageing Population that comprises 40 actions and 32 of them have been completed.  A report on all of the actions will shortly be available.  The third and final report of the implementation group will continue work on the eight actions as well as the new actions in Housing for All, which can take that forward.</p> <p>  Aside from the policy basis, and I covered that in my opening statement, we are looking at how to let people age in place, how to provide grants if they want to live in their own house or if they want to move to supported housing and how best to address that.  The other side of that policy space is funding.  The Department has quite a good deal of funding available for older people's housing.  Most people are aware of the capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding, which is obviously available for older people's housing.  The budget for CAS last year was, I think, &euro;93 million and obviously we have &euro;96 million this year.  Last year, we did 350 units and 150 bed spaces.  The budget for this year will be &euro;96 million for 400 units.  In 2021, 54 units were age-friendly housing so CAS is always available for that.  Interestingly, it is not just CAS that is being used to provide housing for older people it is the capital advance leasing facility or, CALF funding.  As members will be aware, the CALF budget is much bigger at &euro;293 million for 2022.  There is a lot of access, particularly for approved housing bodies, AHBs, that want to specialise in older people's housing.  The funding availability is there.  Members will have seen organisations like Clann come forward and specialise.  It is nice to see the bigger AHBs get into that and there is a host of smaller AHBs.</p></speech>

Age Friendly Ireland has done a bit of work for us in that area.  I am sure that the Deputy is aware that Age Friendly Ireland is a great service that is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Health.  Age Friendly Ireland, along with local authorities, analysed the type of pipeline that they have coming forward.  They looked at the 250 units that they have done over the last couple of years as local authority and there are about 700 units coming forward.  Some of them are AHBs but quite a lot of them are local authority housing, which is interesting.  Local authorities, like the Deputy, are aware that there is an appetite for older people's housing and that if they bring it forward that it will be accepted and supported by communities.  We can see a lot of that coming forward and there is funding for them.</p> <p>  In terms of the financial contribution piece, we are aware of the scheme from Dublin City Council, DCC.  Last year, Age Friendly Ireland did a piece for us arising out right sizing in terms of Housing Options for our Ageing Population.  One of the things that we did, as a Department, was to look at the number of authorities that had financial contribution schemes in place and there is quite a few.  As the Deputy will be aware, Limerick has one at Mungret, which it advertised last December and DCC would have it as well.  We have examined that as to whether it is a model that we could take forward.  It is being used a part of the model at the St. Michael's development in Inchicore and will be allowed as a proportion of the allocations going that way.  I do not think that I have been aware that was potentially an issue in terms of allocation.</p><p>That is something I can take away and look at.  I am aware of the overall issue and we have addressed it in the context of previous issues with homeless accommodation and the points raised about people with notices to quit.  I will, however, have a look at what the Deputy mentioned.  I was not aware that Dublin City Council was considering winding it down.  We have issued a circular in respect of the allegations.  We have said that local authorities can purchase properties within the categories that already exist.  We can re-examine this to see if it is causing a difficulty in that space.  We will then respond to the Deputy.</p></speech>

To explain what we are doing now, with the Chair's agreement, regarding St. Michael's, that scheme is being reviewed by the Housing Agency as it goes through each phase.  The final review by the Housing Agency will be to recommend an overall model that we should use.  It will be interesting to see if it will come forward and propose what the Deputy referred to as part of the model.  It will also, in some ways, be explored as part of our rightsizing policy that we are developing this year.  I am not sure what direction that will go in.  I will wait to see the advice we receive from the Housing Agency and then we will move it this forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#D00800"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  We have some wonderful housing for older people, especially in the public sector, right across the State.  In deference to Senator Cummins, I was in St. John's College in Waterford, which is a wonderful Respond development recently funded by the Department.  I refer as well to McAuley Place in Naas, which is also such a wonderful facility, and even to some of the slightly older schemes, such a Verschoyle Court, just off Mount Street not far from here.  Deputy McAuley will be aware of it.  What is wonderful about all three of these examples is that they do not consist only of housing.  They also have a variety of other facilities.  The public garden in Verschoyle Court is incredible, while McAuley Place is an entire community.  If the Chair has not been there, he really should visit.  Not unlike the Respond facility, it has a community hall and a public caf&eacute; and provides a host of activities in which the residents are involved.  Several new apartments have been built at the back of the complex.</p> <p>  We know what works in this regard, certainly in the public sector.  It is important when we have these conversations to emphasise this is about choice and not about putting any pressure on older people living in larger homes to move out of them.  They are not the cause of, nor contributors to, our housing crisis.  This is about giving older people who may wish to rightsize as many options as possible to enable them to do the right thing for themselves.  The reason I say that is that sometimes when these matters are debated by other people on the radio, many politicians get calls from nervous pensioners who feel like they are being blamed because they have an emotional attachment to the homes they are living in.  They might be the only people living in them, but these are their homes and they have a right to live in them.  I do not think anyone at this committee would say otherwise.  </p> <p>  My one concern, however, is that while some funding is available, it is not anywhere near enough.  More important, I am not so sure if we are setting the right kinds of targets.  A good local authority will take all the good policy instruments Ms Timmons has outlined and access them through the capital assistance scheme, CAS, the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, the AHBs or the strategic housing investment programme, SHIP, to deliver good quality rightsizing.  The great value of doing that is that a rightsizing social housing development built in an existing local authority estate will make it possible to get more dormer bungalows on that piece of land, which in turn will free up more two-, three- and four-bedroom homes in that existing estate.  That is a good model of practice.</p> <p>  My first question for Ms Timmons then concerns whether we are moving towards starting to set targets in local authorities whereby a certain percentage of their social housing output, based on an evidence-based need for rightsizing in existing estates, would be incorporated into their housing plans.  There is also a need to go a step further because we will also need rightsizing options in the private sector.  Do we need to start considering amendments to planning legislation?  As part of the housing need and demand assessment, HNDA, of planning applications, should consideration be given to ensuring an appropriate proportion of rightsized properties, especially dormer bungalows and ground-floor apartments, can be delivered?  </p> <p>  I will raise a major concern about the fair deal scheme.  The age organisations, representatives of which will be before the committee later, have been particularly concerned about issues of potential elder abuse and extended family members applying pressure to family members, some of whom are vulnerable, to access the fair deal scheme to enable a property to be let out.  I am not opposed to trying to incentivise getting some of these properties into the private rental sector.  I think it will be a small number and not anywhere close to 8,000 properties, or even a half or a quarter of that figure.  Any properties we can get into the rental sector will be a good development.  How do we fully protect the owners of these properties from the kinds of concerns we have heard the Minister of State in the Department of Health, and others, express?  How can we ensure that while we get the properties into the rental market, we do so in a way that fully protects the interests of the older owners of these homes?</p></speech>

This is underpinned by the fact that the proportion of the population aged over 65 is increasing.  Local authorities will need to understand that.  The way we are asking them to do that is principally through the HNDA, which now forms part of a suite of tools local authorities can use when preparing their housing strategies as part of their development plans.  We have seen some six local authorities successfully come through that HNDA development plan process, including Dublin City Council and Kildare, Kerry, Clare and Galway county councils.  Part of the HNDA framework requires local authorities to have a chapter on specialist housing.  It means they must explore the demographics of their populations and then plan in their housing strategies for what their provision will be for older people as part of their development plans.  They must then signal that to the planners and the housing sector.  It is extremely important that this starts coming through.</p> <p>  The second strand of this relates to more immediate implementation.  In the housing delivery action plans, we asked all the local authorities drawing up their implementation plans for the next five years to make provision in those plans for housing for older people, those with disabilities and other specialist groupings.  Older people are one of the groups being considered.  More recently, at the end of March, we communicated with the local authorities that we wanted to see a little more in the content of those action plans to describe the targets that are going to be set and how they are proposing to achieve them.  I fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on this point.  It is important that local authorities are examining this issue and have targets they will try to reach in this regard.  We will see the fruits of this in the next few years as the local authorities progress through their plans and get better at the planning part of HNDA, which is being bedded into the process now.</p></speech>

I will make one strong recommendation.  When I speak to constituents living in larger homes, which they feel are too big for their needs, the one condition they always express for a rightsizing option is that it be in the same immediate locality.  They would like to be able to walk to the church or bingo and remain part of their social networks.  We are moving to some larger social housing projects and the smaller in-fills are not necessarily coming through now as frequently.  Smaller in-fills, however, are ideal for dormer bungalows.  They are within existing communities, especially in our larger council estates.  I wish to impress upon Ms Timmons that in-fill is ideal for those dormer bungalows.   Additionally, it provides a win-win scenario.  As I said, we had a wonderful development in north Clondalkin.  It was originally meant to consist of five family homes.  Through the Part 8 process, we amended the plans for the development to get seven or eight dormer bungalows.  We still freed up seven or eight larger homes in the local community.  It is possible to get the rightsizing options and the larger number of two- and three-bedroom homes as well.  That kind of policy, if it was pushed hard with the local authorities, could produce real dividends.</p></speech>

We are certainly open to it.  Awareness in local authorities has really improved in recent years, especially following the appointment of the age-friendly technical advisers and the advent of Age Friendly Ireland having representatives in each local authority raising awareness of what is needed for older people's housing and trying to put that in place.  These developments are contributing to that being brought forward.  We are open to any suggestions of in-fill housing undertaken in the manner outlined by the Deputy.  It completely chimes with our NPF objectives, so we are happy to take that point on board.  I thank the Deputy.</p></speech>

The point about the vulnerability of the cohort is important.  From the national dementia strategy, we know that more than 70% of people in nursing homes have dementia or some other type of cognitive impairment.  This is an issue affecting a majority rather than a minority in trying to determine the will and preference of the person in care is.  One of the main safeguards we are looking to, and something we have made clear in all our communications on this issue, is the implementation of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Its title is a bit of a mouthful but the legislation is all about ensuring that people who wish to rent out their homes are supported in being able to do so and have someone on hand who will work with them as a decision-maker to reach the extremely important decision that will have many consequences for them downstream.</p> <p>  The other aspect of this is something that Age Friend Ireland representatives told to us about signposting, namely, that older people will not do anything in this regard unless it is made easier for them to do so.  Once all of this is in place, we will have to consider, as a group, how we can help older people to understand what we would like them to do, the implications of doing that and how they might go about it.</p><p>All of that is very important in helping them take that decision.  As the Deputy mentioned, when communicating about this it is so important not to, in essence, spook people in this regard.  We do not want to make people think we are trying to take their houses from them.  We have to do this in a very careful and considered manner that is respectful of the residents.  Overall, the Department is separately working on the adult safeguarding policy, which will also bring in consideration of risk assessments. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#E00300"><p>This is a very important topic.  It is probably an area that does not necessarily get the focus it needs.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct.  There are some excellent examples of schemes throughout the country, not least in my county.  He referenced St. John's College and the significant <i>ad hoc </i>work being done by organisations on the ground in communities, but there is less of an overarching structure to it, which is necessary.  As we see an ageing of our population, and the projections to 2051 are that we will have an additional 1.7 million people over the age of 65, we have to address that and grasp that we have an under-provision of rightsizing options in our State.</p><p>I want to tease this out with the departmental officials.  Other than H and A zonings, is there a case to be made that we now need to look at specific zonings in respect of older persons or at least specific guidance on making decisions on planning applications?  As the officials know, local authorities are being pushed into making decisions on higher density.  That is laudable and there for a reason.  We have a specific amount of zoned land we need to maximise, but perhaps 35 houses per hectare in Waterford is not appropriate when providing a particular scheme, yet it has to be adjudicated on from a planning perspective that is being driven by densities.  What is the thinking in the Department on how we can address that issue in the context of the drive for density and the need to make provision for older persons' accommodation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.293" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Timmons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#E00400"><p>One of the things to mention in respect of planning and local authorities, and how to help them to plan where to put their older people's housing, is we have made significant progress.  One of the working groups from the four working groups under the housing options for ageing population policy looked very specifically at that.  At the time, it looked at where that housing should be brought forward.  Should it be in urban or rural settings and where is the divide?  That led us to a very interesting place to do with geographic information system mapping and what we can use it for.  We can take all the information we have, such as where all the services and older people are, and identify the location that would serve the best interests of the older people.  We are developing a tool for local authorities to score and rate development potential of particular sites.  That will help them to plan for where they should put their older people's housing.  That is one of the ways they can bring that forward.<br/><br/>On specific zonings and density, I am not sure density is the issue <i>per se</i>.  We could have a conversation about that, but it is about raising the awareness of planners about what makes a good older persons' development, why it is necessary in the area, what could be attractive about that, and what the needs are.  The housing and planning departments of each local authority have to communicate on that front.  That is maybe moving us back to the housing strategy being the key part of the work that needs to be done so that everybody sees the importance of it in the first place.  I am not sure a specific zone is required or that we should necessarily be prescriptive about density.  Sometimes apartments can work very well for older people if they are well designed and have good principles behind them.  I would not say every development should be the same, but I can see what the Senator is saying about keeping in mind the overarching need for older people's housing. </p></speech>

When we think of older persons accommodation we think straightaway of the bungalow but that is not necessarily the most appropriate land use.  We have excellent schemes and St. John's College in Waterford is one of those.  There is a scheme in Manor Hill, Waterford, that consists of 71 units to be delivered through the repair and lease scheme, which will be predominantly geared to older persons.</p><p>To take it a little further, we are predominantly talking about local authorities and people who are in social housing provision.  I consistently get queries.  A developer is looking at developing a small scheme for the private sector in the context of rightsizing in Waterford at present, and the second it was put out there the phone just rang off the hook.  Cork city has a scheme where the council purchases private property and gives a guarantee of lifetime tenure within an older person's scheme but that is more an <i>ad hoc</i>thing it has developed.  The officials can correct me if I am wrong.  Perhaps there needs to be a national overarching policy for that because I would like to see us freeing up more private housing stock for young families to move into, such as three- and four-bedroom homes, when those properties are no longer suitable for older people.  It has to come back to that person's decision, of course.  Nobody is saying anybody is being forced out.  It has to be that person's decision but from the engagement I have had in my locality it is very much something that is in demand.  We need to get that mix between the private and the social side of it.  There needs to be an overarching policy.  Cork city is doing something quite good in that space.  The officials might be able to elaborate on it.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator.  Last year, Age Friendly Ireland did some very good work for local authorities on rightsizing, including developing a guide to rightsizing.  All of this is available on the Age Friendly Homes website that we and the Department of Health jointly sponsor.  The Housing Agency is involved in that as well.  Age Friendly Ireland has put together a rightsizing template for local authorities that is particularly to do with social housing and considers many of the issues the Senator talked about.  This year, we will try to take that more national overarching view in our national rightsizing policy.  The team is working on that at present.  It will be developed over the next couple of months.  There will be consultation to enable all those views about the right way to promote it to be put into that policy and to try to come forward with some ideas about what people need to enable that.</p> <p>  I am delighted to hear private developers are coming forward and demand-----</p></speech>

I am from County Limerick.  I was a councillor for six years and was then elected to the D&aacute;il.  I have been in construction all my life and had elderly parents, God rest them.  We are talking about Housing for All and housing for the elderly, but there is no infrastructure in Limerick to build any of the houses the officials are talking about.  I will give them a brief synopsis of the situation in County Limerick.</p> <p>  At present, the Government can deliver 53 houses in Limerick city this year.  It cannot deliver any houses in County Limerick at present because there is inadequate water.  I could deliver 70 houses this year in Croom if I had water supply.  I could deliver houses in Hospital if there was sewerage capacity, of which there is none.  I could deliver houses in Askeaton, if I had sewerage capacity, which has been waiting for an upgrade, for 40 years.  Dromcolliher has been waiting 15 years for a sewerage supply.  There is fantastic housing for the elderly in Athlacca.  It is a fantastic facility.  I was there many times and grew up around there, but there is no capacity to build more.  Not everyone lives in the city.  People live in County Limerick, in rural towns and villages and in rural areas, but there is no infrastructure because of the failure of previous Governments to invest in infrastructure in the counties.</p> <p>  We are talking about Housing for All, but everything coming out of here seems to be housing for cities.  It is not coming for the counties.  If we are about Housing for All, then it should be for all.</p><p>That means investment needs to be made in infrastructure in the likes of Counties Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  Infrastructure is key and that is what Housing for All should involve so that is what I would like to see included in it.  We also have people living in towns and villages in rural areas who want to sell their houses and downsize.  There is no infrastructure in the countryside so they want to buy smaller sites, build smaller houses and be nearer to their community but the planning authority states the case that if someone has a house then he or she does not need a house and so he or she does not qualify to build a smaller house.  If someone is in a rural area then he or she does not qualify for a second house because those are the planning laws.</p><p> I welcome everything the Department can do but I am looking for their help when it comes to housing for all people, whether they are in the city or the countryside.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, is only investing in infrastructure and housing in Limerick city and unless people live within 15 minutes of the city.  That precludes two-thirds of County Limerick, including Newcastle West, which has a population of more than 4,000 people and Kilmallock, which has a population of 3,000.  This needs to be assessed county by county.  Not everyone is in a local authority house and the biggest problem we have is that we do not have the infrastructure to carry out the fantastic plans the Department has for housing for our elderly people.  What can the Department do to address that for the people of County Limerick?</p></speech>

The Town Centre First policy is quite focused on rural areas and I have a rural perspective on this myself; I am not a city person.  The Town Centre First policy is mentioned in Housing for All and one of the important parts of that is making sites available in the smaller towns and areas where people might want to move.  That will facilitate one of the scenarios the Deputy raised where some people will want to sell their rural houses and move to the outskirts of a town where they will have a little more access to infrastructure like primary care services, GP services or-----</p></speech>

People live in small villages where there is no infrastructure so if you are an elderly person, for example, you have lived your whole life in a village or a small town where there is no infrastructure to carry out what I am talking about.  Then you are being offered to move 20 miles away where there is elderly housing.  That takes people away from the friends and families they have built up around them over a lifetime.  That does not address towns and villages.  There is no infrastructure for the towns and villages to do what the Department wants to do.  With the greatest of respect I am a rural person and I have lived outside of the villages and towns.  I live in a parish with 396 people and there is no infrastructure in the village.  In Banogue village, where I was born, there is no infrastructure.  I do not want to move 20 miles away or have people in my community have to move 20 miles away as they will lose the network of people they have gone to mass with and met at the shop.  That is not housing for all and that is not covering everyone in County Limerick.  What is happening here is that the towns and villages do not have the infrastructure.  We only have three towns in County Limerick that have infrastructure; the rest of them are gone.  The local authorities know about this and now they are looking at putting plans in place for infrastructure that will not include two-thirds of County Limerick.  I need the Department to help me to highlight this to the Government.</p></speech>

It is a key partner for infrastructure, along with electricity and so on.  We included Irish Water in our overall structures.  Under the Housing for All governance structure Irish Water comes in to report regularly to the public sector delivery group.  It is making further provision for housing, it is prioritising it in every way possible and we are adequately funding it do so.  I take the Deputy's point that infrastructure is a serious difficulty and the Department's ambition is to bring forward supply as quickly as possible.  That is one of the key areas we need to tackle.  We have heard the message and we have delivered it firmly to Irish Water, which is collaborating with us to try to make a change.

Did the officials know that the biggest polluters in this country are the local authorities?  All the surveys that have been done show that the biggest polluters in this country are the local authorities because of the lack of infrastructure and funding from Government to invest in our towns and villages</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has never really co-ordinated the opportunities there are for developers in downsizing and in older persons' housing.  One of the critical mistakes the Minister made was not applying the bulk fund for investors in properties that were coming onto the market to apartments and that will hit older people who are looking to downsize.  Apartments, particularly in suburban areas, are perfect for people who want security, a smaller footprint to manage and access to lifts or ground floors.  It is a real shame that institutional investors are still able to bulk-buy apartments and that will particularly affect the older population.</p> <p>  I also want to make a couple of points on Dublin city, where I come from, and the number of build to rent properties there as opposed to apartments.  I know friends of mine whose parents have moved into apartments because they were not able to manage their houses.  They are happy there, it is a good, safe and secure way for them to live and they know they have all the services there.  In Dublin and particularly in my area we are simply seeing build to rent properties being built and that denies older people the opportunity to downsize as build to rent properties do not have proper storage or balcony facilities.  The Department should consider harmonising the build to buy and build to rent standards because we need to make sure that in years to come housing will be flexible and can be changed.  What might be a house for one generation might end up being a group of apartments for another generation and we need to ensure that what is being built is flexible in that way.  The tendency has been for the developers to want to pull down everything and then build something else.  We cannot do that with the carbon emissions that come from building and housing and I ask that the Department consider harmonising those standards.</p> <p>  In my questions I want to focus on renters and on older people who are renting.  There is a generation of people who are of pension age, who have paid off their mortgages, who have pensions and who do not have to worry about housing costs but in the not too distant future we will have a generation of people for whom housing costs will make up more than what their pensions will be.  How does the Department see this matter developing in the coming years and what future planning is it doing for older people renting and spending their entire pensions on rent?  While we can talk about downsizing and trying to get people into more appropriate housing and while we can adopt a strategy for same, we need to have a look at the older persons' rental crisis that is coming down the line and developing.  To what extent does the Department see the intake in the fair deal scheme reducing in the coming years because of people renting in older age and because of the reduction in home ownership?  Has the impact that paying for fair deal will have on the Department of Health been costed?</p> <p>  I refer to rightsizing.  Has the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage costed giving people either bridging loans, tax incentives or a clawback of capital gains tax after death?  I have a number of people who are in a difficult financial situation but who own an asset.  The Department is looking at private companies and we know that in the UK some of those companies have behaved unethically towards older people who do not have the wherewithal to know what they are signing at the time.  Is there potential for a local authority home loan, which Deputy McAuliffe addressed?  I will let those questions be asked and not ask my last question.</p></speech>

It is a good point to make that we need to make more apartments available for owner-occupiers, particularly in our urban areas.</p><p>We launched the cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe scheme today which will incentivise the development of apartments in urban areas.  It is designed to bring forward apartments of four storeys or more in urban centres, which is in all of our cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  It will look at the gap between the development cost of apartments, which is very high, and the sales price to owner occupiers, which is one of the reasons that they are not available for owner occupiers.  It is simply not economical currently for developers to bring these forward.  That scheme is specifically designed to bring up to and over 5,000 apartments for sale to owner occupiers over the next few years.  That is one way in which Housing for All is addressing that particular point.</p><p> On renters and older people, Senator Moynihan is making an interesting point.  Approximately 84% of older people own their own homes and we have a very high percentage of such ownership in the country.  The phenomenon of older people renting is a relatively new phenomenon.  A very high percentage of older people also own their property without a mortgage.  It is probably one of the wealthier cohorts but we will see a small percentage coming to the social housing waiting list and we are looking at that.  It is still a very small percentage of the overall list and local authorities are good at dealing with that and in providing housing for older people.  We need to keep an eye on that to ensure that we are planning for provision for the future.</p><p> The same outlets for supply, and for the supply of affordable accommodation in particular, apply to older people, equally, as they do to anybody else.  We need to bring cost rental forward at scale together with affordable housing and a supply of social housing for those who would be eligible for such housing, and ensure that it is available for older people.  </p><p> The same avenues which address the wider housing crisis will also address housing for older people who are finding difficulties with their rent.  Older people are also eligible to apply for social housing, as it stands, if their income qualifies them for that and can also get housing assistance payment.  The tools are there to address this issue and it is a question of incorporating that into our planning as we go forward where we have a higher percentage, potentially, in that rental market.</p><p> On right-sizing, I hear the Senator&rsquo;s points.  I made points earlier on bringing forward that right-sizing policy, which I would expect will address the Senator&rsquo;s points there.</p></speech>

One issue which is brought up with me a great deal by older residents in my constituency is exactly as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has stated, which is that some people want to stay in their family home.  They have a long and strong emotional connection there, with all of their memories.  They completely want that and this needs to be supported.  Others fully want to move to something which they feel is more appropriate to their needs.  It is a great frustration to them to see all of these build-to-rent apartments being built which they cannot and do not even have an option of buying.  There is a problem of reduced standards but there is also the problem of not having the security of moving from homeownership to renting then.  This is not something that they would be interested in.  The best way to address that would be through ensuring that there was enough affordable purchase apartments.  That would be a much better use of resources than the giving of subsidies to developers.</p> <p>  On that issue which was brought up earlier, if one looks at Vienna, one of the reasons that it was able to do a great deal of cost rental and to bring it to completion at a good cost was because there was affordable housing zoning, so that it could provide much more affordable accommodation for people, including for older people.  Has affordable zonings or zonings specific for elderly people been considered because there is good practice in other countries?  Could this be put in rather than more subsidies for developers looking for higher prices?  That would be a much more cost-effective way of delivering.  I ask that Ms Timmons might address that point.</p> <p>  On the fair deal scheme and the proposals that are coming forward, what is the timeframe on that and when are these likely to be implemented?  Is it that the homeowners will need to register with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and that full tenancy rights will apply?  The point made by Ms Larthwell about signposting and making things easier for people is a key one.  Many people will not, if they have not been a landlord before, want to manage this.  They could go to a letting agent but if there was a particular pathway also, for example, for some not-for-profit approved housing bodies to perhaps manage that, that might take much of the worry and risk away for some people.  Has that been considered and have the proposals which such groups as Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation have worked on, where it has looked at where homes could be managed by not-for-profit bodies, been looked at and considered?  What are the thoughts of the Departments on those proposals?  These are my main questions.</p></speech>

I will start my replies on the issue of staying in the family home, which is a very good point.  The whole of our joint policy is about ageing in place and of giving people options, where if they want to stay, they can.  The Deputy is right in that some people, a small proportion, will need an option to move on.  I agree with the Deputy that apartments should also be coming through the affordable housing space.  A good deal of affordable housing is coming through the pipeline and some of these will definitely be apartments.  Local authorities and the Land Development Agency, LDA, are all being told that it is certainly not all about one&rsquo;s traditional three-bed, semi-detached house and that it is also certainly about apartments.  These can be very suitable and can really work for cost rental and could be ideal for older people who are looking for somewhere which gives them security of tenure for the foreseeable future and a stabilised rent.</p> <p>  I do not want to give the impression that the private space is the only way in which to bring this forward but we are certainly bringing this through the affordable housing space also.  </p> <p>  Local authorities are being encouraged to look at density and the funding available for suitably dense, apartment-driven developments in any urban areas.  I hope to see that coming through.</p> <p>  On the affordable-----</p></speech>

The idea of these very high quality housing schemes for older people with services, facilities and activities are very successful and attractive.  These can be facilitated if some land is zoned specifically for that use.  If it is an up-zoning, it increases the value.  Otherwise, in a full residential zoning, investors are always going to go for the best return and providing such housing may not be the best return.  Has that been considered?</p></speech>

When we had walked through the Vienna concept, it is certainly just the cost rental costs that the Deputy will have seen.  I have not seen it coming through into planning as affordable zoning as we do not zone for tenure-type, as things stand.  I do not know if there has been any consideration in the Department of that.  I can check when I return to the Department if there have been any particular moves on that front but I am not aware of any at the moment.</p></speech>

We are looking at the timeframe at the moment.  The legislation is being developed as we speak and is being brought through, I believe, in the SIRI Bill.  Forgive me, I am not in housing, and I cannot remember what that stands for.  That will be brought through before the summer.  On implementation, we have two dependencies.  One is, as I have mentioned before, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act.  We do not want to bring this measure in before that Act is fully enacted.  We understand that there is a very strong push on now to get that in place and fully enacted by the summer session also.  That should not be a limiting factor.</p> <p>  The other limiting factor is probably the impact on the HSE.  The HSE&rsquo;s systems, unfortunately, are simply not designed to track rental income, that is, that dynamic movement of income where typically a person has one assessment and three years later, one may have another assessment if one is still on the scheme, but that is about the totality of it.  We will need to put a great deal of different systems and processes in place with the HSE with, possibly, some amendment to their financial IT systems.  That, in itself, may take a bit of time but we are very committed to doing this.  One of the things that has been emphasised very strongly by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and indeed by Government, is that this is a measure that is expected to be in place and to start delivering as soon as possible.  That is where our focus is.</p> <p>  On the RTB, the tenancy rights and the other interesting proposals the Deputy raised, in developing the scheme we considered having a preferential rate which would apply to social housing or to people in receipt of housing supports but it is not something that we were able to pursue for various complex reasons.  That is why we have gone with the flat rate of 40% across the board.</p> <p>  From the point of view of the fair deal scheme, we are agnostic about what the source of the income is.  We are working, however, to ensure that within the legislation, there will be a couple more categories other than just private landlords who are registered with the RTB, in order to ensure that we can also facilitate social housing models.</p></speech>

As my colleague Ms Larthwell has said, this is being considered as a Committee Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill, which is commencing on 16 May.</p><p>In addition, it is being drafted to allow for not just private tenancies, but also local authority, approved housing bodies and other providers as well, to make it as expansive as possible.

This is a particularly interesting topic.  For so long we have talked about reforming the fair deal scheme to unlock, if you like, more housing within the rental market.  The fact that we all know that there is a massive deficit in this country of older people-specific housing is just a huge issue.  It is something that we, as a committee, need to shine a light on.  I am very pleased to have officials from both of the relevant Departments here today to do exactly that and bring their expertise to the fore.</p> <p>  I have listened with interest to what Ms Timmons said around the housing need and demand assessments, HNDAs and the fact that in respect of future planning, local authorities will now be not just asked, but mandated and required to have targets and policies that allow for right-sizing that support our older people who might like to downsize or move to an older person-specific housing accommodation, ideally, as other speakers have said, in villages where access to local services, medical services, shops and support is very easy for them.  That is a very long-term statement.  That is what is so frustrating for so many of us who have been in local government for so long prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  While there are some very good innovative examples of where this has worked throughout Ireland, it is painfully slow.  I appreciate that the HNDA reports will be the catalyst and framework for giving us the parameters of building all of this into our plans.  However, again, it just seems like that information is coming now and not necessarily in tandem with development plans that have the ink is drying on them at this stage in many local authorities up and down the country.  I suppose I am just concerned about that.  I would love to hear Ms Timmons&rsquo;s view on the targets and how they should be set and managed, and how we can plan for older people's accommodation to be delivered in local towns and village across Ireland in the short- to medium-term, rather than just the long-term. </p> <p>  I refer to the Department of Health.  It is very encouraging that we are now getting information from the Minister that the fair deal scheme will be changed to enable people who would otherwise be losing 80% of their rental income to incentivise them to rent out their home through the new 40% statistic.  That is quite an important thing when looking at housing in the context of the Ukrainians, who in so many hundreds and thousands are coming to our shores.  We need to be there to make sure that we are providing short-term as well as long-term offerings for them.  The fair deal scheme has the potential to unlock a huge amount of housing relatively quickly.</p> <p>  I was quite concerned to hear the figure that 70% of people who are availing of the fair deal scheme have dementia.  I know that adds complexities to all of this.  We want to make sure that there are safeguards there so that no older person feel they are forced in any way, shape or form to rent out their home.  That is not what this is about.  This is about incentivising those who wish to do so by allowing them to reap the financial rewards because, ultimately, they do not at the moment. </p> <p>  ALONE and a number of other organisations, many of which will be coming in later today, have done a bit of research in that area.  I do not know if it is possible for Ms Timmons to answer this question, but does she get any sense that there will likely be an issue around the homes that are owned by people who are in fair deal nursing home schemes in respect of rental regulations and the homes not being up to standard or scratch in terms of all of the regulations that we now require through the Residential Tenancies Board?</p></speech>

Sometimes developments can take years to come to fruition.  However, it is interesting that, when one gets a more global view of what has been going on over the years, there has actually been loads of small developments.  They are not necessarily at scale, but they are there.  Interestingly, when we were talking to the Irish Council for Social Housing recently, it was looking at nearly 9,000 units of older people&rsquo;s accommodation that it identified that AHBs are running at the minute.  There is actually quite a bit of scale there, it is just not easily identifiable perhaps.  It seems slow, but there is progress on it and we are kind of making progress in the local authority sector in particular on it.  There is pipeline on that.</p> <p>  In terms of the planning for it, I agree with the Deputy that it needs to come through the HNDA.  The housing areas of the local authorities need to be aware of the demographics.  One way they can do that is by looking at the HNDA repository on our website, which will give a full view of an area&rsquo;s demographics out for a space of a number of years.  They can see how many in their population will be over 65 and they can think about it from that space.  As I said earlier, they can then translate that into housing delivery action plans.  They can set their targets in respect of older people, in particular in social housing developments and what they may need to do, and they can think about where they should plan them.</p> <p>  There is a very good example in Kells of using vacancy as another element.  One does not just have to do social housing.  There is a development in Kells that Meath Count Council is bringing through.  It is using some vacant housing as part of the older people&rsquo;s housing that it is bringing forward there.  One can use many different tools to bring forward older people&rsquo;s housing.  That is a very good development.  I will give my colleagues time to come back on the other question.</p></speech>

We understand from Age Friendly Ireland that about 31% of older adults report moderate to major problems in housing.  We have engaged ALONE, which provided us with a submission as well.  It indicated that about half of people over 50 have some kind of issue with their housing and nearly 10% have a sort of critical difficulty in keeping the housing warm if they are older.  We think that will be a challenge.  At the end of the day, if a person is going into care because their needs are such that they cannot look after themselves in their own home, it is highly likely that they will have had difficulty maintaining that home as well.  That is something we are expecting.  The initial six-month period that have to kind of test this all out will give us a bit of a view as to how quickly those homes actually start to materialise.</p></speech>

The reason I am saying that is because obviously then the signposting to make sure that the owner of the property who may want to rent out knows what all of those things are is very important.</p> <p>  One of the concerns I have is around the fact that we know one of the reasons a large of number accidental and semi-professional landlords are leaving is because they have realised how much work it is to be a landlord.  It is not a passive investment.  It takes a lot of active, hands-on work.  Obviously, that is not something the fair deal recipient will be able to do and their extended family members may not as well.  Is there also an option, for example, with the provision, whether it is of social housing or public transitional accommodations, for an AHB, rather than placing the owner of the property as a landlord in conjunction with the folks who deal with leasing in the local authorities, there could some leasing-type arrangement, albeit on the shorter time horizon like RAS, where the management of the property is actually taken over by an AHB, for example?  That might be a way of facilitating greater ability of people to access the scheme if they so choose.</p><p>Again, I do not believe anything in the Department's amendments would preclude that, but signposting and encouraging it might take some collaboration between the Departments.  That is my first question.</p><p> I will go back to Ms Timmons for my second question, which is on McAuley Place because I was very taken by it when I was in Naas.  I do not know if Ms Timmons has been there but it is an old historic building that was handed over by a religious order and then converted into a caf&eacute;, community centre and residential units.  Apartments were also built at the back.  Most of this was done with charitable funding.  It is funded through that weird and wonderful thing, capital assistance scheme-rental accommodation scheme, CAS-RAS, funding.  I am sure Ms Timmons is one of the few people in the world who fully understands that.  The difficulty for that facility is generating a revenue stream to keep it going.  Because the Department does not fund the non-residential element and because there can be problems with having some private renters living in the development to generate some surplus income to recycle back into it, this is the kind of project that probably would not have got off the ground if it had not been for a lot of bending of rules and determined flexibility, which the system does not always allow.  What can Ms Timmons say on the Department's future approach to CAS-RAS projects, if such a thing is permissible these days?  That would facilitate developments of this type.  What is wonderful about McAuley Place and the Respond development at St. John's College is that, by refurbishing existing buildings, carbon emissions are kept low and an important part of the urban neighbourhood is regenerated.  However, such projects do require flexibility beyond just a CAS allocation or a capital advance leasing facility, CALF, allocation.  How flexible can the Department be with approved housing bodies, AHBs, or other community groups to get these kinds of end results?</p></speech>

I understand it has tea rooms, an arts and culture centre and so on.  A lot of volunteers are engaged in that particular project.  I am not familiar with how the project is funded so I will not comment on it specifically, but I will say we have been looking for an exemplar project to tell us how to keep these projects going in future.  I believe St. Michael's will tell us quite a bit about how properly to fund housing with supports.  Both Departments will probably be involved in that.  We do a lot as regards putting the infrastructure in place and building the actual housing.  Wrap-around supports need to be put in afterwards and the AHB needs to keep it going.  In the case of St. Michael's, that AHB will be Circle Voluntary Housing Association and ALONE, which will be acting as the support.  It will be interesting to see if that model will come through as the preferred model for doing this in future because I do not have an answer for the Deputy today as to how it should work.  It is definitely something we want to explore as we move forward.  Perhaps Ms Larthwell would like to comment on this matter as well.</p></speech>

With regard to the signposting and communication with residents, it is a very interesting idea and something the Department of Health would be in favour of.  When schemes are operated by local authorities, there are far more opportunities to ensure those safeguarding touchpoints are included and that everything everybody is doing has the consent and preference of the resident at its heart.  That is really important.  The difficulties arise because, as I know from real life, the HAP can be a bit longer term and approximately one eighth of residents pass within six months, more than a quarter do not stay longer than a year and at least two thirds spend less than three years in the scheme.  Something that also involves inheritors would therefore probably have to be looked at.  There may also be interaction with the nursing home loan.  Approximately one quarter of the people in the scheme who have a house have a nursing home loan, which is secured against the house and becomes due once a person passes away.  Those kinds of implications would also have to be thought about but it is something we would be quite interested in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#J00900"><p>While it is no consolation for the tenant, I should say that HAP and RAS landlords can exit lease agreements, for example, on the grounds of sale, even within those two or four years.  For me, a more interesting idea relates to the long-term leasing run by the Department and local authorities.  This allows people essentially not to be landlords while remaining the property owner.  Such people lease the property to the local authority or AHB for a long term.  A not-for-profit body like the North and East Housing Association is often brought in to manage the property and the tenancy.  If there was a way to combine that package with the flexibility of HAP and RAS, for the reasons the witnesses have outlined, it might provide a more viable option for some families who would like to go down that route but where nobody in the family has the ability and wherewithal to be a landlord.</p> <p>  The witnesses also made the very important point that we need to think about the tenants on the other side of this.  We do not want 1,000 fair deal properties coming into the market and then exiting a year later.  That is not a long-term gain for the family, the owner or the tenant.  A combination of the support of long-term leasing with the flexibility of the short-term lease might be an option.  I say that with the caveat that tenants need security of tenure as well but we have to live in the real world.  If that is not something that is being discussed, I would encourage people to do so.  Because I again suspect the Department's amendments would not preclude any of that, it is something that could be agreed and signposted by the Department after the legislation is enacted.</p></speech>

In the case of the owner of the property passing and a debt being due to the HSE under the fair deal scheme, would such a debt be due immediately or would consideration be given to the fact there is a tenant in the property?  Can some flexibility be given in that regard?  Has there been a conversation around this?  I am treading very carefully because I do not like even the nature of this discussion but the witnesses can see the question I am asking.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting debate and it is timely and important we have it here.  I will preface my contribution by saying I started to read Richard Osman's <i>The Man Who Died Twice</i>at the weekend.  For those who do not know, the protagonists live in a retirement village.  In that book, there is an awful lot of wine and an awful lot of pizza, so I look forward to the Departments' plans coming to fruition in approximately 20 years' time.</p><p>On a more serious note, the plight of the elderly is a hidden aspect of our housing crisis.  Everybody in this room will have been out canvassing and come to the home of an old person who just wants to talk.  I always say it is indicative of how lonely people are when they want to talk to a politician, but that is the reality.  In many cases, we may be the only person they have seen that week.  That situation was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic.  Some local authorities have done well down through the years.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the clusters of houses.  It is my personal view this does not work.  We probably have a view of young people in one place and then a cluster of houses together, but I do not believe that works.  The Sue Ryder Foundation has a community for people with Alzheimer's disease in Bruff, where additional supports are provided.  There is a real crisis looming but it also presents us with an opportunity within the area of housing.  In many respects, the officials are probably ahead of the politicians in the work they have done.  It may have been remiss of us not to have taken more detailed note of what they have been doing because there is a real opportunity there for us.</p><p>I have some questions.  With regard to the provisions of the nursing home support scheme, most of these homes will not be up to the standard required to let them.  If somebody has to go around and ask John, Michael and Marty to put up a few bob to get the house ready to rent out, that will be very divisive.  Can we provide within the scheme for some kind of grant, which could then be recouped when the house is sold?  With my hand on my heart, I can say that none of these homes will be up to the standard required to let them.  That is one query for the witnesses.</p><p>The witnesses have spoken a lot about rightsizing.  The tenant purchase scheme has been very successful for us.  We made a change earlier in the year whereby people in receipt of the State pension can now opt to buy out their home.</p><p>There is a downside for people who successfully bought out the home under the tenant purchase scheme and would like to downsize, because there is no opportunity to since they have ended up in their own home and are automatically precluded from downsizing.  We need to look at this.  The witnesses mentioned something to Deputy McAuliffe earlier.  Will they expand on that?  Unfortunately, I missed that section.</p><p> It is great to see all the different agencies here today.  We need something collective and radical for housing for the elderly in the future.  Greater input is needed from the Department of Health.  Some work has been done on that.  In Longford, we recently appointed an old-age liaison officer in conjunction with Westmeath.  It is one of the best initiatives that we have seen.  Visits are made to people's houses and small, incremental improvement works are done, which is great to see, and we need more of it.  We need something radical, such as what Senator Cummins mentioned.  We need a mix of private approved housing bodies and local authorities coming together.</p><p> We also have to look at the challenge that care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities have.  In many cases, the primary carers are over 70 years old.  Challenges will arise related to Down's syndrome and dementia, which will feed into our housing policy over the next 20 to 30 years.  It will be an additional challenge that will require a smart living solution.  The Vienna model is very good.  At a risk of sounding like Deputy O'Donoghue, there is an urban-rural divide.  Cost rental will not work out in the sticks in Limerick and it will certainly not work in rural Longford.  We need something.  The Vienna model is great and it will certainly work in Dublin and large cities but not in the country.  I hope the witnesses picked up on what I asked and I would appreciate if they could reply in the two minutes left.</p></speech>

People can currently only access that grant if they are living in the house.  If we made a slight change so that people could access the grant if they are in a nursing home, provided they rent out the property, that would be a ready solution.  That grant would be up to &euro;30,000, which may not be needed in most cases.  That is a ready and immediate solution that could be tapped into.</p></speech>

We can certainly examine that point.  I would need to think about it more, but we can talk to our colleagues in the Department of Health and see where we go with that.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the tenant purchase scheme.  A positive amendment was made to that.  We talked about the financial contribution scheme earlier, which is run by some local authorities.  It enables people to downsize from a private house, which they sell to the local authority, and to move into social housing.  There may be options in that regard for people who have bought under the tenant purchase scheme once they get permission to sell from the local authority.  The Deputy's point on the urban-rural divide is well made and noted.  I echo his points on Longford and Monaghan.  Age Friendly Ireland is spreading out, with regional managers, and a person in each local authority who is key to developing awareness and progressing housing for older people.

It has been an interesting debate.  I acknowledge the substantial work and progress around the country.  Deputy Flaherty referred to the hidden plight of older people in housing.  I will focus on the plight of older people in the specific category about which I have a particular concern.  Rather than ask too many questions, I ask the witnesses to give feedback on some issues I would like to touch on.  We know older members of the Traveller community are a group towards whom the Irish housing stock cannot fulfil its requirements or meet its obligations.  It is a vulnerable group, especially the older people.  Older members of the migrant community face issues.  There is a large migrant community in Ireland, which is ever-growing.  There are major challenges and yet they are low in the pecking order, from my experience of meeting members of community.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of older people with disabilities.  Over 36% of persons aged 65 or over in Ireland were reported as having a disability in 2016.  I know that is some time ago.  They are more likely to live alone and not to have a job.  They need extra supports.  This group is particularly vulnerable.  They are more vulnerable when they are elderly.  Older women in Ireland are disproportionately likely to live alone, going by the statistics provided to us.  They are vulnerable people.  There are significant challenges in getting suitable housing for the five groups I have mentioned living in parts of rural Ireland compared with those in urban Ireland.  It is a problem everywhere, but it is a bigger problem in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I flagged those five groups.  I do not doubt the witnesses recognise that through their own work, but what are we doing for these groups?  How can we bring in extra, focused or targeted measures that will address older persons with disabilities, older women living on their own, older members of the migrant community and older members of the Traveller community?  There is an added problem in rural Ireland.  Are there focus groups?  What do the witnesses think should happen?  What is happening behind the scenes to focus on these groups?</p></speech>

That covers much of the ground the Senator is looking at, so we will start there.  Flowing from that, disability steering groups in local authorities address housing.  That looks at the population and the age profile of those with disabilities as well as what housing they need.  The Senator is right that there is a relationship between disability and older people that we need to recognise.  Universal design needs to be brought in.  In Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, we looked at the question of universal design.  We are trying to make progress on that with the National Disability Authority, to bring forward a cost-benefit analysis related to incorporating universal principles into social housing.  It is important we understand the cost and benefits of progressing that.  Universally designed housing is not specifically for a cohort the Senator mentioned, but it could be used for any of the cohorts he mentioned.  If he is looking for a specific measure that would cover each person, I would say that all of them will be designed for older people.</p><p>The Senator is right, though, that for older members of the Travelling community that could be slightly more complex.  We have provided a budget of &euro;18 million for capital works for Traveller accommodation.  It is important that local authorities look at how many of those projects are for older people.  Whether the preference is for Traveller-specific accommodation or, as in many cases, social housing proper, which is absolutely fine, it is important that local authorities understand themselves what the need in the locality is.  The HNDA provides for them doing that level of work.  The local authority and its Age Friendly Ireland officer should be aware of the demographics of the older population in that local authority.  That information should be supplied to the local authorities in order that they make the decisions with the categories in mind as well as what they might need to cater to.</p><p> As for the migrant community and older women, all social housing that comes through for older people will apply to them as well.  It is not necessarily that they need something specifically different; it is just that we need more of it to provide for them.  That comes back to the supply factor, promoting the supply of housing generally, which the whole of pathway 3 of Housing for All does.  That can address any older person who is in the market.  Then it is a matter of promoting more generally the supply of social housing, which, of course, can be allocated to older people as well as any other category of person.  It is not just about developments specifically for older people; it is about all social housing such that there are options for people in their local areas if they need social housing.</p><p> Senator Boyhan's point about rural Ireland has been accepted a number of times.  Obviously, this is not just about the city dwellers.  We can look at that as well.</p><p> I think Ms McArdle wants to come in on some of the community aspects so I will hand over to her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#L00200"><p>I thank Ms Timmons and Senator Boyhan.  To add to what Ms Timmons said, the Department of Health works very closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the agencies on joint delivery and joint design.  We are very much supportive of and involved in the Housing for All programme, in particular for people with disabilities or particular vulnerabilities.</p> <p>  As for the community response, it is really important to consider the role home support plays in supporting people with disabilities and older people who are frail or who need support.  The home support budget is based on need rather than the fact of coming from a particular group.  It is open to all and based on assessed need.  The Department of Health, through the HSE, funds to the level of &euro;670 million per annum home support that enables people to live well and safely in their own homes.  That is very important, picking up on the point Ms Timmons raised about the universal design and the appropriate future-proofing of future accommodation, aligned with the community-based supports such as home support or those provided through the community healthcare networks.  The integrated healthcare programmes for older people are resourced out in the community.  Together, I think those two pieces will make a variety of choices and safe options available to older people as they age.</p></speech>

That will bring us up to 4.57 p.m., ahead of our 5 o'clock meeting with the approved housing bodies.  You might have three minutes, Deputy Gould.  I will try to squeeze you in if I can between Senator Seery Kearney and me, but I remind Members that we will have the organisations housing older people before us at 5 p.m.</p> <p>  The point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made about the changes to the fair deal scheme is interesting.  There are the financial changes, but some of the reasons people are put off by or resistant to it are emotional, some are about their connections to their home and some are about not yet being ready to think about that home as not being the family home.  Some of the reasons are logistical and relate to the practicalities of renting the home, dealing with the tax return and all those issues.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes a valid point that while the changes to the fair deal scheme are crucial, local authorities could play a role in trying to support the transition or the administration around it.  They could do that in a way that supports that delivery.</p> <p>  The financial contribution scheme I spoke about earlier is another one of the factors many people raise with me.  People come to me with houses worth &euro;300,000 and tell me they want to participate in the local authority financial contribution scheme, whereby they give 40% of the value of the house to the council and then move into a one-bedroom home that they might have to wait some time for.  I often say to them that that is &euro;120,000 they will have to give to the local authority and that they might be better buying an apartment on the open market and not giving that &euro;120,000 to the council.  Often the main reason they say they want to go down the route of the financial contribution scheme is that they do not want to have to engage with a solicitor or an auctioneer and do not want to put the house up for sale.  We should consider that.  The benefit of the financial contribution scheme is not just the financial element of it or the access to great public housing that is our senior citizen schemes; it is also the transition and the process of the transition.  For both those schemes, I would like the Department to consider the management of the hassle, if I may put it in those terms, and how we can make them simpler.</p> <p>  We talk about the huge demand for senior citizen schemes when they arise.  When communities see them being built, there is lots of interest and they ask whether they are eligible.  Many people are not eligible for senior citizen accommodation.  I was joking with Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier about age criteria.  Many people are really surprised to learn that they qualify.  Others do not qualify or their financial circumstances put them beyond the eligibility criteria.  It is amazing that the market has not responded by providing senior citizen accommodation similar to that provided by local authorities in respect of both density and owner occupation.  I am taken aback that the market has not provided those types of schemes whereby they may get more density and more numbers and may make more profit.  They may be more viable, yet the market has not responded.  Has the Department examined the reasons the market has not responded?  We see in other countries that there is more senior citizen-type accommodation or accommodation marketed as senior citizen accommodation.  It may look very similar to an apartment complex but it is marketed as a senior citizen complex or there might be covenants that make it such a complex.  Has the Department looked at why the Irish market has not responded in the way other countries have by providing for owners who want to sell in order to downsize and why it has not provided those types of sheltered communities that could be sold?</p></speech>

That was one of the papers done by the Housing Agency.  It was very clear that there is a real benefit to bringing forward supported housing.  It could be seen that there was a clear need for it.  Why is it not coming through?  That is hard to answer in some ways.  In some cases it is expensive to provide.  Housing supports are expensive to provide, and one will need a provider to come in.  Developers will not necessarily know how to do that, but we see some developments come through now on the private side that are specifically designated for older people and advertised as such.  There is not necessarily a support element involved because not all older people will need that, but it may be appropriate to their needs in respect of the facilities provided.  I am interested in that and it is coming through.  With the age-friendly homes website we have provided all the resources to developers to look at what they need to do to make developments age-friendly.  That has been really useful to them over the past year.  Also, the designation of age-friendly technical people in the local authorities to whom they can talk about how to make developments age-friendly has been really useful to them.  That will perhaps stimulate some more development on the private side.</p> <p>  In respect of the point about age criteria, the Vice Chairman is right.  Many people are surprised to find that they qualify as needing age-friendly housing.  Some people put that point at over 55.  I do not necessarily agree, but it is certainly something we need to plan for a lot earlier.  I agree with the Vice Chairman that we need to do that.</p> <p>  We consider the financial contribution scheme as part of the right-sizing policy we are bringing forward.  It is a matter of considering how we manage that and provide solutions that are options to come into social housing but also what the barriers to people downsizing are.  We looked at that as part of the ideas research we did in our Department on what would incentivise people to right-size.  People identified the hassle and solicitors' fees.  They want not necessarily someone who will guide them through the process but something like that, that is, someone who will help them to make the move.  Sometimes that person is lacking in their family.  We might consider that as part of our overall response to the right-sizing policy and what we can do on that front.</p> <p>  As for the fair deal scheme, I will hand over to Ms Comer.</p></speech>

The scheme will remain voluntary and is about providing choice.</p><p>In line with what Ms Timmons was saying, we have been interacting with Age Friendly Ireland in regard to providing options and helping with that signposting we mentioned earlier.  It is very keen to get involved and that will be a key part for us.  We are working with the Department of Health to ensure it will be in place.</p></speech>

What is more attractive is the size of the unit and the collective nature of it.  There is an area in my locality known as Wadelei, which was privately built in the 1950s, and maisonettes were built as part of the offering.  In several parts of that estate, people have moved from three-bedroom houses to the maisonette on their road, and may even have sold the house to a family member who took the larger property.  They moved because the stock was available.  I believe the private market has missed a trick and, therefore, it is up to us to try to respond to that.  Those types of houses marketed to senior citizens that are purely for a private transaction, whereby the financial resources are there from selling the private family home, are something Ireland does not do, unlike other countries, and I think we are missing a trick in that regard.</p></speech>

I will watch the video recording of the meeting later because I am sure much of what I had intended to say has been covered.</p> <p>  A proposed development in my home constituency, Dublin South-Central, arose recently and is currently at the pre-planning phase.  It is in the order of about 300 apartments in an area full of three- and four-bedroom houses and of people from a generation who would happily downsize or right-size if they had somewhere to go.  When I met residents' associations to discuss this proposal for a major development in the area, they were in support of housing but the problem was the development related only to build-to-rent.  The build-to-rent aspect is off-putting for people who have had a lifetime of owning their own homes, whereby there is a precariousness about it.  It seems to be a cultural barrier such that if someone has worked hard and has a home, selling it and moving into a build-to-rent, perhaps without qualifying for the criteria that may be inherent in that, is a problem.  The local community's attitude is such that were the development to go ahead, at least a certain proportion of the homes needed to be able to be bought in order that they would be incentivised to move.  As the Vice Chairman said, sufficient housing stock is not available.  People want to stay in the communities in which they have been all their lives, where there may be familiar faces in the church or the post office.  They want to stay in those areas but they are not necessarily able to do so because the housing stock is not sufficient.</p> <p>  This brings me to the recent newspaper article in which the Dublin city manager was quoted as having criticised the proliferation of build-to-rent in Dublin city and the destabilising nature that may have on the community and on the sense of the surroundings of the community and familiar faces for a long time.  That is my observation and I would welcome our guests' comments on how we can overcome that and ensure people will have housing stock in a given area.  Would it involve forced planning decisions whereby there would have to be criteria, such as specific numbers and a ratio?  Is there a sufficient level of home care and other supports to keep people in their homes, since that is their overwhelming desire to stay in their homes and their communities?</p> <p>  Again, I apologise if these questions have been answered.</p></speech>

Today, we launched Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities scheme, which involves &euro;450 million to incentivise exactly that, namely, apartments for sale to owner-occupiers and not for rent.  The difficulty is that the only financial model that makes sense for developers at the moment is build-to-rent.  That is the only way units can be built at the cost it takes to develop.  We need to address the cost of development, bridge that gap for the viability of those developments and ensure they will be available for the very people the Senator mentioned, namely, those who want to right-size or downsize into an apartment.  We are absolutely, 100% bringing that through and we are looking at a target of about 5,000 apartments over the coming years.  That is very much at the top of our agenda at the moment.</p> <p>  I might ask the representatives from the Department of Health to address the availability of home care in this context.</p></speech>

Home support, or supporting people to live safely and independently in their home where they have additional care needs, is a key policy in the programme for Government.  The HSE is getting an investment in the current year of &euro;670 million to provide home support services.  Compared with what has been provided over the past four years, that is a very significant increase, in excess of &euro;250 million.  This year, we have provided an additional 2.9 million hours of home support, which means that throughout the country, people who are assessed as needing additional care, whether for assistance with daily living, self-care, mobilising out of bed, washing, dressing and so on, are assessed on a standardised care assessment and are prioritised for those home support hours.  They support individuals, families and communities to help individuals to remain safely in their home.</p> <p>  The Department of Health is implementing change to, and reform of, the home support system.  This will introduce regulation and standards into the area of home supports in order that we can be assured throughout the country that people who have been assessed as needing home support will access an equally high standard and safe levels of care.  That will involve licensing of our home support providers and work is ongoing in that regard.</p> <p>  Furthermore, standardisation is happening throughout the country in order that all providers of home support and our healthcare systems will use similar assessment tools and care banding.  This will ensure that regardless of whether it is in Cork, Dublin or Galway, persons with the same type of clinical need will access equitable levels of home support.  It is a growing area and the investment has been considerable over recent years.  At one point at the start of 2020, many people were awaiting home support because the funding was not in place.  The addition of considerable funding over recent years has meant that is no longer a barrier and waiting times have reduced, but we are aware some families and individuals in the community are still waiting for a number of weeks for their home support because we, the HSE and other providers are trying to catch up in our services to recruit sufficient numbers of home support workers to meet that increased demand.</p></speech>

We are now working to attract people into home support by putting in place regulations and standards, and we are also working on the strategy.  The Department of Health has developed a strategic workforce group, which, along with key stakeholders throughout government and society, looks at the area of staffing and how we can attract and maintain staffing.  It is important for older people that their home support worker will not change from day to day and week to week.  We want people to stay and develop their skills in that area.</p></speech>

One of them, in Knocknaheeney, is a beautiful place, with excellent wraparound services, and the people who live there, in the heart of the community, love it.  They come from within the community.  The problem is there are not enough of these places.  More of them should be rolled out, and the disappointing point I have taken from this meeting is that not enough funding or resources are going into their delivery.  Cork City Council has done some excellent work on such projects.</p><p>However, it is about the amount of money and staffing resources needed to bring these complexes to fruition.  We have some excellent ones but we do not have enough of them.</p><p> I am conscious my time is limited.  I am being contacted by people who are being affected by long-term equity loans they took out on their homes during the middle of the Celtic tiger period.  The problem is they cannot access the fair deal scheme because the HSE will not engage with the people who hold the equity loans on their properties.  Have the Department officials looked at this issue?  Is there a solution because people who need to go into nursing homes and need access to the fair deal scheme are being blocked out because of the rules around equity loans.</p></speech>

This is not an issue we are particularly aware of.  It is really important that people who have been assessed as needing residential care get access to that care.  If the Deputy would like, we will certainly raise and discuss that matter with the HSE.</p></speech>

From Age Action, we have Ms Mary Murphy, Dr. Nat O'Connor and Ms Celine Clarke, who are attending via Microsoft Teams, from Alone, we have Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan and from the Sue Ryder Foundation, we have Mr. Gavin Reid.  They are all very welcome and we appreciate their input.  This is part of a process where the committee is examining this issue of the supply of housing for older people.  We will issue a recommendation via a report and thus the organisations' insights are very welcome indeed.</p> <p>  I must repeat part of the privilege warning for our new witnesses.  They are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending via Microsoft Teams from outside the Leinster House complex.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a person who is physically present within the complex.</p><p>Witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Time is against us.  We will move to our opening statements.  Our guests have five minutes.  I may cut them off but they have been supplied to the committee.  I do that so that we can have the best interaction during questions.  I will start with Ms Mary Murphy of Age Action.</p></speech>

In my remarks, I will build on the submission Age Action made to the committee in March this year.  Age Action is Ireland&rsquo;s leading advocacy organisation on ageing and older people.  We advocate for a society that enables all older people to participate and to live full, independent lives.</p> <p>  There are over 1 million people in Ireland aged 60 years or older, representing more than a quarter of all adults.  The number of people aged 80 or older will rise from over 170,000 people today to over 340,000 people by 2035.  This is a success story but when it comes to something like unmet housing needs, the scale of the challenge needs to be matched by the scale of the response.  Four in five older persons own their own home.  Because of this, many people assume older persons do not experience housing problems.  I will now mention five areas of unmet housing need.  Then I will address the proposed changes to the fair deal scheme.</p> <p>  First and foremost, older persons want to age in place and to grow old in the communities where they have built their lives.  Barriers prevent many people from ageing at home.  These include lack of physical accessibility around the home, lack of transport especially if people lose the ability to drive, and problems securing home care support.  A third of people aged 65 years or older have a disability or serious impairment.  Local authority grants help with things like grab rails or ramps, but there are not enough to meet the needs of all older persons.  Although many older persons will have funded home modifications themselves, Age Action estimates that up to 56,000 households still have unmet home accessibility needs.</p> <p>  A second concern is that older persons who want to rightsize cannot access bridging loans.  We have spoken to people who own their home outright and want to sell it to buy a cheaper home better suited to their needs but they cannot get a loan because mainstream banks look only at their income, not the value of their assets.</p> <p>  The third problem also relates to rightsizing.  There is often a lack of suitable alternative housing in the communities where people have built their lives.  While some older persons might like a smaller home, they do not want to give up all their social connections.  Planning needs to ensure that more diverse housing types are available in every community. </p> <p>  Our fourth concern is that many older persons cannot afford home repairs or insulation.  Older persons tend to live in older homes.  Out of roughly 500,000 homes in Ireland that have a building energy rating, BER, of E, F or G, at least 300,000 are likely to be occupied by older persons.  Only a third of older persons receive fuel allowance and the two thirds who are not eligible are also not eligible for the free upgrade under the national retrofit scheme.  CSO surveys indicate that half of older persons have cash savings of less than &euro;5,800.  Most older persons cannot afford to make major investments in their homes, even with the other retrofit partial subsidies.</p> <p>  The fifth issue is the affordability of housing which is a growing concern for older persons.  In 2019, 9,370 mortgage accounts held by people aged 60 years or older were in arrears with the majority in deep arrears.  This means they were 720 days or more behind in payments.  In future, more people will reach their 70s still paying off a mortgage.  Some 2.4% of older persons rent in the private sector.  Many have no idea how they will afford their housing once they stop working in their 70s.  Social housing tenants also pay rent, which can be a significant proportion of their weekly income.</p> <p>  Finally, since January 2022, we have received more than 200 calls about the nursing home support scheme or fair deal scheme.  The recent announcement that people will be permitted to keep 60% of rental income under the scheme improves on the 20% under the old rules, but why not 100%?  Very few people rent out their homes under the current scheme.  There is no incentive.  The HSE is not gaining income through this and will not lose any if people kept 100% of their rental income.  That would maximise the incentive to free up housing that might otherwise be left vacant for the years that a person spends in a nursing home.</p> <p>  That said, we have other concerns about this proposal.  The older person must have choice and control throughout the process and a package of safeguards is needed.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 needs to be implemented in full, including for the new decision support service to be fully operational.  Anyone with impaired decision-making capacities needs to be assisted with making a decision about renting out their home rather than having someone else make it instead.  We also need safeguards to prevent abuse, such as family members or others pushing an older person to rent out their home, or pocketing the rental income.  In the 30-month period from 1 January 2019 to the end of June 2021, Age Action&rsquo;s information service received over 100 contacts about financial abuse of older persons.</p> <p>  Age Action&rsquo;s core concern is for all older persons to have choice and control over where and how they live.  Planning, housing standards and housing supports all play a huge role in determining older persons' quality of life.  We would like to see housing and planning take a rights-based approach.  We are happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#O00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss housing for older people.  ALONE supports older people to age at home.  ALONE has supported more than 24,000 older people in the last two years.  On average 20.5% of the people we support have housing issues.  By 2031, around 20% of households will contain people over the age of 65.  This, coupled with declining home ownership rates, means we need to increase the focus and range of housing options and choices for older people.</p> <p>  So what do the older people want?  They tell us that they are united in wanting to age at home in their communities for as long as possible; that they want to live safely and securely in their communities; and that if they have health difficulties, they want to receive care in their own community.  We welcome enhanced community care projects that work towards meeting that need.  The other needs and wants depend on every older person&rsquo;s individual preference, health and home ownership situation.  </p> <p>  The current model of housing provision that we are relying on, the private sector rental model, will not fully serve the community or the needs of older people.  If you are renting, there are more barriers and fewer choices available.  If we continue to rely on the model as it stands today, with greater numbers renting into older age, we will see a dramatic increase in the number of homeless older people and the support needs among this age group.  It is not the landlords' responsibility, nor is it within their capabilities, to provide the support and security needed by this age group.</p> <p>  According to census 2016, 2.4% of people aged 65 and over, and almost 10% of people aged between 50 and 54, are renting from a private landlord and we anticipate this to grow further in the next census.  Cost rental models will help as will the new pension provision but not on the scale or within the timeframe needed.</p> <p>  ALONE&rsquo;s Housing Choices for Older People in Ireland report projects that a range of housing options and demand are needed over the next ten years.  We welcome the work that has been done so far under Housing for All and the joint policy statement by the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Health, Housing Options for Our Ageing Population.  The three sectors - private, voluntary and State - contributed to the joint policy statement, which was warmly welcomed as a significant step forward in housing policy for older people.  However, just one report from the implementation group for this policy statement is currently available publicly online, and this is dated from 2019.  We would ask that these reports are updated regularly and that the sectors that supported the development of the plan are involved in its implementation.  Implementation of this report will go a long way to resolving some of the challenges facing older people.  Without these reports and the meeting of these specific targets, ALONE is concerned that the issue of housing provision for older people could fall off the agenda and prevent all sectors from making further progress in this area.  Therefore, ALONE recommends that the first priority of the joint committee is to ensure the 2019 joint policy statement and implementation plans be fully reviewed, updated and released publicly on a regular basis, and to ensure all outstanding actions aim to be completed by the end of 2022 where possible.</p> <p>  ALONE is happy to work with the relevant bodies to identify gaps and blocks and support delivery however we can.  In addition to the actions outlined in the joint policy statement, ALONE believes we need to take a range of actions to meet the needs of our ageing demographic and to strengthen our communities.  The housing stock that older people occupy is often in need of extensive work.  Anyone who has purchased a house from probate will see this.  While the housing adaptation grant application process has been streamlined to some extent, the grant requires significantly more funding.</p><p>Our research indicates that annual funding of &euro;84.5 million would be required for older people alone.  Also, 95% of the work is covered by the grant.  Those on low incomes find it extremely difficult to pay the 5% where extensive works are required, as well as the additional costs involved in the application.  ALONE recommends that funding for the housing adaptation grant be set at &euro;84.5 million for older people to meet the demand and that, for individuals reliant on State transfers, the grant cover 100% of the cost of the work.</p><p> We need to increase the numbers of local authority, approved housing body, AHB, or other subsidised accommodation.  The sustainability of homes on reduced post-retirement incomes is a concern.  The current private rental model does not serve the vast majority of people after they retire.  At ALONE, we see this already.  We must adjust our system accordingly to ensure appropriate protections for tenants in the private rental sector, including long-term leasing.  Measures such as cost rental schemes, as outlined in Housing for All, must be prioritised and delivered at scale.</p><p> The quarter 4 progress report on the implementation of Housing for All indicates that just 65 cost-rental homes had been tenanted by the date of publication.  Long-term leases and cost rental must be prioritised and delivered on a greater scale, and other measures to protect older tenants must be introduced.</p><p> We need to continue to create the conversation, safeguards and incentives that allow older people to rightsize.  Rightsized one- and two-bedroom units must be delivered within existing communities so older people can avail of family and community supports as well as enhancing their quality of life.  These should be brownfield sites to help to rejuvenate our towns and villages where services and communities already exist.  The demand from older people is nearly 60,000 homes.  The proposal would release family homes back into the housing stock.  The provision of rightsized modern housing will release homes to younger buyers almost instantly.  The way these conversations have been approached in the past may not have helped this debate.</p></speech>

What makes it slightly different from many AHBs is that it caters for the elderly with supports.   We provide housing in our six schemes: Ballyroan, Kilminchy, Dalkey, Holycross, Carlow and Nenagh.  Apart from housing, the key supports we offer include a four-course lunch with choice; a laundry service; the cleaning of apartments or bungalows; maintenance; social and recreational facilities, gardens, exercise rooms, TV rooms, libraries and oratories or prayer rooms; and staff on site to support our residents, coupled with an emergency response system.</p> <p>  Our experience is that people live longer and healthier lives as a result of the additional supports we provide.  GP and hospital visits are reduced, loneliness and stress are removed, and people live in a safe and secure community.  The challenges for this type of housing are not really recognised or understood in the State.  Where we have schemes, our private lists illustrate a clear demand.  For example, we have over 300 people on our private list in Dalkey.  It rarely falls below that number.  Our hope is for a greater focus on housing with supports for our elderly citizens, with a dedicated subclass in housing with adequate funding.</p></speech>

We have 35 minutes remaining and seven groupings so I propose slots of five minutes each per group.

As I said to the departmental representatives, this discussion is very timely.  If anything, legislators are behind the ball in respect of the work officials have done heretofore and that is being done by the delegates.  It is not said enough that there is a crisis concerning housing for the elderly.  That is probably because we do not have many 70- and 80-year-old journalists.  It just does not tickle the fancy of the media.  However, this is a massive issue and we can see its effect.  As we told the Department, if you want to know whether there is a loneliness and housing crisis for the elderly, you should knock on an elderly person's door.  If someone is willing to talk to a politician for 40 minutes, you know he or she must be lonely.  The politician is the only person he or she will have seen.  For a while, I thought I was going to be a very popular politician and then I realised there was actually a loneliness crisis.  It goes to show we have not given this due attention.  That is why today's presentations are very important.  I commend the guests on the significant work they are doing.</p> <p>  The ALONE submission referred to 60,000 homes.  How has it arrived at that figure?  Is it based on departmental figures or its own research?  Has it got a geographical breakdown of the figures?</p></speech>

For us, rightsizing creates an opportunity for us all.  It is all about choices for older people.  Around 15% of older people said they would rightsize if choices were available close to them in their community so they could maintain a relationship with friends, family and the services they use.  Up to now, the conversation has sometimes made older people feel as if others wanted access to their homes rather than focusing on giving them a positive choice in old age.</p></speech>

They want to rightsize but it is a question of how we go about it.</p> <p>  This brings me on to the Sue Ryder Foundation, which is doing incredible work.  I misheard Mr. Reid when he was giving his opening statement in that I thought he said "archery or prayer room".  I thought that was an eclectic offer so I had to check what was said.  He actually stated "oratories or prayer rooms".</p></speech>

The model that the Sue Ryder Foundation is offering is particularly interesting.  We are unfortunate in many parts of the country because we are not familiar with the work it is doing.  Will Mr. Reid expand on the private list he referred to?  How does it work?  Is the foundation unique in offering a service to both the private community and local authorities?  Could Mr. Reid expand on the working model?</p></speech>

We still work at the local authority even though we have no real obligation to do so now.  That is predominantly private.  I referred to the number of people on the list.  We do not focus very well on this type of housing.  Once it is built and people know it exists, the lists grow.  We often feel that local authorities go back to the housing lists.  Local authorities will not have elderly people on housing lists.  As Mr. Moynihan mentioned, there will be people for whom bigger houses are unsuitable and do not work, but they do not really see the downsizing option.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

It relates to the point I was making to Mr. Moynihan initially on the source of information.  Mr. Reid obviously gleaned the information on the number living alone from the CSO.  We need detailed work to drill into the statistics, reach out to people and determine what exactly they want to do.  The Department officials, when they were before us earlier, told us this is part of the process they are to engage in.</p> <p>  While we have a housing crisis and this is very much part of the challenge, there is a great opportunity for us to get this right.  Our population is getting older and there are challenges with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  We want more people living in their own homes and communities such as those facilitated by the Sue Ryder Foundation.  I thank the delegates for the work they are doing.  We need to be more responsive to what they are bringing to us.  I put my hand up and say we have not been to date.</p></speech>

I had a look at the rightsizing studies.  My own mother said I was trying to take her house.  Without showing people the alternatives, they fear we are trying to take their home to give it to somebody else.  We need to get over that barrier.  People need to understand what is available.</p></speech>

On the safeguards we are discussing, my first question is on the reduction from 80% to 40% in respect of the fair deal scheme.  Ms Murphy made the point the rate should be 0% because there is no income coming in at the moment.  There is no loss to the Exchequer.  The hope is that more people would be encouraged to rent out their properties.  Could Ms Murphy expand on that?  Could the delegates expand on their concerns over putting safeguards in place to allay the fears of older people who get involved?</p></speech>

I suppose the major concern for Age Action Ireland would be that undue pressure would be placed on older persons by family members or other interested parties into putting their homes on the market when they themselves are unwilling or not ready to do so or may simply lack the capacity to make a decision like that.  We believe that if they are being incentivised to do so as part of the fair deal scheme, that needs to be matched by thorough safeguarding measures which may be adequately delivered through the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act once that is brought into effect.  We would see the solution coming from the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act.</p></speech>

I am not sure who might wish to answer it.  I have been contacted by people who took out equity loans on their homes during the Celtic tiger era and now, when they need to avail of the fair deal scheme because the equity loan is in place, that person cannot avail of the fair deal scheme.  Is this something any of the witnesses have come across or is it a new phenomenon?  When those people borrowed that money, they were much younger and now they are getting to the age where they need the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

In some ways, we feel there has been a large focus on it but it may not produce that much.  There is considerable dispute over how many houses are available.  It could be as low as 4,000 units, many of which are not in parts of the country where people want to rent.  In addition, on average a person lives for 2.9 years in a nursing home.  When someone goes into a nursing home, his or her possessions need to be stored.  The house needs to comply with tenancy laws and meet health and safety standards.  Authority may need to be handed over to a relative because it is probably not something a person can do within a nursing home.  Considerable effort might go into this scheme and produce very little.  In addition, we hear stories that many of these houses are full of children, grandchildren and other relatives.  It has been suggested that we might get a significant amount of housing but I do not think so because when people unfortunately die, that housing comes back into the stock of available housing anyway.</p></speech>

Where I live on Cathedral Road in Cork, there are three beautiful homes within 100 yd.  It would be possible to go in and hang up a coat.  The people who own those houses are in nursing homes and will never come out.  It is a sin.  The person in the nursing home is not getting any benefit from their home.  The lights are set to come on at 8 p.m. and they are on for four hours.  The heating comes on for a couple of hours.  At the same time, we have families who are homeless.  No one is benefiting.</p> <p>  Further to the point Ms Murphy made earlier, to try to get these houses into play the Government needs to think outside the box.  Mr. Moynihan made a point about the fear factor of people trying to take their homes.  I hear that from people in Cork.  What Mr. Reid of the Sue Ryder Foundation described is what we would love to see rolled out.  We have a very popular scheme where I come from called the Solas Apartments.  It is a brilliant scheme.  We could fill it ten times over, but the problem is there are not enough of them.</p> <p>  In Barrett's Buildings, Roche's Buildings and Madden's Buildings in Cork, there are smaller properties of one-bedroom.  At the time, 20 or 30 years ago, they were probably brilliant because older people were all put together.  There are no services with them.  We are dropping elderly people, many of them with health issues or disabilities, into old houses that have not been retrofitted or anything and they are left there.  Instead, we need to get to what Mr. Reid is proposing.</p></speech>

I begin by complimenting the Sue Ryder Foundation on everything it is doing to provide practical support and day-to-day assistance.  As Deputy Flaherty mentioned, combating social isolation is really important.  The previous discussion dealt with the point I was going to make relating to rental income from houses belonging to those availing of the fair deal scheme.  I know we have heard from Age Action Ireland the perspective that at the moment nothing is being taken by the Exchequer on this and homes are instead lying idle.  Should we look at 100% going to the person whose home it is?</p> <p>  We have heard a very different perspective from Alone.  Obviously, the representatives of Age Action Ireland are also talking about safeguards, which I fully agree need to be in place.  Mr. Moynihan from Alone raised other concerns, including concerns he has raised directly with me prior to this meeting, not just about safeguarding but also about the additional expenditure incurred for solicitors, auctioneers or estate agents.  There is also the issue of security of tenure.  Up to 50% of houses would need to be upgraded to meet the current standards and regulations in order to bring them back to supply, a matter we discussed in the first session today.</p> <p>  Even if the figure is as low as 4,000 units, those are 4,000 families we could help by unlocking these homes.  I would be on the side of what the representatives of Age Action Ireland said about increasing that figure as much as possible so that the rental income is being seen by the person in care.  I know the proposed 40% rate is not quite there, but it is a doubling of what is currently available and a step worth taking.  I would be interested in hearing the two different perspectives.  I know they both come from the same place, which is safeguarding older people and helping to resolve the housing crisis.  I would like to hear those different perspectives from Alone and Age Action Ireland, elaborating on the pros and cons of homes of people in the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

Just because someone is in a nursing home, it does not mean that person cannot or does not want to manage his or her financial affairs.  That should be front and centre.  Even if someone loses some capacity, in order to be able to make those decisions, he or she needs the decision-making service under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act to be fully operational, which is not yet the case.</p> <p>  We are introducing a new statutory home care scheme and we are waiting to see details of that.  We know most people want to age in place; that is in the programme for Government.  People want to stay in their homes.  This new scheme may unlock properties this year, but in five years' time, all going well, many more people will be staying at home longer and therefore their stay in a nursing home will be later in life when they have a higher degree of needs.  Therefore, the tenancies that could be achieved from those houses will be shorter.  I quite agree that, for the time that is in it, if we could free up 4,000 dwellings, that would make sense.  However, the older person must have control over the process, which is why we need that wraparound of the safeguarding so that his or her wishes are adhered to at all times.</p></speech>

It is more a difference of emphasis.  Safeguarding is very important.  We are concerned at the excessive focus on this.  We might say it is 4,000 units, but the reality is that if somebody rents something out and unfortunately the individual in the nursing home dies, the chances are that the property will be sold and somebody will move up.  There are obviously examples in every community where houses are lying idle, but given the amount of support and protection the older person needs, the amount of costs that somebody is going to have to come up with and the length of time that people moving in might get, would we be better off shifting the emphasis and energy away from this and providing housing choices for older people, such as rightsizing and providing housing with on-site supports for older people?  That would free up housing on a much bigger scale for families and provide much more long-term options.  We might put in a lot of effort and produce very short-term gains for the people who move in.  There is not much difference between us; it is just a difference of emphasis.</p></speech>

We are focusing in particular on supporting and responding to the complex housing needs of older citizens.  We are all going in that direction.  I am not there quite yet but I am always looking around for places I particularly like.  That tees me up to talk about the Sue Ryder Foundation.  I am familiar with its facility in County Laois and I know there are other such facilities in counties Tipperary and Carlow.  I am particularly familiar with the facility in Dalkey, which is, to say the least, a fantastic site.  It is a brilliant place for anyone to live.  It is by the coast.  Its site is what makes it so special.  The siting of these locations is very important because they are, effectively, sheltered villages.  Dalkey is a particularly nice place, as our guests know.  It is served by many restaurants and pubs, a library, doctors and two or three churches.  It has everything, including public transport.  People do not need a car to live there, even if they are not living in sheltered accommodation.  The Sue Ryder Foundation facility in Dalkey is a community within a community.  It is double-wrapped in community.  Mr. Reid will know that many people seek to go to that facility.</p><p> Someone spoke earlier about ageing in place.  Ageing in place does not necessarily means ageing in the same building and the same fabric.  People like to age in the same community.  That is a subtle difference and sometimes we lose sight of that.  Many people in their 60s, who are not very old, find that their children have moved on and their circumstances have changed.  They realise they have a lot of capital tied up in bricks and mortar and could have a better quality of life by releasing some of that equity.</p><p> The Sue Ryder Foundation model is wonderful.  However, having said that, I am aware of some difficulties that do not specifically apply to the facility in Dalkey.  I want to be clear about that.  Mr. Reid or another of our guests might tell us the costs involved.  This is not a cheap housing option.  I am not saying that all housing should be cheap but it is quite an expensive option for some people.  I would like to hear more detail on the way that is costed.  I would also like to know more about how people are selected for this support housing, because that is what it is.  Meals, laundry, cleaning services, maintenance, gardening and interactive activities are provided.  There is a cost to that.  Clearly when there is cost and demand, there needs to be a mechanism for prioritisation.  Those who are most in need should be prioritised and not the people with the biggest wallet, purse or mouth.  I do not say that disrespectfully.  I want to be clear about the people who have the most important need.  I would have thought that people who have no homes are more important than people who may be leaving a home to move to another home.  That is not a luxury we all have.  I understand that people do not want to live in isolation and do not want to be lonely.  Many of the people elderly people know may be gone.</p><p> I am interested in the bigger picture of the policy and how we are going to proceed as a committee.  What do our guests say about all of that?  What do they recommend?  Bearing in mind our time constraints, perhaps each of our guests would give us a strong line about what they would like us to do in terms of policy.</p></speech>

We have six schemes, as the Senator will be aware.  Dalkey is unique because most of the residents in Dalkey would be downsizing.  In other schemes, most people are from local authority housing lists.  Each scheme has an allocations committee that assesses the need in conjunction with our obligations under our mortgage agreements.  It differs from scheme to scheme, but it would be determined by our mortgage arrangements.</p> <p>  As I said, Dalkey is unique.  It is out of mortgage and much of it was built using our private funds so, therefore, we run a private list.  An allocations committee assesses the need before an offer is made.</p> <p>  In terms of pricing, I believe the Senator may have been referring to the prices we charge our residents.</p></speech>

A two-bed averages approximately &euro;250 per week.  A one-bed costs &euro;180 per week.  Residents can avail of a payment under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, of &euro;55 towards that.  I would like to see suitably funded elderly housing as its own subclass.  We charge approximately &euro;9,000 per annum per unit.  It costs us approximately &euro;14,000 to keep a resident.  We subsidise that amount through our retail shops, as committee members can see in our submission.  Those sales are collapsing.</p></speech>

Housing and support go together for older people in many cases.  We need housing with on-site support.  We would like to see within health and housing policy, and the Housing for All plan, a demonstrator site that involves building 24-7 on-site support.  In Ireland, one either ages at home or in a nursing home.  In the middle of those two options is housing with on-site support as a positive choice when people may be facing other reasons they cannot age at home.  At the moment, the policies of both Departments mean it is hard to get a funding model.  The Senator asked about housing.  The policy we would most like to see is a commitment to housing with support under that joint policy statement and a funding model for it.  Whether the answer is accommodation provided by the Sue Ryder Foundation and a loan, private suppliers or another approved housing body, we must ensure there is an ability to build housing with on-site support as an alternative to nursing homes for those who cannot stay in their current location.</p></speech>

As a society, we are not ready to meet all of the unmet housing needs for older persons, given the pace at which the numbers of older persons are growing.  Ms Murphy earlier mentioned many things with regard to unmet needs and there are two additional things to consider.  Many of the calls we get about the fair deal scheme are from people who are uncertain about how it works.  There is a lot of worry and concern in that regard.  Some people are not making applications under the scheme and are instead taking out credit union loans because they are afraid of the scheme.  There is a need to explain the fair deal scheme to people and reassure them about what is happening.  That is even more the case now as we change the rental rules.</p> <p>  Another thing to consider is the local authority assessment of housing need that happens under the Housing Act.  At the moment, there is a narrow examination of how many social housing units will be needed.  That could be broadened out to consider the full range of housing needs, including the supports people will need to stay in their homes or the needs people might have to right-size and so on.  A wider definition there, and a wider duty for the local authority, might help, on an area-by-area basis, to identify the needs of older persons and their desire, as the Senator said, to age in their communities and not just be ignored because they are currently in a house.  Just because a person is in a house does not mean he or she does not have many unmet housing needs.</p></speech>

I would welcome the views of any of our guests as to whether a dedicated zoning for affordable housing that includes housing for older people or specific zoning for housing for older people would be a way of ensuring that more land and sites are available.</p> <p>  Some very good points have been made about the hope that people will be in nursing homes for a much shorter time because they are supported better to stay in their homes for longer.  If we have a choice between getting long-term vacant homes back into use or short-term vacant homes, it would be better to pick long-term vacant homes.  We could make less out of short-term vacant homes.  There is probably political consensus on trying to achieve both.</p> <p>  I will ask Age Action Ireland about issues around people being pressurised by the fair deal scheme and the safeguards required in that regard.  The representatives referred to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and that the provisions there are part of the safeguards.  What about people who are not covered under that Act and who are not be defined as a relevant person under the Act?  Let us take, for example, the case of a person who may well be capable of making their own decisions but who could also be subject to pressure from family members.  As people get older, sometimes there are a lot of dependencies and interdependencies involved.  Have our guests any ideas or views on the safeguards required for that cohort of people who may not be specifically covered by that Act?  That is an area about which I have concerns.</p></speech>

We have put together a package of safeguarding measures that we would like to see coming on stream.</p><p>One of those would be safeguarding legislation for adults who would fall outside of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The other is a change to the coercive control legislation to include any crime within a relationship where there is a power.  Currently, it is only within couples in intimate relationships.  That is where one would see issues to do with pressure, for example, from a nephew, from a neighbour or from a community, for a person to leave his or her home.</p><p> The adult safeguarding HSE team annual report in 2022 had more than 600 reports of financial elder abuse, and that is what is reported.  Organisations, such as Age Action Ireland and Sage Advocacy, believe that is well under reported in the issues that come to the fore.  It is a very genuine concern.</p><p> Steps can be taken in the safeguarding packages, such as the assisted decision-making, ADM, adult safeguarding legislation and changes in coercive control, but a cultural shift is also required and an understanding that older people have their rights, regardless of their age and setting.  We need to respect and understand, and root out ageism from our practice, society and attitudes.</p></speech>

In fact, if people want to stay in their own home, if we have universal design in modern homes that allows adaptation, for example, a downstairs loo and access for a wheelchair or mobility devices, people should be able to live in their communities.  A planning requirement of a certain percentage of houses with universal design - we have that but they could be grown - and, likewise, a planning requirement for accommodation for older persons rather than necessarily separate zoning would be the way we would look at that.</p></speech>

The first is their relationship with the local authorities.  That is critically important.  In some cases, local authorities co-fund or support the rents, depending on the circumstances.  That is a good one.</p> <p>  I know quite a few people who have fallen out of social housing through no fault of their own in different circumstances and they have ended up coming back to charities looking for housing.  This is the second, and sometimes the third, time they have sought support housing through no fault of their own.  It is sad, but more common than one might think.  They might touch on their relationships with the local authorities.  I hope that is positive.</p> <p>  The second is this point about the universal design.  I have walked into support housing in recent times that does not fit the criteria of universal design.  While we can advertise universal design, I would be of the view that no State funding should be given to any new housing scheme that does not have going forward in its development plan universal design.  One hears of cases anecdotally.  An elderly woman said to me recently that her family said she had to leave because she cannot get upstairs and there is no downstairs toilet or wash room.  That is easily resolved.  The local authorities have funding for that, but this was more pressure that it was time the woman moved into a place.  The woman felt pressurised and vulnerable and really did not have anywhere to go to.  Those who tried to advocate for that elderly lady were told they were poking their nose in somewhere.  It is a difficult situation.</p> <p>  The witnesses might talk about their relationships with their relevant local authority or authorities, and also this issue of universal design because that is the key.  We should be able to walk into any home with any set of circumstances or any set of disabilities and be able to live there.  We visit people and people with disabilities in different sets of circumstances.  We are human after all.  It is about people living in these places but also family and friends coming to engage with those people in those places.  I would be interested in some comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#S00700"><p>On the universal design, the centre of universal design, under Dr. Ger Craddock, has done huge work and most people are supportive of that.  They have done a lot of costings and, under Housing for All, a report is due soon.  They are coming out with there being between 3% and 5% in extra cost per unit for universal design.  I agree with the Senator that, ultimately, for future proofing and stopping us having to retrofit in the future, it makes more sense to put that investment in now.</p> <p>  On the local authority, between the local authorities and the HSE, the Department of Health and others, there is much common ground in the understanding of the issues that face older people around housing.  The problem we have is probably agreed models, implementation and funding mechanisms so that if people need care and support, the question is: how do they tap into that?  Obviously, the right to home care that is progressing at present and the quality standards in legislation will go some way towards that, but that can be the challenge because the same people who sometimes need support also need housing and maybe the supports that people need are beyond the statutory responsibility of the local authorities.  That is why we would focus on that joint policy statement.  That is where they intersect.  That is where they have identified where those sections are.  If we do not get implementation on those intersections, ultimately older people will fall between the different Departments.</p></speech>

The Senator hit the nail on the head.  It is not about where people live; it is about them being able to visit their relatives and being able to get out and about and meet people.  This is what we mean by a rights-based approach to housing and planning - that the older person or anybody who has a disability is the rights bearer and we should think in terms of removing any barriers to him or her living the same kind of life we all enjoy in terms of being able to go and visit anyone in any home.  That is absolutely what we would like to see in terms of universal design.  We have achieved great things in terms of recently-built housing, in terms of its BER rating of A, because of nearly zero energy building, NZEB, housing.  We should be able to do the same with universal design and simply raising the bar in the quality standard.</p></speech>

I had to go out and do a "Drivetime" interview and the argument with Senator Cummins lasted longer than RT&Eacute; expected.</p> <p>  I have one question.  My colleague, Deputy Gould, and others raised earlier most of the issues I would have raised.  I want to return to Mr. Moynihan's comment on the policy statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population and the fact that no implementation reports have been published since 2019.  When the departmental officials were before us earlier, they extolled the successful implementation of almost all of the 40 actions.  My question, to Mr. Moynihan and the other two organisations, is: from their experience on the ground - I acknowledge it has been difficult because we have had Covid and it is not necessarily a fair comparison from the Department's point of view - how much implementation of those 40 key actions that were in that important policy statement have they seen progressed and are there any that they would have a concern that are progressing less speedily than they should do that they would like us as a committee to raise with the Department or issues where there could be more progress than there has been?</p></speech>

It is an interesting model.  The reality is many organisations, such as ours and Age Action Ireland, even in the private sector, and campaigning organisations would have put a great deal of effort into providing inputs into the development of that policy but when it goes to implementation it really goes back down in the public service and the statutory bodies.  In the public service there are plenty of very fine individuals working on them but many people who may have created the thinking that led to the policy are not involved in the implementation.  We have felt some of it on the ground, in fairness, but the point is we are not quite sure to what extent and how much national coverage there is of some of the actions.  It is time to see an implementation report so that we can have that conversation.</p> <p>  I also believe the statutory bodies are full of fine people.  There is a common understanding of what we want to do but there may not be a common understanding of how and when to do it.</p><p>We would welcome seeing that report so we could re-engage in the debate that led to the development of the policy in the first place.</p></speech>

In other areas of housing policy with this Department, there is often a cross-sectoral group that oversees or reviews those implementation reports that would involve the local authorities, other Government agencies, NGOs, academics, etc.  Would we benefit from something like that at this level, even on an annual or biannual basis?  Those reports could be considered and discussed, and feedback could be given to the statutory bodies.</p></speech>

The reality is that there are things in that policy statement which go across two and three Departments, so it is not clear at which stage a Secretary General or assistant secretary general may not have the authority to cross a particular statutory line.  The point is to provide housing and support.  What is in those statements is that we need changes, some of which may require legislation or may need Government Departments to shift in their policy stances.  Ultimately, it will have to go to the highest level.  I would not be surprised if some of the actions within that policy statement are not implemented because they are stuck at a point at which there is a need to go higher, even for a statutory instrument, a change of law or because people do not have the authority to change the responsibilities of their Departments.</p></speech>

This is something we have become invested in recently because the housing aid for older persons grant is one of the few ways for elderly individuals to get central heating systems installed in their homes by the State in a subsidised way, which would be crucial for a lot of those who still do not have central heating and who may be dependent on something like turf.  In this way, their heating source might be jeopardised or restricted if certain Government measures are enacted soon.</p></speech>

We get the data on the number of people who apply for these schemes but it is up to people to apply.  We do not know or have a good sense of what the level of housing need in the population is.  The census only gets us so far; there is a need for more analysis of the overall housing needs of older persons and of all the costs associated with ageing.  There needs to be a great deal more research done to bring together the three Departments to help drive policy forward.</p></speech>

Aon rud eile from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan?  No. I will pick up on one point.  The Department officials said that they are undertaking a review of the grants for the elderly and disabled.  I am taking a leap of faith and assuming that neither Age Action nor any of the groups have been invited to make a submission or observations for that review.</p></speech>

It would be important to get their input into something like that.  Access to bridging loans for people to right-size was mentioned.  That is a problem, and it is hard to pinpoint it.  One option is the local authority housing loan, which could be tweaked to enable people to downsize if they want to do so.  Is that an obvious solution?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-10a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nat O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051000002#T01000"><p>It is a good idea.  Local authorities can do mortgage lending so there could be a tweak to that, as the Acting Chairman says.  Someone may own a home which is an asset and which could be worth &euro;300,000, &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000.  They may want something smaller that is, in theory, cheaper.  They may also want to take their time to get the right house and when they see it they want to purchase it and it may take them three to six months to sell their house.  That is the level of bridging involved and there can also be issues with mortgage financing as they will not lend to people over a certain age and so on.  There is a real gap there where people need a product and the local authority could fit well in those instances.</p></speech>

Given that it is the primary conduit of funding for the local authority loan you could even look at something which has a low cost or no cost in terms of the rate for such a bridging loan because it was talking about a loan of up to five years.</p></speech>

This has been an informative meeting.  We need to listen to the witnesses more.  They are doing valuable work.  Hopefully the Department will invite them to feed into that review, particularly with regard to bridging finance.  The Department has an opportunity there and we are being too rigid in the implementation of the local authority loans.</p></speech>
