This is important as they cause inference for our broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>Today we will have engagement on alliance building to strengthen the European Union.  I am very glad that Dr. Catherine Day is here to discuss this.  She is well known to all of us as the former most senior European civil servant and currently serves in a number of roles, including as a special adviser to President Juncker.  It is important that the EU is prepared for the future and for a future without the UK in it.  We must look ahead and think about how strong relationships can be built between EU states and how Ireland can best contribute to this.  Of course, alliances can go beyond governments working together.  This is something on which many of us can work together in different spheres.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are about to give to the committee.  If they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and they continue to do so, they are only entitled thereafter to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence they give.  They are directed that only evidence concerned with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an entity or a person either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Day to make her opening statement and I am sure committee members will have questions and comments for her.  It is an honour to have her here.  As I have told her, her CV precedes her and she is known for her extremely strong work ethic, something I really admire in anybody.  It is a privilege to chair a meeting at which she is attending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Day" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019040300002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me to address them today on the topic of alliance building.  This has always been an important part of how the EU works and it takes on a particular relevance in the context of Brexit.  I commend the Chairman and the committee on their very timely initiative in considering this important topic.</p> <p>  We all know the EU will be very different after Brexit.  I will mention a few areas because they are the background to the focus on alliance building.  Inevitably, the EU will be more continental in outlook after the UK leaves.  Among other things, it will mean that the civil law tradition, which is the basis of most continental law making, will be more dominant than when the UK, with its common law tradition, played a big role.</p><p>France and Germany will obviously play a bigger role in shaping the future direction of the EU.  They will no longer have to contend with the questioning and reluctant attitude of the UK.  In thinking about today, it struck me that the EU was already working before the UK and Ireland joined, but Ireland has never known the EU without the UK.  It will be quite a change for us.  We often saw issues in a similar way to the UK and we will certainly miss the role the UK played as a big member state in being a buffer between France and Germany and in terms of organising a different debate.<br/><br/>More than ever, in the future the euro will be the core of the EU system and further consolidation and deepening can certainly be expected.<br/><br/>Without the opposition of the UK, and this may be one of the positive sides of UK departure, the EU will develop stronger social policies.  This will certainly be needed to address the challenge of populism and the feeling among parts of the EU population that they somehow have missed out on the benefits of globalisation and that they have been left behind by open trade.  The EU needs to be able to show that it cares about all of its citizens and that stronger economic policies will be accompanied by social policies that deliver.<br/><br/>I have a couple of worries about how the EU will be in the future.  I am concerned that the EU 27 could be more protectionist than at present and perhaps a little less open to the outside world.  In my view, the current push to curb the competition rules and develop European champions is not a healthy development.<br/><br/>I also have a worry that what is called in Brussels the &quot;better regulation&quot; agenda process, which has improved EU policymaking through evidence-based, impact-assessed policy proposals resulting from wide stakeholder consultation will be given less importance without the constant pressure of the UK to combat red tape.  These are merely a few of the changes that we can expect to see in the future.<br/><br/>For me, that means that the post-Brexit climate will require a different approach to Irish membership in the future.  We have all seen during the Brexit negotiations just how deeply integrated we are as a Union and how much we benefit from things that we take for granted but that only exist because of our EU membership.  Perhaps, most of all, we have seen the need to keep our citizens involved and help them feel that EU belongs to them and is not something imposed from the outside.<br/><br/>In my brief opening remarks, there are four areas on which I will focus: the need for much deeper understanding of the wishes and problems of other member states so that Ireland can build alliances with like-minded countries but also so that we understand the opinions and the positions of those who will differ from us; the enhanced need to anticipate what proposals are likely to come from the institutions and other member states and to seek to influence them at an early stage; the need for earlier work with others on proposals we want or do not want to see agreed; and finally, the need for continuous information to our citizens on how and why the EU is changing and Ireland's place and role within that future Union.<br/><br/>First, on the topic of the deeper understanding of the views of others, there is a need for a systematic approach.  The EU is now so big through successive enlargements that it is impossible to keep up to speed with thinking in every member state unless one has an active information gathering and exchange system in place.  While new technologies have made it much easier for us to keep in touch with people around the world directly, do we know whether they represent a considered national or sectoral position or are they are merely transmitting their own personal views to us?  With the ease of contact, there are pluses and minuses.<br/><br/>In Ireland, we attach importance to personal contacts, but so do our EU counterparts.  Building relations over time, based on a deeper understanding of their point of view, is crucial to building good alliances.  In my time as Secretary General, I noticed a strong tendency to form groups of so-called &quot;like-minded&quot; member states.  There are long established such groups, for example, the <i>Francophonie</i>of the French-speaking countries, the organisation of the Benelux countries, as well as newer ones, such as the Visegrad countries in eastern Europe and the so-called &quot;New Hansa League&quot;, but it is important that we not only speak to those who are like-minded but also reach out to those who hold different views from us.  The EU is all about finding workable compromises that allow it to move forward in the interest of all its members and reaching out to those with different views is just as crucial a part of the engagement as is talking to those who would agree with us.<br/><br/>We are all conscious of the huge solidarity that Ireland has had from the other EU countries and the EU institutions throughout the Brexit process.  In my view, this has been achieved by the mobilisation of politicians and diplomats with our other partners with a clear message from Ireland, with a clear investment in time and travelling to meet partners, who, in turn, have been willing to take a serious interest in the case that we put.  We will need to keep up that kind of effort in future.  We have to reach out beyond the English-speaking world to our continental partners and that means travelling to them and keeping in touch on a regular basis, obviously, not only when we have a problem.  It will mean a requirement for more staff increases, not only in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but across all Departments that are dealing with EU matters.  It will also require a bigger travel budget so that politicians and officials can regularly visit different countries as part of building deeper alliances.  Thinking about this, it came to me that, in fact, what we need is something close to the mobilisation that Ireland engages in every time we hold the Presidency of the EU.  Then we really gear up and we have similar messages across all messengers.  Ireland has a good track record of successful Presidencies.<br/><br/>The good news is that all of the smaller member states are coming to the same conclusion.  They all see what we see - the need to work together permanently to ensure that the voice of smaller member states is heard.  This is certainly, but not only, a task for Government.  The Oireachtas can do useful work with other national parliaments and social partners and civil society, all of which have a role to play in building long-term alliances.<br/><br/>I want to mention two organisations that I know of which, I believe, can play an incredibly useful role in supporting this process.  I am on the board of both of them because I regard that membership as a <i>pro bono</i>part of my continuation of public service.  I refer to European Movement Ireland, EMI, and the Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA.  Both organisations are well known to members of this committee and with their connections in other member states and in their different roles, both can play a significant role in helping to inform Ireland about changing EU priorities and in helping to formulate wise national responses.  The point I would like to raise here is that both of those organisations have to spend a lot of time and resources on fundraising every year.  They are grateful for the public funding they get but it would be important to find ways to support them that allows them to devote themselves to the challenges of the tasks that lie ahead instead of merely being engaged in a constant quest for project funding.  I hope that may be something about which the committee could have a think.<br/><br/>Having spent most of my working in the European Commission, I want to say that alliance building should not only be confined to other member states but that I see a similar need to invest in the European institutions.  We have all seen the role that the Commission has played over the past two years in standing shoulder to shoulder with Ireland through the Brexit negotiations and in general the Commission sees itself, and should be seen, as a true friend of the smaller member states.  My generation of Irish EU staff is retiring, however, and our numbers are falling.  We need to encourage young people to think about a career in the European institutions and maybe also to take more active measures to support them when they make that choice.  Without in any way interfering with the independence of Irish EU staff, they can be an important source of information and guidance on what is happening across the institutions.<br/><br/>My second point is about anticipating what will be coming down the track from Brussels and elsewhere.  There will be less legislation in the future because the EU has a well-developed body of legislation in many areas and what is needed now is to keep it relevant and up to date, not necessarily to add to it.  However, all the time there will be new challenges where co-ordinated action at EU level will be more effective than unco-ordinated national action.</p><p>In response to this change of need, the Commission has been developing an overall set of policy proposals for each of its five year mandates.  This year, 2019, is going to be an absolutely crucial year in that respect.  Ireland is following closely and feeding into the meeting that the Heads of State and Government will have in Romania on 9 May to talk about the future direction of the EU 27.  Just after the European Parliament elections, most likely in June, the new President of the European Commission will be nominated.  The European Parliament will then vote in July on confirmation of that President on the basis of what he or she sets out as programme priorities.  The parliament will certainly seek through its systems and committees to influence that programme of work.  When the parliament holds hearings with the nominated Commissioners, it will also be seeking to feed into the future work programme of the Commission for the next five years.  Similarly, in the European Council, Ministers will also be wanting to feed into that programme.  This is really a crucial year in terms of influencing and deciding the future direction of EU policy.  Of course, that policy will not be set in stone.  The next five years will bring new crises, coupled with the need to adapt and so forth but the basic backbone of the EU agenda for the next five years will be set before the end of this year.  I really hope that civil servants and stakeholders are getting ready to feed in their ideas and to react to those that are advocated by their counterparts in other member states.</p><p> In terms of influencing future proposals, the Commission nowadays spends a lot of time consulting with and involving stakeholders long before it makes proposals.  Unfortunately, many stakeholders, including member states at times, do not get involved early enough in the process and then have to scramble at the last minute to try to develop their positions and have them taken into account.  We in Ireland would benefit from early discussion of upcoming proposals not just across Government but also across stakeholders.  This would give a lot of opportunities to feed a really mature and well developed Irish perspective into the work being done with opposite numbers in other member states to develop like-minded positions.  If Government and stakeholders can work together, at least on the key proposals, that will have the effect of ensuring a wider public understanding of how the EU works and how Ireland can have a role in shaping and influencing it.</p><p> This leads me to a very important point about the need for continuous citizen involvement.  I am well placed to know just how badly the EU has suffered from bad press as a remote and soulless technocracy.  In particular, the British Eurosceptic press has had a lot to do with that.  It has used ridicule to try to undermine what is very solid and praiseworthy progress in a lot areas.  Here in Ireland we have seen a strong desire, expressed through our many referenda campaigns and in other ways, among people to understand and be part of what is happening in the EU.  We have also seen, in the context of Brexit, what can happen when people feel alienated from that process.  While we may be enjoying a kind of Brexit dividend at the moment in terms of Irish support for the EU, we all know that it is very hard to maintain the intensity of interest and that level of focus in more normal times.  Therefore, we need to think about how we can have a step change in how information circulates on the EU and on creating a greater sense of civil involvement.  It is possible to make a complex and technical organisation like the EU accessible to citizens if we take the time and invest the necessary resources.  We have examples like the Citizens' Assembly, the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit and the Government's future of Europe citizen's dialogue national engagement process which show what can be done.  What we need is some kind of permanent programme of citizen involvement, not just on issues but on an ongoing basis.  I have already mentioned European Movement Ireland and the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, both of which have an important role to play.  More frequent debates in the Oireachtas on EU policies would also be helpful and there are examples in other member states that are worth examining.  This committee might like to consider whether there could be more regular reporting on the floor of the D&aacute;il on significant EU meetings and issues as they develop.  We need to find ways to stimulate a real debate in the media and to move away from the kind of polarisation and politicisation that has too often been how EU differences of opinion are portrayed.  The first step would be to agree that we need a deeper and more inclusive debate and then I am sure there would be a lot of good ideas about how to make it happen.  I do not think there is necessarily a need to develop a new body to do it but rather to use the existing structures to inject a deeper EU dimension into many of the ongoing processes already in place.</p><p> We all know that the EU post-Brexit is going to be different.  The issue is how to prepare to get the best out of the next stage of our own membership of the EU and alliance building is clearly going to be a very important component of that.  There are member states with which we have a lot of common and it will be easy to team up with them but there are also those who have very different views.  We have a natural advantage because we are not in any one geographic or political grouping so we can move easily between different groups, depending on our interests.  I have already explained why we need to have a concept of alliance building that includes the domestic arena and not just building alliances with other countries and institutions.  The most important alliance of all has to be with our own citizens because they need to feel that they are involved and that their voice is heard.  We have seen through the different referendum campaigns that we need a more sustained level of communication and information to maintain the high level of support for the EU in this country.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today.  I wish members success in their deliberations and look forward to seeing the results of their labour.  If I can be of any help now or in the future, the committee should not hesitate to involve me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019040300002#C00300"><p>I also thank Dr. Day for her very comprehensive presentation.  While I do not want to turn this room into an echo chamber by agreeing with Dr. Day, it must be said that I do agree with pretty much everything she said.  I will make a number of points in response to her remarks and then ask a few questions.</p> <p>  One of the areas that is very much lacking is the level of parliamentary and inter-parliamentary engagement.  Some of us are lucky to get the opportunity every six months to travel to the COSAC meetings but outside of that arena there are limited opportunities for domestic politicians, both Deputies and Senators, as distinct from MEPs, to engage.  The introduction of direct elections and the abolition of the dual mandate for the European Parliament means that MEPs meet as members of the European Parliament, which is great but domestic parliamentarians do not engage very much with their European counterparts.  I am talking here about engaging on a sectoral basis.  Rather than just having COSAC meetings every six months, there should be an agricultural, finance or justice version, bringing all those committees together and shadowing the relevant European Council meetings.  I was fortunate to spend just over two years on the Committee of the Regions and one of the best elements of that work was that we were dealing with domestic politicians and making comparisons in terms of what works.  That was subsidiarity in action in terms of taking European policies to the member states.</p> <p>  I agree with Dr. Day about the need for increasing the presence of Irish diplomats across Europe, particularly within our permanent representation in Brussels.  It was a real shame that we reduced the numbers after the 2013 Presidency and then had to build those numbers back up.  That said, we have many excellent people over there, which has been very evident over the last two and a half years.  We really need to expand our key embassies.  One of the greatest achievements during the crisis years was keeping all the embassies open but we now need to increase embassy staff numbers and the numbers of people from State agencies like Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia who are based in Europe.  There is also a need for additional consular outreach.  We need to augment our embassies as well as our existing consular network.  I am thinking in particular of the consulate in Edinburgh, the recently reopened consulate in Cardiff as well as the planned consulate for northern England which will open within the next 12 months.  There is another consulate coming on stream in Germany and there is talk of opening one in southern France but there is significant scope for expansion across the EU, particularly in the context of European cities that are similar in size to Irish cities.  </p> <p>  Dr. Day made reference to her generation of Irish European officials and said that we are losing so many good people.</p><p>I know they are not being replaced and there will be a huge gap there.  One of the reasons I left Brussels in 2007 was that Dublin was a lot more attractive to come back to than it was 25 years ago.  Something that puts off a lot of people is the scare of the concours and of admission into the institutions themselves.  We see a lot of people working in the private sector in Brussels or in agency-related work who are unwilling to go into the Commission.  It is not money or conditions that turns them off, it is the linguistics.  Much emphasis is rightly put on the status of the Irish language but I have fears about the number of people in the institutions who will have a command of English as a first language after Brexit.  Increasingly, we see English as the working language of the EU whereas previously it was French.  Can anything be done in terms of a derogation to prioritise native English speakers in a European context, possibly by giving them exemptions in the concours or preferential status?  There are only so many Maltese and Irish citizens.  Many of the British European officials over the past 15 or 20 years were on secondment from Departments as opposed to coming through the direct admission system.  There needs to be a level of flexibility that possibly has not been there before.</p><p> There are two aspects of citizens' engagement that are critical.  The European Commission is brilliant at informing the people on how they can complain about the EU and, unfortunately, this allows many of the myths to continue, particularly in the tabloid media.  If we have to read one more article about blue passports and straight bananas we will all go a bit mad but it does resonate.  Perhaps we need to be a little more abrasive and counter the myths.  Perhaps the European Commission or, to be honest, domestic politicians, need to be a bit more direct in championing all the good that Europe has done over the past more than 60 years.  I am not just talking about mobile phone roaming but the really deep things that my generation take for granted.  We can go all the way back to peace if we want.  The European Commission and the European institutions as a whole could be a lot more aggressive in selling the narrative and taking on the absolute ridiculousness that is presented.</p><p> With regard to engagement, a concept alien to this country but perhaps not to others is the spitzenkandidat.  It worked well at the previous European elections.  I am happily contributing to the campaign of Manfred Weber for these European elections.  It is not a system that we, in Ireland, necessarily appreciate because we do not use the list system.  I am sure it would require direct treaty change but potentially we could directly elect the Commission President, with confines such as guaranteeing nomination by a political group or a mass number of European citizens.  People would have to go into the voting booth and put a No. 1 or an X beside their choice of candidate rather than it being indirect.  We do not have the list system in this country and no one knows that Manfred Weber will be the top of the Fine Gael list on 24 May.  It would probably mean voters would get half a dozen ballot papers this time, given the other elections that will be happening and the referendum being held on the same day, but we need to familiarise ourselves with it.  It might also force political groups to narrow it down to one candidate.  This is a challenge I put to my colleagues.</p><p> These are a few ideas and suggestions on which I would love to get the opinion of Dr. Day.  I have more specific questions on the nature of alliances.  Dr. Day touched on some of these.  How best can we approach these natural alliances?  Is it in a sectoral manner?  We know Ireland and France have always worked hand in glove when it comes to agricultural policy and the CAP.  Would it be an ideological approach when it comes to monetary policy, now that Ireland sees itself far more as northern European?  Dr. Day spoke about the New Hanseatic League.  Is it geographic?  The UK was our closest neighbour and it was obvious to link up with it beyond policy but it will not be there so it really does fall on us to increase our engagement with the Benelux countries and possibly some of the others that are simply closer to home.</p><p> Dr. Day mentioned at length the smaller member states.  How can we prioritise what policy we can identify with?  The policies of Luxembourg differ drastically from those of Estonia.  Does she mean any smaller state?  With which smaller state should we identify and in which areas?  We do not need to be rigid.  Just because we are an ally of one country on one issue does not mean we cannot be an ally of another country on another issue.  The most important alliance I believe, and it is a political alliance as much as anything else, is the alliance against euroscepticism and how best can we come together and take on the populists on the hard left and the hard right, some of whom are in governments.  This is the biggest challenge.  The most important alliance is bringing together countries, be they part of the European movement for more than 60 years or since 2013, and state we want this peace process and movement to continue.  How do we build this alliance and solidify it?  Unfortunately, for too long we have probably taken that alliance for granted and I say this against domestic politicians.  It has been too easy for too long to blame Brussels.  We need to take responsibility for our own actions.  We need to triumph initiatives and ideas that come from a European level and we need to give them the level of support and credit they deserve.  Equally, we cannot simply use the perceived foreign bogeyman as somehow being responsible for all our ills.  Of all alliances, this is the most important to build up.  I would welcome Dr. Day's opinions on this.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that the role she continues to play will bear good fruit in the future as it has in the past.  I happened to be at a meeting in Bucharest for the past two days at which the same subject matter was up for debate.  I have been attending meetings for a long time in Europe.  I have been doing it for almost 40 years, when I think of it.  The same questions come around again and again with regard to bringing Europe closer to the people.  The phrase is wrong.  It should be the other way round, along the lines that Senator Richmond has been speaking about.  The people and we, as representatives of the people, need to familiarise ourselves more with what affects our colleagues in other countries throughout Europe.  Unfortunately, what Britain did was that it stood aloof from Europe.  In the days of Henry Plumb, for example, it was different but since then the critique has gone on without cessation and there has been constant criticism.  Constant dripping wears a stone, and it did.  Let us not forget that Nigel Farage and such people were elected for this purpose and became the lightning rod for debate in the area, to the extent they dominated the debate whenever it took place, which was regularly.</p> <p>  We had presentations of this nature at the meeting on the future of Europe I attended in recent days with extremes of right and left.  I was reminded of a similar meeting I attended in Berlin a few years ago when the order paper asked "Where is social Europe?".  This was at the very beginning of the economic crash.  Nobody seemed to understand that when times got really bad other distractions arose and leaders throughout Europe had to attend to the issues that were of the most serious domestic importance and they did so, largely with beneficial effect.  Again, sadly, Britain took the opportunity to criticise at that particular time and much of the media in the UK was dedicated to a constant critique of where Europe was and how it was going to fail.  We seem to have forgotten in recent years that the prediction was the euro was about to fail and disintegrate and the reasons for it came largely from the media in the UK and they were not all tabloid.</p> <p>  I am sure that at various meetings we have all had to listen to a tirade of how poor we were and how much poorer we were going to get as a result of being members of the European Union.  We need to take ownership.  We have done this better than most other countries but every member of the European Union needs to take ownership of the Union.  If they do not do so they will move apart and populism will win out.  It is hugely important the elected public representatives throughout Europe, in domestic politics and in the European Parliament, take on the critics and those offering the easy options.  Let us not forget this is not the first time populism invaded Europe.  This is not the first time by a long shot.  Those who say it can never happen again are wrong.  These things have happened again.  Man's inhumanity to man knows no bounds when it comes to repetition.</p><p>We need to be conscious of that and of the fact that we can do something about it.  My feeling, based on the discussions over the past couple of days, is that we need to be alert.  We need to speak.  Without doing it aggressively, we need to dissect the arguments put forward by people pursuing a populist stance and prove to them by reason that they are wrong, and the extremes on both sides are wrong.</p><p> The alliances are most important.  That is the way to do it.  It is part of the natural progression of getting to know the other people better.  I entirely agree with Senator Richmond that the national politicians need to get to know each other.  How else do all of us here understand the issues that affect other people?  There are deep worrying issues affecting every country in the European Union, as they do in every country all over the world.  It is up to ourselves to be familiar with and sympathetic towards them, and if we do not find ourselves in agreement with them that at least we understand them and can do something about it in that way.</p><p> I hope that we do not disintegrate towards a world trade war.  There were a few hints at it in the past few days.  There is a danger that we could descend into a tit-for-tat situation.  We had to explain yesterday to some people that trade agreements are not the gift of one group, one country or one philosophy.  They are reached by agreement.  The late Peter Sutherland spent considerable time negotiating the GATT many years ago.  A feeling seems to be developing that the most powerful should dictate the pace and that, by so doing, they will achieve a situation that they could not achieve by agreement through natural discussion and dialogue.  That is a worrying factor, and it is particularly worrying for smaller countries.  In the aggression that takes place in trade wars, the smaller countries get damaged first and hit hardest, and the protagonists unfortunately damage each other to the extent that the fallout is the same again in so far as the smaller countries are concerned.</p><p> I am a little concerned about the drop-off in the Civil Service involvement in Brussels.  That is something we should directly address.  That should be addressed in the educational system and through the diplomatic services here.  It should be done as a matter of urgency.  We need to educate people for those positions in Brussels in all organisations that we Europeans converge on for whatever reason.</p><p> Europe is going through a hiatus at present.  Questions are being raised in a number of member states, which we would regard unreasonable because all the alternatives put forward have been tried previously and failed.  What is it with people sometimes that we must go back and have the same debate, often in trying circumstances, despite the fact that there is strong evidence to show that they failed previously?  We can go back centuries and find the same thing.  Europe has its own heritage in that area.  We need not go back beyond the 20th century to find out all that we could do wrong and the depths to which we could go to inflict the maximum punishment on each other with death and destruction in all directions.  For any generation, and particularly the present generation, of politicians from whichever side to forget that is a sad reflection on society.</p><p> I thank Dr. Day for the work that she continues to do in that area, and particularly for flagging for us what was happening before it happened.  I believe greatly in the maxim that to be able to avert a crisis before it becomes recognised as a crisis is a greater art than trying to deal with it when the place is in flames.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019040300002#E00200"><p>I thank Dr. Day for her comprehensive presentation and for setting out a number of practical suggestions on how we can operate and improve matters generally from an Irish point of view.  I recall her speaking at the AGM of the European Movement Ireland at the height of the Brexit crisis, which we are still in, where she expressed concerns about Ireland taking its eye off the ball regarding a number of other developments taking place in Europe, such as the future of Europe, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and migration.  Does she still hold those concerns?  She set out the agenda, but does she think that Brexit has completely taken over our public administration system and does she hold concerns about all these other development which are proceeding?</p> <p>  President Macron has set out his vision for Europe and we do not agree with everything that he has said.  He is to be congratulated for producing a thought-provoking vision of the future of Europe.  States can be divided into three categories: nation states, which do not want to make any more changes, and the view of which is that one should pull up the ladder and what we have we hold: other nation states, which believe in incremental change on a pragmatic basis in the interests of citizens, in which camp, I suggest, Ireland is; and a third category, which believes in deeper integration of the European Union.  I am not sure that Irish people are fully convinced about the need for deeper integration.  We have seen that in our referendums.  Any case for deeper integration will have to be clearly put before them and the rationale for it explained, and there would have to be a lot of public debate.  How does Dr. Day see the movement across the nation states?  Is there an inexorable move towards deeper integration or will it be stalled and will there be difficulty realising President Macron's vision?</p> <p>  The UK leaving the EU poses a major challenge for us.  For all sorts of reasons, the UK was an ally on various issues.  Alliances now will have to be formed again on these issues, including farm support, tax, security and defence, and social policies.  Dr. Day set out some guidelines on that.  How are we doing in this regard?  Are we engaged in that process?  As I stated earlier, our public administration system is convulsed by the fallout from Brexit.  Are we doing well in forging new alliances or does much work need to be done?  I agree with the two previous speakers that the big alliance will be an alliance against populism and we know where we stand in that regard.</p> <p>  I have one final question.  In one way, it is an innocent question.  We have a view that the Irish people are popular, everybody loves us and we punch above our weight.  We have good interpersonal skills, to which Dr. Day made reference in her presentations, and diplomatic skills, and our public servants are excellent in respect of diplomacy, etc., but how are we considered generally in the European Commission and across the nation states?  She has much experience.  We were a bold child in 2008 when our banks collapsed and we needed a bailout and we are certainly causing problems at present regarding the Border, etc.  I suppose it is a light-hearted question.  How are we viewed generally in the European Union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019040300002#E00300"><p>Before I make a few comments, I will explain that Senators Craughwell and Coghlan and Deputy O'Rourke were here but had to leave.  It is not disrespectful; it is merely that the Seanad was resuming and they had to attend.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Noelle O'Connell, the director of European Movement Ireland, the ambassadors and many others in the Public Gallery.  I particularly welcome another important group of people from the greater Beaufort area just outside of Killarney, which, of course, everybody knows is the tourism capital of the world and the finest place in the nation that anybody could be from.</p><p>I thank Dr. Day for attending the committee.  She discussed her view that the Oireachtas has a further role to play in alliance building.  Are there any ways that she feels this committee could contribute to this?</p><p> The committee regularly meets stakeholders.  On Tuesday mornings, for example, I meet ambassadors from all over Europe, as well as with other officials.  I relay the contents of those meetings to the committee members.  I believe building alliances, friendships and relationships is what politics is all about.  As we discussed earlier, if our neighbours across the water were as good at talking at length as we are, they might not have found themselves in their present mess.</p><p> We have to mind our backs because of what is happening over there.  We deal with visiting parliamentary delegations.  Are there any other ways we could further use our platform to build alliances with other member states, as well as with our citizens, to create positivity about Europe?  As Dr. Day knows from her important position, there seems to be a negative attitude towards Europe.  When something goes wrong, it is deemed to be the fault of those politicians in Europe.  Can we turn that around, especially in light of seeing what our neighbours across the water have done by backing themselves into a corner?  Can we use that in some way to shore ourselves up?</p><p> The EU 26 has expressed strong support for Ireland and our position in the Brexit negotiations, often demonstrating a deep understanding of Ireland and its challenges.  Does Dr. Day believe there are opportunities to build upon this wave of support?  Much of the work on alliance building has been focused on government level and established diplomatic channels.  We are interested in expanding this and looking at the important role parliamentarians can play in alliance building.  The committee participates in COSAC, the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, and other interparliamentary groupings which are valuable fora for networking with parliamentarians from other EU member states.  We meet stakeholders and visiting delegations.  Our committee members are proactive and workmanlike in their job.  Will Dr. Day recommend how we can further develop our existing interparliamentary networks?</p><p> Is there a risk that focusing on alliances between individual member states could contribute to perceived divisions within the EU, such as geographical divisions or divisions between established and newer member states?  Is this an opportunity to move away from this?  Alliances start with understanding.  Are there any particular member states which Dr. Day believes Ireland could understand better?  Does she see us falling down in our role in any of this?</p><p> Most think of alliances as only those between countries.  However, we are interested in how understandings and co-operation can be better developed between other stakeholders, such as trade unions, farming organisations and various interest groups.  Does Dr. Day believe these organisations, working with their European peers, can contribute to improved knowledge?  All politicians, whether they are county councillors, Senators or Deputies, know of the valuable contribution that the likes of, for example, the IFA, the ICMSA, the Irish Hotels Federation and others working in the tourism sector make.  Councillors, Senators and Deputies have built up expertise from years of work, traipsing up and down the country going to meetings, listening to the people involved in farming or tourism about their issues and concerns.</p><p> Local and European elections will be held in May.  I have no agenda in promoting or not promoting political parties.  I do not care from what party people person comes, provided they are good workers.  That is all I am interested in.  They can be Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Independent or Sinn F&eacute;in.  If they are workers, I am behind them.  If they are not, it does not matter what stamp they have on their back because they are no good in my book.  Either one is a worker or one is not.  Can we use our MEPs more?  I see a lack of connectivity between our MEPs.  It is no disrespect to them as individuals.  I do not mean to say anything disparaging about them.  Citizens, irrespective of whether they vote, think of MEPs as being away over in Europe, having nothing to do with them.  They do, however, have much to do with us.  Dr. Day, more than anyone else in this room, knows that because of her impressive work history.  Can we create a greater engagement not just between Members and MEPs but between the citizens?  It is the citizens who are the bosses and who we must represent.  After the May elections, I hope there will be greater engagement at ground level and people would be able to see something from their politicians in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Day" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019040300002#F00200"><p>Members have raised an array of interesting points.</p> <p>  On the question of how do we push back against the tide of populism and maintain a feeling across the European population that Europe is a plus and takes nothing away from them nationally but gives extras, I do not believe that battle can be fought and won by the Brussels machinery alone.  What are missing are the national voices in support of what is going on.  It is important to distinguish between the overall architecture and the individual decisions we do not like.  In modern society, we have a tendency to conflate the two and claim the EU is useless and no good because of one matter or issue we do not like.</p> <p>  During the euro crisis, because of my role, I was in meetings with the Heads of Government.  I watched them sometimes go through 24 hour long meetings, wrestling with the euro problems.  It left me with the strong conviction that, in the end, with the exception of the UK, they all want the EU to succeed and will take the hard decisions when they absolutely have to.  No matter how differently they approach matters, they all know all of our European countries are small in the modern world and we have no hope of influencing the wider world if we do not act as a grouping.  They all want a different kind of EU but want it to succeed.  That is a good starting point.</p> <p>  In some ways, we are still digesting the 2004 enlargement.  In a way, each of those countries which joined then felt it would be the 16th member state while the rest of the EU felt we would go on as before.  We are still working out how a much larger EU with different traditions and expectations has to find its way.  We are going through quite a challenge, both from older and newer member states, to our values.  It is not unique to geography.  Having seen them in dire times, my conviction is that they all have a reason to want it to survive.</p> <p>  Greece, for example, is still going through a difficult time.  It has not wanted to leave the euro or the EU because it understands its future would be even more difficult without all that membership brings.</p><p>The challenge is for national politicians to talk about the EU in more positive terms, but not to be starry-eyed and claim it is all wonderful.  They need to give a more mature assessment to people emphasising that 27, 26 or ten others need to be brought on board.  It is important that small countries are represented and at the table and have a say.  There are reasons that we agree to the things we do.<br/><br/>Legally, qualified majority voting is the norm in all legislation but the EU very rarely pushes things to a vote.  It may take another six months or a year to bring the reluctant on board continuing trying to find compromises because there is more inclusivity but also better implementation if everybody has signed up to whatever has been decided.  It is only really <i>in extremis</i>when everything has broken down and there is a need to make a decision that issues are pushed to a vote.  I do not mean the voting process needs to be explained every day, but there needs to be a sharing of responsibility for taking decisions at EU level.<br/><br/>In my time as Secretary General, I was really frustrated when the European Council spent all night drafting its conclusions and then 28 Prime Ministers gave different press conferences on what had just happened instead of spending 24 hours drafting the conclusions and stating, &quot;This is what we agreed&quot;, without the need to put a national spin on it.  Wrongly, in my view, a number of national politicians of all different parties feel somehow that they have to come out of these meetings and say something different or say how they had to fight for a national point of view instead of saying they had collectively come to a conclusion they believe will be good for all of us because everybody had their fingerprints on it.  That is one aspect.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Brussels cannot do a better job; it can.  It can do many things to improve the situation.  If it is always an outside voice trying to argue the merits of the EU, it has lost in advance.  It has to be the members.  It is like any club; the members have to want it to succeed.  My conviction is that they do but we will still have much debate over a long time to come to hammer out where we want to go next.  Some of that will not be comfortable for Ireland because we will not have the same harmony of views as we had with the UK on many things - not on everything, but on many things.<br/><br/>We need to pay careful attention to the trade situation.  The member is absolutely right in saying we are coming to a stage where some people believe might is right and that the biggest can call the shots.  That is the kind of denial of the multilateral world from which we have benefited considerably in the past 70 years.  In this area Europe must hold to its views and try to bring together many other countries in the world that think like us.  The recent EU-Japan trade deal is a very good example of other big trading blocs in the world that believe in the rule of law, negotiated agreements and the mutual interest that can be negotiated.  We need to find those alliances and build them.<br/><br/>The EU has been behind in social policy, not only but largely because of British opposition to developing social policies.  There has to be a better way for those who gain from globalisation and open trade to share more of the benefits with those who inevitably will lose or feel penalised by it.  That is a big challenge for Europe in the years to come.  If we do not get that right, we will retreat in the face of pressure from the United States, China, etc.  We will also retreat into a less open way of doing business.  This will not be good for the smaller countries that make their living from it.<br/><br/>I am concerned about the number of new Irish officials in the institutions.  I know the competitions are difficult, but as Senator Richmond stated, many young Irish people working in Brussels in consultancy companies, advocacy organisations, etc., would love to work for the institutions.  However, I do not believe it is right to seek a language derogation.  The British have argued for that for years, but it goes down extremely badly with the other countries from where many people have to learn more than one other language in order to be able to work in a multilingual environment.  However, some help could be given in that area.  There are examples of helping people who are going through the process to improve their language skills.  That would not cost very much and would be a better way.  It is very important for people to show they have made an effort to learn another language in order to understand and reach out to a different culture.  That kind of thing is well regarded in the rest of the European Union.  We need to be alive to encouraging younger people and helping them deal with the machinery involved.<br/><br/>How are we doing on new alliances?  Many of the smaller countries are going through the same thinking process as Ireland to work out how they can group together to be more effective.  I think there is a welcome for Ireland in many of these groupings, but we will need to do more to understand their problems and positions.  We may need to give them more support in areas in which we might have had little interest in the past.  I always tell the story of one of my Luxembourg colleagues who, even though his country is not located near the sea, was a specialist in the Common Fisheries Policy.  When asked why he bothered, he would say, &quot;It is because it is important to my other colleagues.  I want to be able to brief my Ministers and tell them how we think it should go but also how to help them.&quot;  It will require more effort on our part.<br/><br/>We tend to be very pragmatic.  There is a more visionary dimension to how other countries see the EU.  We might need to get more lyrical in understanding the less pragmatic side of things.  We are always viewed as being well prepared and I think we would be welcome.  We and the other small member states will need to work harder together to replace the expertise the UK brought to many sectoral forums.  Their analysis was always very well prepared.  They had always thought ahead of the consequences.  They played an important role in questioning and improving proposals.  We will all miss that expertise.  Alliances can be formed by sharing out that work among not always exclusively the member smaller states, but certainly with the smaller member states.<br/><br/>The role of visits is very important.  A number of national parliamentary delegations have come here and have gone to the Border.  They wanted to see for themselves and having seen for themselves, they became important allies in the overall building of support for Ireland.  We could selectively do a bit more of that, going to visit places or attend meetings that are important to other states.  That really builds a well of goodwill and understanding that we will need in the future.<br/><br/>I want to speak about the dangers of overspecialisation on sectors.  It is natural that the people who know most about technology, agriculture or whatever will club together.  While that sharing of experience is very important, it is also important for somebody to have an overview.  For example, this committee is one place that has the overview.  When things do not get sorted out and they start to go up the political agenda of the European Union, a kind of hierarchy applies and there is only political space to deal with a certain number of issues.  It is very important in every system that we have an accurate readout of the relative weight of different things.  I am thinking of the debates to come on the future budget of the EU which will need to be decided fairly quickly once the new European Parliament and Commission are in place.  Every country will have its own set of priorities.  Somehow each country needs to have somebody who is watching the gradual filtering down of the issues to the top three or four that will be decided by the European Council.  While it is important to have a like-on-like sectoral view, it is also important to have an overview and to keep a national track of that.</p><p> There is a risk of geographic division but if we have visiting rights, so to speak, to all of the different groups, we would be a welcome party if we make an effort to participate from time to time.  Ours is not the agenda of a big country and we will not always be pushing a particular line.  We will have our views but we mainly want things to work.  As a country, we could avoid falling into the trap of being seen as only part of a certain group.</p><p> There is, inevitably, some truth in the idea of Brexit eclipsing all other issues for the moment.  It is the major issue for Ireland.  The risk of a no-deal Brexit has demanded an enormous amount of energy and it is the top priority.  The need for that focus will lessen at some stage and, hopefully, in positive circumstances.  We will then have to come back to the big issues on the European agenda, including the future budget, obviously, but also migration.  We will have to find a European policy to deal with that.  One could also mention many other issues and this is why it is important that there has been dialogue on the EU after Brexit.  It is difficult to get people to really concentrate on that at the moment but at least the topic is there.  Work is being done on the issue across Government and many stakeholder organisations and that can be ramped up when there is a bit more political space and time for it.  It is important.</p><p> Turning to the issue of how we can address negativity, we need to do more to debunk the myths surrounding the EU but that is not an easy thing to do.  The UK media in particular have developed ridicule into a fine art and that is most damaging.  We can see the way Nigel Farage always gets a laugh in the European Parliament, even from people who do not agree with him.  It is devastating.  We have to work harder to try to explain the EU and one way to do that is to involve the stakeholders more.  When I speak to representative groups, no matter who they are or what they represent, I am struck by the fact that their knowledge of their sectors across Europe is usually quite high.  That is because those groups are all linked into European networks.  It is also the case, however, that the groups in question tend to be quite narrow in their specialisations.  We need to graft this overview of where the European Union as a whole is going onto that specialisation.</p><p> We may also at times need to return to the simpler issue of why it matters that the EU works.  We all feel very European when we go outside of the EU.  We look back in and then we see what it is that makes us different from the rest of the world.  We have to try and channel that feeling and explain to people that Europe stands for certain values we have benefited from and that we hold very dear.  Part of the debate taking place at present involves a battle for the place of values and what are the fundamental values at the foundation of the European Union to which everybody needs to adhere.</p><p> For all those reasons, we are going to have to invest more time and energy in reaching out to the other member states and trying to understand their different vantage points.  We do not feel the same security pressures, for example, that some other countries do because of our history and geography.  We tend, therefore, to be less open to that argument for wanting the EU to succeed.  The Baltic states, for example, joined the euro not only for economic reasons but also because they understood that it is at the core of the EU, which is where they want to be for security reasons.  We need to find ways to engage with that motivation even though it is not our primary concern and security is quite low on our list of priorities.  I suggest that kind of approach.  It would be useful for parliamentarians to reach out to groups of countries rather than to try to cover everybody at the same time.  It would make sense to target different groups over a certain time cycle.  In addition to COSAC meetings, it would also be useful to meet smaller groups of parliamentarians from the point of view of sometimes just listening but also of having them listen to us and seeing where alliances can be made.</p><p> There is much useful work going on in different countries about how to involve citizens.  Some of this has been documented and there are very innovative ways of trying to make this huge process relevant to different citizens.  We have experimented in this country with some forms of citizen involvement.  They have shown that people are willing to take the time to be involved if expertise and time is provided to help them formulate and think through their ideas.  If we have that citizen involvement, we can try to overcome the alienation of parts of society across Europe and try to develop a new understanding of what the value of the European Union is for the coming 20 or 30 years.  Each generation has to create its own definition of the EU.</p><p> I sympathise with Deputy Durkan who asked why we have to keep fighting the same battles all the time.  We have to do that because there is always a new generation of public representatives, lobbyists, etc.  They will always try their hand at stating that something is old hat and attempt to debunk it because there are so many interests at stake.  We have to not only repeat and explain why things are as they are but to also be open to change where it is good.  However, we should not necessarily change principles if we have tried and tested them and they are solid.  We need to bring people around to understanding why certain things are as they are.  I do, however, understand the fatigue of having to constantly repeat the battles.</p><p> One thing we do need to explain better to our citizens everywhere is just how much of the EU is built on compromise.  In some parts of the world, compromise is seen as a weakness and almost as a dirty word, whereas in Europe we see it as a strength.  It is about understanding different points of view and finding an accommodation.  We all know that in our own lives so we need to bring that home to people and explain not everything is not black and white.  It is about finding common ground in between.  Everybody will not get everything they want but everybody has to get enough of what they want to bring everybody along.  That subtlety has been lost in our polarised world.  I know I have not covered every point made by members but perhaps I could pause there.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, HSE, Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director, CervicalCheck, and Ms Michele Tait, implementation lead for the Scally report, HSE.</p> <p>  The HSE remains extremely conscious of women&rsquo;s concerns regarding cervical screening over the past year and, in particular, many women&rsquo;s anxieties due to the delays in reporting on smear test results.  The HSE is doing its utmost in order to find solutions to these waiting times and we apologise to the women for these delays and for the upset caused.  We continue to address and manage a vast range of issues that have emerged as a result of the crisis in the CervicalCheck programme last April.  Our priority areas include stabilising and strengthening our cervical screening programme; continuing to support women and families who were directly impacted by the CervicalCheck crisis; implementing Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations; strengthening governance arrangements; enhancing the quality assurance of the programme and advancing the implementation of HPV primary screening.  This report, previously circulated to the committee, updates on these key areas of priority.</p> <p>  In the area of supports to women and families, our information line continues to provide information to women who are understandably anxious at delays in accessing their results.  We also support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories where required for legal review.  The client services unit in our national screening service continues to support this process and, to date, 118 out of 125 slide requests have been dealt with, on average, within 27.5 days while seven requests are currently work in progress. </p> <p>  We continue to support the women impacted through the 221+ group through our community liaison officers.  The community liaison officers support women and their families in provision of the support packages provided to government.  We are also developing a public and patient inclusion plan for our screening services.  We have established a patient panel for cervical screening that has already provided critical input into aspects such as communication and Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations.  We have also brought patient representatives on to a number of key project groups within our screening services.  We are very grateful to the many patient representatives who voluntarily give up their time to support our screening programmes.  We have made a start in this area and remain committed to bringing patients to the centre of our screening programmes.</p> <p>  We are continuing to support the independent international expert panel review being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, RCOG, which was established by the Minister for Health, for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process, established a national helpdesk, developed an eligible dataset with the National Cancer Registry and implemented a client management system to support the RCOG.  In recent weeks the laboratories have commenced the transfer of slides and the RCOG estimates that it will take six months for the process to conclude.</p> <p>  On programme turnaround times, in 2018 around 370,000 women presented to the programme, an increase from 280,000 in 2017, or approximately 90,000 in total.  We remain concerned at the length of time being taken for reporting of cervical smears.  Over half of samples received are being processed within 15 weeks, although it can take up to 33 weeks for the report to be provided.  There is currently a backlog of some 79,500 slides.</p> <p>  We have worked with existing private providers, other private providers and public service providers in other countries to try to grow our laboratory capacity.  Some of our existing providers have managed to reduce the wait times and we continue to work with others to try to find additional capacity.  While we continue to pursue active leads, this has proved very challenging due to the global shortage in cytology.  This has been caused by a reduced cytology requirement as countries implement HPV primary screening, which sees a reduction of approximately 80% for cytology requirements.  We are actively trying to identify possible solutions that will help reduce the wait times which we know are causing a lot of anxiety for women.  While this is very undesirable, our clinical advice is that this poses a very low risk to women.  Notwithstanding this, we recognise that these delays are extremely difficult for women and we are making every effort to improve this situation.  We have made significant improvements in the turnaround times with two of our three laboratories and are working closely on an improvement plan with the third laboratory.  We are absolutely focused on reducing waiting times for results as quickly as possible. </p> <p>  A key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  The HSE signed agreements with both providers to enable continuity of the programme.  The HSE also made a decision to expand the public laboratory capacity and an agreement was reached with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to do so.  This will provide a better balance between public and private laboratory capacity provision.</p> <p>  An initial capital allocation was made to develop a national cervical screening laboratory at the Coombe.  A project steering group and project team are now in place with building and workforce plans being developed.  While we are planning for a rapid building programme through a modular development, it will still take a number of years to implement, primarily due to the workforce challenges.</p> <p>  We are progressing plans to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team is in place and is progressing the seven work streams involved in the project.  We have completed a review of international HPV primary screening implementations.  The review informs us that our critical path will be the availability of a provider and the timescales to implement the ICT systems to support HPV primary screening.</p><p>Furthermore, ICT testing is under way, development of education and training materials has commenced and our procurement team has started the tender process for laboratory services with a pre-tender market engagement session held before Christmas.</p><p> A contract notice is about to issue, which will seek formal bids from laboratory service providers.  Our market engagement has identified significant challenges and concerns in the provider community that we are addressing as we move into the tendering process, to ensure that we are successful in acquiring a laboratory service provider.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening as soon as possible, with the critical path to be determined by the tender process that is under way.</p><p> The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan, in collaboration with other State agencies, in response to the Scally review recommendations.  We have appointed a senior manager, Ms Tait, to oversee the implementation and established a HSE implementation oversight group, jointly chaired by our chief clinical officer and deputy director general of operations.  We have now developed a set of 101 actions arising from recommendations that are the responsibility of the HSE to implement and we are reviewing appropriate actions against each recommendation as the implementation progresses.  Examples of progress to date include key appointments and governance changes.  An organisational review of risk management structures has also been commissioned by the HSE in addition to the establishment of an expert group within the national screening service to review clinical audit processes across all screening programmes.</p><p> An interim revision of the HSE open disclosure policy has been completed and approved by the HSE directorate and the process of communicating this and ensuring its implementation throughout the system will commence in the coming weeks pending a more detailed review in late 2019.  The HSE has also reviewed and updated its national financial regulations policy on procurement documentation.  All six recommendations from Dr. Scally's interim report have now been fully implemented, resulting in significant improvements in the information and supports provided to women and other service users on our cervical screening programme.  The HSE has maintained open communication with patient representatives on the implementation plan and will continue to work collaboratively with them throughout 2019.</p><p> We have continued to strengthen the governance and management of our screening services.  We have established an interim management team in the national screening service, with the reassignment of senior people to key positions while we fill these positions on a permanent basis.  We recently appointed a director of public health and CervicalCheck clinical director, Dr. Doherty, and a CervicalCheck laboratory quality assurance lead.  In addition, a risk committee for our screening services, which is independently chaired, was put in place in the third quarter of 2018.  An interim quality and risk manager was also appointed in the third quarter of 2018 and implementation of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations on strengthening our quality assurance processes has commenced.  We have also identified a number of priority positions for implementation, which are currently going through the approval process.</p><p> I assure members that the HSE is absolutely focused on stabilising the cervical screening programme to enable us to progress the introduction of a new enhanced HPV primary screening testing methodology.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.</p><p> Following the recent untimely death of Laura Brennan, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Laura's work in promoting the HPV vaccine and the importance of cervical screening in the most difficult of personal circumstances.  I had the privilege of meeting her and I know that she was an inspiration to us all through her dedication, bravery and humour.  We all have a responsibility to take up her crusade to eliminate cervical cancer in Ireland.  Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this most difficult time.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

I know they are all working very hard on trying to clear up some of the damage being done to what appears to have been one of the most successful screening programmes of its kind anywhere in the world.  I will start with accountability and move into some of the waiting times and what is being done.  I would also like to look at the waiting times for colposcopy.  While there has been a lot of focus on the number of women waiting for test results and the amount of time they are waiting, there has not been as much focus on women waiting for access to colposcopy because these referrals have also increased.  Approximately 80,000 women are waiting for test results.  Some have been waiting for more than eight months.  Waiting times for referral for colposcopy have also increased.  The HPV test, which was due to launch last September, appears to have been delayed indefinitely.  We do not have dates.  "As soon as possible" is the language being used.  We know this is largely due to the offer of the free out of cycle test because there were 90,000 additional tests that overloaded the system.</p> <p>  We know that on Wednesday, 24 April 2018, the story broke from the steps of the High Court.  We know that two days later, in spite of having never met the senior management of CervicalCheck, the Minister said publicly he had no confidence in them.  We know this was interpreted by many as there being a problem with the programme itself.  We know that at approximately 4 p.m. the following day the Minister tweeted the offer of a free out of cycle smear test.  To this day, the Minister maintains that before the offer of the test was made there was no clinical advice not to do so.  He has stated this categorically.  In response to a parliamentary question three weeks ago, he told me neither he nor his officials received advice that recommended against the tests in advance of the decision.  He went further in the D&aacute;il and said that those who persisted in stating he acted against official advice were incorrect and had misled the D&aacute;il.  That is a pretty strong position from the Minister.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we received a submission from Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, who was the clinical lead at the time.  Dr. Henry is referenced in her submission.  What she states directly contradicts the Minister's position.  What she states suggests the Minister has misled the D&aacute;il for the second time.  He misled the D&aacute;il on the children's hospital and has apologised for doing so.</p> <p>  We now know that at lunchtime on that Saturday, the Department of Health called the national screening service after a meeting attended by Dr. Henry.  He is in no way implicated in the advice, he is just referenced as having been there.  Dr. Flannelly stated Mr. Charles O'Hanlon, who was running the national screening service, received a call from the Department of Health regarding the offer of the out of cycle test.  She goes on to detail she met Mr. O'Hanlon and, in the strongest possible terms, advised against the tests.  Not only this, but she predicted what would come to pass.  She predicted what we are all dealing with here today.  She stated the laboratories would not have sufficient capacity for cytology if the offer was made and that this would lead to longer waiting times.  She predicted that the colposcopy service would not have the capacity to deal with the additional referrals and this has come to pass.  She also stated that most importantly it would fundamentally undermine the screening programme, which is exactly what this ill-advised offer did.  Critically, she states Mr. O'Hanlon called the Department of Health back within the hour, which was before the Minister tweeted his offer, which happened at 4.13 p.m.  We have very detailed evidence from Dr. Flannelly stating the Minister and-or his officials at the Department were advised by experts at the national screening service not to proceed and this offer was made before any announcement.  We have a timeline to back this up.  We also have evidence that the advice predicted the fundamental undermining of the programme, which is exactly what has happened.</p> <p>  At an official level, and I am not asking the witnesses a political question or asking them to peer inside the mind of the Minister, do the witnesses accept that expert clinical advice was given to the Department of Health before the decision was made to offer the free out of cycle smear test?</p></speech>

With regard to the pressure on the programme, approximately two thirds of the cases are out of cycle smear tests and one third are women who have re-engaged with the programme or new women, and this is positive.  Unfortunately, in the circumstances we are in, it has created pressure.  This is an important point of context with regard to overall pressure and positioning the out of cycle smears relative to the other impacts that have come on the programme as a result of the crisis.  Dr. Henry will comment on the other aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#G00500"><p>I became aware of Dr. Flannelly's advice last night when I received her statement.</p><p>Like most people I became aware of the announcement of the out-of-hours smear when it was announced publicly.  As a doctor, I understand screening and its rationale, the balance between risks and benefits and that the addition of out-of-cycle smears tilts the relative worth or value of the screening programme in one direction more than another.  I also recall significant public anxiety at the time.  When we set up our phone line around the same time, we were inundated with calls and could not keep up.  GPs were inundated with inquiries from women who were anxious about screening.  There was a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding, reflected not only in women's engagements with their GPs and calls to helplines but also in reporting and at the political level.  I understand screening and the justification for in-cycle and out-of-cycle smears and what that means.  However, when looking back it is reasonable to judge any decisions in the context of the time, that is, the great anxiety that prevailed among women in Ireland and the misinformation and misunderstanding. </p></speech>

Nonetheless, it is important to be led by clinical and expert advice on these issues.  As noted by Dr. Flannelly, overtesting has no medical benefit and can tilt into harm.  Is that fair?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#H00300"><p>I recently visited Public Health England.  That agency asks questions about British screening programmes and new proposed screening programmes.  When subjecting a healthy population to a test, the fundamental question is always whether it will do more good than harm.  All screening programmes which involve populations, as opposed to people who are unwell, involve that balance between creating value, reducing harm and avoiding inflicting harm.  The balance of interest is calculated-----</p></speech>

This may be a question for Dr. Doherty as the clinical lead.  Is there a medical benefit to offering the out-of-cycle test?</p></speech>

As he knows I have recently arrived in the CervicalCheck service.  I was not involved in the decision-making on this at the time.  Nevertheless, at the time we were dealing with a very difficult situation concerning confidence in the programme and anxiety among the population of women in Ireland, who were concerned about the result of their cervical smear and what that might mean for them.  When one is working in a crisis situation one often has to take decisions that one would not take in the cold light of day-----</p></speech>

I am asking a medical question of the clinical lead.  Is there a medical benefit to a shorter interval?</p></speech>

Where stress or distress is caused to a patient by a perceived lack of intervention it behoves medical practitioners to decide what is the most appropriate intervention to undertake.  In this scenario the decision to offer women the opportunity to avail of a free smear was taken collectively by the Government.  This was particularly important for women who were anxious and could not afford to pay for an additional smear.  A decision was taken at a point in time that the service was in crisis.  Ordinarily we would not advise women to have out-of-cycle smears unless there was a good reason to do so.</p></speech>

As the national director of services, does Mr. McCallion accept, given the submission we now have, that the decision to offer the out-of-cycle test was taken contrary to clinical advice provided by the national screening service?</p></speech>

We only had sight of the submission the Deputy refers to late last night.  I do not have a copy here.  I think it was tweeted somewhere.  Dr. Henry and Dr. Doherty have set out the programme's perspective.  We are not focusing on the timing.  To be blunt, my focus is on restoring the programme's credibility, finding capacity to deal with the backlog and resolving the many issues in front of us.</p></speech>

I have a final question on colposcopy.  A lot of data have been provided about women waiting to hear their test results.  What are the waiting times and how many are waiting who have been referred for colposcopy as part of the care pathway of the screening service, as opposed to for other reasons?</p></speech>

She met with the colposcopists as recently as yesterday.  In broad terms, colposcopy services are under pressure.  The turnaround times achieved are still good.  That is because extra sessions were provided for in anticipation of needs arising from human papillomavirus, HPV, screening.  That is not to say the service is not under very significant pressure.  It has seen a significant increase in referrals from GPs.  Women are anxious and are going to general practice, which has led to an increase.  During our previous appearance before the committee, Dr. McKenna discussed some of the solutions we are considering.  I will ask Dr. Doherty to speak about that based on her experience yesterday.</p></speech>

I had a meeting with the colposcopy community yesterday, which was the first time I have met with them since I took up the post.  I heard from my colleagues about their commitment to delivering a first-class service to the women of Ireland.  However, they are under pressure from the increased number of referrals to the programme from primary care and elsewhere.  I have seen from the data that colleagues have worked to increase the number of clinics available in most of the centres across Ireland, particularly those that generally have many patients referred for colposcopy.  In some cases they have doubled the number of sessions or added at least one or two sessions a week.  The data show that waiting times are not abnormally high at the moment.  We need to look at how we are going to support this going forward.  The additional capacity is being delivered in the context of goodwill and support for delivering this programme within hospitals.  We need to continue to support our colleagues in delivering that service.</p></speech>

The data show that the majority of centres achieve numbers like 100% or 86%.  There is a reasonably good rate of achievement of that target.  The percentage seen after 12 weeks is much higher.  In terms of performance, the service is sustaining quite intense pressure but nevertheless seems to be coping reasonably well for now.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, as Dr. Doherty said, there is significant pressure on the service.  There is a lot of work to be done with GPs.  As Dr. McKenna said during our previous appearance, gynaecological and other services and the model of working must also be examined.  Moreover, we have commissioned impact assessments through Dr. McKenna, who is the clinical director of the national women and infants health programme, to prepare ourselves for HPV screening.  That will result in a spike in colposcopy referrals on a phased basis over several years.  That will involve visiting each unit, looking at the short-term and long-term issues and identifying the resources needed to address them.  In particular, this will include re-engineering some of the pathways for patients for GPs.  That process is fairly well advanced.  That team has now visited approximately 75% of the units and will provide a set of recommendations on how we can strengthen that service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#H01600"><p>I thank all our witnesses.  I join Mr. McCallion in expressing sympathy to the family and friends of Ms Laura Brennan.  She did absolutely fantastic campaigning work at a time in her life most of us would not have been at all able to do so.  She took on the mantle and will always be remembered for the great work she did.</p> <p>  I am struggling with this.  I wish to discuss the pathway of communication between the HSE and the Department of Health.  I fully appreciate that the witnesses only saw this announcement last night, as did we.  It is very clear that advice was given which should have made its way to the Minister.  Despite that, at a meeting of this committee on 13 February, Mr. Breslin was happy to confirm that the advice did not get to the Minister.  The T&aacute;naiste doubled down on that the very next day.  My question is directed at Mr. McCallion.</p><p>When clinical advice of the nature communicated by Dr. Flannelly makes its way from the HSE to the Department of Health, is there an expectation that action will be taken?  According to her submission, she strongly advised against it.  Incidentally, it turns out that she was right about all the things we are discussing here, such as that GPs were not organised, laboratories would not have capacity, the colposcopy services would not have capacity and, worryingly, that it would fundamentally undermine the screening programme.  That advice came from senior people in the HSE to the Department.  When communicating advice of that nature, can Mr. McCallion outline how he ensures it gets to the right person?  It clearly did not on this occasion, or it did and we were misled.  I need to understand that.</p></speech>

The detail of that issue is probably one the Department can clarify.  What we can talk about is, broadly speaking, what has brought the pressure into the programme in terms of both the out-of-cycle testing and those women who have re-engaged-----</p></speech>

Clearly, he was acting against advice given to people in his Department.  As the senior person in the HSE, what does Mr. McCallion understand happens to advice given by the HSE to the Department of Health?  If nobody in the Department of Health is listening or the advice is being ignored, there is a serious issue.</p></speech>

First, we were not there at the time.  In general terms, it depends on the circumstances of that advice.  If it is on policy matters, they are matters for the Department.  If it is on operational matters, they are matters for the HSE.  We offer advice and we have dialogue with the Department across many settings, both formally and informally.  The Department will always consider that advice.  As I said, it depends on the context of whether it is an operational matter or a policy matter.  All I am flagging in this case is that Dr. Flannelly sent in her submission and set out her understanding at that time.  We have set out how we saw the decision at the time and the context for it, but we were not aware of how that dialogue happened from there.  The Department has set that out to the committee previously.  It is not something we can clarify here today.</p></speech>

Women are waiting because of a decision that was taken to offer repeat smear tests without doing any homework whatsoever.  We now find that, contrary to what the Minister said, advice was given.  I am trying to understand how that advice would make its way from the HSE to the Department of Health.  Mr. McCallion is saying there are effective lines of communication but I am saying that they are not working.</p></speech>

In general, where advice is given the decision-making rests on whether it is a policy matter or a matter for ourselves.  We are trying to focus on solving the issues we have with the backlog and the capacity.  Generally, we have a great deal of dialogue with the Department on all sorts of issues daily, and the decision making rests in terms of either policy or operational matters.  Obviously, Dr. Flannelly set out her understanding of it at that time.  I cannot comment on that with regard to the sequence or timing, as I was not there.  As Deputy Donnelly said, there have been responses already from the Department about how that operated so I am not in a position to give the specifics of that.</p></speech>

Dr. Flannelly clearly says that Mr. O'Hanlon relayed it.  Would Mr. McCallion be happy that the advice made its way there?</p></speech>

What is the current backlog rate?  Can Mr. McCallion provide us with information on the difference in wait times for those who are paying for it privately and public patients?</p></speech>

We always have approximately 20,000 slides that are working through the system if things are on an even keel.  In some ways the critical determination is the turnaround times for women to get their results, what is known as the TAT.  We have made significant improvements with two of the laboratories, in the Coombe and Quest Diagnostics.  They are now down to three weeks and seven weeks, respectively.  That can vary a little week to week-----</p></speech>

They can vary a little week to week based on demand or because the system is so sensitive at present that if one or two staff are on leave that can affect it.  We have got additional resources into those laboratories and we are working on a solution with the third laboratory, MedLab Pathology, which is up at 33 weeks.  Clearly, that is a major concern and it has deteriorated.  Notwithstanding that the clinical advice on this is that it still presents a low risk, as I mentioned in my opening statement, from the experience of this crisis this is very worrying for women.  We see it coming through on our information line.  I met the staff who work on the information line last Thursday and, understandably, there is a great deal of anxiety about it.</p> <p>  Our focus is on trying to put in place some of the solutions we have identified over the last number of months to get capacity.  I mentioned in the opening statement that we have had to trawl the world, from Australia to America to Europe, to try to find capacity.  We also have to take that on in a way, given the experience from Dr. Scally's report, that we go through a full quality assurance process for any laboratory that we connect into the system.  We are also developing a public laboratory at the Coombe.  There is a commitment to that and we received funding this year to do it.  We have set up a couple of project teams.  One is to build the laboratory - there is a construction project involved - and one is to staff it.</p> <p>  We have limited medical manpower in cytopathology in this country, which is an issue for us.  We must grow the medical workforce and the screening workforce.  Getting screeners is very difficult when a country moves to HPV primary screening.  The UK is under massive pressure with backlogs as well.  Part of the reason in the UK is that as it switches laboratories over and consolidates from the old testing model to the new one, the requirement for cytology reduces so people who have made careers in that are leaving.  That presents challenges.  We are trying to pick up some of those people from the UK and to come up with all sorts of propositions to get them to come and work here, even temporarily, to help alleviate and reduce the time.  At present, we are in the middle of quite complex negotiations which I do not wish to compromise.  Some of them are going on as we speak today and were taking place over the last week or two to nail this down, but I am more optimistic than I would have been when we were last before the committee about getting extra capacity on board that will help to address it.</p> <p>  In the longer term, our aim would be to rebalance the current model where we have approximately 9% in the public system and 81% in the private system.  The commitment to build the laboratory at the Coombe will help that, but it will take time.  In the short term we must avail of capacity in other jurisdictions to help get us out of the problem we are in at present and to ensure women get the results.</p></speech>

It is very worrying that the capacity seems to exist for those who have the money.  With regard to the extensive efforts being made to source capacity overseas, Mr. McCallion referred to quality assurance.  Does that involve on-site visits?</p></speech>

In one of the laboratories where we have a number of prospective laboratories, we have a team assembled.  Dr. Doherty can perhaps speak about the quality assurance process which follows on from Dr. Scally's report.  We have tried to strengthen the quality assurance.  A number of steps have been taken and I will ask Dr. Doherty to speak on those.</p></speech>

Alongside that, we have planned for on-site visits to laboratories that will be providing this service to Ireland and the programme-----</p></speech>

Last year, the credibility of the people in charge of CervicalCheck changed overnight.  In many cases it arose because of a misunderstanding of information.  It is a very serious issue and it is important to ensure that the correct information about the programme is given at all times.  Can Dr. Doherty envisage a controversy like this arising again?  Continuous information was not being given out by CervicalCheck over the years and the information was kept very low-key.  Is there a plan to make sure all relevant information is made available to the media on an ongoing basis?  Will Dr. Doherty ensure there is no misinterpretation of information as it becomes available?</p></speech>

My background is in the NHS and whenever I have had to deal with a loss of confidence or another crisis in a service, communications have always been one of the learning elements that need to be addressed.  It is fundamentally important that we get this right.</p> <p>  As I have only recently joined the service, I have not been involved in the most recent update of our public and patient information, which is very impressive and can be seen on our website.  Ms Tait will speak about this a bit more in a few minutes.  Communication is fundamentally important to the programme.  Everything needs to be open and the professional communication needs to be well informed and well developed with professionals.  A programme of work is ongoing to enhance the communication arrangements within the service for members of the public, patients and the health professionals involved in the programme.  We are working on redeveloping the information for health professionals in the context of the move to HPV primary screening and we are developing new educational resources for health professionals.  We are also establishing new lines of communication with our consultant colleagues, whom I met yesterday, to ensure they are kept fully up to date with guidelines and information on the programme.</p> <p>  Ms Tait will speak about the new information being made available to the public.</p></speech>

Over a 48-hour or 72-hour period, the credibility of the whole CervicalCheck programme changed.  Is Dr. Doherty satisfied that the structure that is now in place will prevent such a situation arising again?</p></speech>

I am satisfied.  We have put in place enhanced governance arrangements and enhanced staffing around all aspects of the programme.  Communication has been a strong focus within the service since I arrived and there is a communications working group which works with us on all aspects of our programme.  We pay good attention to the communication aspects of our programme and we are working very hard to ensure we never have a crisis of confidence in the service again.</p></speech>

Since the report was published last year, the HSE has made significant changes in the information it gives to women and service users of CervicalCheck.  The information is unrecognisable from the information we used to give people.  This was done in consultation with patients at every step of the way since last September.  There have been almost 200,000 visits to the website since we brought in the changes, all on foot of Dr. Scally's recommendations which have relevance across information, governance, quality assurance, etc.  A huge body of work has already been done on the information we give to the public and we have also worked hard to improve the information we share with clinical colleagues.  All Dr. Scally's recommendations are being fully implemented by the HSE.</p></speech>

We have tried to see how it may apply to other settings too.  There remain significant challenges and we need to address the backlog because communication is important to a woman who has been waiting for a long time and wants to know when she will see her results.  We still have work to do.  Many of the ingredients have been put in place but I cannot say we can give clarity to all the people who are waiting as of yet and this is because we have yet to nail down the question of capacity.  People want certainty and they want specific things.  We have a long way to go to get the service on to a stable footing.  Screening is a process involving the GP, the laboratory, colposcopy and treatment.</p> <p>  We feel we have learned a lot from patients and the many patient advocates who have stepped up have brought about huge change.  Patients are at the centre of this and, as we have brought patients into the various aspects of the programme and its structures, it has brought about a unique change in how we approach our work.</p></speech>

At what stage will we be able to get 80% of the analysis done by laboratories in Ireland?  I understand the figure is at less than 50% at the moment.  My final question is on the recruitment of lead clinicians.</p><p>As Mr. McCallion is aware, the recruitment of consultants presents a big challenge for the HSE.  There are more than 500 consultant vacancies.  I presume this is an area that also will be affected.  I have raised the issue of long-term planning.  For instance, we need to consider how many lead clinicians in this area will retire within the next five years and whether we are planning to make sure we have replacements for those lead clinicians.  One aspect concerning the HSE I find frustrating is that jobs are advertised after the person in the post has retired and a locum can be filling in for anything up to two years before a new lead clinician appointed.  How much forward planning is being done in that area?</p></speech>

We have a large team providing support through the consent process, the call centre and so on.  My understanding is that its aim is still to finish within the six-month target.  Regarding the slides, I think more than 60% have now moved to the RCOG in Bristol in the UK.  With respect to further slides, they are all scheduled to move to completion within a matter of three to four weeks, and the RCOG is in that process.  We have weekly calls with the RCOG.  We are trying to plan ahead for the end point when it finishes its work because there will be a disclosure process and a process to feed back the report's findings at the end, which the HSE will have to support as well, and we have commenced that.</p> <p>  We made a commitment to develop the public laboratory at the Coombe Hospital, and we are grateful to the hospital and its board for working with us on that.  The Coombe undertakes about 9% of the programme's work.  There is a significant development task in terms of staffing to develop medical consultants who have the specialties that we need.  There are 1.5 whole-time equivalents in the system and we need to build resilience into the system around that.  The Coombe has been very supportive of the programme and has provided a great deal of advice and support to us on how to deal with many of the issues we face in it.</p> <p>  The other element is the infrastructure.  We have made an initial allocation of funding for the development of a national cervical screening laboratory and we are going through the design process.  While I do not have a detailed plan, we are using the fast-track modular build model to get there as quickly as we can and, hence, as I said in my opening statement, between the workforce side and the capital side I anticipate it will take us certainly up to two years to get there.   The implication of that with respect to our HPV primary screening is that we will need to run a tender to ensure we get a partner to work with us both to maintain the programme as it is today and to deliver HPV primary screening as quickly as possible.  My colleague, Dr. Doherty, can speak to that if Senator would like.</p></speech>

We have to examine merging specialties and we are looking at that with our medical manpower people to see how we could design that.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, has been working very closely with us on all of this also.  There is a major commitment by everyone to try to improve that.  We need to be conscious that we need those partners to work with us over the next number of years and beyond.  In most countries the model used tries to have more than one laboratory to ensure there is some resilience in the service in the event of another crisis of any sort arising.  To illustrate the point, people may remember the tragic death of a lady in the UK, Jade Goody, which caused a major spike in people coming forward for screening and the programme there ran into all sort of problems at the time, although nowhere near the circumstances we are in today.  We need to have capacity to be able to increase the programme as required and to have the resources available.</p></speech>

We have an overarching HPV steering group, a HPV project group and a clinical advisory group.  We have also undertaken a programme of visits to other centres which have introduced HPV primary screening to learn from them the key things we need to consider within the planning and implementation phrases.  We have established a number of work streams around laboratory issues, communication issues for patients and professionals, training and education for professionals, clinical pathways, colposcopy impact assessment and our IT system.  All of those are factors within the work programme that need to be addressed.</p> <p>  What is critical to taking this forward is addressing the backlog to make sure that we have capacity to take forward this new part of the screening programme and to ensure we have a contract in place with a provider to provide this service.  My colleagues have been working on developing the tender arrangements for a provider for HPV primary screening.  There is a great deal of work to be done, but I must stress we must have stability within the programme before we can start moving to a completely new mode of screening.  That is essential.  We must make sure that those who will be called for screening are fully aware of what HPV primary screening means and that they receive all that information before the screening programme starts.  Very importantly, we need to make sure that those who will be responsible for delivering the programme, that is, the smear takers, the GPs and the practice nurses, are fully supported with professional information and training.  As the Senator will note from what I have described, a considerable body of work is to be undertaken to reach the end point at which we deliver this programme.</p></speech>

Some of this relates clearly to changing conditions for consultants but also fewer trainees want to work in smaller model 3 hospitals, in single-handed departments or small departments.  Most trainees want to work in larger departments - we have surveys that confirm this - in urban centres where they can do more complex work.</p> <p>  Our approach to this, not just in obstetrics and gynaecology and colposcopy, is to consider it from a hospital group perspective in terms of how we can create a hospital group by departments.  That, however, asks bigger questions of us as to the sustainability of providing so many unscheduled services in 27 unscheduled care hospitals.  Clearly, these are questions we will have to address as part of manpower planning because these jobs simply are not as attractive as they used to be.</p></speech>

The question is how we can create a sustainable service.  That does not mean there are magic answers but at least we can examine that and try to plan around it as best we can in the coming years.

I wish Dr. Doherty luck in her new role.  I hope it all goes very well for her.  Most of the questions I wanted to ask have been asked but I was not satisfied with some of the answers so I want to go over some old ground.  A few months ago, the Minister sat where the witnesses are sitting now and I asked him the reason he went ahead with the out-of-cycle testing when it was clear it had been recommended that he should not do it.  He looked at me and said that that recommendation had not reached him.  With what came out last night, I believe it did reach him.  He is not here to answer for himself but it is clear that officials in the HSE and in the Department of Health were told not to go ahead or it was recommended that they should not go ahead with it.  Do the witnesses believe that advice did or did not reach the Minister?</p></speech>

All we can do is try to explain the context for it at the time, the break-out in terms of the pressure on the programme, and how the figure of 90,000 splits between out-of-cycle cases and women re-engaging with the programme.  The Deputy will appreciate that we are trying to look at how to resolve it going forward.  In terms of the retrospective piece, I do not believe we can add any more to that.</p></speech>

The implementation of Dr. Scally's report covers many areas across the HSE.  Clearly the work that is being undertaken to clear the backlog is impacting on our ability to progress some of the recommendations in Dr. Scally's report.  Everything is being managed in parallel.  We have been able to make progress on many of the areas Dr. Scally examined and made recommendations on, despite the current backlog with some of the smear tests.  There are many moving parts in all of this and everything is being done simultaneously, with teams of us working on different parts of it.  There definitely is an impact but not across the whole of the implementation plan the Deputy will have seen recently.  Dr. Scally spoke about the progress the HSE has made so far in delivering the implementation plan.  Everything is being done in parallel and there are lots of moving parts in this.  In some areas on which we want to move forward, particularly in developing the HPV screening programme, the impact of that, as Dr. Doherty noted, will be that we need to stabilise the programme and have the backlog significantly reduced.  When we move to that part of Dr. Scally's plan in terms of what the screening services will look like in the future, that will be dependent on some of the issues that are causing the delays in the system being addressed.</p></speech>

As the implementation lead for the Scally report, one of my objectives is to restore public confidence in the screening programmes, particularly in CervicalCheck.  We have made great efforts to keep communications open with patients and encourage members of the public to continue to attend for their smear tests.  This programme will continue to save lives and it is important that people continue to have confidence in it and attend for their smear tests when they are called.  We are doing this work in parallel with everything else that is taking place in the organisation.</p></speech>

We spoke about Laura Brennan in a different context earlier.  As I said, we still have a challenge to restore confidence and we need to address the backlog.  If people are waiting for a long period, that is a challenge for us and we are working to address that.  Hopefully, as we get through the backlog, that will also help.  It is through some of those actions that confidence will begin to be restored.  The numbers remain stable and increased rather than decreased last year.  People also re-engaged with the programme, which was positive.  That is ultimately where we want to be.  HPV primary screening will, we hope, create another opportunity to rebuild confidence.  As Dr. Doherty stated, we need to get all of those ingredients right.  The professionals are very important as well and we all have great faith in them.  General practitioners are probably the most trusted health professionals.  We have a lot of work to do.  There are 4,500 smear takers and GPs who engage with the programme daily and their confidence has also been impacted.  We have to rebuild confidence among this group and among women and their families.</p></speech>

However, the number of private tests carried out in the two laboratories that undertake a small amount of private work is very small.  It is not significant in terms of the overall numbers.  Having said that, every test is critical for us given the search that we have been doing around the world.  We are continuing to make sure that none of the providers undertakes an extra element of that.  That is outside our contract with those providers but the number is very small in the context of what we want.  Our focus with the current providers is on ensuring that they give us the extra capacity we need to deal with the backlog and ensure we get the programme on to a stable footing.</p></speech>

We need significant capacity to address this - there is no point in pretending otherwise - and we have been working on that.  In recent weeks, we have started to make inroads into that.  This has involved engaging with public and private laboratories throughout Europe and in Australia and the United States to try to find people who will work with us and help us to get through this.</p></speech>

I add my voice to the tributes to Laura Brennan.  What was so significant was her age.  When people of my age tell teenagers what to do they may not listen but Ms Brennan's age and youth, which were the great tragedy of it all, had such an impact.  It is not long ago that a few of us who, like the HSE and CervicalCheck, were battling to get the vaccination rate up had to deal with terrible abuse on social media, as did Laura Brennan.  It is great to see how she was able to stand up in the face of such abuse.  She saved lives and, to my mind, she saved the HPV programme because, to call a spade a spade, the HPV vaccination rate was heading below 50%, which would have rendered the programme unviable.  Ms Brennan saved lives and we should all be forever grateful to her.  We should treat a vaccination rate of 70% as a line in the sand.  It would be a disservice to Laura Brennan's memory to allow it to fall below 70% again.  I would like to see it increase to 95%.</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's comments on fairness, I want to address the issue of the additional free smear out of cycle.  My understanding is that there was pressure on GP surgeries at the time because women of means who could afford an additional smear were asking for an additional test.  The response was to provide the option of a free smear.  I understand from discussions in previous meetings that women did not use a token to get a free smear but a clinical decision was made at the bedside with a GP.  Perhaps Dr. Doherty will confirm that it was a clinical decision at the bedside and there were no tokens for a free smear.  It is important to point out that not everyone was given a free smear out of cycle.</p></speech>

As she is aware, I was not involved in the service at that time.  I am not aware of what information GPs were sharing at that time regarding the demand for services.  The decision to undertake a cervical smear is between the GP or other doctor and his or her patient.  It is a decision that is taken in a clinical consultation context and it is a clinical decision.  What informs that decision is between the doctor and the patient and I cannot comment on what individual doctors would discuss with their patients.  However, when an intervention such as a cervical smear is offered, the decision as to whether it is appropriate for the patient is taken by the GP and the patient.</p></speech>

The backlog is 79,500 or the guts of 80,000.  In that case, is the extra capacity in the system sufficient for only 10,500 additional presentations?  According to the opening statement, the backlog is 79,500, which suggests the HSE has found additional capacity for only 10,500 tests.</p></speech>

I am simply explaining that there have been peaks where there have been major gaps in capacity.  As the figure has grown, we have acquired capacity, some of which is temporary which means we have it for a period.  One of the key issues is to get the capacity in quickly.  It needs to come through the existing providers so the process of connecting a new laboratory probably takes four or five months.  It is not a simple plug and play process when one uses new laboratories, aside from the issues raised earlier on the quality side.</p></speech>

It has had screening for a lot longer than we and many other countries have.  We work closely with Australia.  There are two objectives: to try to find capacity to deal with the backlog and to try to identify laboratories that might work with us on HPV primary screening.  There are big challenges when a company looks into Ireland at the moment and we have to make sure we can attract people to work with us.  That is a risk we have to manage around this.  There is not a normal tendering environment around HPV primary screening.  I will ask Dr. Doherty to answer the timeline question.</p></speech>

We have taken evidence from several countries about how they have led the development of their programme.  While we have not visited Australia we have been in contact with colleagues there and have done a detailed review of some of the National Health Service, NHS, programmes, in particular the Scottish one.</p> <p>  A variety of approaches have been adopted to taking this forward.  In some regions in Australia and New Zealand they stopped or suspended programmes for a while to allow for the introduction of the new programme.  The laboratory issues are fundamentally important to having a recognised service provider and plugging it into our existing call and recall systems and how we generate results.  All of that takes time.</p> <p>  The planning and implementation phases take quite a bit of time to put together to ensure they are done in a safe and evidence-driven way to achieve a quality service at the end of that process.  It is not a thing to be rushed in a couple of months.  Getting a laboratory provider to contract with us is unlikely before later this year.  We cannot give a definitive timescale for when this service will be introduced but the Deputy must recognise that we have a very robust work programme going on to move us towards that point.</p></speech>

I assume that is to draw a line in the sand in moving from one to the other.  I imagine that in the Irish situation because of the complexities in the past two years, we would not want to see any suspension of the programme.  We have had enough difficulty I would imagine.  I just want to make sure this is not soft selling a suspension of the CervicalCheck programme.</p></speech>

We want people to know the screening service is available, that they can access it and will be called to screening when it is their turn to be screened.  Stopping the programme would be a very difficult decision and not one we would want to take if we were to restore confidence in this programme for women.</p></speech>

That allows us to move on with HPV primary screening.  We would love to see it go in this year but whether we can do that will be contingent on the tender process.  That will be the critical path, to identify a partner to work with us to get this in place, in as short a time as possible and, to echo Dr. Doherty's point, in a structured sensible safe way.  That is our objective.</p></speech>

While we are correctly focusing on the backlog now, at that time there was a lot of public anxiety and it is easy to forget that.  Women were very concerned.  There was a great deal of misinformation and mischaracterisation of this crisis and there was a danger of a collapse in confidence in the screening programme, which has saved lives over the years.  It is not for me to say how a decision was made because I do not know but I remember very well the concern that our phone lines were oversubscribed by people seeking advice and reassurance and general practitioners around the country were facing women who were similarly very concerned.</p><p>This concern was reflected in the media and at political level, including the Committee of Public Accounts here where we faced questions about a crisis of confidence.  It was in that context.</p></speech>

Between the crisis first bursting on the scene and this week, how many of the women have been tested?  I worry that we go from week to week where there is another announcement that something else has arisen or there is a pending problem and that erodes public confidence in the system.  We need to get to the bottom of it.  To what extent is capacity a problem?  Would the State be better off investing in national capacity rather than subcontracting?  Were the Government to invest in national capacity, that would represent a once-off capital expenditure where the other is repeated every day with each person who is tested.  Has there been any cost-benefit analysis of that?</p></speech>

We aim to build that up to give greater resilience within the programme.  Funding has been allocated on the capital programme to advance the development of a national cervical screening laboratory in the Coombe.  We have a steering group in place with the Coombe, a joint group, and a project team and we are working on the designs for that.  We are also working on the basis of a fast-track modular build to get it in place as quickly as possible.  Equally critical is the need to develop the workforce, as I said earlier.  There is a very small workforce for cervical screening cytology or cytopathology here in Ireland.</p></speech>

There is the logistics of being able to manage all the smears, which is relatively easy to develop, but, on the medical side, there are approximately 1.5 consultants in the public system.  We need a number of other consultants but we must look at a model that allows them to operate in other aspects of pathology.  One is unlikely to attract people into a role with that specialty on its own.  We are looking at how we develop that.  The other challenge, which I mentioned earlier, relates to  the screeners themselves.  Cytology is becoming a much reduced profession.  The current model will reduce the requirement for cytoscreeners by approximately 80%.  In some UK trusts at the moment, for instance, a significant backlog is emerging where screeners are leaving because of difficulties relating to their future career prospects, and laboratories are being closed.  We are trying to capture some of that if we can to help us with our current problems, even in the short term.</p></speech>

One is that we are trying to capture some resources over the next period - both laboratories and individuals who are qualified to work in laboratories - to address the backlog.  That is crucial.  Our current pressure is that in some cases women are waiting excessive periods.  That is one of the core issues we want to tackle.  We have made some inroads.  The times have reduced in the Coombe and Quest Diagnostics laboratories.  We have challenges and we are working with our other partner to address those.  We have found some solutions but we are trying to work them through in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

That is fine but we are conscious that is little comfort to the women awaiting their results if they are sitting at home so our focus is still on trying to address that.

Cervical cancer happens to be very slow growing.  In many cases, it takes ten to 15 years to develop.  My colleague, Dr. McKenna, gave evidence at another hearing and he described the exceedingly low chance, although not negligible, that harm would result as a consequence of the delay and that the intervention would have changed.  That is not to take from the distress and anxiety that the delays cause for women.</p></speech>

We have identified capacity with that third laboratory which we are currently trying to secure contractually, going through the relevant quality assurance steps to bring it on board.  A lot of work is ongoing to bring those times down.  Ultimately confidence will be restored for women who are waiting when they get their results.  That is one aspect of the restoration of confidence.  There is a range of other factors in restoring confidence in the programme generally which Dr. Doherty might speak to.</p></speech>

Earlier, we heard about the active engagement with patients who have been affected by this programme and women who are involved with it.  We also overhauled all the information provided to the public and to women regarding the programme, some of which my colleague Ms Tait described earlier.  There is a new website for CervicalCheck with new information for health professionals and patients.  The information sent to patients and women in the screening programme has been enhanced and improved greatly to support women in the programme.  We hope all of this will help to rebuild confidence in understanding the screening programme and that the programme is still there to provide a service for women.  Ultimately, we are working to address the capacity issues around the laboratory and move towards HPV primary screening all of which will be further confidence-building measures for the programme.</p></speech>

We seem to be bedevilled by waiting lists in this country for almost everything.  There is now a waiting list for everything.  That should not be the case.  As the new applicants come on stream, some of whom are more urgent than others, do they go onto a waiting list?  Is it possible to attack the waiting list from both sides and is that happening?  Are the new applicants for screening tests and slide tests added to the tail end of the waiting list that is there?  If that is how waiting lists are eroded, it will never happen.  There will be a ten-year waiting list before we know where we are.  We have discussed this previously.  Numerous public bodies have this same tendency towards waiting lists and it is a cushion.  It does nothing for health and safety, it does not restore confidence in anybody or in the system, and it is not good for the morale of those working in the system because they are also bedevilled by the constant pressure from people who legitimately criticise the existence of waiting lists.  Is the waiting list being controlled and is it being eroded from two sides rather than being extended and saying the service is up to speed?</p></speech>

A cohort of women who were identified have earlier recalls under the programme.  For example, people are referred to colposcopy might have a priority.  However, screening is different from, for instance, being on a waiting list for an acute hospital orthopaedic outpatient appointment.</p><p>Dr. Doherty might comment further on that.</p></speech>

All women have equitable access to the screening programme.  They will be called in turn when it is their turn to be screened; that has not changed.  In one particular laboratory we have a backlog of smears which have not yet been read.  Changes were made to the screening programme some years ago where we introduced what is called HPV reflex testing, where some smears were tested with a HPV test.  We are also aware, from previous experience in the system, that HPV testing can expire.  We have to make sure that does not happen.  Within the backlog we are prioritising the smears that are in danger of going out of date and applying the HPV test to them in an effort to manage risk.  As was correctly pointed out there is a waiting time, and there is a risk that the smears will be out of date and cannot be read.  Where a woman is HPV positive, namely, at higher risk, she is immediately prioritised for her cytology test.  That is already in place to manage risk.  We have also prioritised women who have having interventions such as colposcopy because they are also deemed to be at higher risk.  We have adopted a risk-based approach to managing that backlog.  However, we are as anxious as everyone else to find a solution to that backlog, and to put a provider and staff in place to deliver the results in a more timely way.  Efforts continue to try to achieve that.</p></speech>

If a woman in her mid-20s turns up with symptoms, for example bleeding, and a family history, is she prioritised?  Those having a colposcopy are prioritised, as Dr. Doherty has outlined to Deputy Durkan, as are those who are HPV positive.  Are women who turn up with symptoms also prioritised?  For example, if two 30 year old women turn up, one with no symptoms and one with symptoms, does the woman with the symptoms jump the list?  Is she prioritised?</p></speech>

If a woman with symptoms like those the Deputy has described presents at a GP surgery it is not appropriate to just take a smear and send it in to the screening programme.  That patient requires a referral to a gynaecology clinic for urgent clinical assessment.  They are prioritised in terms of addressing their needs given their symptomatic condition.</p></speech>

Screening is for a population of healthy people who are persuaded to undergo a test that might pick up a problem.  When a person has symptoms it is not relevant to the screening programme.  We have three cancer screening programmes, namely, breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening, and in each of those people who develop symptoms, whether rectal bleeding or vaginal bleeding, they enter a clinical pathway that brings them to an urgent referral to a relevant clinician and bypasses everything else.  Screening would be a distraction from that.</p></speech>

That was the issue at the time, and it still is an issue.  At the moment the issue is the backlog on smear results.  It is important to say that 65,000 women have been identified through the screening programme as having varying grades of abnormality and who have been treated very successfully by the programme and are walking around today, almost oblivious to the fact that they had a brush with cancer and were treated at a pre-cancerous stage.  It is important to point out that 65,000 women benefitted substantially from the programme.  A small number of women did not.</p> <p>  As has been outlined, a screening programme is not the same as a diagnostic programme.  No screening programme will identify every single cancer.  In population health the population benefits, but the individual may not benefit.  The majority of individuals do, however.  </p> <p>  We are talking about the backlog and the idea of moving towards HPV testing.  I gather from our discussion this morning that those topics are interlinked, and until we clear the backlog and stabilise the situation we cannot really move on to HPV testing, which would be a more accurate means of testing.  It brings its own challenges, changes and referral pathways, but it is nevertheless a goal we are trying to reach.  </p> <p>  In the interests of stabilising the situation, is there a possibility that the cervical screening programme will not be suspended but rather the routine screening will be suspended for a number of months?  Those who are in colposcopy would continue to be screened, as per the protocol, and those who are being brought back for smears because of the results of previous smears can continue to have those smears carried out, but those who are on the normal recall system, for every three years or five years, which is the majority of the people coming through the programme at the moment could have their screening suspended for a number of months to allow the backlog to be cleared.  That would represent a more rapid solution which could stabilise the situation and allow a movement towards HPV testing, rather than trawling the world for extra laboratory services which do not seem to be available, or developing capacity in the Coombe, which is going to take at least two years because of the need to build a structure and hire staff.  By suspending the routine smears for a number of months the situation could be stabilised rapidly and would allow the programme for HPV testing to commence.</p></speech>

We have secured two laboratories which are providing results much more quickly, within three weeks in one instance and seven to eight weeks in the other.  We are working with another laboratory in order to reduce its times.  It has identified capacity, and we are scheduled to visit it soon, and are hopeful that it will help to address the problem.  If we try to change the cycle from three or five years and moving people out it would involve more than a number of months.  We would have to move the screening services out for a significant period in order to address the backlog and the throughput, as well as addressing new participants in the programme, who have never been screened before and so are considered high-risk.  Some participants would move into the HPV project, because women would then have to be called earlier during the following year, on top of those who would be scheduled for a smear anyway in 2020.  I am not dismissing that as an option, but when we evaluated the options our preference was to try to secure capacity.  We now have capacity on the table, and our focus now is to see whether we can get it into the system.  If we can do that it will help to alleviate the waiting times reasonably quickly.  I will not get into the possible timeframes involved today because we are in the middle of negotiations with a number of the providers around this.  It is an option we are considering, and we have set it out and mapped it out in detail, as we have done with all of the other options.  As Dr. Doherty said earlier, some programmes did that as a sensible entry into HPV screening in order to give the programme a bit of space so that we could move in in a structured way.  Perhaps she could add to that.</p></speech>

It is important that women who are what I call "screening-naive", who have never been screened before and who are eligible for screening can access a test.  We do not know their exact status, but once they are in the programme we have a better idea of how they are doing.</p><p>As Mr. McCallion said, we need to look at how we are going to address the backlog and capacity issues before we can ever consider taking decisions like those we described.</p></speech>

It could be a number of years, therefore, before we move to HPV testing.</p></speech>

Preferably, we will have addressed the backlog to introduce some stability to the system.  As I said, we cannot give the committee a fixed timeline or date for when the HPV primary screening will start, but we anticipate that we would certainly be looking at no longer than early next year to introduce this programme.  We must make sure that the steps we take are evidence driven and safe.  There is no point in being bounced into rapidly introducing a test without all the other structures that need to be in place around it to ensure the system is safe.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are at 9% in the Coombe.  This cannot change overnight, as the Chairman described, so we must secure a provider from our tender.  That is the critical path.  As Dr. Doherty said, our plan is aiming to get that in this year.  That would be the target, regardless of whether we can do it this year or early next year.  In respect of us trying to set out dates, at the moment given the history of this with dates, we need to be sure of our ground before we publish a date.  We can only be in that position when we have gone to the next stage of the tender and are sure we have a provider with which we can work.  To illustrate the point, if it is a new provider, there could be quite a lag time for its IT systems to interconnect, so the programme is designed totally around technology.  Some providers may be able to connect very quickly while others may have an extensive period to connect.  We will not know that until we secure a provider.  As I said earlier, securing a provider in this context is quite challenging for a variety of reasons.  A very small market of providers provide this type of capacity into Europe.</p></speech>

The pressure on front-line staff on the phones is almost unbearable.  There is a difficulty relating to the stress they are under and maintaining those staff.  There is an urgency even with regard to that issue where people are trying to impart factual information to women who are very worried and frustrated, and it is taking a toll on front-line staff.</p></speech>

We are trying to address them in terms of providing more supports from a HR perspective but also trying to get more regular bulletins out to smear takers and GPs because, ultimately, they are probably best placed to try to give some level of reassurance to women.  It is very difficult.  If a woman is ringing in, what she wants to know is when her test will come back.  While an explanation involving the progress we are making or things we are trying to do is helpful, ultimately, it does not answer the person's question and that is the challenge for the person on the line.  We are trying to improve that communication notwithstanding that difficulty, but ultimately we are putting most of our efforts into trying to put this capacity into place so that we can give people a timeline which will give them reassurance.</p> <p>  Regarding the other steps we have taken, which I mentioned at our previous appearance before the committee, because of the risk of expiration of the HPV testing, we undertake those tests now, so that has the added benefit of pulling out those who are HPV-positive and moving them through the system more quickly.  There is an element of triage in that.  That is something at which we are looking in terms of the entire backlog, that we would try to move that forward using HPV testing first, which would prioritise those who are at greatest risk and move them into the system more quickly.  That is part of our overall plan around the backlog.</p></speech>

We will give five minutes to each of our non-members, so I ask them to be concise in their questions.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their submission.  I also thank Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly for her very informative letter on how the whole system works.  It was very well thought-out and delivered.  The page where Dr. Flannelly talked about 28 April 2018 is a very important piece concerning her advice to the Department not to proceed with offering a second test.  In the letter, she wrote that laboratories would not have sufficient capacity, open access for repeat testing would be difficult to plan and deliver, colposcopy services would not have sufficient capacity and it would fundamentally undermine the screening programme.  All of that was very prophetic because that is exactly what has happened where we have a backlog of 80,000 tests with a 33-week waiting period.  The task facing the witnesses is enormous.</p> <p>  Was Dr. Flannelly a big loss to CervicalCheck?  It seems to me that she must have been a big loss to the service given the struggle to recruit experts in this field.  Do the witnesses think that, when this becomes increasingly exposed, there be a loss of confidence in the Department, regardless of whoever is responsible, be it the chief medical officer or the Minister or both, because Dr. Flannelly's advice to the Department was rejected, putting us into the position we are in now?</p> <p>  On CervicalCheck's record in sourcing laboratories to help get through this mess, has it looked to Northern Ireland?  It has four laboratories which I believe have capacity.  Will the witnesses address the result in Northern Ireland?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned challenges with CervicalCheck's other partner, having said that it has made progress with the Coombe and Quest.  I assume that is MedLab.  I do not want to take up the witnesses' entire day, but could they spell out what those challenges may be and the headline issues around those challenges?</p> <p>  In the section dealing with supports for women and their families, the submission reads that CervicalCheck supports them in the provision of access to their records and ensuring that they can get their slides where they are required for legal review.  A total of 118 of 125 slides that have been requested have been dealt with, with an average waiting time of 27.5 days.  This is under the headline of supporting families.  Seven are still in progress.  Are legal proceedings pending in those seven cases?  Is a specific laboratory involved or are multiple laboratories involved?</p> <p>  Under the section on the independent review, the submission reads that in recent weeks the laboratories have commenced the transfer of slides.  I am quite passionate about this because we were told last June that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, estimated that it would take six months to conclude.  I understood that to mean to conclude its examination on the independent review, but it now looks like the witnesses are being told that it will take time to review the transfer of slides.  Has it taken all this time just to get the slides transferred to the RCOG or is the review due to be completed?  Did the 221 group of women ask to be removed from that review and dealt with separately?  If so, why would they have done so?</p> <p>  With regard to requests I have repeatedly made for information on the laboratories from which the false negatives came, I was told repeatedly in parliamentary questions and at meetings like this by the Minister and his Department that this would be dealt with under the RCOG review and that until that review was conducted, I could not get that information.  In a reply to a separate parliamentary question, I was told that an expert was being appointed to look at that and to get me that information.  The information is still not forthcoming.</p> <p>  The decision ten years ago to outsource the service was a mortal sin because it has led to the deaths of women and the mess we are in with regard to CervicalCheck.  This is what I am trying to get somebody to admit.  What scares me now is that the only step forward we seem to be making with HPV testing is, again, to outsource it.  That there are plans to continue the outsourcing of women's health is very worrying when we know that the decision to outsource testing ten years ago has led to a complete mess.  I am delighted to hear that CervicalCheck is reinventing the Coombe as a public clinical service.  That is the way to go because, at the time, university courses were shut down because of the decision to outsource and we lost the capacity to do our own screening in terms of clinical experts who can examine these things.</p><p>I am delighted to hear they will be reinstated.  Does Mr. McCallion agree that outsourcing has been a disaster?  Is he concerned that we are now being forced to outsource the HPV test?</p></speech>

On the report to which the Deputy refers, we have completed a report which simply outlines a profile of the laboratories, with an explanation.  We got someone from outside the State to do it.</p> <p>  We have always said the first group we will meet to go through the information is the patients.  We are due to meet them in the next couple of weeks.  Once they are happy with it, we will release the report.  That work is done, but, as I said, the patient representatives will be our first port of call.</p> <p>  On the RCOG review and the group of 221, I am not aware of a request that it to be moved.  I am not saying it did not come; it may well have, but the RCOG process is independent.  Our role is to try and support it.  We have a significant team working on the issue because we have had to manage the consent process and the information in a range of areas.  The RCOG review is independent and we have a weekly call on it.</p> <p>  I am aware that within the group of 221 women there are a number who have consented.  I cannot give the Deputy the exact number, but certainly there are are women who have consented to participate in the review.  There are approximately 1,800 women - I do not have the exact figures - with invasive cervical cancer, of whom over 1,000 have consented to participate in the review.  The slides are with or being sent to the RCOG.  In total, although I do not have the exact number of women - there are more slides than women - 600 are scheduled to be sent in the next three to four weeks.  That will complete the slide transfer.</p></speech>

Its expectation is that it will be completed within that sort of period.</p> <p>  On sourcing laboratories, we have identified some capacity.  We have been working in the past few weeks to go through all of the capacity, operational and legal elements.  As we are at a critical stage, I am being cautious in what I say, but we have identified some capacity that will be of help.  As I stated, two of the laboratories have made significant improvements.  They have also identified further capacity.  As I mentioned to Deputy O'Reilly, we will be making quality assurance visits.  There is a new pre-inspection process, to which Dr. Doherty referred, that a laboratory must go through as part of the quality assurance process.  There will be on-site visits against an updated quality assurance standard and they are being scheduled rapidly in order to ensure we will get to a point where we can secure the capacity identified.  It is a real challenge which I am not underestimating.  Globally, finding cytology laboratories, where there is a move to HPV testing, is difficult.  That is the other reason we want to move to HPV testing as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On outsourcing, we have recognised that we need to invest in the public system, as we are doing in the Coombe, but it will take a little time.  However, it is not only about construction, although that is an important element.  Designs are being pulled together and fast-tracked as best we can and in so doing we have received good support from our own estates people.  It is also about ensuring we have the medical manpower, something which can be quite complex.  As I said, it is a highly specialised area and there were never many of the people required in the country.  We have talked to some of those who were involved in the specialty previously to try to re-engage them.  We are trying to grow and develop the consultant workforce, for which we have started to pull together some plans.  Recruiting screeners is also challenging.  I acknowledge the support the Coombe hospital and its board have given to us throughout this difficult period.  We are committed to getting the programme going as quickly as we can.  We will still need to have a partner for a significant number of years.  Our aim is to get the Coombe hospital up to a figure of 50% within a two-year period, but, as I said, we will need a partner.  There is a limited pool of companies that do this work and we must be careful in how we manage our communications and engagement.  The procurement strategy we have picked for HPV testing allows us to engage in dialogue with the market because otherwise there would be a real risk that we would be left without a partner.  We must make sure we can secure one.  We were involved in pre-market engagement before Christmas which was very successful and in which there was good interest.  However, there is only a small number of providers that offer this service and we must try to make sure we will bring someone with us in order to ensure we will move to HPV screening.</p></speech>

She started the programme.  Dr. Peter McKenna kindly stepped in to fill the role of clinical director, even with his other roles, for the intervening period.  Dr. Doherty has now moved into the role.  Of course, in losing someone in a key clinical role at any point in time there is an impact.</p> <p>  We discussed the other point raised.  There is nothing we can add on the history and the timing.  We have talked about the context in which the decision was made.  Personally, I was not there to judge.  I have articulated how we work with the Department and how we give advice.  Matters of policy are for the Department.  Operational matters are worked through with the HSE.</p></speech>

We have been through this issue a number of times.  We are not in a position where we can add anything.  We can explain the context in terms of the difficult circumstances faced at the time by GPs and women.  To illustrate them, our cervical helpline would typically have handled a couple of hundred calls in a week.  It jumped to thousands at the time, which created its own challenges, as the Deputy may recall, in responding to women.  There was also considerable public pressure exerted.</p></speech>

A woman will typically have asked a solicitor to take on the role of securing her slides for her.  It is rare for a woman to come directly.  It does happen, but generally she will do so through her solicitor.  Whether she then chooses to take legal proceedings is a matter for her.  We do not concern ourselves with that issue.  We simply try to get the slides to her solicitor as quickly as possible.  If the Deputy is asking whether there is a delay in any of the outstanding cases, I am not aware so it, but I am sure the issue would have been highlighted.  If it is okay, I will double-check and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I cannot but feel a lack of confidence.  When I listen to language such as they "manage our communications" and are engaging in "dialogue with the market" and that there is "pre-market engagement" and that there is no tendering process under way for HPV testing, there is a disconnect between Mr. McCallion's work and the 80,000 women who are affected by the backlog.  Mr. McCallion's work to date has not been adequate in dealing with the backlog.  It has been completely unsatisfactory.  There are women who have now been waiting for up to eight months for a repeat smear test result.  They were seeking reassurance which they felt they needed in the context of the entire scandal in which women have lost their lives.  There has been a focus on the women involved getting their results back within a reasonable time.  Most are not getting them back within a reasonable time.</p> <p>  I can talk to Mr. McCallion about my own case.  I am only one of the 80,000 women involved.  Last October I presented for a reassurance test.</p><p>I am still waiting.  I have a particular history and I should not be waiting.  I got a letter in January inviting me for my routine smear test.  Having already been in the system and not having got my results back, the HSE sent me another letter in January telling me to come in for my routine smear.  Answer that question.  Is the HSE still writing to women in the backlog asking them to come back in because it has not cross-checked these women?  That would probably add to the backlog.</p><p> Mr. McCallion and his colleagues can probably tell from my tone that there is a huge amount of anger out there.  News broke of Ms Laura Brennan passing away and God rest her - I send my sympathies to her family - but every one of those 80,000 women would have felt anxiety and stress listening to the story while still not having results.  The witnesses have indicated that two of the three labs have improved their times but which lab has not?  I assume it is MedLab, which is dealing with people in rural Ireland.  They are the people I represent.  The samples from people outside the cities go to that lab and they are looking at an eight-month wait.  Nothing has happened to address that.</p><p> The suggestion by the Chairman, Dr. Harty, needs to be given serious consideration.  Why on earth would the HSE write to women already in the system to come in for a smear test today knowing it will not have results for them for eight months?  Why would it do so?  It is utter madness.  If the executive delayed sending those letters, it would not block women coming into the system.  If somebody comes in for the first time to get their first smear test, they are brought into the system.  If a woman is already in the system, there is merit in seriously considering delaying the sending of that letter for three, four or maybe five months in order to deal with the backlog.  If a woman comes in today anyway, she will have to wait eight months.  If the letter is delayed for three, four or five months and the test is done at that stage, the results will be received around the same time anyway, but at least there would not be extra stress and anxiety.  The HSE might get to grips with the utter mess it is currently dealing with.</p><p> I listened to Dr. Doherty earlier defending the decision of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to offer that repeat smear test when he knew there were no resources for it.  We know he had clinical advice not to do it.  He has tried to discredit my questioning and the questioning of others around it.  He can say he did not have that advice but we know he did.  There is the suggestion that simply because the Minister is under pressure and things are difficult or challenging, it is justification for a bad decision that ultimately harms the health of women and undermines the screening programme, but I utterly disagree with that.  It is wrong.  When asked about the HPV screening that will be implemented, Dr. Doherty said it would have to be driven by evidence and it must be safe.  The Minister's decision was not driven by evidence and it was not safe.  Just an hour ago she defended his statement but she has justified the lack of implementation of a new screening programme for that reason.  There is a lack of credibility in that.</p><p> I ask Mr. McCallion and his team to demonstrate leadership.  We have a serious mess and many women are seriously upset, worried and anxious.  This is being compounded by the lack of leadership and decisions in dealing with this backlog.  I want serious consideration to be given not to stopping the programme but to delaying the numbers coming in at their current rate.  At that current rate, we will be five or ten years clearing that backlog and other women will not benefit from the new screening programme that was supposed to be implemented last year, by the way.  There is absolutely no confidence that it will be implemented early next year, whatever early next year even means.  We need real timelines and a decision from Mr. McCallion and his team.  The response of "I was not there when it happened" does not cut the mustard.  Mr. McCallion is there now.  The decision that was taken was wrong and he must now tell us what he, as the lead, will do to fix this and the backlog.  We need a decision.  The suggestion from the Chairman, Dr. Harty, is supported by me as somebody in the system.  That delay must be given serious consideration as it is the only way to deal with the backlog.  As has been said to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, the capacity is not there and it will not magically appear in the next number of months.  I am not at all satisfied with the responses given to the committee this morning.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.</p></speech>

It referred to the HPV process.  With respect to the backlog, Quest Diagnostics and Coombe are both now performing, with turnaround times for women's results of three weeks for Coombe and approximately seven to eight weeks for Quest.  That is an improvement from where we were many months ago.  We have had challenges in sourcing capacity with MedLab, as the Deputy notes, and we now have options on the table that we have been working through over the past number of weeks.  If we get them into play they will help shorten MedLab's turnaround times as well.  The process has been complex and I can assure the Deputy that we have been trying to find the capacity.</p> <p>  The Deputy made two points around the recall process.  One concerned women in the backlog potentially not getting the recall and I will take that away as I cannot answer the Deputy now on that.  I will revert to the Deputy directly on that.  On the broader point of moving people on three- and five-year recalls out over a period, we will be moving them into 2020 with respect to the HPV process and moving some of the problem that way.  We have two of the labs functioning who cover the middle, the north east, the south east and other parts of the country but the Deputy is correct in saying that in other areas, they do not have such turnaround times.  We must address that matter.</p> <p>  We now have capacity and we have been working actively over the past couple of weeks with MedLab to try to see how we can get that into the system.  We need to ensure this is done with a full quality assurance process, and we are scheduling visits to the laboratories in order to ensure they meet the quality standard outlined by Dr. Doherty earlier today.  If that falls into place, it would allow us to ensure we turn things around in a reasonable period.  I do not want to go too deeply into that, if members might forgive me for that.  We are in the middle of fairly complex negotiations with the lab to try to get that into the system and ensure we can address the issue as quickly as possible.  I assure the Deputy it has been our sole focus for the past four or five months since we renewed the contracts with the provider.  The first hurdle was to keep the current providers in the programme or it would have crashed.  The second problem was trying to get more capacity from those or other providers in order to ensure we could address the backlog.  We have considered that and I am happy to revert to the Deputy separately on that if she so wishes.</p> <p>  I will come back to her about her concerns about people in the backlog as I was not aware of it.  I will revert to her directly, particularly on her suggestion that people already in the system should not be getting recalled if they have had their smear out of cycle.  Dr. Doherty may wish to comment on one or two other points.</p></speech>

I know this does not cut the mustard with the Deputy but I was not involved in the decision-making process at the time.  I was not even working in the programme at the time.  On reflection, all I can do is try to understand why one might have taken that decision to offer those smears.  There was clearly a crisis relating to confidence in the programme and a heightened anxiety among the population of women eligible for screening as to whether they could have a test or have confidence in the test.  I imagine those kinds of factors may have driven decision-making around that time.</p></speech>

On the one hand she has said decisions must be evidence-driven and safe but on the other she is suggesting that public pressure is sufficient to justify a decision.  All I am saying is I disagree on the point.  It is the responsibility of being in Cabinet.  It is a privilege to serve in Cabinet but a responsibility comes with it.  Decisions taken have an impact and consequences.  One must always base those decisions on evidence and not populism or public pressure.  The right decision must be taken for those who are affected and whom one serves and looks after.  In all of the chaos and madness, we must always revert to making the right decisions based on the right reasons.  The decision of the Minister at the time was not correct and it was not based on the right reasons.  When asked for a professional opinion, the witness would be well within her rights to say that.  That is how we learn from such situations.</p> <p>  Mr. McCallion has again spoken about exploring options and working through the process but it is now April 2019.  This decision was taken last May and the backlog was becoming evident in August.  We have known about this for quite some time.  It is no longer acceptable to say we are working through the process.  I do not accept that the witness cannot outline details to the committee as he knew why he had to come before us today.  I am asking for definite timelines.  When will the backlog be cleared?  The HSE should be able to answer that.  If the witnesses know the capacity in the two labs where improvements have been made, with one seeing turnaround in four to five weeks and one seeing them in seven to eight weeks, it is not acceptable to not know where MedLab is at this point.  Rather than reverting to me personally, I ask that the witnesses revert to the Chairman and that it be circulated to all members.  The HSE should tell the public immediately what is happening with those negotiations and when the backlog will be cleared.</p><p>If the HSE cannot provide that information today, we need a decision from it regarding the out-of-cycle smear tests of women who are already in the system.  Is it going to continue to issue letters to come back in after the three-year period is up?  Is it going to continue to add to the system without the capacity being in place?  That is its decision to make, not mine.  For those 80,000 who comprise the backlog and who have had repeat tests and are awaiting results, nobody should be getting the routine letter I received last January.  The HSE needs to look at that.  If it was not aware of the position, it should have been.</p></speech>

However, until we have a definitive position, we cannot do that.  We must ensure we have that and it is not the case that we can just pick a date.  We would love to have had this resolved months ago but it is not easy to source capacity in the current market or to attract people to Ireland.  I need to reiterate very clearly that it has been hugely challenging to try to identify capacity.  If it was there, I assure the committee that we would love to have plugged it in a long time ago.  We now have very strong options and we are trying to close those out.  Once we do that, we will then revert to the people who are waiting because they are, as the Deputy rightly said, the most important people and they need to understand what is happening.</p></speech>

That completes the first round of contributors.  We will now take a second round.  I call Deputy Donnelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#T00600"><p>I want to reflect.  Mr. McCallion stated earlier, quite nobly, that he took responsibility for a lot of what is happening upon his team and the HSE.  I think he is taking responsibility for the wrong thing.  Largely, the crisis of confidence was caused by politicians in the Oireachtas.  It was partly caused by Members of the Oireachtas outside of Government and by how the Oireachtas reacted given that it conflated clinical outcomes for women with non-disclosure.  I am of the view that the Minister largely created the issue.  He was warned weeks in advance that the Vicky Phelan case was going to emerge and that it was likely to cause a crisis of confidence.  No preparations whatsoever were made and those involved have admitted that.  Within 48 hours, the Minister expressed no confidence in the members of the senior management team at CervicalCheck without meeting them.  He never met those people and never asked their opinion.  That was largely taken as the Government having no confidence in CervicalCheck programme.  Having created anxiety and fear, an offer of free tests was made.  We now know there was very strong clinical advice not to do that.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck failed in not closing the audit loop, although it is worth noting that it failed to complete a loop that no other programme on earth even tried to perform.  It failed at the end of an audit process in trying to be the best programme in the world in terms of audit and feedback to the women involved.  To suggest that this failure would lead to a crisis of clinical confidence among women is, I believe, not true.  The mishandling of this matter by the Minister caused the crisis of confidence which, as we now know, gave rise to this huge backlog, to there being no date for the HPV test to be introduced and to 79,500 women waiting for their results.</p> <p>  What the HSE needs to accept responsibility for, and it may well do, is the response to that.  I do not think Mr. McCallion's team created this mess at all and it was largely created by the Minister and the Government, aided and abetted by the Oireachtas.  There was certainly loose language within the Oireachtas which was very unhelpful as well.  However, it is the HSE's mess to clear up.  I was deeply disappointed when I received a reply in the past few days stating that the number had risen.  On the previous occasion on which we met, the number was 78,000.  It was the expectation of all here that when we met again, that number would have fallen, particularly as many of these women are experiencing acute anxiety.  In fact, the number has risen.  That is extraordinary, particularly when one considers the free tests which caused all of this were stopped months ago.  I was expecting Mr. McCallion to state that it had been 78,000, it had fallen to 55,000 and it will be cleared by whatever date.  Unfortunately, his team does have to accept responsibility for some of that, notwithstanding the very difficult international context, which is what I want to come to next.</p> <p>  Mr. McCallion stated, "Our market engagement has identified significant challenges and concerns in the provider community".  What is the problem?  Is it that there is just not the cytology capacity anywhere?  Is it a fact that there is capacity but that international providers are scared of the political, reputational or litigious contexts relating to Ireland?  While this is not the HSE's fault, it is galling that women, in a phenomenal public screening programme - one of the most successful public screening programmes of its kind anywhere in the world - are waiting eight months for results.  What they hear is that it is not possible to access cytology capacity but that if they want to pay &euro;100, they can get their results in two weeks.  Clearly, cytology capacity does exist because women who can afford to do so are just paying for their results.  One of the wonderful things about the screening programme is that it did not fall foul of our awful two-tier healthcare system.  If it is the case that the HSE simply cannot source the capacity because the capacity is not out there, how is that women can bypass that and obtain results by paying?  If there is cytology capacity out there and if those who have it are refusing to provide it to the HSE, why is that the case?</p></speech>

To put it in context, the private capacity that is there is minuscule in the context of challenges for the public screening programme in this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions.  The NHS has a huge backlog, as has been reported widely in recent weeks, due to its own challenges, which are different to the challenges we face.  That is not a significant factor in the scale of those challenges, although I am not saying it is not a wider issue.  As the Deputy rightly stated, our challenge is to get the capacity in place in order to get the turnaround times back for women.  We made some inroads with two of the laboratories where the turnaround times are down to more reasonable levels, and one is back to pre-crisis levels.  We are working with MedLab on solutions for that and we have identified capacity with it.  Some of that is taking the opportunity whereby, for example, if a site moves with HPV primary screening, that releases cytology capacity and we try to step in quickly to avail of that to ensure we can use it to help us address our backlog and get the programme back on an even keel where the capacity equals the demand.</p></speech>

It is not that there is capacity out there and the international market is cautious of engaging with the HSE.</p></speech>

In terms of the backlog, we are trying to identify capacity with the current providers we have.  The reason for that is the lead time to connect a new laboratory is significant and that would add further delays.  We have identified potential capacity in other jurisdictions that we may be able to avail of or may be able to encourage to compete for our HPV project.</p> <p>  The Deputy's assessment in terms of the risk within Ireland, or the perception of our market in Ireland, is fair.  There is a lot of concern in the wider community in that regard, which is one of the challenges I mentioned in terms of the market engagement process.  To simplify, as we all know, in a normal tender, one puts out a specification, people bid, the process is closed, everyone sees what comes out at the far end and that is assessed against various measures.  If we did that, the risk, given the factors the Deputy has outlined, is that we would not understand what the market is feeling and we would not be able to reflect it in our tender.  The option we have taken allows us to have a dialogue which allows us to make sure that when we put in a specification, we have a good chance of getting providers to bid for that.  That is trying to address the issues-----</p></speech>

However, we are dealing with a backlog of 80,000 tests.  In the context of finding temporary additional capacity to ensure that the women involved get their results on time, what is the problem?</p><p>Are international providers nervous about dealing with Ireland?  Are they asking for prices the State is not willing to pay or for indemnity against risk it is not willing to provide?  It appears that a person willing to pay privately can get access almost immediately.</p></speech>

It is so small in this context that it is not a factor.  The main factors are the other two points mentioned by the Deputy.  One is environmental and the other is cytology availability.  We have source capacity with two of the laboratories.  They have introduced capacity to help get the backlog down and we are now working to finalise a plan with the third laboratory to try to get that capacity as well.  We will write to the people anxiously waiting for the results from the programme once we do that.  It will be in line with what Deputy Lisa Chambers articulated earlier.</p></speech>

As Deputy Lisa Chambers stated, the media has reported that one of the labs has proposed that as well.  What is the HSE's view?

Some 800 of the 2,500 women subject to the expiration of the HPV test now have their test results.  I cannot distinguish between those gone out and those going out.  The target is to complete the balance within two weeks.  Approximately 2,500 women requested a test and others may choose to do so in the coming weeks.  There was, however, an initial surge and I anticipate the additional numbers will be low.</p></speech>

Quest Diagnostics fulfilled its aim of returning 800 results.  The target is to complete the balance within two weeks from next week.  Regarding the point made by the Chairman earlier, we have examined that possibility and kept all options on the table.  At the moment, however, we believe we have capacity identified and a plan we can secure.  We will try to nail that down over the coming week or two, including quality assurance visits.  The reason we cannot be as specific as we would like to be is because we need to schedule those quality assurance visits and then tie down some of the contractual details.</p> <p>  Once that is in place, as I stated earlier, we will write to those people in the backlog to give them the timeframe.  That is the priority now.  We have on several occasions examined how we could logistically manage moving people on normal three and five-year recall periods out.  That, however, also creates a problem straightaway in 2020.  We would be just shuffling everything and not changing anything.  Dr. Doherty earlier gave an example from the Netherlands where the programme was paused.  They had the advantage of being able to oversee a larger number of people.  Instead of missing people, the final six months of people who were due to be tested before the suspension were seen during the previous the six months.  There was then a pause to let HPV come in.  It was a slightly different model than the scenario we face.</p></speech>

That is the main factor.  If we can get a provider through the tender process that can interact with us quickly, then we believe we can achieve this in a much shorter timeframe, perhaps by the end of this year or early next year.  That is our key priority.  The contract advertisement is going out now.  I assure the committee that the procurement process is running.  We will mitigate the risk concerning the environmental factors mentioned earlier by allowing a dialogue with the market.  That is possible through a certain procurement process.  The contract notice for HPV will be going out in the next couple of weeks and then we will be able to see if we can get a vendor to work with us on that.</p></speech>

There is language here, but what we are effectively talking about is moving people on three and a five-year recalls out.  We would always still want to see new women because they are high risk, as well as people from colposcopy and short-term recalls.  There are categories of women that have to be seen and for whom the programme could not be suspended.  We would then simply move some of the standard recalls out further in time.  We have examined that option but if we can secure this capacity, that is clearly the preference.  We are focused on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#U01300"><p>Mr. McCallion stated the HSE examined the option of temporarily suspending the programme for women who are not symptomatic.  I refer to those women who get their letter to go for a routine smear test in the normal course of the programme.  The HSE, however, is not going to suspend the programme because it believes it is going to source capacity from these additional laboratories once quality assurance and everything else is completed.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to anyone in the room but the HSE has not exactly covered itself in glory in sourcing capacity.  I understand the Minister was also not helpful.  In the event that capacity cannot be sourced, will temporary suspension be back on the table?</p> <p>  Women in a high-risk category or new women who may be at high risk would not be included in the suspension.  It would just be for ordinary run-of-the-mill routine tests.  Will temporary suspension be back on the table if the additional capacity cannot be sourced?  Is there a timeline or deadline for when that decision will be made?  Women are waiting while all of this is going on and they are, of course, anxious.  Confidence in the programme has been undermined.  I take every opportunity to tell people screening saves lives and they should always go to get tested.  Mr. McCallion alluded to that earlier as well.  Having said that, however, he will understand women are nervous.</p></speech>

The programme still functions.  As the Chairman stated earlier, it is about moving people on three and five-year recalls out.</p></speech>

We hope to have close out the timeframes over the next month.  There are a number of elements.  We have identified the capacity and we are working through the contractual element now.  We are also working on the pre-inspection aspect.  We are trying to gather information to ensure the laboratories meet the quality standards.  As Dr. Doherty stated earlier, quality assurance visits will follow.  That is the sort of timescale we are looking at.  We have worked up all the options and we have been constantly looking at them.</p> <p>  There is, however, a downside to temporary suspension because we would simply be moving the problem.  We would alleviate something now but we would also create another problem that we may or may not have capacity for to solve later.  We have looked at variations regarding time periods but our focus in the next month will be to try to nail down the capacity we have identified and get it into place.  That will, hopefully, help to alleviate the backlog.  Two of the laboratories have managed to do that.  We now need to do it for the third.  It is working closely with us to identify capacity.</p></speech>

I took the liberty of checking on Twitter.  The Minister tweeted:</p><blockquote>Have heard from many women today who have had smear tests &amp;amp; would like a repeat test to reassure them.  Am arranging for this facility to be available &amp;amp; the State will meet the cost of the repeat test.  Arrangements on how this will operate will be outlined next week.</blockquote> <p>The public announcement from the Minister was that anyone who wanted a test would get one.  It was nothing to do with bedside decisions, a doctor or anything like that.  He offered a free test to any woman who wanted one.</p><p>It is now clear he had not done any homework and, indeed, was going against the only available clinical advice.  He either got that advice and ignored it or he did not get it.  It is concerning, whichever it might be.  Dr. Doherty is now the head of the programme.  I am sure it is concerning for her that her predecessor gave advice and it was ignored.  Will she comment on that?  She is going to be the lead in this area.  If she raises an issue of concern with the Minister, or senior officials in the Department, does she expect she will be taken seriously or does she expect her advice to be ignored in the same way?</p></speech>

Is Dr. Doherty concerned that advice she might give will be ignored?  That appears to be what happened with her predecessor.</p></speech>

I have direct communication with officials in the Department, with medical colleagues and with senior civil servants.  Those relationships are working well and we have regular meetings and briefing sessions.  I have not had any experience to date of any advice I might have given being ignored.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Doherty concerned that the advice of her predecessor was ignored?  Does that give her cause for concern in her current position?  I have to say that if I was in Dr. Doherty's position, it would give me cause for concern.  Her predecessor was a qualified person and was definitely capable of giving that advice.  In her current role, given what happened, is Dr. Doherty concerned that her predecessor's advice was ignored?</p></speech>

That is not within my remit.  I can say that what I see around me now is a process of meaningful engagement with the Department on all issues concerning CervicalCheck.  I would expect any advice I give to be considered and advice given to the Minister to be based on my clinical advice.  I do not have concerns at this point that my advice will be ignored.  As I said, I am quite confident in the relationships I have right now.  Who knows what will happen in the future?</p></speech>

I checked on social media for the tweet that was referred to.  I saw a tweet from Mr. Stephen Teap reminding us that we should focus not only on the past but on the future.  In that regard, what is the status of the steering committee?  I know some of its members are concerned that efforts are being made to somehow sideline or disband it.  The witnesses might comment on that.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to walk through this process with me.  If a woman has received a negative result smear test in the past six months but is symptomatic today and goes back to her doctor, can she expect her test to be fast-tracked?  Second, how soon can she expect a result?  Let us say this woman is not going to pay for it but is in the public system.  How soon will she get her test back?  Does it make a difference if a woman is symptomatic?  Can she expect her result more quickly?  Can the witnesses give us a timeframe?  Can she get a result more quickly if she pays for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019040300002#V00500"><p>I will make a start on that question.  To reiterate the point for anybody listening or watching, it is really important to emphasise the difference between people who are symptomatic and people in the screening programme.  To be blunt about it, if someone shows symptoms corresponding to any of the three screening programmes, such as bowel symptoms, a breast lump or vaginal bleeding in the case of cervical cancer, the screening programme has no relevance to him or her.  Such people must go straight to their GP.  We have urgent access pathways for these patients, which we measure and report on monthly.  Those patients bypass screening.  They should go straight to their general practitioner.  As the Chairman knows, the general practitioner will refer that patient straight to urgent cancer referral clinics.</p></speech>

We offer endoscopy in a large number of centres.  We measure performance for urgent referrals for each of those centres.  We interrogate our hospital groups and hospitals on those performances monthly.  The results are published on the HSE website.</p></speech>

We need to think about the situation a few months ago, when the issue first became public.  If I was the Minister, I would want to know what went wrong.  The Minister quite correctly did everything possible to ensure that all the available buttons were pushed to begin a new era with a new confidence into the system.  As the Chair knows I have been a critic of the structure of the HSE, though not its personnel.  I do not and will never agree with the structures because to my mind they are not workable.  I asked a question at this meeting; who is the boss, the Minister, or the HSE?  I have to raise that question again.  The Minister quite correctly made the decision to reassure those women who might have been under the illusion that they either were or were not cancer-free, in order to address their anxiety.</p> <p>  I fully accept Dr. Doherty's response on responding and dealing with a situation as it arises, but however this situation was dealt with was not adequate.  It did not work correctly.  If it did, there would not have been a problem in the first place.  Somebody said that a clinical decision was made.  A clinical decision was not made; a management decision was made by a clinician on the basis of experience suggesting things might happen in a certain way.  The critical issue at that stage was the need to reassure the public that the system in place was adequate and those who had gone through screening, whether they got a negative or positive result, would receive another test.  The issue then was to separate the two and create a second line.  The solution could not add to a waiting list or to the problem that was already there.  A second channel was needed to deal with that review for women who might or might not have a concern or might or might not have a condition.  That was where the problem arose.  That is what needed to be done at that particular stage.  That is a management problem too.  It concerns how to manage a situation.</p> <p>  I am not being critical at all.  We have a lot of experts.  Somebody mentioned that we are not clinicians.  That is right.  However, we have a duty to raise the issues and to ask whether the system is fit for purpose and does the job.  That is also essential if we are to be fair to the clinicians.  If we do not have a system that is adequate to the caseload, the clinicians' job will become impossible.  No matter what they do, a problem will come down the tracks at some time in the very near future.  It is very easy to pick out a scapegoat and say that he or she is responsible for this, be it a clinician, a Minister or somebody else.  The fact is that the situation arose that was totally unacceptable.  That is a fact.  That is not a theory.  It was there, plain as a pikestaff, in front of everybody.</p><p>The system had not worked.  There was confusion over whether it was a diagnostic system, a smear system or simply a check system, and we knew what that meant with 80% accuracy and so on.  Some people acted on the basis that it was 100% accurate.  Of course it was not.  We came to the conclusion early on that it was the wrong system and that we need a more accurate system.  We cannot put our political or medical reputation on the line unless we have a reasonable degree of reliance on whatever we are dealing with.</p><p> It goes back to capacity - this has come up again and again.  Sadly, the necessary capacity was not in place to do the job as it should have been done.  There are various reasons for that, whether it was a lack of money or personnel or a failure to attract clinicians from abroad and so on.  Whatever it was, it was there then and it is still there.</p><p> We should be fair to all concerned.  I can play politics with this as much as anyone else.  I am sure the Minister could do so if he were here as well.  Playing politics does not address the issues or concerns of the women.  It is easy to do that with sound bites left, right and centre.  We can accommodate that and I can accommodate that too.  </p><p> I am keen to emphasise one point now as I did at the beginning.  I believe we now need a clear indication that we are attacking the problem at both ends.  We need to contain the existing problem and make inroads insofar as waiting lists are concerned.</p><p> I received a reply to a parliamentary question last week in another context.  I nearly had a seizure when I read it.  It related to a condition that was progressive and serious.  Whoever dictated the reply decided that the question was submitted by a stupid ridiculous politician who would not know the difference.  We do know the difference.  We know cynicism when it is incorporated in a reply.  We know the mind-your-own-business mindset when it is incorporated in a reply.  This is our business.  This is what we are here for.  When we ask a question it would not necessarily be a good idea to come to the conclusion that the stupid idiot who raised the question in the first place does not know what he or she is talking about.  We have to be alert, on-the-ball and able to do the job.  That is why I have said many times in the past that when the health boards were in existence what happened in a crisis situation was that there would be a meeting on the same evening or same day &ndash; not a week afterwards or anything else.  By the following morning we all knew what was happening.</p></speech>

Alternatively, we could find in two or three weeks that we have another problem that we did not see beforehand.  In that case we would be in a worse situation.  Worse still, public confidence in the system will have diminished in the intervening period and that must be dealt with.  It is now a crucial and critical issue.</p> <p>  Excuse me for coughing, Chairman.  I also have a cold.  You might be able to administer something before the meeting is over.</p></speech>

I outlined earlier in response to previous questions that we have seen improvement in two of the laboratories.  We are working with the third laboratory.  We have identified the capacity and we are working to close that out over the coming weeks.  That is the point at which we would communicate with people who are in the backlog first in terms of the suggested timeframe.  The idea is to give people some level of assurance, if possible, around the delays.</p></speech>

We have the benefit of hindsight.  We have heard many history lessons and assumptions this morning.</p> <p>  I am keen to make it clear because I have been straight on this since the start, when the offer of an additional smear was given.  Mr. McCallion will correct me if I am wrong because I imagine he will know the answer.  I do not follow Twitter in the sense that it is not where I get my official press releases.  Anyway, the chief medical officer made a press statement stating any woman who had had a cervical smear test should have a further test as part of a reassurance measure provided the GP took the view that she required it.  Moreover, the Minister asked CervicalCheck to make arrangements, including payment provision.</p> <p>  The first point in respect of the correspondence we got last night is that I want to make it clear that GPs got paid for this.  Second, there were two strands to the payment.  There was a consultation payment and a further payment if the procedure took place.  Previous commentary referred to a free token for a smear but the Minister was offering a free smear.</p> <p>  The Minister is not a medic but he acts on medical advice.  I speak as someone who has worked as a clinical pharmacist and who has worked in community pharmacy for 15 years.  We have two well-qualified doctors before us today.  If it was as simple as making clinical decisions based on data, we would not need any doctors or pharmacists.  We could simply throw data into a computer and allow it to throw data out the other end.  Doctors need the autonomy to make decisions that they need to make with regard to men and women in the comfort of their practice and in the context of their relationship with their patients.  The very fact that the payment was divided into two strands, consultation plus procedure, points out that the power was in the hands of the GPs.</p> <p>  The next point is based on anecdotal evidence and not some major study.  I live and work in Dublin.  I have busy city centre pharmacies.  People were presenting terrified.  Let us look back at the history.  I hope I do not attribute the wrong questions to the Chairman, but I remember questions were raised about custody and even the question of who owned the smears.  We did not know that in the early years.  When Professor Flannelly went on "Morning Ireland", she could not tell how many women were affected.  I am not taking from her role and I know she did extraordinary work and started off all of this, but she did not know how many women were affected.  There is a letter from July 2016 in which Professor Flannelly specifically pointed to non-disclosure to the families of deceased people.  On the one hand we have a document released overnight and some people are taking it as gospel, while on the other hand we have historical references to a person whose contribution on "Morning Ireland" contributed considerably to the stress around this.</p></speech>

Reference was made to scaremongering.  The normal response from most women was one of terror that no one had read the smear, although it had been tested three years or two and a half years before.  There was almost a perception that it was on a shelf somewhere and no one had looked at it.  It is fine looking back at these things.  Let us take ourselves back to where we were at this committee and at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Many of those present were treated in an aggressive way.  It was adversarial but that stemmed from our concerns about the system.  We know the system has improved the lives of 65,000 people since it started.</p><p>On the question of capacity, a comment was made that the Minister was not helpful in sourcing capacity.  What is the evidence for that comment or can it be retracted? </p></speech>

We are in cervical screening and are transitioning to HPV.  If there is HPV reflex going on, would it be fair to say that we are in a transition period?  I thought it was a move from "A" to "B" but it is really a transition.</p></speech>

If there is any indication of any abnormality on her smear, she has a reflex HPV test.  This test is to identify oncogenic types of HPV, particularly type 16 and 18, which are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancers.  If a woman has change on her smear plus a positive reflex test, that highlights the fact that she needs to be prioritised for management and referral.  That is what we mean by reflex testing.  It is a secondary test; it is not the primary screening test.</p></speech>

It has been a gradual transition, in the sense that we had pure cytology.  Some jurisdictions did not introduce the reflex test but we have done that.  As Dr. Doherty has said, the plan is to transition, where HPV becomes the primary screen and cytology becomes almost like a diagnostic on the HPV test.</p></speech>

That is a fair  charge coming out of this committee this morning because the sole focus here is getting this sorted for the future.  We must move forward from where we are, where many of us are concerned about whether the entire system will collapse.  The backlog issue is not great.  As I pointed out in my initial contribution, we do not seem to be getting traction on the capacity issue.  I am aware that other members have asked about this and I acknowledge that it is difficult to get timelines as to when we can eat into that backlog.</p> <p>  That is a major concern for us because, again, there have been a couple of comments that it could take ten years or so to get through this.  If the progression of cervical cancer is three, six, and nine years that is then sending a message out of this committee that is incorrect, which will feed the scaremongering and the anxiety related to this issue.  </p> <p>  Other contributions have been made about the Oireachtas having contributed to this issue.  I believe the vast majority of Members were trying to get answers to try and improve the system.  </p> <p>  As we move forward from today, the day of political point-scoring, and the historical look back at who did what and when, could leave us forever looking into this but to what end?  At the end of the day, the point of this is to save lives, to ensure better outcomes for women and families, and to examine at the exposure of the open disclosure issue, which many obstetricians and gynaecologists here have dealt with in the past.</p> <p>  How do we eat into this backlog and hammer home the message that screening saves lives, improves outcomes in respect of fertility and improves people's life experiences; the healthy population is screened; women with symptoms move to a different phase and those at a higher risk move to a different area.? I do not want the message going out from this committee that there are 80,000 people who are likely to have cervical cancer sitting in a room.  I understand, with reference to Dr. Henry, that this is not the truth.  We do not want additional erosion of our screening and our engagement.</p></speech>

Equally, we are focused on trying to resolve the backlog so that people who are waiting - we have made some inroads but not enough - are addressed through the capacity provision, and we will continue to look at all options as we get through this over the next while.</p></speech>

Has any work been done on that?  In the aftermath of this, many GPs did not understand or know the limitations of the test at 70% or 80%.  There was the concern that they did not relay that to their patients in the correct way.  I was not aware of the limitations.  The leaflet presented to us was very wordy, and no one is going to engage with it.  It was essentially not fit for purpose.  If it was, there would not have been as much false or ambiguous information out there.  What work has been done on that information going to a woman who is in the system perhaps a girl in her leaving certificate year, who has been through the HPV vaccination programme, and moving into the contraceptive period of life?  How are we communicating in a better fashion compared to what was done prior to this crisis?</p></speech>

I agree and referred to this point earlier.  As part of the scoping inquiry, Dr. Scally made a number of recommendations on the information we give to women and service users of the programme.  One of the outputs from the work that he did was that we undertook a complete overhaul of all the information we provide to women and to other service users.  I have the old leaflet and letter that we provided previously to patients with information about the screening programme.  We now have a suite of information that patients get, depending on where that patient is, or if they are a healthcare provider and so on.  All of that was done in consultation with patients who were affected directly by the issues that arose in 2018, and a wider pool of patients with whom we work closely on all of this.</p> <p>  The range of materials that we have produced are incredibly clear and unambiguous and they provide information to women in a way that identifies the limitations of screening.  Nobody fully understood that.  Looking at the "before" and "after" products, there is no comparison between the information sources.  Online resources have been vastly improved.  I mentioned earlier that since we put the new information online in September-October of last year, there has been 165,000 or more visits to that website.  Feedback from patients we have received has been positive.  This is something that we keep under review.  This is not something that we have just done as a once-off exercise.  </p> <p>  In the context of all the recommendations made by Dr. Scally in his report, this is significant work that is taking place, alongside everything else that we are trying to manage and all the challenges that my colleagues have described.  We have to start looking to the future with all of this.  A great volume of work has been done by us on the information leaflets to address the deficits that were in the type and volume of information we were giving to people, and much other work is under way as well.  All of this information is readily available on our website.  Women will get information when they are called for screening.</p><p>They will be given different information when they attend for their screening test.  It is really good information.  Part of the work we have done in recent months has been to engage significantly with Dr. Scally and his team in reviewing all of the information.  He has given us some good feedback as to how we can make improvements.  This is something we keep under review.  We have already vastly improved the information we provide to women.</p></speech>

The section of the report dealing with the progress report on interval cancer audits indicates that the expert group is looking at processes that should work in the future.  Is it not the case that, after the Vicky Phelan case last April, the internal audit was shut down and that, since then, between 250 and 300 women who were excluded from the group of 221 women who were affected initially - the 221 group - have been diagnosed with cervical cancer?  In other words, these women's cases have not been audited and the women have not been given access to the care package which members of the 221 group received, yet it is likely that they have a smear history because the smear test programme was in operation for 11 years.  Was the audit shut down to keep the figure at 221 and stop it growing?  Is the HSE not deliberately denying women access to the full healthcare package and to an audit, which would allow them to look at their history in the context of what happened to others?  Given the law of averages, there could be 50 to 60 women out there who are dying of, or at the very least suffering from, cervical cancer who may have fallen into the 221 category were they not shut out because the HSE closed the audit and did not replace it.  Nobody ever said there was a problem with the audit.  The way in which the audit was carried out seemed perfectly fine.  The problem was that patients were not told about the results.  The HSE shut down the audit and is looking at a new type of audit but in the meantime a whole cohort is being excluded.  Do the witnesses acknowledge that is the case?</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Henry to expand on that.</p></speech>

It is easy to forget that there was not only a failure to disclose information, which the Deputy pointed out, but that the design and implementation of the audit were also found to be faulty.  It was also incomplete in that it did not include patients who were characterised as having cancer on the National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI.  There has been much discussion about quality assurance this morning and in other fora.  Auditing interval cancers is but one component of quality assurance.  Quality assurance in any programme looks at its whole scope, range and pathway of care, from the credentials of the laboratories to smear-taking to communication with women.  It looks at the whole range.  One other component involves looking at interval cancers in order to learn from what is found.  With regard to this programme and other screening programmes, there is very little information internationally as to how open disclosure of interval cancers should be dealt with.  After the Scally report came out, we undertook to examine all three cancer programmes and design a way to look at interval cancers in those screening programmes, bearing in mind that we all want screening to flourish and thrive and for women to have confidence and partake in the programmes.  We sought the best international advice and the best expert advice available here in Ireland as to how we should deal with interval cancers, whether in respect of breast, bowel or cervical cancer.  That working is ongoing.  It is led by Professor Susan O'Reilly who previously headed the national cancer control programme, NCCP.  We hope to see the outcome of that work in the summer.</p></speech>

What is the answer to them?  They are being excluded from a group that has access to a certain healthcare package which, in the case of Vicky Phelan in particular, is proving to be excellent.  It is disgraceful that these women are being excluded from that group.  If they have been diagnosed but have not had their case audited, they should be included in the group.</p> <p>  I want to take up Dr. Henry's point about it being difficult to know how to inform patients of results.  I am told that there is a step-by-step guide available on the NHS website.  I have not looked at it, but I believe it is very good and substantial.  What is the problem other than the fact that the audit was shut down to exclude other women and stop the number growing from 221 to 421 or 491?  If that is the truth, as increasingly appears to be the case, it is disgraceful, particularly when the HSE reports that it is sitting down with committees and groups to determine the best type of audit.  There has been no proper audit of these women's screening history.</p></speech>

To return to my point, the audit was not paused to deny anybody else access to those supports but because there were faults in its design and implementation and it was incomplete.  That is why it was paused.  The Deputy references-----</p></speech>

With regard to England and Wales, the Deputy is absolutely correct that Public Health England has had guidance in place with regard to the communication of interval cancers since 2016.  Cancer programmes in other healthcare systems, including those of Germany, France and Australia, have no active policy on open disclosure in respect of interval cancers because they are population screening programmes.  There is a variation of opinion on this issue internationally.  We want to design something which will enjoy public confidence and also allow the screening programmes to thrive.</p></speech>

The only conclusion I can make from the failure to have such an audit in place is that the HSE does not want that figure to grow.  If that is the case, it is another example of a lack of open disclosure.</p></speech>

This was a whole year ago.  Between 250 and 300 women have been diagnosed with cervical cancer since then.  If I was one of them, I would feel let down by the State, the system, the HSE and everybody concerned on the basis that no audit of my screening history is available to me.  There have been four meetings over a year to decide with what that audit system is to be replaced.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

While it is very difficult for us to look at this through the prism of our experience over the past year, other healthcare systems which did not have that experience consider screening to be outside the expectations of a diagnostic pathway.  Audits of interval cancers are carried out in some systems, but they are anonymised because the primary purpose of the audit is to inform the quality of the programme.</p></speech>

It was the failure of the named audit here which led to the controversy.  The purpose of audit is to inform quality.  No screening service is 100% accurate.  Unfortunately, a number of people will always be missed.</p><p>Obviously the system is working if one compares the 65,000 people who have benefited with the 221 who had their smear upgraded on the audit - or 1,800 as the case may be.  The audit is to learn from that rather than being an adversarial system.</p></speech>

We heard today, as well as from other useful discussions in other fora, about expectations concerning screening programmes.  They are not set up or designed to diagnose all cancers.  Part of the relative risks and benefits of a screening programme is that one is persuading healthy people to undergo a test to identify something before a serious intervention is required or a life-threatening illness develops.  In doing so, the test cannot be overly sensitive in that it will then subject many people to unnecessary tests, investigations and possibly adverse events.</p> <p>  Our group will be comparing other systems and examining the relative need to allow a screening programme to thrive and flourish with the expectations people have regarding cancer audits as part of the quality assurance programme and what they need to be told.  It is not an easy question.  Other healthcare systems are facing the same question and are looking at great interest at the problems we are facing.  There is no easy answer to this.</p></speech>

Then we were missing a chunk of people on the national cancer registry but we are sorting that out.  On the one hand, we have people talking about populism and scaremongering and then contributing to it.  I feel strongly about dealing with this situation in order that, ultimately, lives are saved and outcomes are better for women and their families.</p> <p>  The audit was flawed in its essence in that, from my recollection from the committee, nobody ever considered what to do with the audit results.  The audit process identified the 221 women who then received a package based on non-open disclosure.  However, falling within the acceptable parameters of testing the 70% to 80%, have we no evidence to date that any lab was underperforming?</p></speech>

I accept Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith&rsquo;s point that we need to get to a point where we have a defined audit process.  The Deputy described a range of options in different jurisdictions.  The point of an expert group with patients, professionals and providers involved at the heart of it is to ensure we come up with a model for all that will work for the cancer screening programme but also for the persons themselves.  We need to do that expeditiously.  That was put in place in December following Dr. Scally&rsquo;s review.  It has met on several occasions already.</p></speech>

We did an update on the condition for the 221 group which we provided to it and then circulated it to others.  I have met with many of the group.  That is not to say that many people do not face emotional, psychological and other impacts from their cancer.  If one puts 221 women and their families into a room &ndash; remembering some of them are deceased &ndash; the impact of cervical cancer is stark, irrespective of anything to do with audits and the impacts on people.  We recognise that.  The report set out the clinical condition for people.  That was published in conjunction with the 221 group.</p></speech>

From the national directorate for fire and emergency management in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan, Ms Maria Smith and Mr. Keith Leonard.  Before beginning, I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on Mr. Hogan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#C00100"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend the meeting.  The National Emergency Co-ordination Group, NECG, is associated with our Department in its role as a lead Department for a number of emergency scenarios.  While our Department has led the development of many aspects of emergency management and is perhaps most associated with the NECG because of storms Ophelia and Emma.  However, the group is part of a generic emergency management system, which is used by any one of eight lead Departments, depending on the emergency scenario, and is not merely associated with weather events.<br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s functions in emergency management are delegated to the national directorate for fire and emergency management, NDFEM, in our Department, of which I am the national director.  I am joined by colleagues Keith Leonard, director of emergency management, and Maria Smith, assistant principal in the national directorate.<br/><br/>The NDFEM was established in 2009 as part of a consolidation exercise and operates with its own management board structure within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Its mandate is to develop consistent, effective, quality local authority fire services to protect communities from fire.  Its roles include developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.<br/><br/>Based on international good practice in the field of safety and emergency management, the national directorate uses a systemic risk management approach in managing fire risk and other emergency scenarios in Ireland.<br/><br/>Ten years on from its inception, the management board of the NDFEM has made significant progress in aligning national and local arrangements around common fire safety objectives.  The national directorate supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.<br/><br/>National policy on fire services is set out in Keeping Communities Safe published by my Department's national directorate in 2013.  This policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire and sets out national norms, standards and targets against which local authorities can benchmark their services.<br/><br/>Over the course of 2014 and 2015, the national directorate&rsquo;s management board commissioned an external validation group, EVG, to visit each of the 27 local authority fire services.  In April 2016, the management board published the first EVG report entitled, Local Delivery - National Consistency, arising from this work.  The report concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that local authorities benchmarked their fire services against the national standards and national norms, and a strong degree of consistency, linked to area risk categorisation process in fire service provision, and all local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as minimum standards.<br/><br/>Practically all fire deaths in Ireland occur in the home and there has been a strong focus on community fire safety initiatives over the past decade, primarily the fitting of smoke alarms in dwellings.  There has been a consistent decline in fire fatality rates in Ireland over the past decade.  We are at a point where, at a three-year average 5.3 fatalities per million of population, we are in the league of fire safe countries.  This is less than half the death rate ten years ago.<br/><br/>Additionally, the directorate has played a key role in developing arrangements for emergency management at both local and national levels.  The directorate has led the national level response across government services as lead Department for severe weather to events such as Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  My presentation will focus on the work undertaken by the NDFEM in our role as chair of the NECG in recent severe weather events.<br/><br/>The group is not a standing committee.  It is activated when the judgement of the lead Department suggests that it is both necessary and beneficial to activate defined national co-ordination procedures for situations which are, or may develop, into national emergencies.<br/><br/>It is a principle of emergency management in Ireland that response occurs and is led at the level closest to where the emergency occurs.  For instance, we do not try to manage events in west Cork from Dublin, the people in west Cork will respond and do what they need.  Hundreds of minor emergencies are dealt with every day by our principal emergency services.  Not all emergencies require a full NECG to be activated.  Last summer for instance, we convened a cross-departmental group to manage the drought and water supply, rather than convening a full NECG.<br/><br/>A national emergency co-ordination group may be convened where a potential or actual national emergency situation is perceived to exist by the relevant lead Department.  Emergency scenarios for which the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the lead Department and may activate a group are severe weather events, flooding, major fires, water supply or water contamination, hazardous materials incidents, landslides, and building collapse or accidental explosions.<br/><br/>With the exception of the tsunami and nuclear accident at Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, when nuclear safety was part of the Department&rsquo;s brief, all of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government&rsquo;s experiences as a lead Department convening a NECG relate to severe weather and flooding scenarios.  We work closely with our colleagues in Met &Eacute;ireann, who are also part of the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government.  Met &Eacute;ireann issue weather-related advisories, alerts and warnings under a well-established traffic light and scaled system for severe weather events.  In addition, Met &Eacute;ireann is developing a national fluvial flood forecast and warning system in conjunction with the OPW.<br/><br/>In the national directorate we work closely with Met &Eacute;ireann in assessing potential impacts of forecasted weather conditions, and liaise with them practically on a daily basis.  Where we judge the situation warrants, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will convene and chair the NECG to undertake the necessary additional co-ordination of services at national level.  All Departments and a range of specialist agencies are required to attend a group when it is convened by a lead Department.<br/><br/>As lead Department, the chair will decide the mode of national emergency co-ordination centre, NECC, operation appropriate to the circumstances.  This may range from one co-ordination group meeting per day to continuous, or 18-hour, operation within the centre or on a continuum between these.<br/><br/>The Department uses the NECC facility in Agriculture House on Kildare Street when it has called an NECG.  This facility was put in place at the request of the Department in the mid-2000s and has proven invaluable as a hub for national co-ordination and communications with the public.<br/><br/>The national directorate team uses a simple but effective national incident management system to manage all emergencies.  This involves four boards.  The recognised current situation describes whether the emergency relates to snow, weather, fire or transport accident, for instance.  Out of that we extract the key issues for our level of co-ordination.  We then establish the objective or objectives and priorities against which we judge all our actions.  It is a very simple generic system which is in use throughout the country by all local authorities, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everyone.  It is a simple system that has been bedded in over the last decade.  <br/><br/>The NECG chair designates, and revises as necessary, our staff roles while in operation.  We review information, decide actions and assign tasks.  Depending on the circumstances, the national directorate team may be supported by members of the Department&rsquo;s management board and other Department staff as appropriate.<br/><br/>The NECG is the national hub for co-ordination of all activity relating to an emergency situation.  At the initial group meeting, the chair will make appropriate introductory comments, and at this stage we have established working relationships among many of the participants around the table, which helps set the tone for the working of the group.<br/><br/>The co-ordination activity at national level is referred to as horizontal co-ordination, that is, we are co-ordinating equals among all 15 Departments and all the agencies.  This happens at the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre.  Several meetings may be held a day or it may be a single meeting, depending on the situation.  <br/><br/>We prepare an agenda for distribution which reflects the key issues.  The chair&rsquo;s job is to structure the meeting and ensure that things are focused on the key issues and ensure that each is dealt with adequately and efficiently as time is usually a pressure.<br/><br/>It is important to bear in mind that the NECG is a forum for sharing information which enables organisations to make informed and appropriate decisions about their individual areas of responsibility.<br/><br/>The existence of a national emergency co-ordination group does not take decision-making or other functions from any statutory body, Minister, Department, or agency.  Attendees are expected to share relevant information, to contribute meaningfully to discussion of issues and to ensure that decisions for their sector are made in a timely fashion taking account of the information shared at the group.  <br/><br/>Depending on the nature, extent and response required, the chair may designate subgroups, and subgroup chairs, to deal with specific issues or aspects of its work that have arisen, or are anticipated, in the event of the emergency.</p><p>In my role as chairman I normally assign a member of our staff to work with the group to ensure issues are dealt with quickly and effectively.  Some subgroups dealing with generic functions, such as public safety messaging and preparing communication messages, may be standing for the duration of a national emergency co-ordination group.  Others come and go on a day-by-day basis as needed.</p><p> Part of the role of the lead Department is to liaise with and support those who work on the front line to manage the emergency.  The task of linking with local services is referred to as vertical co-ordination.  There are two levels of co-ordination.  One is at national level, which is horizontal, and the vertical is where we link with people managing the emergency at local level.</p><p> A framework for major emergency management was adopted by the Government in 2006 and introduced through a two-year major emergency development programme.  It underpins the co-ordination of local response efforts in an emergency.  The national steering group for major emergency management is an interdepartmental body, which was also formed in 2006.  It is chaired and supported by the national directorate and has an ongoing programme for further development of emergency management capacity at local and regional level.  The national steering group is overseeing the final stages of the introduction of a framework for mass fatality planning.  This a grim subject but we felt there was a need to do some work on it.  The national steering group has developed and published an extensive range of guidance on different aspects of emergency management.</p><p> As we have seen from flooding in Donegal to snow in Wexford, the relevant local authorities lead the local response and co-ordinate the activities of the principal response agencies, be they the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the HSE.  Significant efforts have gone into developing a standard approach to this function and each event is reviewed with a view to learning.  An initial experience of a local authority in using social media to provide information for the public on a developing emergency has become the norm after review meetings.  For example, a presentation may be made on how something worked in Cork along with the issues that arose.  This is how much of the development has happened over the past decade.</p><p> Provision of timely and appropriate public safety warnings and information for the public is one of the key roles of a national emergency co-ordination group.  The chair of the group generally leads a Department's public information and communications work associated with the emergency, and the general approach is, if possible, to have a single voice for the duration of the emergency.</p><p> A further perceived strength of the Department's practice is that it is the crisis management process which is dominant.  Communications is positioned as an important ancillary support function but not the central player of the National Emergency Co-ordination Group.  While recognising the centrality of the group's public information mandate, with its focus on crisis management and general reliance on expert-led and delivered communications, the Department&rsquo;s experience is that the National Emergency Co-ordination Group has established credibility with the media and the public as the definitive source of warnings, advice and information.  Widely accepted public communication is an indication of successful delivery of the national emergency co-ordination group's remit.  Managing to preserve this positive perception of the group is a constant challenge.  Overuse of the group or a misjudgment on an issue could damage its public credibility.</p><p> Communicating warnings and associated protective actions to the public is a significant function of the National Emergency Co-ordination Group.  One of the values of establishing a national emergency co-ordination group during a crisis lies in its collective consideration of all the issues, while fine-tuning safety advice for the public, depending on the situation.</p><p> Delivery of public safety messages is achieved through a combination of traditional news media and social media.  Safety messaging is a reasonably well developed function and, for example, relevant organisations begin disseminating selected messages in advance of weather emergencies.  Experience suggests that communities and individuals will take the necessary protective action when provided with timely, credible and accurate safety information.</p><p> Since we first used the National Emergency Co-ordination Group approach for the major flooding in November 2009, the national directorate has reviewed the response to every emergency event where a national emergency co-ordination group has been activated.  This has enabled a continuous cycle of reflection, learning and improvement in our co-ordination of emergency response.  We have prepared a review report on the extraordinary series of weather events that affected Ireland in 2017 and 2018, including ex-Hurricane Ophelia and Storm Emma, which was a snowstorm, three flooding events and the drought and associated water shortages and wildland fires last summer.  Our overall conclusion, based on the response across the range of events, is that our emergency management system at national level, when linked with a local response that successfully engages communities and provides adequate warnings and information for the public, is a comprehensive form of integrated emergency management in keeping with good international practice.  However, part of the purpose of the review is to identify what we can improve.  We have implemented recommendations within the national directorate's remit and we are working with the local government sector and the national steering group on major emergency management to implement recommendations within their respective remits.  The Government's task force on emergency management is considering our recommendations, which have national co-ordination and interdepartmental implications.</p><p> I hope I have been able to explain the National Emergency Co-ordination Group and I look forward to hearing the views of committee members.  I hope I can answer the questions they may have on this area of work.</p></speech>

I also thank Mr. Hogan for outlining his work.  It gives us a lot of confidence in many of the issues he outlined.  There are other issues he did not touch on and I will raise them.  I will begin with messaging.  When Mr. Hogan spoke about the importance of communication and messaging he used the expression "a single voice".  The problem in an emergency is the media goes after it and it becomes the main story of the day.  The line can be blurred between politicising an event and the co-ordinators, responders and people dealing with the event.  I have noticed this and it needs to be guarded against.  What are the media really interested in speaking about?  They are in the business of news.  Obviously, the news is factual and true but sometimes the media get bored of the same old face.  I mean no disrespect to anyone here in saying that.  There is a very fine line and it is something that needs to be looked at and kept constantly monitored.  An event suddenly becomes about the response of politicians and Ministers, which is not necessarily the right approach in an emergency.  I do not necessarily want to draw out Mr. Hogan on this, other than to say it is something I have noticed and I would like to think Mr. Hogan is keeping a close eye on it because we do need a single co-ordinated voice in a response.</p> <p>  My next question is on the National Emergency Co-ordination Group's experience with local authorities, of which we have 31.  As a former member of a local authority, I am not sure how well equipped they are to respond to an emergency.  Are dry runs done?  Are their systems audited?  Are they robust enough?  I suggest some of them are not but that is a matter for the witnesses, as the professionals.  How does the National Emergency Co-ordination Group engage with local authorities and how does it monitor and audit their capacity and ability to respond?  Does it go out to see how well equipped their response units are and how they relate to the group?</p> <p>  There are various needs and responses.  One area Mr. Hogan did not deal with was major maritime emergencies.  The response to somebody living in a port such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire may be very different from the response to somebody living in the midlands, County Laois or County Tipperary.  We need to look at this.  How well equipped is the National Emergency Co-ordination Group?  Does it cover major maritime emergencies?  We are an island nation and major maritime incidents could occur.  We need to know about them.  I am not sure how the National Emergency Co-ordination Group interfaces with major environmental challenges and emergencies.</p> <p>  With regard to the homeless initiative, we see when there is a major snow event that the agencies involved, particularly in Dublin, issue an alert asking people to contact them.  How does the National Emergency Co-ordination Group interface with these organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#D00300"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions and the points he raised and I will try to deal with them as best I can.  With regard to the single voice, the role I have stepped into is chairing the National Emergency Co-ordination Group, which involves leading the media.  We work very closely with traditional media.  Our approach facilitates the traditional media.  By timing our meetings, we can get our message out and the media have been very good at capturing and picking up on the safety messages we want to disseminate.</p><p>I am not the only one involved.  Images of a series of spokespersons will, hopefully, have been seen.  Those include people from the transport sector, the ESB, the communications sector, the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The whole group is aligned around the message.  That is part of how this system of public communication works.</p><p> Regarding politicisation, we live in a world where our mandate comes from the Taoiseach of the day.  That has been the case since 2009 when the former Deputy, Mr. Brian Cowen, was Taoiseach.  He was followed in that post by Deputy Enda Kenny and now we have the current Taoiseach.  They give us our mandate and our co-ordination has been so successful because we have a strong mandate to do what we do.  This ensures that all of 15 Departments are part of the effort and contribute at full tilt in doing what needs to be done.  The political aspect is, therefore, very important.  It is normal in our world for the Taoiseach, our Minister, as the lead Minister, and other Ministers to make statements at an early stage.  Our role is to co-ordinate.  Let us take severe weather events as an example.  Those impact greatly on transport so we rely a great deal on our transport colleagues and their expertise.  There are times, therefore, when it is appropriate for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to comment on issues.  It would be the same for the ESB in the context of power supply, which is always another major issue in these situations.  It is generally in the early stages that statements are issued as a way of getting people&rsquo;s attention focused on a major issue.  That is how we have worked.  It is a constant issue as to who takes the lead, how things are led and where the balance lies in making decisions.  It is important that we as public servants do not become the story.  We have a message to communicate but we are not the story.  The National Emergency Co-ordination Group is not the story.  We want to get people focused on the weather event.  I certainly take that approach.</p><p> Another thing I will say about the political aspect is that the Taoiseach and various Ministers attend meetings of the National Emergency Co-ordination Group to see what is happening.  There have been situations where we have been asked to brief the full Cabinet on various issues, as need be.  There is a high degree of interaction.  Media people from the various Departments also attend meetings of National Emergency Co-ordination Group.  This means that when decisions are being made we do not have to go out of the room to discuss how messages are to be formulated.  It is part of the formulation of the decision within the room.  That is one of the strengths we have because it enables us to meet in an hour, cover our agenda, know what our decisions are going to be and what we are going to be stating outside.</p><p> In fairness to the media professionals in the room, they ask questions about what can be said on "RTE News: One O&rsquo;Clock".  I have experienced where such decisions occasionally need to be revised.  It is very helpful for me, as an amateur working in the communications area, to have professionals observing and offering advice on how best to communicate the message.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#E00300"><p>We face constant challenges in the world we are in and we have to balance them continuously.  I put my hands up and state there have been situations where, in retrospect, I would have made an alternative judgement about these things.  That happens, however, in these areas.</p> <p>  Turning to the local authorities, that is again an interesting point.  The major emergency development programme was a two-year programme designed to embed this framework for major emergency management.  That framework guides how local authorities in an area are to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  Those are the bodies charged by Government with responding to situations.  If there is a road traffic accident, a local authority's fire brigade, the Garda and the HSE&rsquo;s ambulance service will respond and they are used to working together.  This framework was put in place in 2006 to enable those services to work together.</p> <p>  A defined set of steps was gone over.  Part of our approach has been to work carefully with people.  There may at times have been an approach of policy being set by the national Government and execution being done by those outside of national Government.  We have stepped into the space of working carefully and closely with the local authorities, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our national steering group on major emergency management includes representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities.  We collaborate closely to ensure these people can work together.  I have a fair degree of confidence in local authorities.  I would actually be stronger than that: local authorities have taken emergency management and the local response onto themselves and have really made an effort in this area.  They have realised how important it is.  Whether dealing with flooding in Donegal, snow in Wexford or storms in Cork, they have risen to the challenge.</p> <p>  At the end of each event we gather in the 27 areas we deal with and reflect on events.  There are 31 local authorities but some provide services jointly.  I recall that after Storm Ophelia people in Cork spoke about how they did certain things and they were quizzed by their peers and colleagues.  I am confident that the good practice evident in Cork can now be found in all 27 areas after everybody in that room went home and acted.  There will always be small variations in how people do things but the local authorities have really taken that on board.  I have already referred to doing what we term an external validation in the fire services.  We stated national policy and what we wanted those services to do.  A small group was then appointed to visit every authority.  That was a very beneficial exercise.  We have not undertaken that same exercise regarding emergency management but we have a slightly different way of doing that.</p> <p>  We are the parent Department of the local government system and the local authorities have stepped in and done the work necessary.  They have spent money carrying out those responses and as a Department we have stepped in to support them.  In the past decade we have provided an additional &euro;90 million to local authorities for unbudgeted expenditure undertaken carrying out those responses.  As part of that process, the money will not be forthcoming unless things are in order and the major emergency plans, flooding plans and severe weather plans are in place.  It is a case of linking both elements.  Local authorities, from my perspective, have undertaken their responsibilities.  I have a strong degree of confidence regarding what will happen when I have to pick up the phone to deal with a particular local authority.  There is a system in place and local co-ordination will kick in.</p> <p>  As weather events arrived this last winter, Mr. Leonard and his staff had practically weekly contact with individuals within the local authorities concerning their preparations for and awareness of what was coming.  We have a high degree of contact and that can mitigate the worst effects of events.  An example would be the flooding in Donegal in August 2017.  There was a question of whether we should have convened the National Emergency Co-ordination Group.  We had been in touch with Donegal, however.  We knew the county had mobilised its services as we expected in accordance with the national system laid out.  We were not going to add any additional value by convening in Dublin.  The right people were in place in Donegal and they were doing what we had asked them to do.  We convened in Dublin when we got into recovery mode two or three days later to ensure that all Departments were supporting Donegal County Council in restoring services and areas as best it could in the aftermath of that weather event.</p> <p>  That is the area where I work with the local authorities.  In answering this question about local authorities, therefore, I must state that I have a strong degree of confidence in the local government system.  That is not just with the executive.  My background is working in fire services and those services have led much of the work on emergency management within the local government system.  Responding to emergencies is the day to day business of those services.  They have learned how to do that and how to lead the process.  That has been successful from our perspective.  In the two months after Storm Ophelia, through the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, we met about 300 local authority members to discuss the response, their place in that and the things they were doing.  </p> <p>  It is not that the local authorities are accountable to us in the Department.  The Donegal County Council executive is accountable in its own chamber first of all.  The members of Donegal County Council met two days after the flooding and the Inishowen area met on the day.  They are the ones to whom the response must first be justified.</p><p>It is not that I am sitting in the Custom House thinking or wondering what will the local authorities in Longford, Louth or whatever county do.  I know how the system works and I know that the local members will hold people to account.  What we wanted to do in our effort was to set out the expectation of what people would do.  Part of the job we have done is to present the expectation.  It is not the case of saying that one has to do everything, anywhere, any time.  We are stating what is reasonably expected of officials and this is what they should be benchmarked against.  We have all the documents here that the local authorities are working to.  This is what they are expected to do.  By and large the staff get on with that.  The staff know now at this stage that they will get the support from national level and they have received that support.  That is a big help.  They are not hesitant before they go forth and go out.  From our perspective this has helped.<br/><br/>Local authorities have been particularly successful at engaging with communities.  One of the strengths of Ireland is the way that communities respond.  This is due to a number of reasons.  People see that things are working at national level and at local level things are working and, therefore, communities are happy to do whatever they can to help themselves and their neighbours.  That is one of the very positive aspects of the emergency management system.  The local government system has been particularly strong.  We have further to go, and there is a lot of work to do about the communities.<br/><br/>It is interesting that Senator Boyhan raised maritime emergencies.  Transport emergencies generally come under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If it is an aircraft incident, a train crash, a road traffic incident or whatever the nature of the event, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be the lead Department.  They will convene an NECG.<br/><br/>We have a significant degree of liaison with our colleagues in the Irish Coast Guard in respect of maritime affairs.  We have a framework for major emergency management and they have a framework for search and rescue response at sea.  We have a protocol for the interface between the two because if a ship is coming close to shore, and that might involve pollution or rescuing lives, similar to the incident in Norway just a few weeks ago where hundreds of passengers on a cruise ship had to be evacuated.  I could not talk about maritime emergencies <i>per se </i>because we are not the lead Department but I know that in the event of an incident, we would move in to support the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the way it supports us currently if there is snow and a storm and the airports, rail or bus services are disrupted.<br/><br/>We do a lot of work with our colleagues in the Coast Guard .  Our national steering group on major emergency management in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Coast Guard are part of that group.  We do a lot of &quot;preparedness work&quot; there.  While members tend to see the high-profile NECG, I would characterise the past decade as a decade of significant background work with people working together.  That is the secret.  People know each other.  Ireland is a good size of a country and we know our colleagues in the Coast Guard very well.  We work with them.  They understand our system and we understand their system, which is governed by international practice.  They would under International Maritime Organization rules.  We have to understand that.  I am sorry that I cannot give Senator Boyhan more detail on their system, but that is how we interface with that system.  I expect that the very same system would be used in a maritime transport accident.<br/><br/>I will now respond to the question on homelessness and severe weather events.  I am particularly proud that as a Department we have a particular focus on this issue.  I look back at the work that was done in the run up to Storm Emma and during the week from 26 February.  We had put out the word that the storm was going to be bad and the homeless would be among the priorities of the Department.  With the organisations work on the ground, significant work was done.  An additional 100 people who would never normally come in and avail of shelter were successfully persuaded to come in and engage with the health service.  Their medical needs were attended to.  However, some ten or 12 people stayed out and as members will be aware, their circumstances are complex.  They chose not to come in and to their credit the services checked on them on an hourly basis.  I was pleased with the way we as a society responded and how the Department, the local authorities and the voluntary sector acted in these circumstances.  I instance Storm Emma because we know the figures.  More than 100 people who had not engaged with the services for a long time were successfully engaged.  I cannot tell members what happened subsequently but it was a success and it was a case of transforming what could have been a disaster into an opportunity to engage with homeless people.</p></speech>

I imagine the number one policy priority in a national weather emergency is the protection and saving of life.  There have been fatalities in weather emergencies.  To some extent that is inevitable, but I agree with those who feel the loss of life could have been prevented in weather emergencies.  A case that come into the public realm through his widow is the death of Mr. Fintan Goss from County Louth who lost his life in 2017 in Storm Ophelia when driving home from work.  He was a private sector worker.  Would he have lost his life had he been a public sector worker?</p></speech>

Essentially, there was no shutdown in the private sector.  We do not have laws in this country that state that in a status red weather emergency workplaces generally must shut down and workers must be asked to stay at home in the interests of protecting life and limb.  There should be legislation to that effect.  Mr. Goss's widow, Ms Pamela Goss has spoken out publicly in support of that position.  I am asking Mr. Hogan to comment on that.  Does he think it would be of assistance to the work of the co-ordinating committee if such legislation were in place?  Would it be a factor which would assist in the saving of lives?</p> <p>  My second question related to a topic that Mr. Hogan zeroed in on, which is homelessness.  Mr. Hogan referred to the important role the organisations out on the ground played during Storm Emma.</p><p>One of the organisations on the ground assisting homeless people in such weather emergencies is Inner City Helping Homeless.  It went public regarding events during severe weather conditions in the capital on 29 January of this year.  The temperature in Dublin dropped below zero that night.  The picture presented by this organisation which works on the ground night in, night out and day in, day out was different from that Mr. Hogan presented to the committee five minutes ago.  It was not a picture of ten or 12 people staying out for complex reasons best known to themselves in spite of being coaxed inside and beds being made available for them.  Inner City Helping Homeless states that it counted 86 people in this city on 29 January for whom emergency accommodation could not be found during that period of very freezing temperatures.  Its spokesperson stated, "We know for a fact there were no beds available when our teams tried to get them last night."  He further stated that people were not told to call back later:"They were just told straight 'no'."  He was responding to a claim by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive that some people were told there were no beds available at the time but that they should ring back later, at which stage a bed would be available.  Inner City Helping Homeless strongly contested that claim and stated that in addition to beds not being available later that night, people were told not to call back.  I ask Mr. Hogan to comment on those claims by Inner City Helping Homeless.  Obviously, this is a serious and vital question in terms of ensuring that the number one priority during a weather emergency, namely, the saving of lives, including those of people who are homeless, is to be attended to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#G00200"><p>The Deputy raised several points.  I deeply regret the loss of life during Storm Ophelia and the surrounding issues.  However, I do not think I should comment on an individual case or circumstance.  I am happy to comment on the overall issue raised by the Deputy arising from that in terms of statutory powers to close workplaces during a status red warning.  Our clear priority is the protection of life and limb.  The role of the national emergency co-ordination group during status red alerts has been about what we add to the weather information provided by Met &Eacute;ireann.  We provide additional public safety advice when there are real and definite public safety issues.  We do not operate under legislation.  Other countries take different approaches, such as declaring code red, closing certain locations and having statutory requirements.  My view rather than that of the Department is that I am unsure that legislation would be of benefit in such situations.  We would describe our system as integrated emergency management, which comes from international practice in this area.  We want to get communities to respond to the advice and warnings rather than our taking a central command-and-control approach whereby we sit in Dublin and state that certain things will happen.  The latter is not the approach we have promulgated for the past decade.  I have question marks over whether it would be right tone or would work in this country.  We have developed a system whereby we try to send out information and encourage people to react to it in an appropriate and sensible way.  Although I do not wish to individualise the issue, it is all about people taking account of the warnings.  The Met &Eacute;ireann weather alert system is such that if it is a yellow alert, people need to be aware of it; if it is orange, they need to be thinking about it; and if it is red, they need to do something about it.  It is a very simple and straightforward system.  We do not have statutory powers.  I would not be in favour of powers which would enable a person in a position such as mine to close certain locations, such as workplaces in particular.</p> <p>  One of the things we have learned from reviewing the response to severe weather events is that workplaces are complex and non-homogenous.  We or I discovered that there is a series of essential services which must be kept going and for which necessary arrangments must be made.  We were familiar with such requirements from the need to keep the fire service operational during emergencies.  The experience of Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma brought home the need for a range of employment sectors to develop enhanced staffing arrangements to keep businesses such as bakeries and those involved in logistics operational.  These are not high-profile jobs but they are essential to keep the country.  Every employer needs to give consideration to this issue.  Many have done so and others are doing so.</p> <p>  Advice and guidance is available.  Our colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published guidance which has been updated that since Storms Ophelia and Emma.  Obviously, individual employers must look at business continuity and what they need to do to keep their business going, particularly in certain sectors.  Many employers alter working hours or arrangements.  Within the emergency services, many fire services are provided by retained fire services.  Various arrangements have been put in place by local authorities and other relevant bodies to ensure a continuity of fire services when an extreme weather event is forecast with a sufficient lead-in time. </p> <p>  On Deputy Barry's request for my comments on the issue, I am not convinced that legislation is the way to go and I do not wish to comment on individual cases.</p> <p>  On homelessness, I am unsure of the particular circumstances on the night of 29 January of this year to which the Deputy referred.  From memory, the weather in February was lovely.  I am trying to recall what happened on 29 January.  It may have been below zero, but there are between 40 and 60 nights when temperatures fall below zero and a well-established system is in place for local authorities to react in those situations.  I am not in a position to comment directly on 29 January.  I reiterate that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and such organisations do not report directly to us.  In the first instance, it would work with Dublin City Council.  I am not in a position to comment on the events of that night.  However,  I assure the Deputy that homeless is an issue that comes before the national emergency co-ordination group and into which particular effort is put.</p></speech>

Emergency services need to work.  There is no argument about that.</p><p>That issue is not up for debate.  Various employments can make alterations.  Of course people can work from home.  The hours can be shifted around, etc.  Is it not the case that if we do not have legislation of this type, an employer has the right to call people into work if he or she chooses to do so?  Given that people will not be able to walk or fly to work in these circumstances, is it not inevitable that people will use buses, cars or bicycles to travel on roads, highways and byways during red-level weather alerts?  Surely that should not be permitted and action should be taken on it.  I invite Mr. Hogan to comment on this matter again.  I was somewhat surprised by his initial comments.</p></speech>

I am interested in this matter.  However, I do not know whether it falls within Mr. Hogan's remit.  He is more than welcome to comment on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#H00300"><p>I will try to clarify and explain my view on this matter for the Chairman and Deputy Barry.  The existing legislation with regard to people at work is not entirely as clear as it may seem.  Emergency services are governed by health and safety legislation and have to make judgments.  By and large, unless there is life at risk emergency services will not respond to significant numbers of incidents.  No employer is going to put his or her employees at risk unless there is a reasonable possibility of saving life.  That is something that cascades right across.  I might draw out of the experience.  One of the lessons we took from Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma is that conditions can vary across the country.  I meet people who tell me we were very worked up about something in Dublin even though it had no impact at all on them in Mayo or Donegal.  It was an ordinary day for them.  That is one of the difficulties with using a legislative approach.  One of the learning points we have taken out of our experiences with Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma as red-level events is the need to mirror what we do at national level in our 30 local co-ordination centres around the country.  We would like to move to a point at which the group that meets in Castlebar has access to the best information in Mayo, assesses the weather and issues the definitive local advice, just as we issue the definitive national advice.  There were significant variations across the country in the two instances we are discussing.  In the case of Storm Emma, southern counties like Wexford, Wicklow, Carlow and Kildare and places as far north as south Meath were significantly affected by snowdrifts, whereas counties like Donegal on the west coast were not affected at all even though they were covered by the red-level alert.  It can be a bit of a blunt instrument.  That is part of the difficulty we would face if a legislative approach were taken.  At the moment, all employers are required by health and safety legislation to consider the conditions and whatever.  Many of them have developed their arrangements since the experiences of Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  I am not sure that legislating to insist on closures would necessarily be of benefit from the perspective of public safety, which is the area to which we are giving the most consideration.  Along with the Department of jobs, we are pushing the possibility of additional guidance for employers where that is a possibility.  The Department has certainly done that.  A consensus on whether people consider that to be appropriate, relevant or effective will emerge in due course.</p></speech>

When I contend that a more professional approach has come to the fore over the ten-year period since the establishment of the NECG, I am probably answering a question I intend to ask later in my contribution.  I will begin by focusing on local authority fire services.  Regretfully, there have been a few significant incidents in County Wicklow.  Mr. Hogan has explained that the fire authorities are supported in "setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects".  How much progress has been made since this work started to be done at national level as opposed to at service level in individual counties?  Mr. Hogan went on to say that local authorities are "benchmarked .... against the national standards".  Has that benchmarking been made publicly available to enable us to see how each local authority is progressing?  How far from reaching the minimum standards and the national norms are the local authorities?</p> <p>  The second matter I would like to raise has probably been addressed, as I said in my opening remarks.  I assume that after every event, the NECG conducts a review to analyse what happened and learn lessons from it.  It is clear as every event progresses that a different and more professional approach is being taken.  I acknowledge and welcome that.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to Met &Eacute;ireann's system of issuing red, orange and yellow status warnings.  How does Mr. Hogan feel this system is working out?  County Wicklow had a yellow warning for snow and frost last night.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Hogan to make a general comment on how the system is working.  I fully understand that it is very hard to make a call for the whole country.  Every county is different.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on an issue mentioned by Deputy Barry.  As an employer, I am probably coming at it from the other point of view.  If I insist that my workers come to work even though a red-level warning has been issued, to what extent am I exposed if something happens?  Am I liable in relation to that call?</p> <p>  Mixed signals were sent out when the question of footpath liability came up a number of years ago.  It was suggested that if someone slipped on a footpath which had not been cleared correctly, the person who attempted to clear it would be liable.  I think that has been cleared up now.  Perhaps Mr. Hogan can give the committee some clarity in that regard.</p> <p>  I would like to mention some specific issues in my own county.  The question of who has the authority to order a road closure is a continual concern.  The Sally Gap road in County Wicklow becomes a tourist destination, particularly among those with four-wheel drives, when the snow comes.  When this results in people having to pick up the phone to make an emergency call, the Glen of Imaal Mountain Rescue and the Dublin-Wicklow Mountain Rescue, both of which are voluntary organisations, are sent out to take them off the roads.  In some cases, the people who are being rescued are upset and annoyed when they are told that their vehicles are being left behind on the mountain roads.  A number of years ago, we tried to put a barrier on roads like the Sally Gap.  It seemed that no one was in a position to make the final call about putting up the barrier and stopping vehicles from going up there.  The plan fell by the wayside.  Now we are back in the same situation with snow tourists, as we call them, going up in cars.  What is Mr. Hogan's view on that?</p> <p>  We are beginning to work towards a more co-ordinated approach to the clearing of roads after events like last year's severe snow event.  I am thinking especially of local roads that are not kept clear of snow, rather than regional roads.  Is there a need for a national policy that each local authority can roll out?  Such a policy would allow local authorities to engage with the farming community and other communities that have suitable equipment to clear these roads as soon as possible.  When three days have passed, a council could announce that it needs help in clearing roads that it might not be able to clear in the short term.  We are working on a countywide policy in County Wicklow.  It has been hit and miss, but it is beginning to work.  I wonder whether we need something at national level.  Local authorities are never going to have enough equipment to clear all the roads.  We have to find some other way of ensuring they are cleared.  In County Wicklow, we have gone some way down that road by engaging farmers.</p><p>However, we could do with national legislation in this area because some farmers feel they will be exposed if they damage the road.  </p><p> Senator Boyhan referred to political interference or political love bombing, as I sometimes describe it.  Perhaps we would all appear on television wearing a hard hat and a high-visibility jacket if we could do so.  Sometimes this takes away from the key message, however.  While I fully accept that Ministers are entitled to appear in the media but sometimes we see them a little too often and they are love bombing the whole process.  I await Mr. Hogan's response on that.</p></speech>

I concur with his view on that.  We take something from the experience after each event.  If we look back to the first cold weather events, of which there were two in 2010, we have come a long way.  Back then, we were deciding on the day what roads were a priority.  Now, a list of priority roads is published in each local authority.  We also have 200,000 tonnes of salt in storage, which I regret to say we did not have in 2010.  Things have certainly moved along.  We learn something new from each event because all of them have different dimensions.  There is still a degree of judgment involved in all situations and that is part of the difficulty.  Local services are, by definition, almost overwhelmed in emergencies and prioritisation and everything that goes with it are necessary.  Those are important factors to bear in mind in the management of events.  Sometimes we expect our lives to go on but nature can have a huge impact on society, including in ways that we may no longer be used to.  People in rural communities look outside every day to check the weather.  There is a level of uncertainty associated with severe weather events.  We rely on Met &Eacute;ireann's forecasts and Met &Eacute;ireann relies on international systems to find out about global weather conditions.  We have seen storms crossing the Atlantic suddenly track a little to the right or left, which can have a major impact.  The Deputy referred to snowfall in Wicklow last night.  Snow is notoriously difficult to forecast and be precise about.  They are the kinds of difficulties we face.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about progress with fire services in the local authorities and stated that each local authority should use a benchmark.  This has been done.  The purpose of the external validation group was to ensure that each fire service had benchmarked itself against national standards and norms.  The group's report was published in 2016.  We did not publish it in league table format.  The report addressed particular themes.  The Deputy's reference to the fire service in Wicklow brings to mind the tragic loss of fire fighters in the county in 2007.  A firefighter and a garda were also killed responding to a road traffic accident in Foynes in the same year.  These incidents are on all our minds and a great deal of work was subsequently done on health and safety in the fire service.  The external validation process checked that all the statutory requirements in the area of health and safety had been met by all 27 services.  I am pleased to note that one of our fire services was the national winner of the National Irish Safety Organisation, NISO, safety award, based on the system that we put in place and developed.  That report is public and the work done in the fire service on this is on the record.</p> <p>   The Deputy referred to carrying out reviews after each event and mentioned Met &Eacute;ireann.  Met &Eacute;ireann has also made significant changes in the past ten years.  The introduction of the colour-coded advisory alert warning system has brought home the importance of weather events.  We probably have a much greater consciousness about weather than we did a decade ago.  Events might have come and gone and we were not so sure about them, unlike now.  In terms of public engagement, we believe the Met &Eacute;ireann system is much advanced.  We work closely with Met &Eacute;ireann, which constantly reviews its system, the approach it takes and the warnings it issues.  A question was asked about confusion caused by multiple warnings being issued in the case of a storm, for example, a rainfall warning and a wind warning and a yellow alert in one place and an orange alert in another.  It is all about communicating with the public.  I believe the new warning system has been a significant step forward.  Met &Eacute;ireann is probably working to refine the messages and judgments around the system.  However, it should be borne in mind that the forecasting of snow is particularly problematic, difficult and hard to get right.  Events occur and we consider our approach afterwards.  If an event is in red warning territory, our approach is straightforward, as it is when it is in yellow warning territory.  However, if it is in orange territory and approaching red, it could go either way.   There is an element of judgment involved in all this.  We try to draw on all our experiences.  Do we get them right all the time?  No, we do not.  We miss certain things and probably over-call in other areas, which creates its own problems.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to his concerns about liability and so on as an employer.  Far be it from me to discuss or give the committee legal advice on liability issues.  Working with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, we saw that a great effort was made to provide advice to employers' organisations.  Ultimately, employers must make a judgment as to what they need to do and how essential certain things are.  The last thing anyone will want is for an employee not to make it home safely to his or her family.  That is a universal position.  I could not give the Deputy the kind of legal advice he seeks.</p> <p>  The issue of footpath liability goes back to 2010.  I accept there was some initial confusion in this regard.  However, the Attorney General at the time gave us a form of wording which I should be able to recite but I am afraid I cannot do so.  In essence, it stated that not only could people clear the footpath outside their home but they should do so.  Moreover, there is no a liability attached to doing so, unless someone does something that creates a particular risk that will injure somebody.  We have moved on from that.  I think that position also applies with respect to the scenario the Deputy outlined.</p></speech>

Clearing snow leaves ice behind.  Does that create a risk given that it is safer to walk on snow than on ice?  That is the issue.</p></speech>

Should one do nothing rather than something?  We all make a judgment on these matters.  I live in an area where we go out and clear the footpaths in front of our own houses and those of our elderly neighbours and take our chances with liability.  That is just a personal perspective.  One of the positive features is how society has come together in response to some of the weather events, with people helping each other and their neighbours.  From an international emergency management perspective, achieving that societal response is where one wants to be, although I am not sure that we can take credit for that.</p></speech>

The question on who may call a road closure is very interesting.</p><p>That is a very interesting question on which I am sure officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport could advise much more than I can.  I have great sympathy for the Deputy on the issue of tourists and those who do foolish things to draw attention to themselves during weather emergencies.  It is galling for people who work in the emergency services, especially those in the voluntary services.  From working with Mountain Rescue Ireland, we learned more about how to do co-ordination as opposed to command and control.  My experience of working with Mountain Rescue Ireland over the years when we were developing our framework for major emergency management was a classic lesson in how one cannot impose on groups.  It is awful to see how the services provided by people volunteering to go out and do rescue work are being abused.  This also applies in the case of people who do foolish things and expect emergency services to assist when they get into difficulty.  A judgment has to be made on the response and rescue.  These are not situations that should arise but, unfortunately, there is always a handful of people who do these kinds of things.  We regret that.  I am very familiar with the point the Deputy makes regarding snow tourists who want to test out four-wheel drive vehicles.</p></speech>

The Deputy and the volunteers in the Glen of Imaal Wicklow Mountain Rescue have my full sympathy on that particular issue.</p> <p>  On clearing snow from roads, our national policy is that local authorities should engage with farmers and encourage them to clear roads.  We saw this during Storm Emma and we did some detailed studies in some counties.  The local authorities and their contractors cleared approximately 50% of the roads and in some counties roughly 50% of the roads were cleared by farmers using their own gear.  That would be our approach in the policy.  In particular areas, the local authorities have made small salt dumps available on hills and these are now in use.  There have been improvements in many such areas since 2009 and 2010.  We did not have enough salt in 2009 and 2010 to leave small salt dumps but we do now.  The position has improved greatly as a result of this and the work done with farmers and the machinery available to them.  We see this in all sorts of weather events.  During the storms, for example, many roads were cleared by people taking out chainsaws and moving fallen trees.  The local authorities will focus on the main roads first to ensure they are cleared and this requires a lot of work.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey also referred to the political aspect.  From my perspective, the activity he described is not interference.  It is more the case that we take our mandate from the political system to do what we do.  It is always a balance but from working with various taoisigh over the years I believe this approach works well.  The political system supports us and finds out what needs to be done, what Departments are needed, what is happening and if particular issues need addressed.  It also gives us direct feedback.  We hear very directly about the issues confronting people.  Part of our role in emergency management is to pick up on emerging issues.  Our political people are frequently among the first to pick up on issues.  We are very glad of their feedback and I would not underestimate this aspect of the political dimension.  It happens at local level with councillors in the local authorities and at national level with Ministers and other Deputies who provide us with a sense of how things are.  If we get that sense, we can start to address the issues.  If we carry on blithely unaware, we are missing the point.  Part of good emergency management is picking up those emerging signals.</p></speech>

My experience of emergency service workers on the ground and the emergency co-ordination team leaves very little room for criticism.  I agree with some of the comments made by previous speakers, but they are primarily criticisms or questions for the Government around legislation or politics.  Looking back at the handling of the most recent two or three major weather events, certainly in South Dublin County Council, the interaction between the National Emergency Co-ordination Group, NECG, the fire and ambulance services and the local authority was pretty exceptional.</p> <p>  It is very encouraging to hear Mr. Hogan say there are some things that, in hindsight, he would do differently.  That means that the group is learning from its experience.  Mr. Hogan's emphasis on co-ordination rather than command and control is very welcome.  I commend the NECG and all of the emergency services in all of the divisions Mr. Hogan works with, and I am sure all members would share that sentiment.  While there have been fatalities - and unfortunately in extreme weather events they cannot be avoided - I have no doubt that we have far fewer fatalities as a result of the work of Mr. Hogan's team and the workers on the ground.  I commend Mr. Hogan and encourage him to continue the work he is doing.</p></speech>

On securing supplies of grit and given that the head of meteorology is in Reading just outside London, will Brexit have any impact in this regard for us in Ireland?  We were racking our brains about whether it would have an impact.  Mr. Hogan is the best person to ask about the issue.</p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Casey on the Sally Gap.  People were swimming in the sea off Salthill in Galway during a recent storm.  Some people do stupid things at very dangerous times and put other people's lives at risk.  All one can do is warn people.</p></speech>

From my time as a councillor, I am aware that when it comes to reacting to severe weather events, it is important to know if funding will be available when making decisions.  The costs of engaging in some responses can be significant and sometimes a delay arises.  When I was a local councillor we always provided for winter maintenance in the budget.  Sometimes we would have a good year and the allocation would not be used.  Is there a case to be made for the winter maintenance budget to be ring-fenced and kept?  This goes back to the idea of use it or lose it, which is madness.  I always felt that the winter maintenance fund should be rolled over if it was not used.  The local authority would have money in reserve and when a severe weather event hit, it would have the resources needed to call in the emergency services and whatever extra expenditure it needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1246" speakername="Maria Bailey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#K01100"><p>It is unbelievable how far we have come.  To draw on personal experience, in 2010, I had been home from the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, for three days and there was a shutdown in November until two days before Christmas, which was followed by another shutdown.  It is unbelievable how far we have come in those eight years.  We have learned from each event, including in the messaging and warnings that have been issued.  I will take my political hat off and put on my parent hat.  We were told well in advance of the most recent severe weather event that the schools would close.  It helps families to know in advance as it allows them to plan ahead for the day with childcare and work.  Sometimes it is not possible to inform people at an early time, but it was very beneficial to be informed on the afternoon before the most recent event that schools would not open.</p> <p>  Do we look at best practice around the world?  I understand a text messaging service is used in Australia.  Has the co-ordination group examined that?  The messaging and communication around weather events are very good and everybody will be glued to the television, radio or online sources to find out what is happening.  Is text messaging another tool that could be used to get the message out?</p></speech>

The group has had the privilege of leading a huge effort, not only at national level.  I highlight the work of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the ESB, with our colleagues in the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality who row in with us and the Department of Education and Skills.  The lessons were learned in that Department.  Decisions taken on the closing of schools were classic examples of how things should be done.  The Department of Education and Skills makes the decision but we present information, for example, in respect of what was happening in Cork during Storm Ophelia and information provided by the ESB on the situation around the country.  We might say that a decision needs to be made before 2 p.m. in order that members of the public are informed.  This is how our system works.</p><p>The Department of Education and the Skills and the Minister for Education and Skills can make the decision and do that.  That is how it works.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Broin that it is a huge effort by the full panoply of not just central government but the local government system and our front-line services.  We have put in a lot of work over a decade in trying to develop those services.  There is a judgement issue in this regard and inevitably when there is a judgement issue, in retrospect, we will get that wrong somewhere.  We generally put our hands up if we do.  </p><p> To respond to the other questions on Brexit and its impact on Met &Eacute;ireann, I do not want to speak for the organisation.  I know it is part of our Department.  Met &Eacute;ireann is part of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system.  It is not dependent on the UK and Reading for all the pieces here.  Met &Eacute;ireann is well ahead.  Regarding the developments that have taken place in forecasting, there is a high degree of confidence in the ten-day forecast.  It is the main forecast on which we rely.  Weather is a global system.  It does not depend on country boundaries so the modelling is done on that global system.  </p><p> I can assure the committee that our colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport keep a huge stock of salt so we will have a whole year of preparation.  We know multiple sources are used for the delivery of salt stocks.  From our bit of research on this, we are happy that we are okay there for the time being.  Brexit will not impact hugely in those areas.</p></speech>

We must again put our hand up on that.  Sometimes there is no dedicated fund on which we draw on so we must look around the Department to try to find money.  This can be significant.  One year, the maximum amount we had to find was &euro;17 million, which is a significant sum.  We have had to come back before this committee to seek additional funding at the end of the year so sometimes we hold things until the end of the year to see how things pan out.  We would put our hands up regarding some of the delays but we have succeeded in getting that.  A series of debates have taken place about how one funds extraordinary events like this.  Nobody likes to have a budget lying around unspent coming to the end of the year.  If a budget is available, people think, "Can we not use that for something else?"  There have many debates about that.  We have succeeded in establishing a norm and being supported.  I am referring to a very low level involving us as the Department supporting the the local authorities.  Our system has a little rhythm about it.  It may not be perfect but we are fairly sure we will get there.  We will get the money to them.  There may be some delays, which is less than ideal in that if something happens at the beginning of the year, local authorities will have spent their money and there may be budgeting and balancing issues there but that is where we go.</p> <p>  Regarding the questions about best practice, I emphasise that everything we do and have done is based on a systemic approach to risk management.  That is something that is international and derived from the space programme.  We have taken that risk management approach for both fire services and emergency management so everything we do is based on that.  There has been a master's programme in emergency management in DCU for the past decade, which has produced graduates who are now dispersed across the system so when we talk about systemic risk management, we have a significant understanding of it.  That is a significant benefit.  Part of the success involves trying to look ahead and anticipate.  It is not just about looking at what happened the last time but trying to look ahead.  Putting the systems in place and establishing the NECG were all significant steps that involved looking ahead based on international good practice.  </p> <p>  Regarding text alerts, technology changes, as a person from a certain generation, this is new.  Bodies like ESB Networks and Met &Eacute;ireann report that the difference in how people access their information compared to five years ago is huge when it comes to the use of social media.  I sit in awe looking at bodies like Met &Eacute;ireann and ESB Networks regarding how they manage social media but that is how people communicate.  Moving on to text alerts in certain areas, I know work is ongoing.  All emergency services use the terrestrial trunked radio, TETRA, system so steps are being taken all the time.  I know our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are certainly progressing work in that area.  </p></speech>

We had drought conditions for an extended period that developed into a significant wild land fire issue.  That was not the only issue.  We were managing water supply issues with Irish Water over an extended period.  Fire services were dealing with approximately 150 gorse fires per day at one stage.  We had fantastic support from the Air Corps during that period.  Deputy Casey will know that gorse or forest fires such as those that occurred in Killarney are almost impossible to extinguish.  They are self-extinguishing.  One controls them a bit whereas the helicopter provided the opportunity to actually impact.  Serious damage was done on Bray Head and in that area.  It is a significant issue.  Our job was to manage the available resource, which was the helicopter at national level.  Does it go to Laois or Wicklow today and how do we manage all that?</p></speech>

We would have very grave concerns about urban areas where if fire breaks out, there will be smoke and people with health issues will be badly affected.  We did quite a bit of work with our colleagues in public health on that issue at the time anticipating that this might happen.  Members may recall an extreme forest fire in the Cloosh Valley in Galway that affected Galway city.  The smoke was coming in the right direction, came into Galway city and affected people there so it is not a remote and dramatic thing at night time out in the country.  This can affect a population.  These issues must be managed.</p> <p>  This is a general approach to this.  This is not just the fire service working on its own.  For wild land firefighting, the people involved have been led by the fire service, NPWS, the OPW, our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who issue the warnings, and our colleagues in the Department of Defence so there is a multi-agency approach to this.  That is the beauty of co-ordination.  One brings people together.  One can then say, "This is what we are going to do about this", and everybody knows that.  This co-ordination approach may not always hit national level but it is embedded in many emergency response areas.  It shows the times and it works well.  The biggest and best example was after Storm Ophelia when more than 300,000 customers were left without electricity supply.</p><p>Water supplies also went down.  ESB Networks and Irish Water working together with the Defence Forces and local authorities to respond to that is probably as good an example as any of co-ordinated response, prioritising and getting things done.  They were able to adhere to their expected response times.  We never heard of these response times ten years ago, whereas now they have become the norm.  When the electricity supply network is down, the expected response time for a given area will be two days, three days or 12 hours, depending on circumstances.  This is the kind of progress being made in this area.</p></speech>

Mr. Hogan might talk to us briefly about his Department's engagement with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which now operates under the umbrella of the EPA.  This is a particularly important area in any risk or crisis.  How does the Department relate to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland?  I ask him to share his views on this with us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019040300002#M00500"><p>Yes.  An absolutely critical part of effective emergency services is having the fire services properly equipped.  I have received shocking representations in the past ten days or so from firefighters who told me that the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet is substandard and the vehicles are way too old and would not be put on the road by fire services anywhere else in Europe, where there are very strict standards as to how old fire appliances can be.  The standard in most of Europe is that a fire appliance should be on front-line service for five or six years and then in reserve for another five or six years, after which time it should not be used.  I understand, however, that many of our vehicles, possibly half of the fleet in Dublin, are older than that.  Firefighters told me alarming stories and showed me shocking video footage of leaks from pipes near electrics at the back of fire trucks; of lights, including side lights and strobe lights, not working - apparently, these vehicles are still on the road; and of compartments at the sides of the vehicles with broken locks springing out.  In one instance, the firefighters told me how these broken locks could have killed a cyclist.  They told me that drivers who raise these issues and refuse to drive these trucks, because they are personally liable if there are any accidents, are being disciplined, intimidated and so on and essentially told to shut up and drive defective trucks.  I do not know whether this coincides with a Deloitte report that came out earlier this year, which stated there were major criticisms of the procurement policies of the Dublin Fire Brigade in terms of money being spent on second-hand vehicles in England.  Apparently, quite a few of the vehicles we have in the Dublin fleet were bought second-hand in England, rather than new and are not up to scratch.  Deloitte was very critical of the procurement policies of Dublin Fire Brigade in its report.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Hogan aware of any of these concerns and problems?  Does he have any comment to make on them?  If our fire equipment and fire appliances are seriously substandard and defective, the best laid plans for emergency responses and emergency co-ordination could come badly unstuck.  I am interested in hearing any comments Mr. Hogan may have on this.</p></speech>

I have a keen personal interest in the issue of nuclear safety and so on.  I would go so far as to say the system we have in place now derives from our experience of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents and its development.  The idea of a national emergency co-ordination group first emerged from this national emergency plan.  That became part of our Department's remit at a certain stage.  The national emergency co-ordination centre was put in place at the request of Ms Renee Dempsey from our Department.  She was the principal officer at the time dealing with the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.  We have strong links in this regard and we undertook a review of the plan.  It was recently passed to our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the EPA.  We work very closely with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, as it was formerly titled, and which is part of the EPA now, on the issue of radiological protection.  We have our own guidance on dealing with radiological emergencies.  One guide is developed under the national steering group for major emergency management.  There is a guide for the principal emergency services in dealing with such incidents should a nuclear event occur.  Our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have no doubt, would convene a lead Department, as we do for severe weather events.  In March 2011, when the Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred, we used the National Emergency Co-ordination Group to deal with issues arising.  Despite the event occurring on the far side of the world, there were issues for us here that we needed to deal with at the time.  As I said, I have strong and fond memories of this work, and much of what I have learned I learned from the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents and the experiences arising from it.  Some of them were very bad experiences in the early days but they certainly provided the basis for what we have now.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions about fire services, specifically Dublin fire services, and the fleet there being substandard compared with European standards.  He referred to alarming stories and mentioned the Deloitte report undertaken on procurement.  I am aware of some of the comments made on this because they were made publicly.  I do not necessarily agree with them.  Everything we do in our field we do for a particular reason.  We ask people who work in the fire services and other emergency services to do a difficult and sometimes dirty and dangerous job on behalf of society.  Everything we do to co-ordinate and develop the service is designed to support these people in undertaking these roles.  This is the main motivator of the people with whom I work closely and the people who lead the fire service across the country.  We have our 218 fire stations and they typically respond to approximately 30,000 incidents per year, or perhaps slightly fewer.  The number of incidents they attend is falling.  There is a steady downward trend in this regard.  As I said, our service and all the issues and aspects of it are described in the various fire services reports that have been done over the years.</p> <p>  Regarding procurement of fire engines, our Department supports local authorities in the purchase of fire engines.  The typical fire engine that can be seen driving around is called a class B fire engine and would typically cost somewhere between &euro;350,000 and &euro;400,000.  There is a programme in place.  I do not have exact figures for Deputy Boyd Barrett but I would suggest that under each of the programmes relating to the Dublin fire service, there would typically be 20 front-line fire appliances in Dublin.  The service would get three in each of the programmes and would have got three in each of the past two programmes.  We are part of an Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework in place for the procurement of fire engines.  Specialist fire appliances such as turntable ladders are extremely expensive not just to purchase but also to maintain and operate, depending on the crewing arrangement.  They are infrequently used.  Firefighting in high-rise buildings is generally done from the interior now, as distinct from the exterior.</p><p>We have a fleet of aerial appliances used for firefighting.  I would not have information on particular appliances in Dublin at present.  Normally, there would be two aerial appliances in Dublin, and probably two spares available if needed.  One does not just wait for these appliances to break down.  The hydraulics in them are subject to routine maintenance problems so they are taken off the run routinely.  They are like aircraft so they are taken off the run routinely, serviced and maintained.</p><p> With regard to stories about appliances and difficulties with drivers, Dublin Fire Brigade will manage its own side.  I would not be aware of the detail of what goes on.  Management difficulties and issues sometimes arise in fire services, not just in Dublin but right across the country, but we are not involved directly in those.</p><p> We use such grants as we have available to support the priorities of the authorities themselves in terms of what they want to purchase.  We do not purchase everything everybody wants.  Authorities need to prioritise periodically what they want to buy.  We rely on the judgment of the management teams of Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin City Council regarding their priorities for their area.</p></speech>

If it is the case, as has been alleged to me, that the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet is very significantly substandard relative to the fleets across the rest of Europe, it is very alarming.  The firefighters gave me very specific details on the age of fire appliances.  They were literally naming the fire appliances and stating how old they were.  They said such fire appliances would not be used for front-line service anywhere else in Europe because of the standards applied.  They stated many of the fire appliances we are buying are second hand.  They are already starting quite far down the road.  I was shown video footage of significant defects.  Another story concerned a device that rises up and in which a firefighter sits.  I do not know the exact technical term.  An extra seat had been bolted onto it in an <i>ad hoc</i>way.  These were very worrying points.  I have no doubt about the professionalism of the firefighters.  I am amazed by the professionalism, seriousness and commitment of the front-line firefighters.  They take their job very seriously and they are saying to me that many of the vehicles are unsafe or not up to standard, and that the general standard of the fleet is way below what one would expect elsewhere.  The Deloitte report states there is no competitive tendering in much of the procurement by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  It states there is equipment being bought second hand and that there are no paper trails.  These are worrying reports.</p><p>I call for a full audit of the standard of the Dublin Fire Brigade fleet.  That is what needs to happen because the reports are too serious.  The firefighters I was talking to told me they contacted everybody and have been in touch with Dublin City Council and so on about their concerns.  When they say they are not willing to get into certain vehicles, it must be borne in mind.  They told me stories about brakes not working properly because, as Mr. Hogan stated, there are complex hydraulics.  These are very significant concerns I wished to raise with Mr. Hogan.  A full audit and investigation are needed.</p></speech>

Through the political system, we receive comments and feedback in certain circumstances but I certainly would not be aware of a view such as that expressed by the Deputy on the fire fleet in Dublin or in any other county or local authority fire service.  In the run-up to the difficult financial times, we had achieved a very significant improvement.  Improvement comes in waves over the years.  If one examines the trend over the decades, one realises our fire fleet was in very good order before the difficult times.  Thereafter, we did not have the money to buy on the scale at which we had been buying but we are back purchasing.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deloitte report and the purchase of second-hand equipment, everything we grant aid is subject to Government procurement procedures.  This is now done through the Office of Government Procurement framework.  There are those who will say we are being too bureaucratic in setting too many standards and creating too many hoops for people to jump through in terms of the tendering process on which we insist when we are grant aiding appliances.  We grant aid the new appliances.  I am not aware of the Dublin fire service buying second-hand appliances on a large scale.  Occasionally equipment is bought second hand.  I refer in particular to aerial appliances that become available.  People are aware of what is available on the market.  If there is an economically sound proposition, purchases are made.</p> <p>  On fleet management, the fleets are not being used as much as they would have been traditionally.  There are probably fewer than 30,000 vehicle responses per year now whereas there probably would have been 50,000 ten years ago.  Dublin Fire Brigade has its own in-house vehicle maintenance system.  It will know and work with its vehicles and maintain them.  I am sure that work is to the highest standard.  Vehicles will break down, particularly where they are in 24-hour use across shifts and where different drivers are driving them.  In the retained service, there is a tendency to have drivers who look after the vehicles.  On the 24-hour shift, it is a different system and more issues arise but I can inform the Deputy, without having the detail for him, that Dublin Fire Brigade has its own internal system.  Many other counties have an external arrangement now; it is all contracted out.  Dublin Fire Brigade is managing it internally.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Morgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#D00300"><p>We thank the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for the invitation to attend in order to discuss the recent annual report of the DPC for the period from 25 May to 31 December 2018.  I am one of five deputy commissioners at the DPC and head of legal affairs.  Accompanying me are Jennifer O&rsquo;Sullivan, deputy commissioner, who is head of strategy, operations and international affairs, and Cathal Ryan, assistant commissioner, who has responsibility for the consultation function in respect of the public sector and law enforcement matters.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, 2018 was a momentous year for data protection in Ireland and across the EU, with the GDPR entering into application on 25 May 2018.  This new legal framework has brought about transformative changes to the data protection regulation system, enhancing the data protection rights of individuals, cementing the responsibilities of organisations when processing personal data, and providing data protection regulators with a new toolbox of hard-edged enforcement mechanisms.  While the GDPR is an EU regulation, it allows member states to give further effect to certain aspects of its rules at national level.  This was done in Ireland by way of the Data Protection Act 2018 in respect of which this committee carried out pre-legislative scrutiny in mid-2017.  The DPC acknowledges the valuable work carried out in relation to the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill 2017 and the comprehensive report which was produced by this committee as the outcome of that process.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Act 2018 forms a vital piece of the Irish data protection regulatory framework.  In essence, the 2018 Act serves three overarching purposes.  First, it gives effect at a national level to the GDPR in respect of those areas where a margin of manoeuvre was allowed for member states to specify the GDPR&rsquo;s rules, such as the area of the age of digital consent.  Second, the 2018 Act transposed the law enforcement directive into Irish law.  That directive provides a separate set of data protection rules relating to the processing of personal data by law enforcement agencies for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.  Third, the 2018 Act ended the existence of the Data Protection Commissioner and replaced it with the DPC, which is a body consisting of at least one and not more than three people, each of whom is a commissioner for data protection.</p> <p>  Together, the GDPR and the 2018 Act provide the DPC with a greatly strengthened suite of investigative, authorisation and enforcement powers.  Under the previous legislative framework of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, the enforcement powers available to address contraventions of the law were essentially limited to the issuing of enforcement notices.  However, under the new regulatory regime, the DPC may issue reprimands and warnings, and impose administrative fines up to a maximum of the higher of &euro;20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.  The DPC also has the power to issue directions to organisations to comply with requests by data subjects to exercise their rights, to bring processing into compliance with the law and to issue bans on processing or data transfers, amongst other powers.</p> <p>  The DPC&rsquo;s enhanced medley of powers is reflective of its much increased range of statutory functions under the GDPR and the 2018 Act.  These include raising awareness of rights and risks for individuals and of obligations on organisations which process personal data, advising the legislative function of Government on certain legislation, and co-operating with other data protection supervisory authorities in the EU to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR.  At the core of the DPC&rsquo;s obligations as the regulator and enforcer of data protection law is the obligation to handle every complaint relating to data protection which is lodged with the DPC and to investigate such complaints to the extent appropriate.  In this regard, a significant change from the previous legislative regime is that the DPC is no longer obligated to issue a statutory decision on every complaint where it has not been possible to reach an amicable resolution between the complainant and the organisation concerned.  While the DPC must now handle the complaint, it may address the complaint through a number of different actions including, among other things, issuing enforcement notices to the organisation concerned requiring it to take a particular action, issuing advice to the individual concerned, brokering an amicable resolution, or, where appropriate, commencing a statutory inquiry.  The DPC has already found that the flexibility offered by the new national legislative regime in this regard has allowed it to make much more efficient use of its resources in seeking to vindicate the rights of individuals rather than having to dedicate significant resources to drafting and issuing statutory decisions.  This efficiency is particularly significant in the context of the increased volumes of complaints that are now being received by the DPC, compared with the pre-GDPR period, which I will discuss in a few moments.</p> <p>  It should be noted that while the GDPR and the 2018 Act have been applicable since 25 May 2018, the new legislative regime does not apply retrospectively.  Rather, the previous legislation, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, has been retained in law for certain limited purposes, including for dealing with complaints which relate to data processing prior to 25 May 2018 and for investigations which had already been commenced before that date.  The DPC continues to deal with a number of complaints and issues which must be resolved under the previous legislative regime, including complaints which continue to be received in respect of the pre-GDPR period.</p> <p>  The DPC&rsquo;s remit as a regulator is somewhat exceptional in that it applies regardless of industry and sector where any organisation, public or private, with the sole exception of the courts, is processing personal data.  However, despite our broad jurisdiction to supervise the processing of personal data, it is important to point out that we do not have regulatory competence in law for many contemporary issues, such as so-called fake news, online content moderation and Internet safety.</p> <p>  Since the introduction of the GDPR, data protection has undergone what the Commissioner referred to in the 2018 annual report as the &ldquo;GDPR effect&rdquo;; in other words, the mobilisation of individuals to action to tackle what they see as misuse or failure to adequately account for and explain what is being done with their data.  This has been reflected in the significant increase in complaints and queries received by the DPC during the period from 25 May to 31 December 2018, with more complaints received in that seven-month period than in the full year of 2017.  Equally, this period has seen a doubling in the number of data breach notifications received by the DPC with the now mandatory requirement on organisations to report data breaches to the DPC within 72 hours.  In light of the requirement on the Government to consult the DPC on certain new legislation which concerns data processing activities, there has also been a very significant increase in the DPC&rsquo;s workload to review and provide observations on new and draft legislation, with 25 items of primary or secondary legislation coming to the DPC for review during this seven-month period.</p><p>Critically, the DPC commenced a considerable number of statutory inquiries under the GDPR during 2018 concerning systemic issues in the commercial and public sectors.  Of these, 15 relate to the multinational technology sector, examining issues involving processing by Internet platforms, such as the right of individuals to access their personal data, transparency, the legal basis for processing and the security and safeguarding of users' personal data.  A further 33 domestic statutory inquiries were also commenced during 2018, examining issues such as the use of CCTV by local authorities, data breaches by Tusla, and the role of the data protection officer in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Each of these inquiries is complex, challenging and raises multiple data protection and legal issues, and the DPC has allocated considerable resources to investigating these issues of systemic public importance.  It is expected that the majority of these inquiries will be concluded during 2019.   During the period in question, the DPC also took successful prosecutions against five organisations for 30 offences in total related to direct marketing under the regulations known as the e-privacy regulations.</p><p> As committee members are aware, the DPC's functions and responsibilities are not solely reserved to domestic regulation of data protection.  Under the GDPR and the new one stop shop regime, the DPC has the role of the lead supervisory authority for multinational organisations that have their EU headquarters in Ireland and meet objective criteria to demonstrate that this is their main establishment in the EU.  This means that, in addition to handling and investigating complaints from data subjects in Ireland related to these organisations, the DPC must also do so for data subjects in other European Economic Area, EEA, jurisdictions, including when the complaints were originally lodged with other data protection authorities.  The DPC is responsible for co-ordinating a consensus on a complaint or a possible infringement of the GDPR with all of the other EEA data protection authorities that are said to be concerned by the issues in question under the co-operation and consistency mechanism of the GDPR.</p><p> The DPC's activities in its role as lead supervisory authority represent a considerable proportion of its workload in co-operating with other relevant data protection authorities and keeping them up to date on ongoing investigations and complaint handling.  In addition, as a member of the newly established European Data Protection Board, EDPB, which comprises all the EEA data protection authorities, the DPC devotes significant resources to travelling to the monthly EDPB plenary meetings and frequent meetings of its 12 subgroups, with upwards of 100 meetings planned for 2019, all with the aim of ensuring the consistent application of the GDPR.</p><p> The very serious expansion of the DPC's remit at national and EU level and the huge increase in workload volumes came as no surprise to the DPC.  In the year leading up to the application of the GDPR, the DPC carried out an extensive evaluation and change management process to map the operational and resource impacts of the new functions that the DPC was to take on and the anticipated increases in volume.  The Government's increased funding for the DPC during 2018 of &euro;11.7 million, of which &euro;7.3 million represented pay allocation, enabled the DPC to respond to its need for greatly elevated staffing levels and recruit 25 people during the course of 2018, bringing staff numbers to 110.  The DPC targeted specialist recruitment during this period, running five specialist competitions with the support of the Public Appointments Service, enabling it to appoint new staff in the legal, investigations and technology areas among others.  These appointments were critical for the DPC to continue to build a highly skilled workforce to deliver its expanded regulatory remit under the GDPR.  The DPC has continued to increase its staffing levels in the early part of 2019 and the staff head count currently stands at 135, with further recruitment this year expected to take the DPC to 160 staff by the end of 2019.</p><p> Strategically, the DPC continued to prioritise its awareness raising activities during 2018, with an ambitious outreach programme of participation in national and international events as well as issuing public information and guidance, undertaking significant media engagement and launching a new website.  In conjunction with these ongoing activities, the DPC launched a high profile public consultation at the end of 2018 on the processing of children's data and the rights of children as data subjects.  This is with a view to producing guidance materials for children and young people and the organisations that process their data, and encouraging industry to draw up codes of conduct to promote best practices in this area.  A further stream of this consultation launched in early 2019, which aims to directly gather the views of children and young people in the classroom through the delivery of a specially created lesson plan.  Both streams of the DPC's consultation are running, with a closing date of Friday, 12 April.  At a broader organisational level, the DPC commenced a significant project in late 2018 to develop a new five year regulatory strategy, which will include extensive external consultation during 2019.  This new regulatory strategy will guide the DPC in prioritising its work and strategically balancing competing demands in the exercise of its regulatory powers, and will give greater insight to stakeholders on how the DPC intends to regulate.</p><p> As was 2018, 2019 will be a big year for the DPC, with these consultation projects, its continued expansion and operational enhancement plans and, particularly, with the first wave of decisions arising from its ongoing statutory inquiries anticipated in the latter half of the year.  The DPC is committed to firm and robust regulation and looks forward to continuing to break new ground during 2019 under the GDPR and 2018 Act.  We thank committee members for their attention and are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions based on my experience of the GDPR as a public representative.  I am sure our visitors are aware that at the very end of the GDPR legislative process a number of amendments were made in the Seanad by the Government with regard to public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas dealing with statutory bodies.  I believe many organisations do not respect these amendments.  As an example, if my office receives a query about a third level grant and we engage with SUSI, the organisation that deals with third level grant applications on behalf of the Government, the person making the query must go on the SUSI website and name me as an advocate.  In my view, this is a clear breach of the GDPR legislation.  Have the witnesses come across this situation?  Has the commission ever launched an investigation into Departments using the GDPR as an excuse with regard to engaging with people?  Has an investigation ever been carried out on organisations that perhaps implement the GDPR legislation in a way that is not appropriate?  Has the commission policed or looked at any examples of where the amendments made to the legislation regarding how public representatives engage with various Departments are implemented at local authority level or Department level?</p></speech>

Does Ms Morgan want to answer?  All of the witnesses should feel fully at their ease to add something and they should indicate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Morgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#E00500"><p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  I will deal with the latter issue he raised in general terms and then hand over to Mr. Ryan on the specific query raised.  The Senator referenced the phenomenon of the GDPR being used potentially as an excuse to deal with certain issues.  This is certainly something the DPC has been aware of in many contexts since the GDPR came into application.  The rules in the GDPR have been used by a range of sectors potentially to sidestep obligations that may otherwise apply to them.  We have had to do a significant amount of myth busting.  Recently, we published a blog on our website on what the GDPR does and does not state.  The issues raised by the Senator are certainly very pertinent in the context of the first ten months of application of the GDPR.</p> <p>  On the substance of the question, which I understand concerns section 40 of the 2018 Act and the activities of elected public representatives, I will hand over to Mr. Ryan to address it in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cathal Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#F00100"><p>We identified the issue as important very early.  Literally post-GDPR we noted that there were issues in terms of making public representation.  It is important to state that it is a really important democratic function.  We were very aware that we needed to discuss this matter not only with Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas but also with local authorities and the Departments, which is what we did.  Behind the scenes I carried out a lot of consultation with various committees and local authorities through the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, to get a sense of the issues on the ground.  Following that, we identified that there was an inconsistent approach being used either by local authorities or Departments in how they approached section 40 of the Act.  With that in mind, as the Senator rightly pointed out, there is a sense that people or the Department were using GDPR as an excuse.  We wanted to tackle and implement a common sense approach to section 40, which we have done through the publication of guidelines.  The guidelines would have been sent to every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those guidelines were also issued to all local authority and public sector departments nationwide.  The guidelines suggest that a democratic representative must take some responsibility for the public representation that he or she is making in terms of engagement with his or her constituent.  On the basis that they have done so, the Department or a public sector body should take his or her word or a written letter that he or she has a legitimate public representation to make.  If one reads the guidelines, which were published late last year and, I believe, around December, one will get a real sense of what is required.  Following the guidelines, which we published, we then went back to those bodies and  encouraged them to come together and form a standard approach.  For example, I have attended a data protection officer, DPO, network committee with the LGMA for local authorities and I understand that they will develop a code of conduct based on these guidelines.  As Members will be a aware, there are 31 local authorities that may be doing 31 different ways of public representation.</p></speech>

The guidelines do not respect the unique electoral situation that we find ourselves in.  There are only two countries in the world that have a similar electoral PR-STV system - Ireland and Malta.</p> <p>  The amendments were brought in, in the Seanad, to deal with the uniqueness of our political system.  Yesterday, I spoke to the staff in my office and asked them for one example, which was SUSI.  Do the witnesses think it is acceptable that a Member of the Oireachtas should have to ask a client to go on the SUSI website and name him or her as an advocate given the fact that we have an applicant's personal public service, PPS, number, date of birth, address and all other relevant references?  Do the witnesses think it is acceptable that a Member of the Oireachtas should have to demean him or herself and ask a client to go on a website of a public body to name him or her as an advocate?</p></speech>

When one reads and assesses the guidelines one will find that they suggest a common sense approach.  It appears to be that an overly bureaucratic approach is being taken in terms of what SUSI is doing.  We must be mindful, as a regulator, that the principle of accountability means that each data controller must make an assessment of how they will approach public representation.  Our guidelines were there to influence how the assessment is made.  The guidelines are being digested at the moment because they were issued in December of last year.  Once public sector bodies and local authorities have considered the guidelines we are then going to follow up by encouraging a standard approach but a less bureaucratic common sense approach.  We cannot get into every detail of what they will do in terms of safeguarding particularly sensitive data.  One thing we can do in terms of the SUSI application that was mentioned-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#F00400"><p>I gave just one example.</p></speech>

When one writes to SUSI then that should be the public representation verified without an individual having to fill in a form, which is five or six pages long.  Sometimes doing so delays the process.  I mean the objective of the public representation cannot happen because of a delay in bureaucracy and filling out forms.  We have asked and encouraged bodies to read our form and guidance but apply it accordingly.  We anticipate that the guidelines will work.  Obviously there will be individual things that will happen, o a case by case basis, that we will have to consider.  In the main it is expected that public sector authorities will apply a common sense approach to this very important function.  If there are issues with the interpretation of our guidelines or an overly conservative approach being taken by a public sector authority then of course we will consider the matter.  One must bear in mind that we cannot compel a body to share information and it is their assessment based on the principle of accountability.</p></speech>

If a Member of the Oireachtas breached data protection then his office would be able to carry out an investigation.  There is no point in us dominating this discussion.  I would say that his office has a duty of care and responsibility to host a workshop here and engage with Members of the Oireachtas.  We can give practical examples of where our work has been impeded by Departments using the GDPR as an excuse.  Perhaps Mr. Ryan and his senior management team can discuss the matter and come back to us with a plan.</p></speech>

We had an open invitation to do just that.  Following the release of guidelines we communicated that offer to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have done it in terms of recently meeting councillors at an annual conference by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, in Longford.  I am sure the members are familiar with the association.  We have carried out conferences and workshops of this nature.  We are very much open to continuing that work and spreading the message that people should adopt a common sense approach to public representation.</p></speech>

I am saying, in full support of what Senator Conway has said, that this is a universal experience and impeded is exactly what is happening in terms of our representative function.  It is a very serious matter and I cannot underscore it strongly enough for the delegation here this morning and thank the Senator for his contribution.</p></speech>

Let me outline why section 40 was brought in.  I lobbied significantly for the section.  When one peruses the record of the House one will see the engagements and contributions on both Committee and Report Stages.  The work was done because we are in a situation in this country where politicians receive thousands of representations on specific issues whether it is social welfare, health, education and so on and I really do believe that the commission has a job of work to do.  If this engagement achieves nothing else but re-establishes respect for public representatives among public bodies then it will be a good engagement.</p></speech>

Like Senator Conway said, perhaps the commission would provide a specific email or phone line that would allow public representatives to submit something that restricted our ability to do our representative function.</p><p>If that were communicated to us, it would be a helpful way for the commission to go directly to whomever the body is or the person who is going beyond what the GDPR provides.  I have some questions on the commission's relationship with the various technology companies.  What engagement has the commission had with them?  What is the level of co-operation it has had?  Does the commission give them notice if it is conducting an audit or does it conduct randomised audits of their data processing?  What is the relationship with them on a day-to-day basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Morgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#G00200"><p>In general terms, as members may know, the DPC has always reinforced the importance of an ongoing dialogue with multinational and technology companies to drive better awareness and increased understanding of the rules on data protection and, in particular, the interpretation and position of the GDPR in respect of those rules.  The ongoing dialogue we have with companies serves a very important function and has resulted in us becoming aware of the potential roll-out of products and services where we can input into the data protection compliance of those products and services and influence the technology companies on the manner in which they intend to move forward where we perceive risks to data subjects.</p> <p>  The statutory inquiries we have opened involve a completely different process to our consultation and engagement function.  Those statutory inquiries, 15 of which were opened into the multinational sector during 2018, have as their ultimate objective the reaching of a decision on whether there has been an infringement of one or more of the GDPR rules.  There are a number of stages to those processes and they are quite formalised.  Our annual report refers to the overall linear process.  Members will see a graphical depiction of that on page 30 of our annual report.  In essence, the process involves the stages of information gathering, evidence collection, setting the scope of the inquiry and applying the law to the evidence gathered to assess whether there appears to be an infringement of the legislation.  There is then the formal decision-making process whereby the decision-making function in the commission is engaged to make a formal decision which has status under the 2018 Act and to then consider whether, if an infringement has occurred, a corrective power should be applied.  That is a very different process from the supervision function.  I might hand over to my colleague, Ms Jennifer O'Sullivan, to say a bit more on the supervision of multinational companies and, in particular, statutory inquiries.</p></speech>

The inquiries cover a range of fundamental data protection matters.  Fundamental transparency obligations are being examined and fundamental elements of data protection law as to the legal basis for processing are being carefully looked at.  In light of the breaches reported by two of those companies during that period, we have examined the organisational and security measures of a couple of the companies under the format of a statutory inquiry.  Regarding the relationship with the organisations, we have a multifaceted approach.  Some of our engagement with them is in the context of consultation around their new products.  It is also important for us is to get a better understanding of their business models and the context in which they work.  That is important and useful for us as regulators with regard to the efficacy of our advice as well as with regard to our decision-making and judgment in separate contexts.  Those are some of the inquiries we have under way.  Since the start of 2019, we have commenced to open further inquiries.</p></speech>

As such, that is nine out of 15.  When will fines issue or decisions be made?  In France, decisions have been made under EU privacy rules and a fine has been issued to Google of &euro;50 million.  Google has its headquarters here.  When will decisions and outcomes emerge under the GDPR investigations?  People are awaiting that.  What is the timeline or trajectory for the decision-making process to conclude?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennifer O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#G00500"><p>The Deputy is right that we have seven inquiries into Facebook, two into WhatsApp and a further inquiry into Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook.  That represents a significant proportion of our formal inquiries.  Some of the inquires were in response to complaints, as the Deputy said, but others we undertook of our own volition having examined the context and wider situation.  On the timeline, my colleague outlined the very structured, formal, robust and consistent approach we need to take to these inquiries.  The latter elements of the process include engagement with our colleagues around the EU in the format of the European Data Protection Board.  We are obliged to consult with those colleagues as we near the decision-making process.  We must submit a draft decision to those colleagues which they are entitled to examine and submit reasoned and relevant objections on.  We must take account of those objections, consider whether they have a bearing on our draft decision and seek consensus.  That process takes time in its own right.</p> <p>  The decision of our French colleagues on the Google case involved a somewhat different situation.  Google only established itself as a controller in Ireland in January 2019.  Prior to 22 January 2019, any data protection authority around Europe with competence could have examined a complaint brought to it and taken enforcement action.  That is what our colleagues in the French data protection authority, the CNIL, did.  A complaint was submitted to them at the end of May and at the time the GDPR came into effect.  The CNIL engaged in collaboration and discussion with ourselves and other members of the European Data Protection Board to ensure we carefully examined the question of competence given that Google had not established a data controllership in the EU at all.  After that careful examination, we concluded that it was a matter for the CNIL to take up directly.  However, because it did not come under that definition of cases that are examined under the one-stop-shop model, the CNIL did not have to go through those stages of consultation with colleagues around the EU and EEA on the case.  It was a much shorter process which is why it was able to announce its decision on 21 January this year.  With the inquiries under way here, we are facing into that consultation process with those colleagues.</p></speech>

The consultation concerns the bringing into effect of legislation on online safety.  The legislation is also intended to transpose the EU's audiovisual media services directive.  Insofar as there is an intersection between data protection and issues of online safety, it occurs in relation to children in particular.  Data protection authorities have a newly enunciated obligation under article 57 of the GDPR to drive awareness of issues relating to children's rights and the risks for them in the processing of their data by organisations.</p><p>We have been exploring this issue during the course of 2018 to try to identify methods by which we could better raise awareness and drive good practices among organisations, particularly in the online sector.  With a view to doing that, as I referred to in my opening statement, we launched a consultation process at the end of 2018 which has two limbs to it.  The first is a written public consultation aimed at adult stakeholders.  Parents, educators, child protection organisations and children's representative groups are all encouraged to take part in this consultation, which engages a range of issues from transparency information to children to enable them to understand what is happening to their data when they engage in the context of online platforms and apps.  It also covers issues such as the appropriate age at which a child should be able to exercise his or her data protection rights because the GDPR is silent on that issue.  However we are conscious of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the particular provisions that relate to children having a right to have a say, in light of their evolving capacities, on matters that directly concern them.</p><p> The consultation also relates to issues around direct marketing and advertising to children and the use of children's data in that context.  Along with topical issues, of which the committee members will be aware, it relates to Article 8 of the GDPR concerning the age of digital consent and issues around age verification, including the verification obligations on online organisations to establish that consent to processing has been given by the holder of parental authority.  In light of all of these issues, which have been to the fore of public discussion in the past two years, we launched this consultation process.  We were also very keen to engage with children directly.  For this reason, we made the unique decision to launch a further stream of our consultation, this one aimed at garnering the views of children in particular.  We explored different methods by which we could more effectively do that and we decided that participation in a standard written consultation was potentially not the most effective way to gather children's views.  For this reason, in 2018 we designed a series of lessons plans from scratch, which aims to educate children in a classroom setting on basic principles of data protection to make them aware of their rights and the risks when they are sharing information in an online setting.  These education materials have been sent to every school and all of the Youthreach centres. </p><p> The timeframe for the consultation is still ongoing.  We have asked teachers in schools to participate, obviously on a voluntary basis, in delivering those lesson plans.  The ultimate output of those lesson plans is an exercise whereby teachers can gather the views of children on the topics that have been discussed.  They can also share their opinions on issues such as the age at which children should be able to make an access request to an organisation or seek the erasure of data they have shared online.  That consultation is ongoing and at the end of the process, the intention is to produce best practice guidance for organisations on the use of children's data and, importantly, guidance for children which will be written in accessible and easy to understand language to help them to better comprehend the issues around sharing information online.  Connected to that and in light of our obligation, as set out in the 2018 Act, to encourage the drawing up of codes of practice by industry on a range of issues concerning the processing of children's data, we also aim to use the outputs of that consultation to encourage industry members to come together and produce those codes of conduct.</p></speech>

There are a great many concerns about gambling addicts, one of the most vulnerable groups cohorts in society, being targeted on the basis of their previous activity.  The gambling companies use very complex technical tools to target people and there may have been data breaches.  Concerns about this have been submitted to the Data Protection Commission.  Are there active investigations under way against gambling companies?</p></speech>

On the age of digital consent, which relates to Article 8 of the GDPR, which is a challenge in itself in regard to the obligation on organisations to take reasonable steps to verify that consent has been provided by the holder of parental responsibility where consent is the basis for processing children's data, in other words, the data of anybody in Ireland under the age of 16 years.  This goes to one of the core issues we are considering in our consultation, namely, how organisations can adequately verify age to identify whether a child falls below or above that threshold.  Connected to that, there is the obligation on organisations and online platforms to verify parental consent in regard to that processing.  A range of different methods has been used by organisations, some of which have been based on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 1998 in the US, known as the COPPA Act.  COPPA is detailed legislation that specifically deals with these issues and sets out a range of different techniques, whereby organisations can potentially attempt to verify that the holder of parental responsibility has given consent to the processing.  One of the methods referred to in the legislation is the use of micro-payments on a credit card, the theory being that somebody over the age of 18 years will have access to a credit card.  We are aware that certain online organisations and companies rolled out this measure as a means of verifying whether consent had been adequately given.  We are aware that those companies have received a certain amount of criticism from parents who believed that the gathering of this additional financial information was excessive and disproportionate to the obligation on the organisation to verify parental consent.  It is a very complex issue and one that we intend to fully explore in the context of our consultation.  We will address it in the best practice guidance that we intend to issue after the closure of that consultation.</p> <p>  On the issue of the allocation of resources and staffing levels for the organisation, the Data Protection Commissioner has mentioned on a number of occasions that from 2014 onwards, the Government committed to increasing the funding of the Data Protection Commission in that year and to keeping it under review.  It has done this and the budget allocation to the commission has increased every year since 2014.  The budget for 2019 is &euro;15.2 million, which is a dramatic increase from the &euro;1.7 million allocated for 2013.  We are very much of the view that adequate funding for the Data Protection Commission is critical for it to continue to build its capacity and enable it to perform as an internationally respected, effective and robust regulator.  We have very much welcomed the increases in the budget in recent years.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact of the budget on staff, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we currently have 135 staff and we intend to recruit further staff in specialist areas by the end of this year, particularly in the legal, technology and investigatory functions.</p><p>These are priority areas of recruitment for us.  We intend to reach a staff complement of 165 by the end of 2019 based on this year's current budget allocation.  We also anticipate that we would need 190 staff by the end of 2020 and 220 staff by the end of 2021, based on our analysis to date of the trends and increasing volumes of matters that we are dealing with.  The funding issue remains vital to us being able to continue to perform in the manner that we must do, under the GDPR, and fully perform our functions under the expanded remit of the new legislation. <br/><br/>Finally, I shall deal with the question on gambling.  We do not have a regulatory remit for the gambling sector <i>per se</i>.  However, there will be or may be many situations where personal data could be used in the context of the gambling sector.  Some of the issues referred to might relate to online behavioural advertising, which is an issue that the office has examined in a number of different contexts.  My colleague, Ms O'Sullivan, will comment on the issue of online behavioural advertisements.</p></speech>

The office is examining the issue using a multi-pronged approach.  At European level we are working with our colleagues in the European Data Protection Board as part of a subgroup that examines social media and the targeting of individuals through social media.  We are working on the issue in a very universal way, which would include the targeting of vulnerable individuals such as gambling addicts that were mentioned by the Deputy.  The Data Protection Commission is comprehensively examining the issue.  During 2018, we established a technology leadership unit, which is doing significant research into the area of advertising technology or adtech that touches on some of the issues that have been mentioned.  We are also examining complaints and submissions from various groups who are concerned about the area and we are very carefully examining our statutory steps on that.</p></speech>

Section 137 represents a particular set of powers that can be invoked by authorised officers, in particular, an authorised officer once section 137 is triggered in the context of an ongoing statutory inquiry.  The authorised officer can, for example, hold an oral hearing and has more extensive powers than the standard powers of authorised officers, under section 130, to compel evidence on oath and a range of other particular powers.  That power has not been activated to date but we keep the exercise of our powers under review.  Each inquiry will depend on the context, the level of co-operation by the organisation in question, and the manner in which we need to go about gathering evidence and collating information on the scope of the particular inquiry.  The question of what powers are exercised at what point will really be very much context dependent.</p></speech>

In the context of the GDPR and the provision for co-operation in particular joint operations, which can be carried out between European data protection authorities, potentially, the provisions in the 2018 Act will allow for the authorisation of officers from other European data protection agencies to take part in our investigations.</p></speech>

My apologies but I am a bit hoarse.  We have talked about this stuff for nearly two years but it seems like a lifetime and yet I still do not understand it all.  I do not envy the delegation their jobs.  I would rather be pouring concrete in my bare feet than do their job.  I have prepared a number of questions, which are a criticism and simply seek more information.  A lot of it springs from our encounters with the Ministers while we debated this stuff over the period.  I have broken my questions into a couple of different sections.</p><p>As much as 30% of all complaints from 25 May to 31 December 2018 and 39% of all complaints made in the same period. under the pre-GDPR Acts, were access rights complaints.  In terms of the number of complaints received, access rights complaints were the biggest issue.  Does the delegation have a breakdown of the different types of access rights complaints?  How many relate to the one-month time limit for organisations to comply with access requests?  Are statistics available on the length of time that elapses between receiving a complaint, initiating an investigation and completing an investigation?  Howe does the DPC enforce the one-month limit for organisations to comply with access requests?  What enforcement options are available if an access request complaint cannot be resolved amicably as with case study No. 5 in the report? </p><p>I appreciate that the DPC is the <i>de facto </i>European regulator and has an enormous amount of work to get through.  According to anecdotal evidence provided to me by various people who have made access rights complaints to the DPC that it is slow to deal with a complaint that a data controller has simply ignored an access request.  If these procedures and delays are a result of insufficient funding then the funding of the DPC should be examined.  If the cause is something else then perhaps the way the complaints are handled needs to be examined.  Ms Morgan said that the DPC has 135 staff at present, and that there will be 160 staff by the end of the year and 190 staff by the end of next year.  Is that enough staff? </p></speech>

We can give the Deputy a breakdown of the figures.</p> <p>  In terms of the length of time between the DPC receiving a complaint and initiating activity, the Deputy is right that speed partly depends on the level of resources that we can apply.  As resources are increased the time shortens.</p><p>We are tracking that performance measure very carefully and seeing a slight reduction in it.</p><p> Further to the question asked by Deputy Jack Chambers, and the response given by my colleague, Ms Morgan, the question of funding and resources relates to the level at which we can simultaneously handle complaints and enforce.  Certain finite parts of each process need to be run through.  Certainly, we could do more simultaneously if we had more resources.  The Deputy's question related specifically to the length of time that passes between the receipt of a complaint and the initiation of an investigation.  When we receive a query, concern or complaint from an individual, we check if the issue relates to data protection to ascertain whether it is within our competence.  After that has been assessed, generally we seek initially to resolve the matter amicably between the individual and the organisation.  Access requests, in particular, tend to turn on their own facts.  By intervening and engaging with the data controller and the individual, we can quickly achieve a vindication of the individual's rights and ensure that through our intervention, he or she receives the full set of data he or she is seeking from the data controller.  It is not the case that each complaint ultimately ends up as an investigation.  That is particularly true in the case of access requests if it seems like the issue is specific to the case.  A small proportion would reach a statutory basis like that.  Ms Morgan might follow up on this.  When we achieve amicable resolution of a specific case, we always examine the issue in general with the data controller.  The achievement of an amicable resolution in a given case does not preclude us from continuing to examine the issue in a more systemic way.  Ms Morgan has more to say about amicable resolution in general.</p></speech>

In our experience, most of those who make complaints to our office are satisfied when they achieve the vindication of whatever right they had been trying without success to exercise against the data controller; for example, when they have received the information they sought in an access request or achieved the erasure of information.  Generally, it is not necessary to take further enforcement steps.  A question was asked about the enforcement methods that are available when we are unable to reach an amicable resolution because the data controller is not inclined to allow the data subject to exercise his or her rights.  Sometimes the complainant is not prepared to accept an amicable resolution.  That may relate to the general backdrop to the complaint.  We often find that data protection is the prism through which many consumer issues come to the fore.  For example, overcharging by banks or phone companies can be a frequent occurrence.  If there is a more complicated background to the complaint, the complainant might not be prepared to engage in the amicable resolution process.  When we encounter difficulties in getting a data controller to comply with a data subject's request, section 109(5) gives us the power to issue enforcement notices to direct the data controller to do a number of things, such as comply with a particular request or notify a data breach to an individual if that has not already been done.  More broadly speaking, we have a range of more general enforcement powers where a complaint might turn into a statutory inquiry.</p></speech>

I am curious about the use of the word "provisional" and I ask our guests to elaborate on it.  In what way are the DPC's findings in the draft report provisional or subject to change?  While I am familiar with the statutory inquiry workflow as outlined in the annual report, I am curious to know whether the DPC's findings at this draft report stage might change based on steps taken by the Department as the data controller in the period between receiving the draft report and the DPC's final decision, for example to address issues of coerced consent or the lack of a legal basis for processing.  Is it the case that the findings are provisional because the data controller might offer a further defence against the findings contained in the draft report?  Perhaps out guests could comment on the concerns that this process involves a certain amount of collaboration between the regulator and the data controller.</p> <p>  The workflow of the statutory inquiry is set out on pages 28 to 30 of the annual report.  Is it the case that step 6 in the process, in which the "DPC decision-maker notifies [the] DPC draft decision to other concerned EU data protection authorities", is necessitated by Article 60 of the GDPR, which refers to "Cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned"?  Is the statutory inquiry process, including for example the European Data Protection Board dispute resolution phase of the process, the same for all DPC statutory inquiries?  Is the same process or workflow for these types of investigations used by all data protection authorities in the EU?  Do our guests think this process is applied in a consistent manner across the EU?</p> <p>  Late last year, a spokesperson for the DPC indicated that no more than a summary of the parts of the final public services card report which are deemed to be in the public interest would be published.  I ask our guests to elaborate on what is meant by the public interest in this context.  How could it be in the public interest to conceal aspects of an investigation?  Do our guests agree that if the full report is not published, there will be a problem with the transparency of the investigation?  As I see it, this investigation has real potential to be a definitive or landmark statement by the DPC on data processing in the public sector, regardless of how the DPC rules on the various elements of the investigation.  During Question Time in the D&aacute;il last month, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, told me she "would have the legs cut off" her if she went against the DPC's clear instruction not to release the draft report.  The Minister did not understand my question.  I was actually asking about the possibility of publishing the DPC's final decision, rather than the interim or draft report.  Will our guests clarify whether the DPC has instructed the Minister not to publish the draft report?  If it has, why was such an instruction given?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Morgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#K00400"><p>I would like to preface my response to the Deputy's queries about the report that has been produced as part of our ongoing investigation into the public services card by saying there is a limit to how much we can say about an ongoing investigation.  Members will be aware of case law in respect of to issues such as prejudgment and the issuing of comments that could potentially raise concerns regarding bias or the predetermination of issues.  The investigation is still very much ongoing.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to "concerns [around] collaboration between the regulator and the data controller", which in this context is the Department.  I refute that comment absolutely.  There is absolutely no collaboration.  As an independent regulator, we have to investigate the facts of the issues that are to be determined in the scope of an inquiry.  We do that in an entirely independent and impartial manner.  The steps we follow in any investigation must accord with the right of all of the parties to any given process to fair procedures and procedural safeguards.  The report in question, which was issued on a provisional basis to the Department, is said to be provisional because it allows for the Department's right to be heard.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a fundamental aspect of natural and constitutional justice within our legal system.  Phraseology such as "provisional" is used to denote the fact that submissions were allowed to be received.  The Department was given an opportunity to make submissions on the report addressing any aspects of the provisional findings which it did not consider to be an accurate reflection of the factual or legal situations, in order that we could take account of such matters in our further considerations and in finalising the report.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the overall timeline for that report.</p><p>As referred to in our annual report, we received a significant volume of submissions totalling approximately 470 pages of documents from the Department in response to our invitation to make submissions.  We are in the process of reviewing that material.  </p><p> On the overall scope of the ongoing investigation, this has not been a static inquiry.  There has been an element of dynamism as certain things have changed in the course of the investigation.  For example, one of the issues that is, of course, being investigated relates to the question of transparency and information that is given to data subjects by the Department.  During our investigation, the Department published a comprehensive guide to use of the public services card, PSC.  It also published for the first time a consolidation of the relevant social welfare legislation in this area.  The scope of the inquiry has had to move to take account of these changes.  Additionally, members will be aware that the practice in regard to the use of the public services card to obtain a driver's licence has changed considerably in the course of our investigation.  For example, between June 2017 and August 2018, a PSC was required to sit the driver theory test but, as of 20 August last year, the PSC became one of a number of acceptable forms of identity confirmation in that regard.  The investigation is somewhat dynamic.  We anticipate that it will conclude within the year with the issuing of our final report to the Department.</p><p> On the issues raised by the Deputy around publication of the report, the investigation has been conducted under the previous legislation, namely, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  Our powers of publication are constrained and determined by the extent of the powers set out in those Acts.  Although the 2018 Act provides for express powers of publication under section 141, there is no equivalent section in the previous legislation.  However, if the Department were to consent to the publication of that report, we would very much be open to considering its publication in full with the caveat that, obviously, consideration would have to be given to any confidential information that was not amenable to publication.  Overall, we have no objection to publication of the report once it is finalised.</p></speech>

Does this kind of facial image matching meet the definition of biometric data in Article 4(14) of the GDPR and the reference therein to "specific technical processing"?  Last year, the Data Protection Commission issued guidelines in respect of biometric data.  One type of biometric data it identified was raw images consisting of recognisable data such as an image of a face or a fingerprint.  This appears to be in agreement with the Article 29 Working Party example of biometric data which specifically mentions a photograph of a face.  It seems obvious to me that a photograph is a raw image consisting of recognisable data such as an image of a face.  I ask the witnesses to confirm or clarify the position of the commission on the biometric nature of a photograph?  Are photographs biometric data?</p></speech>

I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Ryan, to address that issue in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cathal Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#L00600"><p>Article 9 of the GDPR sets out conditions for processing of special category data.  Biometric data is included within that.  Under Article 9, it is considered a derogation.  Effectively, in order to process sensitive data, one needs to rely on one of the derogations set out in Article 9(2).  One will see what measures need to be implemented, such as explicit consent or whether it is in the public interest, which is distinguished to be "for reasons of substantial public interest".  The processing of biometric data and, in particular, facial recognition software involves the area covered by Article 9 and one will need to satisfy a condition under Article 9 to proceed.  I have not carried out any assessment of the case of which the Deputy may be aware, although I think he is raising it more as a general issue.</p> <p>  Much of this issue comes down to the kind of processing that is taking place.  For example, processing sometimes takes place in an airport in a situation where there is no attempt to attach any personal information but, rather, to measure a queue.  Is there processing of personal data in measuring a queue of individuals coming into an airport and leaving through the security gates?  There are different types of processing taking place.  There is an important distinction between matching facial data to other data and just looking at individuals moving through an airport queue but not trying to match that data with anything else.  Much of the issue comes down to the processing itself, the nature of the processing and whether there is matching of data with other personal data such as the person's name and so on.</p></speech>

The smart CCTV project of Limerick City and County Council seems to have been abandoned because it will not comply with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act.  Approximately &euro;350,000 was spent on the project, which is a crazy waste of money.  We previously raised problems with the scheme in the Chamber and warned about the lack of a legal basis for it.  It proposed that deep learning and artificial intelligence be overlaid on a network of cameras that could count footfall, keep a record of the registration of every passing car 24 hours a day and recognise faces and patterns.  Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 specifies that CCTV schemes should only be authorised for securing public order and safety in public places, but the proposals for the project published by Limerick City and County Council stated that the scheme would be used to monitor tourism and, bizarrely enough, for animal control.  I hope that the decision of the Data Protection Commission regarding CCTV schemes and law enforcement surveillance will, when published, deter other public bodies from wasting such an amount of money on a mass surveillance project that does not have a legal basis.</p> <p>  Last year, I tabled a parliamentary question to try to establish if there were limits on the technology that could be used as part of the Department of Justice and Equality community-based CCTV scheme.  The annual report indicates that the Data Protection Commission is investigating automatic number plate recognition cameras, for example, as part of its inquiry.  Section 31(d) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 bestows responsibility to publish guidelines in respect of CCTV cameras on the Policing Authority.  I wrote to the Policing Authority in March of last year regarding the use of automated number plate recognition and facial recognition cameras as part of the Department of Justice and Equality community-based CCTV grant aid scheme.  The Policing Authority confirmed that, rather strangely, it had not yet issued any guidelines under section 38 of the Act and the Department had not issued guidelines before the Policing Authority was established.  As far as I am aware, no guidelines have yet been issued.  However, the Policing Authority also stated in its reply to me that it has no role in respect of the technical specifications of CCTV cameras.  Neither the Minister nor the Policing Authority seems to have any responsibility for this issue.  I submitted a freedom of information request to the Policing Authority seeking further information on any work it may have done on CCTV guidelines.  In a 2017 comparative research paper on CCTV, the Policing Authority suggested that a code of practice might be a better idea than required guidelines.  However, that would require section 38 to be amended.  The Policing Authority also suggested in papers released under a freedom of information request that drafting a code of practice would really be a job for the Data Protection Commission rather than the Policing Authority.  In an email sent in September 2017, the head of legal policy and research at the Policing Authority addresses the statutory role in regard to CCTV.  The email states that there is limited value in the Policing Authority putting such guidelines in place and that most of the issues in respect of monitoring of CCTV come under the remit of the Data Protection Commission.</p><p>Will Mr. Ryan confirm whether the DPC has had any contact with the Policing Authority in respect of these matters and whether it intends to make a decision on the technical specifications of the surveillance equipment it will permit to be used?  I refer to how powerful or intrusive such equipment might be.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that we have taken it upon ourselves to begin an investigation of community CCTV, the intention behind which is to discover what is happening.  As indicated earlier, 31 local authorities operate the scheme, perhaps in a different manner, although a code of practice is in place.  This is currently under review and our inquiry will assist in that regard.  The inquiry has been outlined and we provided an update on the status in our annual report.  It will take time because we must engage with 31 local authorities on the issue.  I noted in a report that the work the committee has done this month in respect of rural policing and so on is important.  We are cognisant that we need to get the matter right.  One of the issues that has arisen is accountability, that is, who is responsible and who is administratively responsible for the data collected.  As part of that investigation, other technologies may come to the fore, such as automatic number plate recognition, which the Deputy mentioned.  On legislation, we expect the legislative provision to allow for it.  In the absence of a specific legislative provision, it is a matter of carrying our appropriate assessments in advance of the processing of data, particularly the data on number plate recognition, which could be matched to individuals' names, addresses and so on.  Even in advance of anything being provided for in legislation, an assessment would have to take place of whether it is appropriate to use this type of technology, and in what ways and for what purpose will the technology be used.</p> <p>  We have had interaction with the Policing Authority in recent years in respect of its strategy statements, and we have held meetings with it.  I am not aware of the specific code of conduct or the legislation to which the Deputy referred.  I thank him for that because it is good to know.  On codes of practice, it is worth noting that the DPC does not have a role in making a code of practice unless it is specifically prescribed in law.  Under Article 40 of the GDPR, we are tasked with encouraging codes of conduct.  In this situation, we would encourage a code of conduct for community policing, to be updated, reviewed and published.  It is a great document for accountability and transparency, particularly as anyone can read it and understand what the local authority or the community CCTV scheme is doing.  As the committee will be aware, most communities' CCTV schemes are set up following public consultation and, therefore, there is an opportunity for the community to raise any objections or issues with their use.</p> <p>  On guidance, we would assist the Policing Authority but if the guidance is a matter for it, perhaps we could ask whether it intends to do anything about it and assist in that process.  From our own point of view, we are at a final stage of drafting guidance for CCTV, which I hope will be issued very soon.  It will be more generic and will not deal specifically with CCTV for public sector use.  To follow on, we hope to provide generic guidance for CCTV and address some of the new technologies that are being used for State surveillance or surveillance in general.  We will drill down on that guidance and there will be specific guidance on CCTV for local authorities' community CCTV, and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how it uses CCTV.  That is our plan for raising awareness, setting the parameters of what type of use is appropriate, and getting the message out that when rolling out large-scale CCTV monitoring, it must done following an appropriate, detailed assessment that mitigates risk and includes safeguards to ensure that the data protection rights of individuals are protected.</p></speech>

For example, if, during that intervening period, another data protection authority had received an equivalent complaint which related to the set-up process that an Android phone uses, the downstream effect on advertising and so on, it would not have been precluded from investigating it.  Any data protection authority could, depending on its own national legislation, have examined the issue in its own right.</p></speech>

However, the commission has come in for some scathing criticism with regard to how it regulates the large tech companies, the multinationals and so on.  In the Schrems case, for example, the assertion was that the DPC could have taken direct action against Facebook rather than taking the convoluted route via the courts, etc.  People such as the former German data protection commissioner have made the point that Facebook based itself in Ireland because it can get away with murder and it is the location with the lowest levels of data protection, although I accept that we are improving and have beefed up our mechanisms in that regard.  Following the shocking revelation of the close relationship with the Irish political establishment, and bearing in mind how companies such as Facebook view the Taoiseach as a puppet they can manipulate in order to secure light-touch regulation, we are in a peculiarly unique situation.  On the one hand, giant multinationals are located here.  Some believe that this is because of light-touch regulation but it is clear that it is also for taxation purposes.</p><p>As they are located here, the DPC has become the EU data regulator, which is a challenging role.  My criticisms are in no way directed at any of the witnesses because I recognise that data protection is a challenging job.  As the commission is funded by Government, how does it deal with that conflict and in light of it would it be better if the commission was funded by Europe?  </p><p> How would the witnesses describe the commission's relationship with the permanent government, the Civil Service?  How does it work and could it be improved upon?  I am conscious that in some ways this is a new role for the commission.  Have the witnesses perceived a difficulty in the commission's relationship with the permanent government?  I appreciate that nobody is going to admit to a committee that they a difficult relationship with the Government but in terms of accountability is there a better way in which that relationship could be managed?  Has accountability emerged as a problem for the commission in the context, in particular, of the big technology multinationals and so on?</p></speech>

We always seek to protect, bolster and reinforce our independence in our regulatory activities, in our work as an organisation in terms of the priorities we place on particular matters of enforcement, in the other non-investigative contexts in which we work and in the work we do on encouraging compliance.  We always seek to protect that at its core.  The GDPR is emphatic on the independence of supervisory authorities in general terms and in specific terms.  The GDPR is the answer to the requirement for supervisory authorities to act independently.  We now have one common law in Europe.  A framework has been established to ensure the consistent application of that law, including in respect of the level of sanctioning and the level of decision-making in respect of the gravity and seriousness of infringements.  Deputy Wallace referenced Articles 60 and 65.  There are robust and rigorous procedures in place within the GDPR to ensure that consistent application of this legal framework.  Article 65 has not been put in practice yet.  We have had fewer than ten Article 60 decisions across the EU achieve completion.  The EDPP is very much still testing the waters of these procedures.</p> <p>  In summary, the framework is in place to ensure that every data protection authority in Europe is applying the law consistently and in its findings.</p></speech>

Regarding our budget and funding, this year the commission will become the Accounting Officer for its own funding.  We will be separate from the Department in that regard from next year, and we will have our own Vote.  It is not that this speaks directly to our independence as a supervisory authority but it further underlines our independence as an organisation.  This change will occur in the coming months.</p></speech>

As I understand it, no fines have been levied yet.  Given that none of the investigations would necessarily be terribly complex or long-winded, why have no fines been levied?  Is the commission satisfied that none of the cases which have been concluded met the threshold for a fine and how much discretion does it have in that regard?  Have there been internal discussions on whether a fine should be levied?  We see fines as an effective mechanism for correcting behaviour.  A strong signal tends to get the message out.</p></speech>

There is a decision made in the context of a statutory inquiry that is opened under section 10 and that decision is on whether there has been an infringement of the GDPR or the 2018 Act.  The next step which the commission must take in exercising its decision-making power is to decide if there has been an infringement the type of corrective power that should be imposed.  As the Deputy mentioned, administrative fines are one of a range of corrective powers that can be imposed by the commission.  These corrective powers are the same across Europe.</p> <p>  Regarding the process that has to be followed, earlier I referred committee members to the statutory inquiry process we have outlined in our annual report.  It is important to underline that.  There cannot be any short cuts taken in the statutory inquiry and the decision making that occurs at the end of that inquiry.  Ultimately, our decisions as a quasi-judicial body must be robust and legally sustainable.  There are extensive powers in terms of judicial remedies that are open to any party that is impacted by our decision.  We are mindful, in having plotted out those procedures over and above what is in the 2018 Act, that we must take full account of the right to due process and to fair procedures, which are all referenced in the GDPR as well.  As I said no short cuts can be taken in regard to our inquiries.  It is a process that must be followed.  Once the fact finding stage has been completed and the analysis of the facts has been completed and the official decision-making function has been carried, out the end point will be a determination as to whether a corrective power or administrative fine, among others, should be imposed.</p> <p>  I refer the committee to Article 83 of the GDPR, which sets out the circumstances that must be taken into account by a data protection authority when determining the level of fine that should be imposed where there has been found to be an infringement of the GDPR.  Of particular importance in this regard are issues such as the nature, gravity and duration of the particular infringement.  The GDPR also emphasises that the purpose of administrative fines is to be effective dissuasion.  They must also be proportionate.  These are all factors which will be taken into consideration in the context of the decision-making phase, which will come after the investigation phase of our statutory inquiries concludes.</p></speech>

My question started when her response ended.  I am speaking specifically about cases which the commission has concluded fairly in accordance with the legislation.  I know that the commission has identified breaches.  In the context of all those cases the commission fairly and transparently investigated, there was no case in respect of which the commission deemed it necessary to impose a fine.  How many of those cases met the threshold for a fine and were fines discussed in that context?  As I said, we see the imposition of a fine as an effective remedy.</p></speech>

In terms of complaint handling, our obligations under the GDPR are to handle a complaint and investigate it to the extent appropriate.  In complaint handling we are always focused on vindication of the data subject's rights.  It may be that having concluded a complaint handling function and having obtained an outcome for the individual we then go on to consider whether issues that had been raised in the context of that individual complaint are systemic to the data processing operations of a given organisation or pose a particularly high risk to individuals who are also users of services or products of a particular organisation.</p><p>There is a decision to be taken by us as to whether it is appropriate, when we are faced with a set of circumstances that might indicate systemic or high-risk issues around processing, to commence a statutory inquiry.</p><p> It is in the context of statutory inquiries that we can impose administrative fines as a range of corrective powers and, as I referred to, 49 statutory inquiries have been opened by us.  In that context, it is open to us, at the end of a statutory inquiry wherein we have found one or more infringements, to impose a corrective power or another administrative fine.</p><p> To contrast that with complaint handling, we can use a different range of methods to close off complaints.  We might issue advice to the data controller if we find that a company's systems are not necessarily compliant with the GDPR but the complaint lends itself to amicable resolution or to another of the different types of outcome that are contemplated by section 109, which sets out what steps we can take in handling a complaint.</p></speech>

I was a bit scared about some of the points made about the public services card, PSC, investigation and found the responses to Deputy Wallace's questions a little bit chilling.  The commission has been investigating this since 2017.  The witnesses have said that things have moved on and the issues relating to driver's licences and so on have been sorted.  In fairness, the commission identified, well over a year ago, the illegal basis upon which the Department was operating the PSC.  We know, as a result of the dialogue in society, a number of changes have come about, but those are not as good as they should be.  Let us be clear that the Attorney General gave a legal opinion which, this time last year, led to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport telling the Road Safety Authority, RSA, not to rely on the PSC for driver's licences but it still kept doing it for another five months, in flagrant breach of that ministerial instruction.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner said this was a pressing matter which needed urgent attention in August 2017.  Our systems needed to be sorted at that stage.  Here we are in April 2019, and it has not been concluded.  I do not get that.  I note the exchange the witnesses had with Deputy Wallace about the full report and I am not entirely clear on that.  I am not clear why it has been delayed.  The Department gave the commission 470 pages that have to be analysed.  That seems like a general sort of Civil Service approach to inquiries - dump a pile of information late in the day and bog people down in that sort of stuff.  That said, 470 pages is not an enormous amount, given the time this investigation has been going on.  When can we expect it to be concluded?  I know the witnesses said the commission does not have the expressed powers to publish but do they think there is a legal impediment to publishing, or did I understand the witnesses correctly in replying to Deputy Wallace that the commission would have to get the permission of the Department to publish the final report?  I was not fully sure on that point.</p></speech>

I reiterate some of the comments we made previously and outlined in the annual report that there are a range of quite complex legal issues under consideration in the context of that report.  We have considered a vast volume of information, both publicly available and provided to us in the context of those submissions.  That includes information that has come not only from the Department itself but information we have had to consider in the context of the use of the PSC by other Departments.  </p> <p>  In connection with the further steps to be taken, it is vital that we follow fair procedures in each and every inquiry and investigation that we conduct and do not short-circuit those procedures.  That involves allowing the right to be heard to the party that will be impacted by any decision or outcome of our investigation process.  That applies as much to Departments as it does to any private or commercial actor.  The need to allow the opportunity for submissions to be made where there might be findings in respect of the law is an essential element of the steps we have to take in any investigation or inquiry.</p></speech>

There is no short-circuiting.  This has been going on a long time.  The indications were that the report would be finished in April 2018 and it is now April 2019 and there are serious issues relating to it.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses know how many bodies are using the SAFE 2 PSC system and how many of these are requiring that this be the sole form of acceptable identification?

In a recent reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection reiterated her view and, I suppose, that of the Department that a SAFE 2 PSC photograph is not itself biometric in nature and that the Department does not collect or share biometric data.

Deputy Jack Chambers raised questions about the digital age of consent which was set at 16, despite our best wishes and those of every single child protection expert in this State.  One of the main movers who advocated behind the scenes to raise the digital age of consent to 16 from the originally accepted age of 13 was an adviser to, and quoted by, some members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who are not in attendance.  That person is now involved in a private company, which is seeking to produce patented age verification biometric technology, something for which a larger market was created when we raised the age of consent to 16.  That is interesting and not surprising.</p> <p>  Leaving that aside, how is the age of consent being implemented?  How is the age being verified?  Does the commission know if companies are using technical fixes or what is going on with that verification?  I know that in the US under the Child Online Protection Act, COPA, companies are asking parents to scan copies of their credit cards or Government IDs or whatever.</p><p>Is anything like that happening here?  What is the role of the commission in that?  I am aware that a consultation is under way.</p></speech>

We will pose the question of what the appropriate age of digital consent should be.  We noted the representations made by various charities and children's representatives.  Under section 31, a review of the age is to be carried out after three years and we hope the consultation exercise will provide us with valuable feedback on the opinions of stakeholders.  That is connected to the exercise of children's rights, which is another pertinent issue under the Data Protection Act.</p> <p>  On the question on the operation of the age of digital consent, there are mechanisms such as age gating, which organisations use to verify children's age by asking for a date of birth, and giving only a certain number of attempts to demonstrate that they are over the age of digital consent.  Lots of different sectors and jurisdictions have struggled with this and we are examining how to implement an effective age verification method, bearing in mind that when a platform tries to collect the age of users it will lead to the collection of age information on all users, which raises issues around the excessive collection of personal data under the GDPR provisions.  They are complicated issues and we are hoping our consultation will throw some light on what may be best practice for organisations. </p></speech>

My final point is about data subject access rights and the garda&iacute;.  Does the commission have any role in respect of data held by garda&iacute;?  There have been a number of cases where people have sought information about themselves from garda&iacute; but did not get the full facts, supposedly for security reasons.  Is there anything people can do or anything the commission can do to help people in these circumstances?  I am aware of people who did not get a job as a result of a Garda vetting operation and, while they got some information back from garda&iacute;, other information was denied to them on security grounds.  They believe this to be erroneous and if they knew what the information was they would be able to challenge it.  They are pretty sure they never did anything to warrant being blocked.  There must be some way around this.</p></speech>

We can look at the individual complaint and ask what information is not being shared and we can carry out an inspection to determine whether the test for non-disclosure of the full set of data was applied correctly.  In the past, garda&iacute; may not have disclosed certain information that could have prejudiced the investigation of a case.  We have to look at what data are not being disclosed and make a determination on that.  It is difficult to do so without the necessary knowledge.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very good data protection unit, which was set up following the GDPR.

If State security was the argument being made, it would probably fall under old legislation, namely, the 1998 Act.  Typical Garda operations fall under the law enforcement directive.

If an individual feels he or she is not getting access to data for whatever reason, such a person can make a complaint and we will then have to handle it.</p></speech>

I am thinking of a particular case where people were denied information and we have heard of a number of tragic cases where people applying for citizenship have been told to come along to the ceremony, only to get a letter shortly before the event telling them it is being postponed.

We are all about ensuring that individuals have the right transparency concerning how their data is processed.  That is a significant piece of work in which we are engaged in terms of ensuring that information notices are clear and people are aware of how their data is being processed.  It relates to the recommendations of the Murray report.  I know the latter concerned surveillance and telecommunications data but it relates to ensuring there is proper oversight.  If someone is stating that data cannot be shared on the basis that it will prejudice a case, how we do know that?  What notification has been mentioned?  What authorisation has been given?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has those checks and balances in house but in respect of an individual who wonders why it possesses something it is not sharing with him or her, a complaint could be submitted to our office or a query could be sent for us to check.  We have that relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We work with the data protection unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all the time.  A lot of what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing involves updating its systems.  It has implemented a really robust assessment package so much of what it does is underpinned by data protection impact assessments.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is really implementing the law enforcement directive in full in terms of its assessments, the appropriateness of assessments and all of its procedures.  So there will be checks and balances internally to assess whether it is doing things right but, obviously, if an issue arises where an individual feels he or she is not getting all of the data for which he or she has asked, there is recourse to figure out whether the law is being applied in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

She has done the same to me in respect of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  I would like confirmation that INIS is accountable to the DPC regarding any issue that the commission wishes to raise and that those who are applicants for consideration by INIS in terms of their status and standing in this jurisdiction are also entitled to the same protections as citizens.  Is that the case?  Yes.  I thank our guests for that.</p> <p>  It was stated that the DPC's remit as a regulator applies regardless of industry.  Reference was made to the 15 inquiries relating to the multinational technology sector and that a further 33 domestic statutory inquiries are under consideration.  They have been referred to during the course of the exchanges here this morning.  Do any of those domestic statutory inquiries apply to any of the banking institutions functioning in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

Of the other two inquiries, one relates to a series of data breach notifications made to us relating to Tusla so we are examining the security issues around those data breach notifications.</p> <p>  Insofar as the financial sector is concerned, we certainly receive an awful lot of complaints from consumers regarding banks and insurance companies in particular.  Data breach issues constitute a very salient issue for that industry.  A very large proportion of the data breach notifications we receive relate to banks and insurance companies.  It is something at which we are looking to decide whether or not there is merit in opening statutory inquiries of our volition rather than inquiries being complaint-led with regard to that ongoing stream of breach notifications.  From analysing the breach notifications that come to us, we can see that organisational security measures remain a really big risk and a very large number of breaches relate to disclosure that really should not have happened.  An example would be a bank statement or an insurance policy being sent out to the wrong address or an old address.  That is something we are actively targeting in terms of further statutory inquiries on the domestic front.</p></speech>

There is a much more serious issue.  I use the word &quot;domestic&quot;.  The selling of mortgages is a significant issue of address in these Houses.  What does it entail?  It entails the selling on of all of the data that is relevant to the borrower.  Regarding a borrower presenting to any financial institution, the experience heretofore would have involved a high-street engagement with the local presence of any of the banking institutions.  There is a knowledge and recognition factor and while a lot of the decision-making has been centralised and taken away from the high-street representatives of the respective banking institutions, the fact remains that, regardless of the small print, the people signing up for these arrangements had no idea that their information would have been available for sale on the market to vulture funds.  A number of people have reflected their great upset and disquiet at this.  Let me underscore that there should be no distinction because it is an issue that needs to be substantively addressed but we should not for a moment believe that the main banking institutions are just selling on non-performing loans or under-performing loans.  For whatever reason, they are selling on fully performing loans.  That is a fact.  Somebody enters into an arrangement with a banking institution and signs off to borrow to purchase a home or whatever might be the case and his or her loan is performing in line with the agreement with the bank throughout.  This person can then find himself or herself being notified by the bank that it is selling on the loan.  The person then appeals the decision and the appeal is rejected.  As someone who formerly worked in a banking institution in this country, I can attest that this is the case.  This is a really vexed issue.  I cannot emphasise enough that selling on a loan involves selling on the individual data in tandem.  It is being sold as a package.  We do not even know if the information is retained in the jurisdiction.  Invariably, that is not the case.  Vulture funds <i>et al</i>. are international operators and that is not what people here understood they were getting involved with in the first instance.  This is a very serious issue.</p><p>I urge the DPC to give serious consideration to addressing this.  I will not put a tooth in it, but, in my opinion, there are flagrant abuses, including of the nature I have just recounted.  It is inexplicable, which is all I can say in that regard.</p><p> Our guests indicated that rather than reacting to a request, the commission might initiate a statutory inquiry.  How are statutory inquiries initiated?  How are they carried out?  Is it of the commission's own volition or is there a request process that has given rise to the 33 domestic statutory inquiries currently in train and will give rise to any in future?  Can the methodology employed be clarified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Morgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#R00200"><p>There are two types of statutory inquiry we can process under section 110 of the 2018 Act.  We can take one of our own volition or we can commence an inquiry which is complaint-led.  There are a range of factors which will influence our decision on whether to commence an inquiry of our own volition.  For example, if we see trends or patterns which point to particular issues within a sector or specific organisation and which raise wide-scale concerns regarding the processing of personal data, in other words if systemic issues are pointed to, it will factor significantly into a decision on whether it is appropriate to open an such an inquiry.  Factors include volumes of data subjects being affected along with different types of processing operations and the different types of data being processed.  Obviously, there are special categories of personal data that merit particular protection under the GDPR.</p> <p>  If there are certain subsets of data which fall into the mix and which pose higher risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals in the context of data protection, that is an issue which will weigh heavily on our decision on whether to commence a statutory inquiry.  Equally, it is not just trends in complaints submitted to us that have a bearing on how we decide where to apply the significant resources required to carry out statutory inquiries.  We may have indications from civil society of a belief that there are issues with a particular organisation or sector or industry.  There are a number of privacy advocacy groups that are very active in this area.  Equally, issues may be brought to our attention by the media and, of course, elected representatives also.  There is a range of sources from which we can be alerted to particular issues, including our own internal monitoring of issues, breach notifications, complaints and trends raised by queries submitted to our information and assessment unit.  All of this is factored into the mix.</p></speech>

There was a reference to policing to which Mr. Ryan responded.  As a committee, we have given dedicated address in the course of this year's series of hearings to the whole post-Brexit situation.  Does the commission anticipate any impact on its role with the advent of Brexit, whether by crash-out or agreement?  From a justice perspective, we have had representatives here from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  Are there implications for cross-Border policing and co-operation and the sharing of information on individuals in the event of the worst-case scenario presenting?  Data protection and data sharing are a critical part of the co-operation between the two police forces on this island and have wider implications.  A committee colleague and I represent our parliamentary institution on the EU oversight committee relating to Europol.  It is not something I expect that our guests will be able to comment on immediately but it is an important matter.  I am looking at it from the domestic point of view - that of the island of Ireland.  Is it something the commission has considered?  What our guests tell us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennifer O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#R00400"><p>I might answer the question on Brexit generally first and then hand over to Mr. Ryan to speak directly to the exchange of information between policing authorities on the island and across Europe.  The commission has been engaged heavily in Brexit preparations for the past several months and it is an active topic of conversations with colleagues in the EU at the EDPB.  The transfer of personal data outside the EU is a central element of EU data protection law and is taken very seriously because the relative standard of protection for personal data is so high in Europe.  To not have those safeguards in place would undermine that standard.  The DPC has been issuing guidance to organisations that seek to transfer data from Ireland to the UK.  Over the past several months, we have being doing that and it has also been done via the Government's communications channels.  The EDPB has also been issuing guidance on that.  We are also working with our UK counterparts in preparation for the potential impact on live cases that are cross-border in nature.  On the transfers question, there are several mechanisms available for the transfer of personal data outside the EU.  If the UK leaves without a withdrawal agreement, it will be considered a third country.  For regular organisations, the simplest and quickest method to utilise will be standard contractual clauses.  We have templates for those on our website.  There are some organisations which choose to use a mechanism called "binding corporate rules".  When it comes to transfers by public bodies, particular provisions are in place and the DPC has been involved recently in authorising some of those as required by the GDPR.  Mr. Ryan might speak specifically to the question of the exchange of data in a policing context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cathal Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019040300002#R00500"><p>Brexit is on everyone's mind and that is certainly the case in our office.  We are receiving the legislation or administrative arrangements that follow Brexit.  It is an ongoing consultation on the different arrangements being put in place.  On the policing side of things, the framework is there in the Data Protection Act.  Sections 96 to 100, inclusive, set out the parameters within which one can share data.  Without getting into the specific provisions, there is first of all no adequacy decision in place, which is something the commission can approve.  That is something that may come later.  The big thing in relation to the sharing of data is to ensure the same safeguards and rules apply when one shares data to a third country.  Standard contractual clauses do this.  However, administrative arrangements can also be put in place which, provided they are appropriately specified, can actually act as another way to ensure appropriate safeguards are implemented.  They can ensure there is a similar level of protection for the data in the third country as is provided for in this country.  For example, we are currently analysing whether those safeguards are put in place.  Rather than just one line, it gets into a very detailed level of what data is being shared and how and what oversight there is of that data.  Provided these safeguards, of which there are many more, are implemented, we take a practical view of Brexit.</p> <p>  We have a long-standing relationship with the UK.  Mutual assistance has been in place for quite some time, albeit it will fall by the wayside in Brexit.  It is very important to note, however, that there is a data protection office in the UK, namely the ICO, which has been a leader in the field of data protection.  The ICO is heavily involved in data protection at an EDPB level but it will have to leave the board on foot of Brexit.  The ICO has nevertheless been at the forefront in implementing a law which brings all of the provisions of the GDPR over into English legislation.  Obviously, there will be some divergences due to sovereignty if Brexit happens, but the core elements of the protection of data are there.  There is oversight and there is a regulator in the ICO.  As such, we have to be very pragmatic and understand that these structures are already in place.  It is really a matter now of deciding what level of data is being shared, how it is being shared and what level of oversight there will be of the sharing arrangements.</p><p>Something else one will note, especially when one looks at which provision they go for, whether it is section 98 or 99, there will be a function for the DPC in terms of ensuring that reporting requirements are fulfilled.  We could inspect whether the documentation that is being shared is appropriate, in line with the administrative arrangements or whatever arrangements are put in place.  There will be a proactive involvement of the DPC in terms of monitoring those sharing arrangements.</p><p> I go back to the fact that our friends, the data protection officer unit of the AGS will be well aware of these provisions.  They will be trying to figure out which is most appropriate to them, in terms of their everyday work and in terms of their interaction with the UK.  Clearly, they are the ones who will make the decision and we will help them in that decision in terms of what is required, what level of data needs to be shared, and the date and time of the transfer.  Retention is also a big issue.  I refer to ensuring that if one shares it to a third country, it is not then shared beyond that third country, and if it is, how is it being shared beyond that third country, etc.  There is a level of transparency required which is appropriate to the function of the AGS and we would be the body that would reflect and review those data-sharing arrangements under section 98 or 99 of the Data Protection Act.</p><p> It is very possible.  We have to be pragmatic, given Brexit.  The Commission, the EDPB itself, from a general data protection regulation standpoint, has effectively stated that we need to look at how derogations would be used.  Ultimately, if we are looking at some form of derogation, it is never the solution.  We should be looking for a more permanent solution.  Obviously, the Commission and the UK may in the future look at an adequacy decision which would clear this matter up.  In the interim, we should not be relying on a derogation for the next four or five years until something like that happens.  We would need to probably set in motion some more permanent solution rather than simply relying on a derogation for every data-sharing arrangement.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that this is an issue that the Data Protection Commission has been addressing.  It is important.  Here we are on the cusp perhaps and it is quite alarming to find where there are so many gaps that people are only just saying, "Oh my goodness, what should we be doing."  This will impact right across the board.  People do not have a sense of the scale and scope of this.  It will be significant.</p> <p>  I have bunched together the last little couple.  In that last reply, Mr. Ryan talked about regular engagement with the different companies, for example, the multinational technology sector.  What does the Data Protection Commission's engagement with them entail?  I will explain what I have on my mind.  In terms of the HSE, I have HIQA in mind.  Is the Data Protection Commission a HIQA?  Does the Data Protection Commission carry out unannounced visits in terms of its audit, inspection or inquiry?  Give me a sense of the nature of this relationship with the Facebooks of this world?  Does the Data Protection Commission carry out unannounced visits or is that simply not the way it works?</p></speech>

At the hard edged enforcement side of it, we have our statutory inquiries that are open.  I mentioned that we have not considered those to be investigations, which give us more powers, and we have not used unannounced inspections in those inquiries to date.  The nature of the engagement with these companies on these particular statutory inquiries is quite formal.  There is a significant amount of correspondence which relates to the fair procedure that we must adopt in these inquiries.  Ms Morgan mentioned the right to be heard, the requirement for these organisations to be allowed to make submissions at the various stages of the investigation, and it is quite a formal written type of engagement when we are engaging with them in that context.</p> <p>  Separately, the GDPR introduced a requirement whereby where an organisation is considering introducing new processing that requires personal data to be processed, it must carry out a data protection impact assessment and it must mitigate the risks that are associated with that.  If it finds that it still, for business or whatever other social reasons, wants to carry out the processing in the future but it has not been able to mitigate all of the high risks, it is obliged to come and speak to us.  That is a different kind of engagement, which is quite formal in its own right.</p> <p>  Separately, we engage quite formally with these organisations when we receive intelligence, media reports or submissions that are brought to us, I suppose, in a pre-inquiry stage.  That kind of engagement would be a combination of the following kinds of dialogue: in-person meetings; written correspondence; and us reviewing submissions they make to us on the matter.</p> <p>  We would have other reasons to meet them.  Perhaps they want to give us an update on their general data protection activities.  Particularly in the lead up to GDPR, we would have had several meetings with the big companies in that context whereby they wanted to give us an update on their preparations for the GDPR.  Those would generally have been in the context of meetings where we had a discussion with them.  They might bring to our attention new products that they were considering or that were further down the line, and we would have that kind of engagement with them in that context.</p></speech>

The following is absolutely the last one - I am getting worse than Deputy Clare Daly.</p> <p>  In the course of Ms Morgan's address to us at the outset, under "New trends", she stated that in light of the requirement on the Government to consult the DPC on certain new legislation, the DPC has reviewed and provided "observations on new and draft legislation, with 25 items of primary or secondary legislation coming to the DPC for review during this seven-month period", I guess, from the inception of the GDPR to the end of the year.  As to new and draft legislation, the largest body of legislation that goes through these Houses is scrutinised in this committee.  We take Committee Stage of the greatest body of legislation passing through the Houses, that from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The requester in this instance, I presume, is the Department.  While I could understand the Data Protection Commission's responses going on the draft which may not have even presented in the general scheme coming before the committee, when I hear the point about new legislation I note my colleagues and I are the legislators.  Ms Morgan indicated 25 items to which the DPC has responded.  Government may be the initiator but I, as Chair of this committee, have no recall of ever having received any feedback on legislation from the DPC.  I wonder is that the way it should be and is that appropriate, if we are not the requester.  Legislation is the business of the Houses, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace initiate legislation.  They are called Private Members' Bills.  We deal with them all the time.  Government sponsors Bills.  We deal with them all the time.  I would have a degree of confidence that if Deputy Clare Daly had requested a DPC opinion on a piece of legislation, the Deputy would share it, and if it was new legislation that had got to Committee Stage, it would not be withheld from us.  I do not see why Government should be different because it is the initiator of proposed legislation from those of us who are broadly labelled or perceived to be Opposition voices.</p><p>Perhaps the commission representatives would comment on that.  My own sense is that if the commission is there to carry out a specific function then we, as legislators, should be privy to all the relevant information to inform us as to the suitability, the consequences and the concerns - if any - of all legislation.  I do not believe that anything should be withheld from our eyes.  As the people who make the law, members have a statutory responsibility and a public role and responsibility.  In responding to such requests in the future would the commission think it appropriate to release its replies to the Members of the Houses or the respective committee? I believe it should be the widest possible audience.  How would the representatives like to respond to that? </p></speech>

When we say 25 pieces, our function is set out in article 36 of the GDPR with regard to consultation that happened prior to a legislative or regulatory measure on foot of a legislative measure.  It has to happen in advance of the processing of data.  The appropriate timing for that consultation with us is really a matter for the Department or, if it was a Private Members' Bill, for the individual who sponsors the Bill to determine when is the appropriate time to consult with the data protection authority under article 36.  To be fair, anecdotally it is the case that individuals or Departments are coming to us early - almost as a policy and as a sketch of where they feel the legislation is going.  They know there is movement in terms of legislation, and while it may not have gone to the heads of a Bill, they may be worried that at a heads of Bill stage the policy approach is simply a red-line issue for the Data Protection Commission, DPC.</p> <p>  Sometimes, appropriately, they come to the DPC early to see that general approach taken by them will not contravene data protection law.  The figures we have presented incorporate some of those engagements, which are at a very early stage in their processes, almost at the policy development stage.</p> <p>  We are very happy to engage at that level because there is no point in them going down a rabbit hole of data protection and for us to then turn around at publication of a Bill and say their situation is untenable.</p> <p>  We have previously looked at publishing all of our replies, but the problem is that our replies may have to be collated together over a period of time to get an overall sense.  We may, for example, only get a question on a specific policy approach that is intended to be given legislative underpinning.  Instead of looking at a heads of Bill, a piece of legislation or a whole Bill we may sometimes only get a policy approach on where a body is going and we would be involved at that level.   We have looked at consultation and publication of our responses because not only would it help the Department it would also give transparency, and other Departments would learn of the particular approach taken or the way a data protection authority has viewed a certain matter.</p> <p>  With the creation of online registers for a public sector body, for example, in the recent past we have given observations many times on our views around the creation of online registers and the publication of same on websites.  Instead of only the recipient of those observations learning from that, I am very happy to share them out.  We would need to set up a process or format for how and when we do that.  It comes back to when it is appropriate or when is the perfect time for a Department or a Member to come to us to get a full overview of our position, rather than a piecemeal effort that is almost out of context. </p> <p>  I note that we have been invited before by this committee during a pre-legislative scrutiny.  If we make observations they are collated and shared currently through the Department of Justice and Equality, but we would also make our own observations as an independent authority in the future.  We would look at how we might publish our observations for everybody's benefit.  This is something we had considered prior to GDPR.  We have also looked at other authorities in Europe and elsewhere, including around consultation about a project or initiative.  The New Zealand data protection authority firmly states that it may publish its views on a project.</p> <p>  We must also practise what we preach with regard to transparency.  If we are to demand transparency from everybody then we too must be transparent.  From my perspective, consultation would be great because we would get our message across to the person who has asked the question and also to the wider audience.  This is very important because it would help with understanding, awareness and a standard approach to data protection that would meet the requirements of GDPR or the law enforcement directive.  I am very much open to suggestions on how that can be done effectively.  I would not walk away from that.  It is important.  This could offer another access to information along with freedom of information requests - which we receive only under administrative functions and not necessarily for investigations and so on.  These are important issues with regard to the data protection viewpoint.  It is to our own benefit that by publishing our views of these matters they do not get hidden within everybody else's observations: we can highlight what the particular issues are for us.  As legislators the Members would also be aware of the views of the DPC while they go through the various stages of the process in the Houses.</p></speech>

I listened fully to Ms Morgan's address and I thought it was interesting that I have been chairing this committee since 2016 and I have never seen any of the responses that were referenced.  I am sure my colleagues would concur that this is also their experience.  It is not that we want to look into their copybook.  We want to be the best we can be in the service of the people who have entrusted their vote to us to perform here.</p> <p>  The point was made that the DPC has responded to scrutiny of 25 pieces of proposed legislation.  Was any of them a Private Members' Bill?</p></speech>

Sometimes the Bill may not go through pre-legislative scrutiny so it is really determined by that.  I have absolutely no problem sharing our observations on legislation that is going to see the light of day or which will come to this committee.  It would be a matter of engaging with us to figure out the appropriate timing for that.  I do not see anything preventing us from doing that, as long as all parties are aware that we may publish.  Not everything will be published.  Sometimes we come back with nil observations because we simply had no observations to give.  When, however, there are important data protection implications to legislation then I am very happy to do it, if we can do it.  I am surprised that the committee does not get sight of our views on the legislation.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Further Revised Estimates for 2019 for the Department of Rural and Community Development which amounts to &euro;260,282,000.  It is an opportunity for the committee to make the process more transparent and engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  The programme-based structure of the Estimate is intended to assist the committee in focusing on what the Department has committed to achieving in actual outputs and outcomes, considering whether the performance targets included in the Estimate are sufficiently descriptive of the services provided by the Department and whether they strike the right balance in meeting the needs of society, and considering if the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether the allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.  I propose to proceed programme by programme and subhead by subhead.  At the outset of our consideration of each programme I will ask the Minister or the Minister of State to give a high-level overview of it, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance and related expenditure in 2019.  Having discussed the main subheads within a programme, members may wish to raise issues related to other subheads within the programme before moving on to the next one.  This approach will assist them in their consideration of the Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  It is proposed to publish on the committee's website the opening statements and briefing documents supplied by the Department.  This will be an invaluable aid for citizens in monitoring the Department's performance.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State at the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Canney.  I also extend a warm welcome to the officials accompanying them.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.589" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#B00500"><p>I thank the select committee for its invitation to attend the discussion on the Further Revised Estimate for my Department for 2019.  A short briefing note has been circulated to members.  It provides a summary of the programme areas in the Department and sets out the planned expenditure in 2019 across the programme areas.</p> <p>  Before highlighting some of the details of expenditure in 2019, I will mention briefly the performance of the Department in 2018.  Last year was its first full year of operation.  While there were many challenges in establishing it, the allocation provided for me in 2018 was almost fully utilised.  In total, &euro;236.8 million was spent of an allocation of &euro;238.5 million.  As such, 99.3% of our allocation was spent, with the unspent money related mainly to savings on salary and administration costs.  In real terms, this means that we have delivered for communities and rural areas through a wide range of programmes and projects.  I am determined that we will continue this progress in 2019 and that the budget allocation provided for the Department will be put to best use to continue to support communities across the country.</p> <p>  I will mention briefly the importance of my Department's mission for the Government and citizens.  Rural Ireland plays a vital role in the economic and social fabric of the country.  Our sense of community across Ireland is what makes the country what it is.  The establishment of my Department was an important step in strengthening Government support for this area.  Project Ireland 2040 has built further on that support.  It recognises the economic and social importance of rural Ireland and the critical role of communities in ensuring a good quality of life for all.  Strengthening rural economies and communities is one of the core objectives of Project Ireland 2040 and the provision of &euro;1 billion through the rural regeneration and development fund ensures that funding will be available to deliver on that objective in the coming years.</p> <p>  On the allocations to the Department, gross expenditure of &euro;291 million is budgeted for in 2019.  This represents an increase of &euro;60 million, or 26%, on the 2018 provision.  The &euro;291 million budget consists of &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;138 million in capital expenditure.  In terms of the split across programmes, &euro;138 million has been allocated for expenditure on rural development programmes, &euro;148 million has been allocated for expenditure on community development programmes, while &euro;4.6 million has been provided for the Charities Regulator.</p> <p>  The &euro;138 million allocation for rural development programmes consists of &euro;123 million in capital expenditure and &euro;15 million in current expenditure.  I have allocated &euro;52 million for the rural regeneration and development fund this year.  The aim of the fund is to support ambitious projects that can drive the economic and social development of rural towns, villages and their surrounding areas.  The first call for applications took place in July 2018 and 280 applications were received.  Following the assessment process, 84 successful projects have been allocated &euro;86 million in funding.  It will be leveraged with a further &euro;31 million in matching funding, representing a total of &euro;117 million in capital investment across rural Ireland.</p> <p>  It is vital that we continue to build resilience in rural communities and make towns and villages vibrant places for families to live.  It is also particularly appropriate, with Brexit approaching, that we continue to strengthen the rural economy and support sustainable development.  The projects being funded are targeted at sectors in which they can have the greatest economic and social impact.  For example, &euro;13.6 million will be invested in the national mountain biking project which will develop recreational facilities in four locations across seven counties.  In addition, &euro;5.5 million will be invested in Athenry to assist in developing the town into a major food and tourism centre.  Investments such as these will transform many rural towns, villages and outlying areas by delivering projects in sectors such as tourism, agrifood and recreation.  I expect a second call for applications under the rural regeneration and development fund to be launched later this year.  While the fund is important for the future development of rural Ireland, I also remain focused on ensuring the continued success of existing rural schemes and programmes.  It is important that the funding schemes and programmes provide for a coherent approach to supporting rural Ireland and communities.  As well as focusing on large-scale projects through the fund, we will continue to support smaller projects and groups throughout Ireland.  Such projects can have a major impact for local areas and communities.</p> <p>  For 2019, I have allocated &euro;30 million in capital funding for the LEADER programme.  As I have noted for the committee previously, the LEADER programme is demand-led, with the level of funding required dependent on the number of projects that have moved through the approval process.  The allocation provided in 2019 is based on the level of activity in 2018, which was lower than originally planned.  However, there has recently been an increase in activity.  There are now 1,800 projects approved for funding by local action groups, LAGS, to a value of more than &euro;62 million.  There are another 377 projects going through the approval process, with a value of &euro;23.4 million.  This progress is to be welcomed and demonstrates that the changes I have made to the scheme are working.  The programme is now delivering for rural communities and I will be closely monitoring developments in the coming months to ensure this progress is maintained.</p> <p>  The other key rural development allocations in 2019 are &euro;20.3 million for national rural development schemes, &euro;15 million for the town and village renewal scheme and &euro;10 million for the local improvement scheme, LIS.  The allocation for national rural development schemes comprises &euro;5.3 million in current funding and &euro;15 million in capital funding.  The capital allocation will ensure continued investment in the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and CL&Aacute;R.  I expect approximately 180 new outdoor recreation projects to be funded in 2019.  The current allocation for national rural development schemes has increased by &euro;2 million.  The additional funding will be used to double the funding for the walks scheme.  This is welcome and recognises the contribution landowners make to local tourism by facilitating safe access to well maintained walking trails on their lands.</p><p> The town and village renewal scheme is an important part of the Government's work to rejuvenate rural Ireland.  It is having a significant impact on towns and villages across the country.  The benefits of previous funding under the scheme are being felt nationwide.  Since it was introduced in the second half of 2016, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country.  I expect the 2019 allocation of &euro;15 million to support over 200 new town and village renewal projects.  </p><p> As Deputies will be aware, the local improvement scheme supports investment in non-public rural roads to enable people to access their homes and farms.  The 2019 allocation of &euro;10 million will bring to over &euro;47 million the amount invested in this programme area since I reintroduced the scheme in September 2017.</p><p> The allocation of &euro;148 million for community development programmes comprises &euro;133 million in current expenditure and &euro;15 million in capital expenditure.  As the committee is aware, the Department administers a range of programmes which support individuals and the community and voluntary sector as a whole.  The two most significant community development programmes in terms of expenditure are the community services programme, CSP, and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.</p><p> The CSP provides financial support for community organisations to deliver local services through a social enterprise model.  The funding supports the cost of employing a manager or a specific number of full-time equivalents.  The  Futher Revised Estimate contains a provision of &euro;46 million for the CSP.  This will ensure it will continue to benefit over 400 organisations nationwide.  Over 1,900 people are supported by the programme.  A few weeks ago I announced an independent review of the CSP which seeks to ensure the programme will continue to provide the best possible support for individuals, communities and organisations across the country.</p><p> SICAP provides funding to help individuals and communities in society that are experiencing disadvantage, including disadvantaged women, disadvantaged children and families, lone parents, people with disabilities, people who have difficulties in finding employment, members of the Roma community and Travellers.  This is the second year of the new SICAP which places a greater focus on more intensive individual support and emphasises flexibility to respond to the needs of target groups at local level.  The 2019 proposed allocation of &euro;43 million will ensure SICAP can continue to support over 2,200 organisations and 27,000 individuals.</p><p> The 2019 Further Revised Estimate provides &euro;12.6 million in supports for the community and voluntary sector.  This maintains the 2018 funding level.  Funding will continue to be provided for national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, the senior alert scheme and supports for volunteering.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, will provide further detail in his opening statement.</p><p> The Further Revised Estimate includes an allocation of &euro;7.2 million for the development of libraries, up from &euro;3.9 million in 2018.  The increase reflects the importance of libraries in communities and their increased role as civic spaces and places where everyone can access technology.</p><p> The 2019 allocation for the community enhancement programme is &euro;4 million.  This will allow for additional investment to enhance community facilities in disadvantaged areas where small-scale investment can make a significant difference to communities and community groups.  The cross-Border PEACE programme has had its allocation increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2018 to &euro;5 million in 2019.  It is important that we continue to support this programme, particularly in the context of Brexit.</p><p> I have kept my remarks brief to allow a full discussion on the programmes and funding of the Department of Rural and Community Development this year.  I emphasise the good progress made by the Department in 2018 across the rural and community development areas.  The increased allocation in 2019 presents a major opportunity to support rural Ireland and communities across the country.  I am determined to keep up the momentum, to ensure we will get the most out of the allocation provided and to deliver benefits for all communities.  I will be happy to answer questions.  Before I do so, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to speak briefly about the areas within his remit.</p></speech>

My responsibilities include oversight of the work of the Western Development Commission, functions related to the Department's input in regional development and rural broadband provision, oversight of a number of the funding schemes under the community programme, functions related to the Dormant Accounts Fund and oversight of the Charities Regulator.  As the Minister, Deputy Ring, mentioned, Project Ireland 2040 places strong emphasis on balanced regional development which is essential if the country is to grow in a more sustainable way.  I believe the Department has a strong role to play in ensuring these objectives are achieved.</p> <p>  The Western Development Commission has an important role in supporting development in the western region.  It actively and successfully promotes the region as a great place in which to live, work and run a business.  It manages the &euro;32 million western investment fund which provides loan capital for small and medium-sized enterprises in the region.  The Further Revised Estimate for 2019 will see the commission's funding increase from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million.  This will allow it to increase the impact of the western investment fund and enhance its contribution to the work of developing the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC.  The AEC initiative aims to build an offering of scale along the west coast to drive economic development along the entire area.  It is about getting all regions, local authority areas and communities along the western seaboard to work together to build on the region's strengths and attract investment to it as a whole.  </p> <p>  In addition to the increased funding for the Western Development Commission, funding of &euro;30,000 is being made available in 2019 to each of the ten local authorities along the AEC to co-fund an AEC officer in each local authority.</p></speech>

The collaborative work of the Department, the Western Development Commission and the local authorities will ensure there is a much enhanced resource working on the AEC project and that there is a co-ordinated approach to its development.</p> <p>  With regard to rural broadband provision and mobile phone coverage, the role of the Department is to support the local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  This involves officials working closely with the local authorities to identify and mitigate barriers that may delay roll-out.  In 2019 the Department will provide &euro;42,000 for each local authority to support a broadband officer whose role will be to facilitate the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure.  This essential role has been recognised by industry sources as having a transformative impact on their relationships with the local authorities and central government.</p> <p>  The Department has lead responsibility for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector and setting the policy framework in this area.  Some &euro;12.6 million is budgeted for in 2019 to provide supports for the community and voluntary sector, including approximately &euro;6.5 million for the scheme to support national organisations, &euro;2.3 million for the senior alerts scheme and &euro;3.2 million to support volunteering and a network of 21 volunteer centres throughout the country.  This funding will have a positive impact across the country.  It will support organisations and people who make an enormous contribution to furthering social and community development throughout the country.</p> <p>  The ongoing development of public participation networks, PPNs, is continuing.  The allocation for this area has been increased from &euro;1.55 million last year to &euro;1.75 million this year.  It will allow the Department to make an increased allocation available to each PPN, with matching funding of at least &euro;30,000 from the relevant local authority.  The Department has continued to provide practical support to underpin the PPNs, including the publication of a PPN user guide to support all PPN stakeholders - member organisations, secretariats, resource workers and local authorities - in making progress with a nationally consistent framework for PPNs.</p> <p>  The 2019 allocation for the Dormant Accounts Fund is &euro;12.57 million, which represents an increase of &euro;2 million on the 2018 allocation.  In line with the Dormant Accounts Acts, this funding must be used to address social, economic or educational disadvantage or support people with a disability.  In 2019 funding is earmarked for a number of projects which will address disadvantage across the country.  Social Innovation Fund Ireland is being allocated up to &euro;5 million to continue its excellent work.  The senior alerts scheme is being allocated up to &euro;2 million to supplement its funding and meet the level of demand for the scheme.  Up to &euro;2 million is being provided for capital supports for social enterprise.  Up to &euro;1.2 million is being provided to establish permanent volunteer centres in areas which do not have them.  Up to &euro;1 million is being used to support employment along the Atlantic economic corridor.</p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate provides &euro;4.6 million in funding for the Charities Regulatory Authority in 2019.</p><p>The Charities Regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  The general function of the regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland, in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration.  By the end of 2018, there were 9,799 charities registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority.  During 2019, the Charities Regulatory Authority will publish its second strategy statement and, in particular, develop and publish guidance to assist charities in implementing the charities code of governance.</p><p> I am delighted to be working with the Minister, Deputy Ring, in progressing our remit of supporting rural and community development, contributing to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and supporting the well-being of our communities.  I am committed to ensuring that the funding being provided to the Department supports these goals and delivers for people and communities throughout the country.  I am happy to answer any questions that committee members might have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#D00700"><p>I welcome the Minister and Minister of State.  In most cases, their budget has been very well spent and helps in rural Ireland.  I will give some feedback.  I do not want to seem in any way negative as there are a great deal of positive aspects to this, which we should acknowledge.  However, there are some areas of concern that I would like the Minister to consider.</p> <p>  Some &euro;2 million in funding was provided for walkways last year and it is hoped to provide &euro;4 million this year.  I come from a very picturesque area in west Cork which was probably the first to start walkways when James O'Mahony and his team did some incredible work on the Sheep's Head Way.  I imagine when they spoke to the farmers about walkways at the time, they were looked at as if they had two heads.  However, walkways have grown and developed and we now have the Beara Way and many other successes throughout the country.  There is a considerable amount of funding available for gates, stiles and steps but the impression I get is that there is no funding extended to farmers.  There is great potential for a Mizen way and many farmers have voluntarily given access to their lands.  They receive initial funds for stiles, probably from the &euro;2 million provided, there is no long-term funding to make payments to farmers for allowing people to go through their lands.  Such payments could be used to maintain the land.  It is important that this be addressed for the sake of tourism and generating a small bit of an income because many smaller farmers are struggling.  I would appreciate if, for 2019, the Minister would look into compensating farmers all year around.  This would not require a large amount of money but it is necessary to the farmers, some of whom are giving access to their lands free of charge, having been given an initial grant.  They should be rewarded, which would encourage others to come on board and be positive for tourism in these communities in the long term.</p> <p>  The Minister brought community involvement scheme back from nowhere.  No matter how much money he has, it is never enough.  I expect Cork County Council has an endless list of people looking for schemes.  The funding for the community involvement scheme should be increased because it is greatly appreciated in rural communities.  Some council areas might have funding for only one or two schemes when they may have a list of 50 schemes.  Money cannot be got for everything but it is great that the scheme has started again.</p> <p>  I was a fierce advocate of the previous LEADER scheme.  I always took the view that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but somebody tried to fix it and it still broke.  That is the impression that I have received from communities.  Many people are finding the application process very difficult.  I was involved in community groups over the years and went through the previous application process.  There would have been somebody there at the other end of the phone, at least, but that system has gone.  I was told by someone who secured funding recently that they would never submit an application to LEADER.  It is bad when one hears community people saying that.  In another case, an application was returned requesting further information.  I do not know how many pages had to be filled in with further information.  It is an exhaustive process which is difficult for people who are giving of their time freely.  I know that everything has to be checked out to ensure it is 100% correct but more administrative staff are needed to help people.  Since the LEADER company closed in west Cork, there is nobody available to help.  The sense I get is that the funding has come back but accessing it is not as easy as it used to be.  I ask the Minister to examine this because it is very serious.  In the past, when I mentioned funding to people in west Cork, the LEADER programme was the first thing that came to mind but it is not the last.  No one discusses LEADER any longer whereas it used to be a hot topic.  The funding provided is not as good as it used to be.  The programme helped get many farm and tourism businesses up and running but that seems to be gone by the wayside.  This area requires a strong focus.</p> <p>  I do not want to hog the time but if we cover everything together, we can get through this much quicker.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, spoke about funding for broadband and mobile phone coverage but it is not going anywhere.  It is difficult to see where it will go.  I hope an announcement on rural broadband is imminent but mobile phone coverage has not been touched on.   We hit the doorsteps canvassing in elections and now that I am out now canvassing for my brother, Councillor Danny Collins, people are asking me the same question they asked during the general election campaign.  They say there is no broadband and no mobile phone coverage and ask me what I have done about it.  I have no answer for them and it is three years on from the general election.  This is a serious issue and the mobile phone companies need to be brought to the table or perhaps brought before the committee to discuss why they cannot tackle the issue.  They are running around after 5G now but, good God, some people cannot even get one bar of coverage.  This must be pulled back.  There must be some regulation to say to these companies that they can forget about their 5G and that they should go away and deliver a couple of bars of mobile phone coverage for people in their houses or communities.  That would be a great start and we could worry about 4G, 5G or 6G after that.  There is not much point in bringing up broadband now.</p> <p>  I have been involved in a community alert group in west Cork for the past 26 or 27 years.  There is funding available for aid calls but little funding for the groups.  We did a church collection in Schull and Lowertown last week and we raised &euro;450.</p><p>We have to pay for the insurance and the affiliation of Muintir na T&iacute;re.  There needs to be something more.  While some of it is covered now with grant aid in fairness, there needs to be more concentration on funding going forward because groups are begging on the doorstep.  If one is involved in a school board, one is out trying to do cake sales, if one is involved in a community alert group or a community council, one must beg from the public all the time.  Community alert groups should be concentrating on attendance at their meetings, trying to deliver for people, meeting elderly people and getting the aid calls out there.  The focus should not be on worrying if they can pay the small bills that come in and that need to be paid.  There needs to be a better concentration on funds if at all possible.</p><p> We met the Charities Regulator in Leinster House some time ago in the audiovisual room.  I presume the funding that is being referred to and that can be spent might arise where elderly members of community groups have passed away, the funding is lying there and such groups may have given it back.  My argument with the regulator was that if, for instance, there was a group in County Mayo where the members have grown elderly and are unable to continue and where &euro;10,000 was left in the account, that will go back to the Charities Regulator if that community group will be inactive in the future.  That money should go back into Mayo.  Money came out of a council in west Cork and while that money went anywhere and everywhere, it has not come back to west Cork.  If this is the money the Minister is able to spend in this regard, that needs to be looked into.  If a community has had to hand back &euro;4,000 or &euro;8,000, that money should have gone back into that community, because that is where that money came from in the first place.  It should not be distributed to the Charities Regulator and perhaps spread around Dublin or wherever.</p><p> The community services programme, CSP, is a great programme and I am involved in a group that has a number of workers through the CSP.  The issue is that the material grant was taken from it a number of years ago.  Ultimately, regardless of whether a worker is with a rural social scheme or a community employment, CE, scheme, he or she will need a strimmer and will need material and it is not available.  We need concentrate more on CSP workers.  They are landed on the community group, which must then go back to the church gate collection again to buy the strimmers or pay for the fuel to strim the graveyard or whatever the workers are doing.  They might be working in the social centre and in our case, we have a halls programme.  This funding is for whatever they need to purchase.  The CSP programme is providing the wage as such but the material grants were taken from a lot of the groups, mainly the rural groups, and they are the ones finding it the hardest to survive and to keep the doors open.  I would appreciate it if the Government would go back and look at that.</p><p> The Tidy Towns groups take a great amount of pressure off local authorities, they do a lot of fabulous work and any funds they get are greatly appreciated.  Any such groups I know very much appreciate that.</p><p> I will only talk about one more matter because I do not want to be going on all night and that is the rural regeneration fund.  A large amount of money is to be given out to community voluntary groups because that is what the Taoiseach said at the launch of this programme.  I have nothing against companies like Coillte and Teagasc but I get worried when I see such companies or a number of LEADER companies applying for funding.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has its own budget of approximately &euro;360 million and these companies are getting top-ups from the rural regeneration programme.  Then I look at community voluntary groups getting zero, so there is something wrong.</p><p> There is one project I raised in the D&aacute;il in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, where a community voluntary group in Schull spent &euro;50,000 of its own money to try to get this project to the point of being what they were told would be shovel-ready.  They are being told it is shovel-ready and then are being told it is not.  It is dribbling back and forth like a game of tennis.  They do not know whether it is shovel-ready or not.  The Minister should remember one thing.  If the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a budget of approximately &euro;360 million, these groups have no budget like that.  They could never dream about such a budget but they can guarantee jobs in a town.  Every assistance should be given to them to make sure that if they have an issue, it can be resolved within a week or two of the first announcement that they did not get funding but that is not happening.  They have never been told what the problem is, unless they have been told today, and they are begging and pleading.  This project alone would have created numerous jobs in a community that is absolutely starved because rural peninsulas are starved of employment and there is no point in denying it.</p><p> The cities are doing well and a lot of people are going from the rural communities to the cities.  I am trying to say that a body such as the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a budget of approximately &euro;360 million and Coillte has a budget.  Such bodies all have their own massive budgets.  The Minister will counter that point by telling me that they are putting forward great projects but these other community voluntary groups are failing to tick the boxes and are failing to get the funding for some reason they do not know about.  They are spending their own &euro;50,000 in their own town.  There is something wrong somewhere and I would appreciate the Government trying to put it right.</p></speech>

He mostly touched on programme A in terms of the walks programme, the LEADER programme, broadband and mobile phone coverage.  He touched on the issue of text alerts.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality but the committee received representations on that issue in Dunhill, County Waterford last week and it is an issue we hope to follow up on with the community alert groups.  The Charities Regulator is under programme C.  The CSP programme is under programme B and the rural regeneration programme is under programme A.  Schull is an area of which I am very fond and the Deputy makes a good point about the rural peninsulas and the need to invest there.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Ring and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to address the various issues that have been raised in respect of programme A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#E00300"><p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins.  To be fair, he started off very positively and I could not fault anything that he said.  He has raised some of the issues that are being raised with me every single day.  He started his contribution by talking in particular about the walks scheme and he is quite correct.  I take this opportunity again and every opportunity I get to thank farmers for their co-operation around this country.  To be fair to them, we have a great community spirit in rural Ireland.  People come from all over the world and come from cities to walk the walkways around this country.  One would not walk into somebody's garden in Dublin and expect to be able to go through it and that is why the walks scheme was set up.  I have to say that farmers have been very generous and I thank them for their co-operation.</p> <p>  In the walks scheme, we have 39 trails with payments.  We have approximately 1,900 people who are getting payment from the Department.  We have spent &euro;2 million per year on it and there has been no increase or no new call in recent years.  I am glad to say to the committee that we have an extra &euro;2 million in funding this year.  It has been doubled and I have invited expressions of interest from trail committees, community groups and other similar bodies that are entitled to apply for the scheme in 2019.  I am pleased that I am opening the scheme but I also note that I will not be able to facilitate every group and every scheme.  There will be rules and regulations but at least we have doubled the fund this year and that is something with which we should be pleased.</p> <p>  The Deputy then raised the LEADER programme and again he talked about the difficulty people have in drawing down funding from it.  There are a number of reasons why that is happening.  This morning, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and other Deputies raised questions to me in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the LEADER programme.  As a Minister, I have made 31 changes to that scheme.  I have made it easier for people to make applications, I have made it easier for the groups themselves to get the paperwork back to the Department and I have made the necessary changes to the LEADER project.  To give an update on the LEADER programme, we have approximately 1,800 projects approved to the value of &euro;62.25 million.  We are already seeing a demand for the first quarter of this year.  In the first quarter of this year, we saw an increase in the approvals and the funding that has been drawn down and I have to say that at last, the LEADER programme is beginning to happen.</p><p>We all knew that it always takes a while for the LEADER programme to ramp up.  It is no different from all the other programmes.  When profiled for the first three months of this year, we see an increase in LEADER funding, which is important.  Last year, I put &euro;35 million into the programme and that is down to &euro;30 million this year.  If we need further funding, I will certainly accommodate that.  I hope we do because if so, it means that the programme is being ramped up.  I am pleased with how it is being ramped up.  The Deputy talked about the local development company providing assistance.  With regard to the rural regeneration scheme, we told groups what has happened with their application.  I put this on the record of the D&aacute;il this morning and there is no harm to doing so again.  Most projects that were shovel-ready were approved.  Many local authorities and groups made applications that made out that they were shovel-ready.  The question of rural regeneration schemes was raised with me before we even put out applications.  I have had local authorities telling Members that they were going to Part 8 and had other works to do or did not have planning permission for some projects, and yet stated that they would be ready when they were not.<br/><br/>The Department is holding workshops around the country to assist the community groups that the Deputy talks about.  One difficulty is what we call the helping hands event.  I find in many schemes that I administer that many groups have professional people to make the applications for them.  They have the funding to do that.  There are other groups that I need to target and support that are not getting the funding that they should be getting, simply because they do not have the means to make the applications.  That is why my Department is going out with Pobal to talk to and support groups, and to help them to make applications to schemes.<br/><br/>The Deputy talked about the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I opened that scheme and it is working well.  I wish I had more funding for it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said something that I did not agree with, but I do now, and have the media on my back when I do it.  I try to rationalise and give every county a certain percentage of the money.  There are counties with a greater need for local improvement schemes than other counties.  I need to start looking at that <i>pro rata</i>and giving it to counties with a bigger demand that are actually using it when they get it.  That is in places like west Cork, Mayo, Galway and Leitrim.  Leitrim is a small county which has more local improvement schemes than any other county in the country.  I need to start to look at ways and means to give it to Leitrim and counties that have more of a need for LIS.  If I have further funding between now and the end of the year, I will do that and will not listen to media asking what we are giving to each county.<br/><br/>We support the community services programme, CSP.  Some 20 new organisations entered into that programme last year.  We were supporting more than 400 community organisations.  More than 1,900 posts have been provided for that scheme but the Department is not the employer.  It is our job to support them and to give them the necessary grant aid.  Earlier this year, I found a bit of extra funding and distributed that to groups.  I let Pobal do that.  It did not even have to make an application.  It assessed the organisations that were most in need and that funding was distributed to them.<br/><br/>The rural regeneration scheme will be very good, especially for major projects in rural areas.  It will take time.  Phase 2 of that scheme is to provide funding to get projects ready.  The local authorities have complained to me for years that they make applications and do not have the funding to put much work and resources into them.  They find that they could put money into applications and then find that there is no funding for them.  In the rural regeneration scheme, we gave funding to get projects ready for application for the scheme.  That has worked well.<br/><br/>I think I have covered all the issues.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to respond about broadband.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#F00200"><p>To clarify demarcation lines on what the Department does about broadband and mobile phones, a task force called the mobile phone and broadband task force has been set up and I chair it.  The Deputy mentioned getting everybody into the room but everybody is in the room for that task force.  There are local authorities, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the ESB, telecoms industries, officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p> <p>  We have a broadband officer appointed in every local authority.  To give an example of work carried out, the motorway from Tuam to Limerick has spare infrastructure underground, including ducts and pipes, to take whatever will come in future, such as cables.  TII has retrofitted other motorways that do not have it so that it is in place.  It has spent a few million euro of its own money to do that so that is ready and all operations can use the same duct.  They will not all look for their own space.  We have the same type of infrastructure in place from Kilcock to Galway.  These are practical examples.  When a local authority talks about upgrading the sewerage in a town, such as in Galway city, we make sure through this task force that when the work is being done, spare services in the ground will be facilitated in order that they can be used in future rather than having to dig it up.  Those are the kinds of practical things that we are doing.</p> <p>  Heretofore, the operation of road opening licences has been different in every local authority.  The charges have been different and the forms have been different.  We have standardised all of that so it is the same charge and the same form, and is done on a system that can be accessed by any telecoms industry.  It simplifies it and makes it more efficient, so that it is cheaper to install this infrastructure in future.  We are also looking at having neutral hosts for this infrastructure so that it is not owned by specific telecoms companies that will not let other telecoms companies look at it.  We brought in the Office of Public Works because it has State assets and we may be able to use some State assets to install infrastructure such as masts that may be required on land that it owns.  It has maps of and knows what assets it has in the country.  We can see if there is a black spot and whether there is a State asset that we can use to get it done fairly quickly.</p> <p>  In the Minister, Deputy Ring's native county of Mayo, for example, the broadband officer has created a digitised map application so that every piece of spare ductwork in the ground in every town in County Mayo is mapped and can be seen by the telecoms industry.  That application will be given to every other broadband officer to do the same in every county so that we do not have fellows digging up streets to find out if something is there or not.  It will take time but it is common sense to make sure that we do not dig up streets for the sake of it.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned black spots and I agree that there are black spots.  ComReg has published an up-to-date map of where the good spots are and what providers are there so that if one is buying a phone, one can look at the map first to see whether a phone will work in that area.  That was published only three or four weeks ago.  It is the most up-to-date map that we have, and it is a true map because it is done by ComReg.</p><p>People ask what we are doing about broadband and mobile phones in our Department.  We are really talking about this kind of work.  We are trying to bring about some common sense across the Departments in the context of what we are doing to create the infrastructure in order that we will not be not digging and re-digging or putting up additional poles when there are already poles in place.</p><p> Reference was made to 5G.  There is a company called Valeo in Tuam.  It invested &euro;44 million last June with the aim of becoming a global centre for the development of appliances for the autonomous car.  That is the reality in Tuam and 5G will be needed for it.  All of the infrastructure we are discussing will be required in order to enable that.  People state that nothing is happening.  To an extent, I agree.  I do not have broadband in my house.  Hopefully, when it is rolled out, it will be done in a very positive way.  The broadband officers have identified 300 locations that will be able to accommodate broadband from day one once a decision has been made on the roll-out.  It will be delivered into the communities very quickly, if not to every house, at the start of the period of delivery.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on spending all the money he had.  He spent some of it by way of forward payment for work not yet done.  For example, under LIS, some &euro;10 million was given to the local authorities but the work was not done by 31 December 2018.

Some 99.3% of that money has been spent, despite the fact that the Deputy and others spent the year sending out statements saying that I would not spend that money.  I provided some funding to LIS because I wanted to get road works done under the scheme.</p></speech>

I have sent those inspectors out to many of the local authorities to carry out checks.  They make inspections on a regular basis and ensure that the money is being spent.  I did something the Deputy did not do when he was Minister and made the local authorities provide a list.  I put that list on the website and give it to my colleagues.  There are two checks carried out - one by my Department and my inspectors and another by the general public.  If a member of the public sees that money has been allocated in respect of his or her road but has not been spent, he or she quickly makes contact with the Department, Deputies and Ministers and everyone else.</p></speech>

State agencies have to be funded by the State, as the Deputy knows.  Communities work with the likes of the county councils, the western development commission and &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta.  Groups are coming to me who have been in contact with the LEADER groups, &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta and the local authorities.  These agencies went out and spoke to community groups.  How does the Deputy think applications are made?  A number of applications came in via the LEADER programme because the LCDCs were out meeting with and talking to various groups, and then groups made their applications.</p></speech>

We were informed that it was focusing on certain big towns in the county.  It is interesting that it picked Athenry.  The latter is a fine town; it is actually the location that has been designated to ease growth in the city.  It is not a very rural town.  It received &euro;5.5 million, mainly through the urban fund.  It is the new centre for IDA Ireland in east Galway as opposed to being an area for rural development.  I have a concern with the way this is constructed.  It might not have been the Minister's intention, but I am concerned that this will be driven in this way.  The excuse that will be given will be the national spatial strategy which is totally focused on towns and growing urban agglomerations.  I listened to Waterford County Council when the committee went there last week, and all the county and city manager could talk about was big urban development.  He did not mention rural development even though he was addressing members of this committee.  The county manager in Galway stated on Monday that the message from the Government seems to be to focus on the bigger places.  Such an approach will not help the smaller locations.</p></speech>

Some 53 schemes were instigated by local authorities, 13 by departmental agencies, nine by the local development group and LEADER, eight by commercial semi-State companies and one by a third-level institution.  The fund was open to the latter and to local development groups, agencies such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and local authorities.  We held workshops and went out to the regions.  We received very positive feedback from the communities.  I am participating in the rural roadshows and listening to people on the ground.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Athenry.   That will be a tremendous development for the region.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service are developing ideas in the six national parks in County Mayo.  It is good to have communities, State agencies and local authorities involved.  There are problems in all local authorities with pet projects.  I cannot do anything about that.  They make the applications and we adjudicate on them.  Sometimes we find that the scheme applied for does not comply with the wishes of the elected representative.  However, he or she has an input into it.  The ideas are brought before the local authorities and the elected representatives, who then have an opportunity to support or refuse to support particular projects.</p></speech>

He will remember his time on the local council.  I admire the fact that he fought to retain the dual mandate.  He knows the trick that is played.  By the time a scheme is brought to a representative, one cannot go against it because it would be like hitting someone.  The people behind the scheme do not come to the elected representative before the list is drawn up.  It is the same when a list of roads to be fixed is created.</p><p>As public representatives we know about this structural problem.  Let us suppose someone comes in with a list of six or seven projects.  It is too late to start changing them, so what do we do?  We endorse them.</p><p> I am pleased the Minister has admitted that there is a danger here.  I am reassured as long as he is aware of the danger of pet projects.  My fear is that the pet projects will be in the stronger or growing places and not the weaker ones.  I am articulating a genuine concern.  I have been listening during the past week or two and people are using Project Ireland 2040 as an excuse.  That is a problem.</p><p> The Minister stated that a LEADER company can become the promoter of a project.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One part of the CL&Aacute;R scheme relates to health and cancer care services.  These include the mobile bus, cancer care transport and sensory gardens.  I am allowing some leniency there.  They must specifically operate in a CL&Aacute;R area but they can make the application from outside a CL&Aacute;R area.  We are bringing the cancer care service bus to Galway.  I do not imagine Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v or anyone else could object to that.  That is one of the best schemes I introduced.  It does not specifically have to be from a CL&Aacute;R area.  It can be from outside, but some of the use must be in a CL&Aacute;R area.</p></speech>

The thinking was that we would get Beaumont Hospital looking for money on the basis that the hospital treats people from CL&Aacute;R areas.  The Minister is familiar with the syndrome.  We need to be careful.  I am not making a case about what the Minister has done in that particular case.  I would have preferred if it had been under a different heading from the point of view of money because for me CL&Aacute;R is CL&Aacute;R.  However, I am a little disappointed given all the extra money coming into the Department but yet no more money is being ring-fenced for CL&Aacute;R areas.  For example, would the Minister consider ring-fencing some of the rural regeneration fund for CL&Aacute;R areas in order to ensure help for areas suffering most from rural decline?  The maps show vast areas of the country.  The geographers can tell us about the rapid growth in the areas under the influence of the cities.  Then we go over a cliff and there are areas in decline.  The Minister's county is a particular example.  It would suit to focus on the areas of decline because, unfortunately, much of County Mayo does not fall within the sphere of a major city.  The idea behind the criteria relating to CL&Aacute;R was that since these areas, continuously and over a long period, failed to get investment they had declining populations.  However, the latter was the case because they had failed to attract investment and so on.  The idea was to redress that.  Will the Minister consider reallocation?  I am not suggesting he can do it this year but perhaps he could do it next year.  Would he consider directing that a certain amount of the &euro;52 million be spent on projects put forward by the various agencies in CL&Aacute;R areas in order to ensure that there is not an inexorable pull toward the centre with the authorities that will be promoting the projects?</p></speech>

I have been reviewing it as recently as this week.  On the previous occasion, we left the scheme rather open.  We are looking to clarify some of the rules and regulations relating to it.  The idea is not to make it more difficult to make applications.  From his time in the Department, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be aware of the difficulty involved.  I do not want my rural regeneration scheme to be used by the various other Departments to deal with their problems.  I must ensure that it is used specifically for what it should be used for, namely, rural regeneration to revitalise rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned CL&Aacute;R.  As he is aware, we have only &euro;5 million in the programme, which we reintroduced in 2016.  We have spent &euro;27 million on the programme.  If we average the figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018, it comes to &euro;9 million per year.  I have a little flexibility with any savings.  I look at three or four schemes from which there may be savings.  These include, CL&Aacute;R, LIS and the Tidy Towns initiative.  All these funding projects are worthy of support.  A total of 1,270 projects have been supported by the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I am pleased with the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I am not going to start tampering with the rural regeneration scheme.  I want to get it opened as quickly as possible.  As I said, seed funding was put into the local authorities.  Some communities and groups made applications to get projects ready.  I expect we will have better projects.  It will take some time.  It is like every scheme that we ever introduced.  It takes a little time for organisations, whether they are state agencies or councils, to get up-and-running and to get good projects.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the Athenry scheme and there are schemes with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the LEADER companies.  These are all good schemes.  They will learn how to develop and get better in future.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, I am keen for the programme to target areas in need.  The CL&Aacute;R programme has worked well.  The rural regeneration scheme will be a good scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy knows about some of the schemes we had in the past under LEADER, town and village funding and other bits and pieces of funding.  If a project comes to the rural regeneration scheme, it is guaranteed to get substantial funding in order to enable completion.  However, there is one thing I will not allow.  I am making this clear to the Deputy, other members and the officials in the Department.  The projects get one shot; those involved are not coming back to finish a project for which they have received funding.  If a group made an application this year but finds that it needs more money next year, it will not get it.  Such a project can stall where it is.  If it is shovel-ready or ready to go and if we are informed that the latter is the case and that part of the funding already allocated relates to it, then it gets the remainder from the Department.</p> <p>  Members will know of the pilot scheme we operated with six towns.  We have given &euro;100,000 to each of the local authorities involved to enable them to sit down with communities, the local chamber of commerce, if there is one in the town, and whatever community groups are in place.  We hope they will come back with ideas to help us to regenerate towns and villages.  The six towns might come back with different ideas or with a common denominator of one or two schemes they would like to see put in place.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government.  We want to see what the towns throw up or what proposals they might bring to Government.  Another Department had a scheme involving grant aid to refurbish old houses but it simply did not work.  Why was that the case?  The scheme was not right in the first instance.  We have to operate certain schemes.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the CL&Aacute;R programme, the town and village renewal scheme and the outdoor recreation scheme.  We know why the LEADER programme did not work.  We tied it up in knots with rules and regulations.  I have freed up the programme by making 32 changes.  We know what to do if we do not want something to work.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows from his time here that we cannot make rules and regulations so difficult that applicants are unable to draw down funding.  Six towns have been selected, namely, Boyle, Callan, Ballinrobe, Banagher, Castleblayney and Cappoquin.  That is a representative group nationally, although I could have included another 20 towns.  We are hoping they will use the funding we have given them to employ people with some good ideas.  Private sector concerns have contacted me to make proposals for the scheme.  I did not entertain the proposals and insisted they speak to the groups directly and to the local authorities.  That is not my game.  My game is to provide the funding and I want the groups to come back with proposals.  It will then be my job to go back to the Government and see what I can do to revitalise towns and villages around the country.  What is needed?  Perhaps simple things can help, for example, making compulsory purchase orders which councils need to use more.</p><p> Ballinrobe is in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's area but it is a town I have a great love for. </p></speech>

Ballinrobe is a fine town, which I am glad to get back to my constituency, but south Mayo, which was assigned to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's constituency, is good country and I always did well in it.  It has gone through a very difficult time but it has a great community group, which has done great work, on which I compliment it.  The town is fighting back and making a revival and is getting funding from my Department and other Departments.  As the Deputy knows, the State broadcaster visited Ballinrobe on many occasions and always highlighted the negativity, but there is a great deal of positivity in the town.  It has wonderful facilities.  I want to see this happening in other towns.</p></speech>

The population of the town has increased significantly, with housing estates all over the edge of the town.  There is more employment in the area than there ever was, thank God, thanks to McHale, ECC Timber Products and other companies.  While the main street is maith go leor, the street leading off it has always been derelict and needs major refurbishment.  The centre of the town is not as vibrant as it was.  This shows that the solution is not simple.  Most people believe that town decline is caused by population loss and so on.  In the case of Ballinrobe, the population has exploded and there is a very good employment situation, yet the heart of the town is still not what it was.  I have thought for some time that it would be good to map what was in the town in its heyday in the 1970s.  What businesses were in the premises on the main street and why are they no longer there?  I would expect to find that there were lots of grocery shops, hardware shops and pubs and that these have been replaced by major supermarkets at the edge of town and convenience stores in petrol station forecourts.  These are not bad things because if the major multinational companies did not locate at the edge of the town, people would go to Castlebar or Claremorris to shop.  Nobody can tell me people do not do go to those types of shops.</p> <p>  Such a mapping exercise would highlight the real problem.  The way the town was used has become redundant and we need to create new uses for it.  Shopping habits have changed and nothing will bring back the old shopping habits.  Why would it when online shopping is available?  The town centre should be used more for recreational shopping as I describe it, in other words, going out for a meal.  Somebody said to me recently that in the old days people ate at home and went out to drink, whereas now they drink at home and go out to eat.  All these changes must be examined.  If we are serious about addressing this problem, we must acknowledge that the issue is not just the area's population or employment conditions.  It is connected to the old function of the town.  Obviously, there is no longer a video shop and there are not half as many pubs as there used to be.  Does the Minister understand what I am saying?  It would be ideal to map what was in Ballinrobe and similar towns in their perceived heyday 30 years ago, find out why those businesses no longer exist and suggest what could replace them.  The problem is more complicated that we sometimes believe.</p> <p>  My second point concerns future efforts, rather than this year's Estimate.  One thing that has always puzzled me slightly - it was a given before my tenure and during the Minister's tenure but it is worthy of examination - is that administrative costs account for 20% of the LEADER budget.  Most Departments directly providing grants manage to achieve a figure of 5% for administration costs.  Should we examine the processes in place in LEADER to find out why it is such an expensive project to administer?  If we reduced administration costs to 10% of &euro;20 million, there would be another &euro;200,000 to spend on the ground.  The amount spent on the administration of a programme for allocating grants is very high.  We can dress it up any way we like, with animation and all sorts of fancy European terms, but essentially LEADER is just a grant-giving programme.  Groups make an application, secure a grant and spend it. </p></speech>

He is right that more people are living and working in rural Ireland than ever before.  He is also right about towns and villages.  The shops that were there in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s are gone.  They were challenged by multinational companies such as Dunnes Stores and Tesco and those that are left are being challenged by online retail, which is causing a difficulty.  The pilot scheme for Ballinrobe was intended as an example of what could be done to regenerate a town.  We provided &euro;1,100,000 in the recent rural regeneration and development fund project to be used exactly as the Deputy described.  We are trying to regenerate the town centre and the market houses.  We provided funding as part of the town and village renewal scheme and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy knows that Ballinrobe is a fantastic town with a fantastic racecourse and golf club.  The one thing that is missing is a hotel.  As the Deputy knows, there were three applications but none ever came to fruition.  That is a pity because we could have done with a hotel in the town.  I remember holding clinics in Belmullet, a town the Deputy knows well, in my early days in politics when one would hardly find somewhere to get a cup of tea.  Now there are two hotels that are doing fantastically well. They provide a great service for weddings, funerals and so on and have given the town a great lift.  Ballinrobe has been chosen as a pilot for the rural regeneration and development fund to show how a town can be regenerated.  There is a great future for the town with its community group and young people.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a very interesting point when he spoke of mapping what was in Ballinrobe in earlier times.  When I think about my home town of Westport, families in the town have carried on.  Sons, daughters and in-laws have modernised family businesses and some have moved to different businesses.  The Hughes family established one of the most successful companies in the world, let alone Ireland.  The company operates out of Westport and trades all over the world as a multinational company.  The Kavanagh Group, which is based in the town, runs a hotel business and is involved in the tourism sector and supermarket business.  It modernises every year and keeps ahead of the posse.  I am working on Ballinrobe and hope we can give the town the support and back-up it needs.</p> <p>  The local area groups, LAGs, get 25% of the LEADER funding to meet administrative costs.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows what happens with administrative costs.</p><p>I know the administrative costs for last year and this year.  They might be a bit more than the actual project.  </p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice did a great deal of work on getting this project to the stage where we could get funding for it.  That is in a small town and it be a real game changer.  Without this fund, the town would never have got out of the mess it was in.  Kinvara, which is another small town, will get a boardwalk that will bring people from the castle to the town.  There will also be a walkway and cycleway all the way from Ballinderreen to Kinvara.</p></speech>

I listened carefully and they spoke about two places in Connemara - An Cheathr&uacute; Rua and An Cloch&aacute;n - and that was it.  It was argued that we could not spread the jam too thin.  That worries me because that is a very common syndrome.  Even when I look at the stuff that is written here, I can see this hierarchy of cities, towns, villages and surrounding areas.  Most people - 1 million people, including me - live in surrounding areas.  They are not in a place and are treated as appendages to somewhere else.  That is very dangerous when we are talking about rural regeneration as we understand the term "rural" in Ireland.  I made the point the other day that with their vision of it, St. Thomas' GAA club might as well pack up its hurley sticks and so might Ballyhale Shamrocks GAA because they will not be there for the next generation to play hurling.  These places no longer count even though they are highly successful communities.  They are not in the areas where the authorities want to see growth.</p></speech>

I was saying that from what I am hearing from the local authorities, and the Chairman knows I was concerned the other day when we were in Waterford, I fear they are reading the Government plan as being an agglomeration plan into the biggest places with a hierarchy starting off with Dublin, Galway and Limerick and then working out to the other big towns, with the rest being also-rans.  Fair play to St. Thomas's GAA club for beating the odds but I not sure it will be so easy to beat them in the next generation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#K01400"><p>We are not criticising the Department in any way.  What Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was probably trying to say is that we are just flagging it to the Department that some county managers may have a vision that may not be compatible with what we, as elected representatives, or the Department may want to do and that it might be worth keeping an eye on it.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister on the local improvement schemes.  He spoke about some counties having large numbers of by-roads and back roads.  In my opinion, the west has more of them than anywhere else in the country.  We welcome the funding that comes when it comes.  Sometimes the roads programme could be run from May to September.  If funding is provided, could the local authorities be given a bit more space?  I do not mind if they get the money up-front as long as they get it and the roads are done.  Could they get an extra month or two to ensure they have time to get enough of the programme done?  I have seen where the Department has gone out and checked whether work was done properly.  In fairness, good work is being done.</p> <p>  I spoke to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the next issue I wish to raise.  In fairness, the Minister of State came to a meeting about it one evening.  There is an undercurrent at the moment for which the Department is not responsible.  Many voluntary groups around the country are being told that they need this or that form of insurance for Tidy Towns.  Villages are all trying to get funding from the &euro;6.2 million and &euro;13 million available for small areas.  A list is coming out showing what can be done with or without construction.  Somebody building a wall in a town obviously needs to produce a methods statement.  The Minister knows the towns in the west better than anyone.  Someone might be cutting grass at the edge of the road but there might not be a kerb.  We are approaching a stage where there is talk of three-day or one-day courses being required.  We must bear in mind that we will be on our knees if we lose these voluntary groups.  Other organisations are basically saying they cannot send their people out if the local community does not sign off on this, that or the other.  We must remember that these are volunteers filling out a form and signing their names as part of a community group to make their towns better.  In fairness, with the funding the Government has given over the past number of years, most of our small towns are looking much better.  There is a query at the moment.  In fairness to the Chairman and the staff here, they are trying to get the different bodies together.  A town with more than 1,000 cars travelling through it is in a different category when it comes to this insurance.  I am talking about towns like Milltown.  There is a fair bit of fear among voluntary bodies that do not know where they stand at the moment and I am concerned that this fear is spreading.  We had a private meeting about it.  I do not want to say too much about this.  We are talking about bringing people in here to try to nail the issue down.  What are the Minister's views on it?  </p> <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he is very good at spending money.  Is there any hope that responsibility for the likes of the CCTV set-up could be transferred to him?  Regarding the walks and the different funds, could community groups get a calendar regarding when CL&Aacute;R and all various other schemes are coming?  With the new drink driving laws, we all get it in the ear about the pubs.  If we are bringing out new schemes, such as those relating to rural transport, buses or something to solve the problem for communities, would the Department be prepared to take them over?</p><p>This year there is a worrying development under the heading of community sewerage schemes, with which the Minister will be familiar from his own area.  The new set-up is such that funding can be obtained only if one taps into the Irish Water network.  Will the Minister's Department work with the Department responsible for the environment?  The latter has stated to us, probably to fob us off, that the Department of Rural and Community Development will be launching a new scheme.</p><p> On hillwalkers, a couple of months ago the Minister spoke about legislation to indemnify farmers.  How is it progressing?</p><p> Reference has been made to towns of various sizes.  All towns - big, medium and small - need a little money.  There is no point in saying they do not.  Could funding be ring-fenced for towns with fewer than 500 people, which we call small villages, to bring them up a little?  Such towns, by comparison with bigger ones, feel like the child who never grew when applying for funding.  They feel it is harder to obtain funding when in with the big boys.</p><p> When will the CL&Aacute;R programme review be carried out?  There are areas that are under pressure and the circumstances of which have changed that probably now qualify under the programme but are not included.</p><p> Will there be a focus on areas included in the REDZ scheme?  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, it has been proved that CL&Aacute;R programme areas are struggling a little.  Could they be helped a little more?</p></speech>

Removing it was the biggest mistake ever made.  The Deputies know my views on the issue.  Taking Deputies out of county councils was the biggest mistake ever made because at least they know what legislation is passing through the D&aacute;il.  When the dual mandate was removed, the happiest people were the county managers in every corner of the country.  I did my best to oppose it and there were those who supported me in that regard.  The abolition should never have happened.  Under the old Western Health Board, there was accountability.  When there was a county and a regional structure in place, there was accountability.  Now we have the HSE and other such bodies.  The media believed the best thing one could ever do was to keep elected public representatives away from everything.  We are elected; we are the ones who put our names on the ballot paper and we are the representatives of the people.</p> <p>  The local improvement scheme was mentioned.   It is a good scheme and working well, but I need to obtain additional funding for it.  I need to consider the areas that are in more need than the ones benefiting from the allocation.  This year I capped the allocation for householders at &euro;1,200.  Although it went unnoticed, it will result in a fairer system.  Members know that people who are paying their local property tax and, in some cases, water charges because they are included in group schemes are paying.  Allocations of &euro;1,500, &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 were expected in such cases, but I have capped the sum at &euro;1,200, which will help the bigger schemes.  It is only fair.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to voluntary groups.  We have great voluntary groups in this country and among the greatest are the Tidy Towns committees.  I was the first Minister to give a separate allocation to every Tidy Towns group throughout the country and I did so for two reasons.  First, the Government appreciates the work the Tidy Towns committees are doing.  Second, we are thanking the volunteers for the work they do.  Most importantly, the volunteers are doing work the local authorities are not doing and that the State should be doing.  But for the voluntary sector, this would be a poorer country.  The local authorities should stop hindering, in any way, community and voluntary groups.  Pencil pushers in the local authorities should not be trying to affect the good work being done by Tidy Towns groups or any other voluntary group.  The local authorities and any other body funded by the State should be working for and supporting volunteers, not putting obstacles in their way.  No group should have to be brought before a committee.  We should be thanking, encouraging and helping them, not putting obstacles in their way.  I do not want some individual who has nothing else to be doing to be considering ways by which progress could be held back.</p> <p>  On CCTV systems, we were trying to get the scheme into the Department, but we encountered some difficulties with data protection.  The scheme is now in place.  Monitoring CCTV systems seems to be the difficulty.  It is a question of who is monitoring.  We will have to wait and see what happens in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about smaller towns and villages.  This year I sent two instructions in that regard.  When I recently met the county managers or chief executives of all of the local authorities, I gave them a calendar of programmes for which I will be allocating funding this year.  They now know the position on all programmes.</p></speech>

There is no difficulty in that regard.  I asked my officials to send it to all members of the committee and anyone who wanted it.  I wrote to the CEOs outlining my Department's programmes and when I was opening them.  They now know that there is scheme continuity.  This is the third year.  My Department has been in place for almost two years.  Before that, in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs we started to open up some of the schemes again.  As I said, the local authorities now know that there is programme continuity.  They also know that they may not have had the capacity in the past but that they will now need to have it.  Many local authorities, including mine and that of Deputy Carey, have a director of services dedicated to dealing with rural issues and rural schemes.  All local authorities will need to do this.</p> <p>  The REDZ scheme was included in the town and village category.  An instruction I gave the local authorities this year in respect of towns and villages was related to the exact point raised by the Deputy.  I want towns and villages that have not received funding before to be included this time.  I do not want the same towns and villages to receive all of the funding again.  I want to see new villages and towns included.  The title of the scheme refers to towns and villages.  The village is as important as the town.  The county councils have received that instruction from me this year.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about the CL&Aacute;R programme review.  I hope to have it towards the end of the year.  Even in my region there are areas that are included in the programme but which have moved on and there are areas that are not included in it that should be.  We need to carry out the review.</p></speech>

The programme is due for review and we will be getting somebody to carry it out for us.  The same process will be used for the review as was used for the previous one.  It involves the college in Maynooth, although the same people will not be used.  We need to carry out the review and include some new areas.</p><p> I think I have covered all of the issues the Deputy raised, except the most important one, namely, the indemnity scheme.  I will be very careful in what I say about that scheme.  We have been working to develop a national indemnity scheme and it is a very complex matter.  My Department has been advised that a scheme like the one envisaged will require legislation to be implemented.  We will have to use two existing Acts, the Occupiers' Liability Act and the National Treasury Management Agency Act, which are under the control of other Ministers.  Therefore, I will have to discuss the matter with the relevant Ministers.  Officials from my Department are also having meetings with the Attorney General.  We are making progress, but it is a complex matter, one that will require more than a simple legislative initiative.  If I bring it forward, I want it to be right.  I have given an undertaking that we will try to bring forward legislation.  The reason we are not further on with it is that Brexit has been the priority in recent weeks.  All other legislation has been put on hold.  Brexit was the subject of the most important legislation we had to deal with.  The Office of the Attorney General is heavily engaged with my office on this issue.  I am also dependent on two other Ministers in the case of the Acts mentioned, but we are making progress.  We need to do something about the issue because, as I have said previously, I cannot have a situation where there are claims against the family of landowners, their home and land.  We need to deal with the issue and want to do so as quickly as possible as we have talked about it for a long time.  We are now trying to implement legislation.</p></speech>

To solve the pub question and resolve the issue of transport in rural parts of Ireland, one idea I came up with was having minibuses under the auspices of development groups which exist in every town.  Would the Minister be in favour of such a scheme and would his Department be prepared to work on it?  The other matter was sewerage schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#M00300"><p>The transport scheme was one I tried to get into my Department.  I think there is approximately &euro;16 million available for RuralLink between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  My Department would be the ideal fit for it.  I am sure it can be negotiated at a later date.  This is a new Department and we need to look at anything that would assist rural Ireland, including the rural social scheme.  There is a debate on it taking place between my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  My Department would be the ideal fit for the rural social scheme and other social schemes.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was a member of the Government that established the scheme.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection covers activation programmes.  It only wants to get people back to work.  It is about the live register.  The rural social scheme and others are community schemes that work very well and we would be in a great deal of difficulty if we did not have them as they do a great deal of fine work.  I have always been a strong supporter of the rural social scheme and want to keep such schemes going.</p> <p>  The issue of water and sewerage schemes has been raised by many Deputies.  I am getting my officials to talk to officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about them.  I do not have a problem with trying to find funding to support group water and sewerage schemes, but it is not my job to provide the bulk of the money.  We should support the scheme within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That is why we are talking to officials of that Department and I am talking to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I have discussed with him the fact that something must be done about small sewerage schemes.  I see no difficulty with my Department having a scheme to top up small water and sewerage schemes, but it will not be the lead Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.701" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#M00400"><p>We are coming to the end of the discussion on programme A and I have a few comments to make.  I welcome the Minister's highlighting Tidy Towns groups which are among our greatest groups.  The Minister's expression of thanks to them as a community initiative is most welcome, as is the financial support he has provided which is well received in communities.  In County Clare, particularly Ennis, we have enjoyed huge success in the Tidy Towns competition and long may it continue.  It is welcome that the Minister has published a schedule of schemes and communicated it to the CEOs of the various local authorities.  I ask him to circulate it to the committee in order that we will know when the rolling schemes will open.  It is a very welcome development that the Minister has reopened the rural development scheme.  I note that we have received two tranches a year for the last couple of years.  It is very welcome to receive this money, but one tranche provided earlier in the year might be better.  Let the local authorities plan on that basis.  The second tranche is received at the end of the year and while it is welcome, it puts pressure on the local authorities to have works done at what may not be the best time of year, namely, during the winter months.  I propose that the Minister consider allocating one tranche and providing it earlier in the year.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice on sewerage schemes.  The Minister will be well aware of the representations I have made in that regard.  In County Clare there were two applications made under sewerage scheme heading of the rural regeneration and development fund for schemes in Broadford and Cooraclare.  Unfortunately, the schemes did not come through.  There is a genuine need to put in place a proper programme to allow communities to realise their potential.  A sewerage scheme in a small rural community is a basic service, but they cannot have it if the necessary funding or programme is not in place.  I welcome the Minister's comments.  Communities such those in Broadford, Carrigaholt, Cooraclare and Doolin in a thriving tourist area in north Clare do not have proper sewerage facilities and the prospects of having them without a programme are slim.  I recognise the Minister's commitment and the interest he has expressed in working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in that regard.  The director of services for County Clare met officials of that Department and I had hoped some progress would be made as a result.  I recognise the Minister's commitment to put together a scheme in conjunction with Irish Water, the local authorities and the communities that will work for them.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister on his involvement in putting together a rural regeneration and development fund.  It is a groundbreaking initiative which will unlock the potential of communities across the country.  County Clare benefited immensely in the last round of funding in which it received &euro;7.5 million.  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Fitzmaurice said the money is not getting into rural areas, but I can say it is.  The locations around Lough Derg, Mountshannon and Holy Island in County Clare are to benefit from an injection of nearly &euro;1 million.  The plan is to establish east Clare as a tourism area, which is very welcome.  It comes in conjunction with the &euro;500,000 given to further develop the blueway along Lough Derg.  In this instance we see an example of how one scheme can complement another, which is very welcome.</p><p>We have seen an injection of money into Loop Head in west Clare.  Lahinch Seaworld has received &euro;2.7 million.  The Irish Open golf tournament is happening in Lahinch this year, and I would welcome everyone down to County Clare to see what a spectacle they are going to put on.  That is very welcome news.  The Vandeleur walled garden is another initiative in west Clare.  Last year, Ennistymon got an allocation of &euro;1 million for the development of a digital hub.  We are doing very well in Clare in terms of the rural regeneration programme.  I encourage the Minister to continue that work and that allocation.  He might come back to me on a few of the points I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.703" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#N00200"><p>I cannot agree more about the Tidy Towns.  We are so lucky to have it.  I just have to keep putting it on the record.  All the Deputies have praised the movement this evening.  Ireland is a better place and our towns, villages and cities are better places because of the Tidy Towns committees.  I know it is probably not politically correct but I want to take this opportunity to thank SuperValu for its sponsorship over the years.  It has  been a great community supporter.  I am grateful to Martin Kelleher, the managing director of SuperValu, for that support.  I am also grateful to all the other sponsors who have been very supportive of the Tidy Towns initiative.</p> <p>  I have no problem sending a copy of that letter to the committee.  It is just a very simple letter outlining the proposals for the year ahead and giving the local authorities a direction on the way we are going, what schemes are coming up and when, to give them an opportunity to prepare and plan for them.</p> <p>  On the local infrastructure scheme, LIS, I know what the Deputy is saying.  I had meant to respond to Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Even when I have given the early funding in February, sometimes by September they did not have it spent.  I know they want to do other roads first.  I was a member of a local authority.  The local authorities have always been telling me that they like to get the LIS money at the end of the year because it keeps their staff and workers employed.  Particularly for the second tranche of money, one of the conditions is that they have the capacity to complete the work.  They all tell us they have the capacity but the minute they get the money, they have no capacity.  It is very hard for me to operate with them but I do my best.  I provide the funding as best I can.</p> <p>  On sewerage and water schemes, to be fair to the Deputy, he pushed that County Clare one very hard.  What we do not want, especially with the rural regeneration scheme, is to be a substitute for the schemes of any other Department.  We want to provide new schemes that complement existing funding from other Departments and we have no problem with that.  I will look at the water and sewerage issue but the lead agency will have to be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It will have to come up with a small scheme.  The economy has gone through a difficult time and a lot of local areas are developing again.  A lot of areas need group water schemes and, particularly, sewerage schemes.  To be fair to the communities, they are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and set up the schemes.  What we need to do is give them some support.</p> <p>  The Chairman has made many representations for the rural regeneration scheme in his county, including Kilrush, Loop Head, Lahinch, Ennistymon and the walled gardens.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, I planted a tree there and I would say that tree is well up now, as it were.  These are all fine projects.  These issues link in with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, especially in respect of the national parks, for which County Clare will be getting some funding as it has one of the finest national parks in the country.  We only have six national parks and sometimes people do not realise the asset they have.  In Canada, America and other parts of the world, when they have a national park, they think they have the greatest tourism attraction.  We have six of them, one as good as the other.  They are tremendous assets that are not being used.  I have to say to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that, to be fair, the National Parks and Wildlife Service did not get a lot of funding in recent years.  When I went into the old Department, I dealt with the staffing problems it had.  We set out a programme for it and got it extra funding.  The national parks are a great asset and we should be making more of them.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has bought into the concept now and realises they are a tourist attraction and a tourism asset.  I hope I have covered all the issues raised.</p></speech>

The funding was intended originally to go to community groups in the main.  I refer to the community services programme.  I understand each company must now top up the wage by &euro;2,000.  Up to 2012, there was a euro-for-euro refund of all wage costs, including the PRSI.  Has the requirement to come up with the income to pay that part of the wage put pressure on the more vulnerable groups?  The Minister said he would like to get the rural social scheme back in his Department.  I might give him a bit of a thought process on that.  He is probably finding it difficult to get an increase in the money for the community services project.</p><p>It has not increased this year.  In fact, it has been squeezed in recent years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looks on that as 100% spending.  If the Minister got a further &euro;5 million, the Department would not give him credit for taking people off the dole.  The project was put under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because, if that Department's Minister was of a mind, she could prove within her budget that taking someone off of farm assist and putting him or her on the RSI had a minimal net cost.  On the other hand, if the Minister before us had the RSI without the farm assist, he would have to look for the full money, and he knows how willing and welcome the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would be to hand over that.  If the Minister is trying for the RSI, I suggest that he take the farm assist scheme with it at a minimum.  As he created jobs through the RSI, he could prove that he was making a saving.  All he would need to show would be the difference between someone being on the RSI compared with farm assist.  I can see the argument from two points of view, but it is complex.</p><p> I am worried, as I can see from this document that this year's budget for the community services programme, CSP, is the same as last year.  I am not saying it would be easy, but the Minister is not managing to leverage extra money out of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Many fantastic community facilities have been built over the years.  Community groups are building new heritage facilities and so on around the country through the rural development fund.  The Minister will need many more community services to run these places, which are semi-viable.  The Crossroads community centre in Cong was in my constituency and is now in the Minister's constituency.  If that was run under the CSP, one could not keep the doors open.  That is true of all of these large centres.  Why would we not keep them open from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m.?  Some staff resources would be needed.</p></speech>

The CSP is a good initiative.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the minimum wage and the shortfall that groups must meet.  It is putting pressure on them.  I am aware of Obair in Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare.  It is a large community services project.  When the committee was in Dunhill last week, we met a group that complained to us about this issue.  It must come up with &euro;20,000 per year.  That is a massive burden for a community group to carry.</p> <p>  Regarding taking on other schemes, the Minister mentioned that Local Link would sit better within his Department.  I would agree.  In recent days, an issue has arisen in County Clare with its Local Link service, which is known as Clare Bus.  It has lost the tender to provide the dispatch centre in Feakle, which is a rural community.  Six jobs are provided through delivering that service, which is tailor made for the community and has worked well over many years.  The provider knows its customers and is in tune with them.  For example, if it gets a phone call an hour before a bus departs, it can change the route and pick up people at their homes.  It is disturbing that the community is not in a position to retain that service.  I will raise this question with the National Transport Authority, NTA, but the programme would be better understood were it within the Minister's Department.  I encourage him to do what he can to take it under his umbrella.</p></speech>

When the Minister speaks to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, he can argue that, if he increased the number by 1,000, all he would need would be to show the net saving on the farm assist scheme versus the RSI.  That would be a problem if the programmes were in two different Departments.</p></speech>

There needs to be the same criteria for both.  We will put a watch on that, as we do not want to be tied into a situation where we do not have the funding or where we get into difficulties because we are implementing the scheme but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is making the ground rules.</p> <p>  Regarding the CSP, we gave an additional &euro;1 million to the most financially vulnerable organisations to assist them in meeting the minimum wage condition.  We did that through Pobal.  We did not ask groups to make applications.  Instead, Pobal had their information, sat down with them and did the job for me.  To be fair, there is also a review of the CSP under way.  Deputies will give out about all of the reviews that are happening, but I want this one to be completed by mid-September.  I need to find out what are the difficulties.  The minimum wage issue is turning out to be a significant one.  Were I to fund that condition now, it would cost me &euro;4 million more.  If we are to do anything on this matter next year, I will have to do so with the Minister for Finance when budget time comes.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, the CSP is meant to be only a contribution.  We are not the employer.  These services do a good job.  I must be careful.  We give &euro;32,000 for the manager and &euro;19,033 for an individual worker.  My Department provides a substantial amount of money.  I will have to negotiate with the Department of Finance regarding the minimum wage.</p> <p>  The Chairman discussed another scheme we needed to take on.  Like the RSI, rural transport would be a better fit in my Department.  A few other schemes would fit into my Department nicely.  This is something the Government needs to review now that the Department is up and running.  The Department is working well.  I compliment the staff on the tremendous work, effort and commitment they have put into it.  It has been difficult.  Mine is the first new Department in a while.  When the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was formulated, at least there was Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's old Department from which to start.  Mine was established from the bottom up.  My officials worked under difficult circumstances.  From top to bottom, we have a tremendous team.  With the Secretary General, assistant secretaries and other staff, we have a committed workforce in Ballina and Dublin.  It has been difficult, as there have been many moves, but whoever inherits it will get a good Department.</p> <p>  I believe I addressed the six Clare Bus jobs.</p> <p>  The CSP is a great programme that provides services where county councils, the HSE and other parts of the State will not.  However, I must be careful that a project under it does not displace any existing business.  I regularly get complaints about us funding groups that compete against businesses that are employing people and paying their taxes and rates.  It is a great scheme, though, and is working well.  I would like further funding for it.  Some community service projects are finding it difficult to replace retirees.  Now that unemployment has decreased from 15.5% to almost 5%, it is creating a problem.</p></speech>

The Dormant Accounts Acts provide the framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts.</p><p>The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders or policyholders with their funds but, in order to utilise the unused funds, the legislation also introduces a scheme for their disbursement.  This money is added to the Government debt.  The moneys are voted upon in government.  The Department is responsible for the management of the overall fund and the delivery of some of the measures within the action plans.</p><p> For this year, 2019, our Department will have &euro;12 million.  The key measures that will be supported through that will be the social inclusion fund and the senior alert scheme.  The funding for the social inclusion fund is &euro;5 million and the funding for the senior alert scheme is &euro;2 million.  The funding for social enterprise is &euro;2 million.  The money will first be allocated for either the social inclusion scheme or Pobal and then it will be given to the community groups.  All the projects funded are published on the website.</p><p> We are also allocating money, &euro;1.2 million, for the capital fund for the development of the volunteer centres.  Up to &euro;1 million has been allocated for employment along the Atlantic economic corridor.  All the groups that get the money are on the website so there is transparency.</p></speech>

It was necessary to introduce regulation but I always had reservations in that community trust is fundamental in so many small local charities around the country.  I refer to where the community knows the individuals concerned.  Applying the same criteria to small local charities as to big international charities, whose staff knock on doors in urban areas and are not known to anybody, is wrong.  We must ensure proportionality in the application of the rules by the Charities Regulator.  Corporate governance is important but it cannot become so great that it sucks considerable sums of money from the funds of very small groups through auditing fees and fees for experts required to fill out forms and so on.  Where this happens, the little group that handles a few thousand euro cannot do so anymore.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this issue because it is serious.  We were worried about it from the very beginning of this road.  At every level of bureaucracy, there is such a cautious approach taken that there is no proportionality left.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.717" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#Q00400"><p>I take the Deputy's points.  In November of last year, we launched the charities governance code.  It consists of six principles of governance: advancing charitable purpose; behaving with integrity; leading people; exercising control; working effectively; and being accountable and transparent.  One of the main points the code has recognised is diversity in the sector.  It aims to be proportionate and it has been written with volunteer-only charities and charities with small numbers of staff in mind.  It sets out 32 core standards that all charities should meet but also contains 17 additional standards that reflect best practice for the larger ones.  Proportionality has been recognised in the code, as desired by the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Charities Regulator will provide guidance so charities and trustees meet all the core standards.  This year will be one of learning and preparation for the charities but they will be expected to comply with the code in 2020.  From 2021, charities will be expected to report on their compliance with it.  At the heart of the code is proportionality.  The difference between the large charities and the small ones is accounted for.  The code has a simple step-by-step guide for the smaller charities and the bigger ones have a lot more work to do to satisfy the criteria.  That has been recognised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.718" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#Q00500"><p>There are small charities in various areas, including mine, that are providing services for the elderly.  Everybody knows the people in question and there is no question of having to identify them.  They might need a small grant from the HSE, for example, and they are asked for a charity number.  Then they are told to form a company and then they have accounts audited.  The charity might be dealing with only &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 per year.  The chance of a large sum of money going missing in that set of circumstances is nil because there is not a large sum.  The chance of a small sum going missing is very small but it does not seem to be the case that there is proper proportionality.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is receiving complaints about this.  Proper proportionality would involve the taking into account of compliance costs.  In some cases, because of the insistence on having to obtain a charity number, it is not worthwhile applying for small grants.</p></speech>

If one notes what happened with some charities, one realises there ought to be governance and transparency.  The money is coming from the public purse to help the charities.  I understand what the Deputy is saying about the smaller organisations but we have to protect the public and have governance.  The code was produced following consultation with the sector.  All welcome it.  It is a new code and it is being worked on so that, by next year, the charities will be using it fully.  They will be getting advice and help on its introduction to ensure they are meeting the proper governance standards.  If one were to exempt some groups on the grounds that the individuals concerned are known-----</p></speech>

We need to assist the charities in respect of the code and ensure the documents with which they have to work are written in plain English to ensure compliance.  We give them the backup to make sure this happens.</p></speech>

What I see happening here is akin to what happened in the banking sector.  The big banks lost a few hundred billion euro and we then introduced a whole lot of regulations for credit unions that removed their community element.  We are trying to turn them into mini banks even though they did not lose any of the money about which we are talking.  What went astray in credit unions was minuscule, yet we are getting rid of the community element.  We are killing volunteerism and making it such a nightmare for people to operate that much of the money the Minister of State is saying we are preventing from going to waste is just going towards audit fees and so on.  Therefore, I am not sure many communities would agree with the Minister of State that the measures are protecting them from whatever he is trying to protect them from.</p></speech>

I asked whether there would be public consultation on the new rural planning arrangements.  He said there would not.</p><p>He told me the Department had already consulted the local authorities but what he meant was that it had consulted senior planners in the local authorities, not members of the public or politicians.  Normally, when a sector is consulted, the strongest part of the organised sector is consulted, rather than the small, disorganised part which does not have representative bodies and cannot be consulted easily.</p></speech>

This will mean that once the governance has been done correctly for one organisation, this work will not have to be done again.  If an organisation is applying for funding, it can use the same document to apply for funding from other organisations.  There is a conflict between non-compliance and compliance.  We must have compliance and transparency when we are giving out public money.  I am aware that difficulties arise in that regard but coaching and help is available.  The regulator is meeting the charity groups to help them in that regard.  A series of meetings is being held nationwide to help people complete these forms as required and advise them on the best way forward.  That is the approach that is needed, rather than saying we will not allow them do this or that because that creates an environment which could be risky in the long term.</p></speech>

I contacted the regulator on behalf of a community group.  Unfortunately, I do not have the reply with me but basically I was told it could not talk to me.  The community group in question was aware that I have experience in administration and it asked me to call the regulator to find out exactly what it needed.  It is time that State agencies did what all Departments do, namely, recognise that under the law, it is a presumption that a public representative approaching an agency or Department has the permission of the person on whose behalf he or she is making the approach.  Otherwise, public representatives will not be able to do our business representing our people and resolving these kinds of problems for the weakest in society or those who are the least organised but might be doing the best work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#G00500"><p>On behalf of Sport Ireland, I thank the members for giving us this opportunity to speak to the committee this afternoon.  I will give an overview of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s funding relationship with the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, including the control mechanisms and management arrangements relating to its grant funding.<br/><br/>At the outset it is important to state that Sport Ireland was established in 2015 under the Sport Ireland Act and is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport in Ireland.  The functions of Sport Ireland are prescribed in section 8 of the Irish Sports Council Act and include powers to develop participation in sport and high performance sport; eliminate doping in sport; develop coaching; develop guidelines on the protection of children in sport; and the development of the national sports campus.<br/><br/>The Sport Ireland Act confers considerable authority in Sport Ireland and this is reinforced by our responsibility in investing substantial amounts of public funding into sport.  As a statutory agency we seek to develop strong sporting organisations and recognise the considerable public interest in a successful Irish sports sector.  That said, we must be mindful of the limits of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s legal powers.  Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and, notwithstanding our focus on good governance and financial management in funded bodies, we respect the autonomy of the national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland is responsible for the investment of public funds in sport and the subsequent oversight and accountability of this investment.  All procedures and interactions with NGBs reflect this responsibility.<br/><br/>NGBs are independent autonomous organisations.  In accordance with the key corporate governance principles, the board of any NGB is collectively responsible for leading and directing the organisation&rsquo;s activities.  Good governance recommends that the board cannot avoid its ultimate responsibility for actions undertaken in the name of the organisation.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland places a high premium on good governance and encourages high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  As the development agency, it is our aim to provide leadership in this area, empowering sport organisations to take responsibility for their own governance and meet the challenges they face.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland assists all funded bodies to achieve excellence in all areas of their work and provides a number of interventions in the area of governance.  This is broken down into a series of meaningful pieces of work, ensuring both growth and sustainability moving forward.<br/><br/>In 2018, representatives of the FAI attended a number of governance seminars and governance code workshops provided by Sport Ireland.  The FAI was also one of the 50 sporting organisations to utilise the governance elearning services which assist organisations on the journey to compliance with the governance code. <br/><br/>As the body tasked with the development of sport in Ireland, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s primary aim and responsibility is the security of, and return on investment for, the approximately &euro;2.9 million in Exchequer funding invested in the FAI on an annual basis.  To that end, Sport Ireland is satisfied that effective control mechanisms and frameworks are in place with regard to our investment in the FAI. Sport Ireland is satisfied that our funding invested in the FAI is fully accounted for and expended on the purpose for which it was intended.<b></b>This is verified on an annual basis by our financial controller based on reviews of the FAI&rsquo;s financial statements and signed auditor statements stating that all our grants were expended for the purposes for which they were intended.<br/><br/>As a further control mechanism, Sport Ireland also commissions additional external independent audits approximately every three years.  These audits independently review the FAI&rsquo;s compliance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant terms and conditions and its overall management arrangements as they relate to our grant funding.<br/><br/>I will now outline in more detail the full oversight procedures and control frameworks within Sport Ireland with regard to our grant funding to the FAI.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland invests in the long-term sustainability of NGBs.  Since 1999, the Irish Sports Council, now Sport Ireland, primarily invests in the FAI through the youth field sport programme.  This grant of &euro;2.5 million is directed towards participation and technical development programmes.  While funding is allocated to the FAI on an annual basis, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s strategy clearly demonstrates a commitment that extends beyond the one-year period.<br/><br/>In 2018, for every &euro;1 of Sport Ireland investment, the FAI invested &euro;4 from its own resources.</p><p>These Sport Ireland funds are spent on grassroots, education, player development, and central and regional development staff.  It is important to note that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s youth field sport grant goes towards technical department staff costs only, that is, development officers, national co-ordinators and programme-specific administrators.  It is explicitly stipulated that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s funding does not include any other salaries, such as high-performance salaries or salaries for those working in the professional game.  During 2017, this equated to the part-funding of 57 members of staff, of an annual average of 193 employed by the FAI.  All other staff costs, including the role of chief executive, are funded by the normal business and other commercial operations of the FAI and are not financially supported by Sport Ireland.  This is explicitly agreed with the FAI in writing and is subject to audit verification.  The youth field sport investment is broadly aimed at encouraging and creating more opportunities for young people throughout Ireland to participate in soccer.  Programmes are based on a shared ethos of developing the grassroots of the games, growing participation numbers, improving standards and embracing communities outside of the traditional base of the sport.  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s youth field sport investment supports detailed action plans which are implemented by a team of development officers and volunteers. </p><p> As well as a number of initiatives specifically aimed at bringing young people into sport, there are programmes that develop clubs and build links with communities.  Also, with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s support, the FAI builds on the expertise of teachers, coaches, referees and volunteers in order that it can provide a quality experience for children and young people who become involved in sport.  There is a strong emphasis within FAI programmes on disadvantaged areas, social inclusion, people with ethnic minority backgrounds and opportunities for players with a disability.  Sport Ireland also invests &euro;142,000 in the FAI through the women in sport programme, which aims to raise overall physical activity levels among women and girls and support women&rsquo;s roles within sporting organisations.  In 2018, Sport Ireland also invested &euro;195,000 in the women&rsquo;s national team.  The core objective of the fund is to raise standards and improve the standard of playing and training environments.  A full breakdown of all funding allocated to the FAI since 2008 has been provided to the committee as part of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s submission.  The committee should note that in 2017, our investment in the FAI represented approximately 5% of its total annual income, with the other 95% coming from the FAI&rsquo;s commercial activity, including sponsorship deals, broadcasting and gate receipts. </p><p> On control and management arrangements, specifically for the funding invested by Sport Ireland in the FAI, there are six layers of control in place.  The first is that there is strategic alignment between Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to increasing sports participation and the development of sport in Ireland, and the FAI's aim to develop participation and volunteer-led local clubs, educate coaches and referees, and promote women's and girls' football.  The aims are outlined in our respective strategies. </p><p> Second, Sport Ireland operates a detailed grant application process for the FAI.  Once received, detailed grant applications are assessed by the senior management team, including me.  The FAI&rsquo;s application for funding is underpinned by an annual programme for action that must assist the achievement of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s aims and objectives.  The board of Sport Ireland is presented with a comprehensive paper outlining the funding recommendations and the board makes the final decisions on the allocation of funds to the FAI. </p><p> Third, Sport Ireland has in place detailed terms and conditions of grant approval, which are reviewed on an annual basis for effectiveness and relevance.  These terms and conditions are signed by the FAI&rsquo;s president and chief executive annually, and are returned to Sport Ireland and retained on file.  Among other things, the terms and conditions include a requirement to notify Sport Ireland in writing without delay in the event of any material deterioration in the FAI&rsquo;s financial position, or of any other matter which may jeopardise the organisation&rsquo;s overall financial viability. </p><p> Fourth, Sport Ireland operates ongoing performance monitoring of the FAI programmes in which we invest throughout the year.  There is regular and ongoing liaison between Sport Ireland and the FAI at various levels.  Sport Ireland periodically meets the FAI to discuss performance, progress and any other issues that may arise.  Sport Ireland staff also perform periodic verification visits to observe courses, seminars, grassroots programmes and other work undertaken within the scope of the funding.  The FAI provides comprehensive information to Sport Ireland on its funded programmes, events and levels of participation throughout the year, which includes submitting an interim report and an end-of-year report which show the FAI's performance against targets. </p><p> Fifth, the FAI is required to submit its financial statements and a note from its annual general meeting to Sport Ireland in a timely fashion.  The financial statements must include an auditor&rsquo;s statement confirming that the Sport Ireland grant was expended for the purposes for which it was intended.  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller analyses the financial statements submitted by the FAI and highlights any concerns or questions that may arise.  Any queries must be satisfactorily addressed prior to the release of the FAI&rsquo;s final grant payment for the year. </p><p> Sixth, at the direction of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee, this entire system as it relates to the FAI is also audited by an independent external auditor every three years. </p><p> Turning to Sport Ireland's audits of the FAI, Sport Ireland has an audit and risk committee, which commissions audits of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grantee organisations.  Over the past decade, the FAI has been audited by Sport Ireland&rsquo;s independent auditors on more occasions than has any other sporting organisation.  Independent audits of the FAI have been completed on Sport Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, with all findings reported to Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee.  The scope of the most recent audit, completed in 2016, included a review of compliance with the Sport Ireland grant terms and conditions. The scope of this audit also included consideration of overall FAI governance and management arrangements as they related to the grant funding of &euro;2.7 million received from Sport Ireland.  This included a high level review in the following areas: board or committee structure and oversight, with reporting and minutes maintained; risk management practices, including formal risk identification, monitoring and reporting; financial management, controls and procedures; whistleblowing policies; and, code of conduct policies and related procedures.  The overall audit opinion concluded that reasonable assurance can be placed on the effectiveness and operation of internal controls.  It should be noted that reasonable assurance was the highest level of classification available.  No high-priority item was identified, while one medium-priority and two low-priority items were identified.</p><p> The 2014 audit did not identify any significant or important items and concluded that it was apparent that the FAI had put in place processes designed to comply with the terms and conditions as set out by Sport Ireland with regard to grant aided expenditure programmes.  The 2010 audit concluded that the system in place provided substantial assurance over the establishment, management and monitoring of contractual arrangements by way of the funding process between Sport Ireland and the FAI.  Three separate independent audit firms, therefore, have provided Sport Ireland with the highest level of assurance that all funding is fully accounted for and expended for the purposes for which it was intended, and that the terms and conditions of funding are being complied with.  The committee should be aware that in November 2018, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee approved our 2019 audit plan, which includes a provision for an audit of the FAI, as per our normal procedures.  The internal audit plan was presented to the board of Sport Ireland at its meeting in February 2019 and agreed to.</p><p> On the conditions of funding, a copy of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval was provided to the committee for reference.  With specific reference to the FAI, in accordance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval, all grant funding made available by Sport Ireland must be expended in accordance with the organisation&rsquo;s funding submission as approved by Sport Ireland.  The FAI must submit to Sport Ireland a copy of its financial statement to the end of the accounting year for the mid-year review process.  All grants received from Sport Ireland must be separately identified as income in the organisation&rsquo;s annual financial statements.  The FAI, and all organisations in receipt of more than &euro;200,000, must present its financial statements with accounts fully audited by a registered auditor in accordance with Irish generally accepted accounting principles, including a signed audit opinion specifying the auditor&rsquo;s name and address, and a statement from the auditor that each grant was expended in accordance with the approved submission.</p><p>The committee should note that, as part of the mid-year financial review of the FAI&rsquo;s 2017 financial statements and in advance of the final tranche of 2018 funding being released to the FAI, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller raised a query with the FAI regarding its 2017 liquidity position, specifically the introduction of a bank overdraft facility of &euro;1.3 million and the increased net debt position in 2017.  The query was responded to by the FAI's director of finance, who stated: </p><blockquote>The Net Current Liabilities position is a common annual position mainly driven by Deferred Income balances where advance funds from grants, sponsorship &amp;amp; commercial agreements are being released over the life of the respective agreement.  The overdraft position at Dec 2017 was within our Overdraft Facility with our Banking partners and was a matter of timing rather than a liquidity concern &ndash; the balance has been in credit for the majority of 2018 to date.  The Balance Sheet position was reviewed by the audit team as part of going concern procedures, including reviewing future budgets, and no concerns were raised.</blockquote><p>The committee should also note that the &euro;100,000 loan from the chief executive to the FAI was not disclosed as a separate note in the 2017 financial statements and this information was not made available to Sport Ireland at any stage.<br/><br/>With respect to the release of grant payments to the FAI, in line with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s code of governance and business conduct, the chief executive has the authority to pay to funded bodies that operate on an ongoing basis up to 50% of their previous year's allocation in advance of the formal approval by the board. The board of Sport Ireland is informed of payment at the next opportunity.  In recent years the FAI has written to Sport Ireland requesting an early drawdown of a portion of funding.  Sport Ireland has always demonstrated a flexibility and willingness to facilitate the FAI,<i></i>as we have with other national governing bodies, NGBs, with early drawdowns of portions of funding where possible and feasible to do so.  In assessing an early drawdown request, the following are considered: procedures within Sport Ireland&rsquo;s code of governance and business conduct; the cyclical nature of funding and Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to funding a programme beyond any one-year period; the NGBs' programme of action and programme delivery timelines; and, the risk appetite and achievement of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objectives. <br/><br/>The committee should note there are a number of reasons a funded body may request early drawdown of a portion of funding, including but not limited to the scheduling of home fixtures; financial cycles for the funded body and Sport Ireland; the hosting of major events; the timing and delivery of the funded programme and costs already incurred; and, the schedule of the Sport Ireland grant process and board decisions.  Sport Ireland pays the majority of NGBs 75% of their annual funds in January and February for the year in question.  However, board decisions on the award of funding to the FAI under the youth field sports programme is typically reached later, during quarter 2 or quarter 3.  Sport Ireland has brought forward the dates for board decision on the youth field sports programme to April, in 2018, and March, in 2019. <br/><br/>It is important to note that final payment to funded bodies in any given year<i>, </i>following formal approval by the board of Sport Ireland, is only released following the annual general meeting of the organisation, the provision of an interim report, the provision of financial statements for the preceding year, which must be reviewed and approved by Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller, and the funded body meeting other compliance obligations.<br/><br/>Regarding current ongoing matters in the FAI, following media reports concerning a loan of &euro;100,000 to the organisation by its now former chief executive, and at the request of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, Sport Ireland wrote to the president of the FAI on 19 March seeking urgent clarification from the board of the FAI on the circustanmces of the loan and its repayment.  Sport Ireland also sought an explanation on why we were not notified at any stage in 2017 about any apparent deterioration in the FAI&rsquo;s financial position, which is a requirement of the terms and conditions of grant approval.  Sport Ireland received a response from the president of the FAI, which acknowledged the loan of &euro;100,000 to the FAI by its then chief executive.  However, the contents of the FAI letter did not sufficiently explain the circumstances of this loan and its repayment, nor fully address the matter of compliance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval.<br/><br/>On Monday, 25 March, Sport Ireland again wrote to the president of the FAI re-seeking clarification on the circumstances of this loan.  More detail was also requested by Sport Ireland in order to assess compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval.  Sport Ireland also sought reconfirmation that all State funding provided to the FAI  had been spent for the purposes intended and in accordance with approved submissions.  We also asked the FAI to fully apprise us of any other significant issues that had arisen or were likely to arise, including key risks and actions proposed and how it proposed to manage them.  That was the letter.  At the time of this submission, I stated a second letter had not been received but a second letter was received last evening in the office of Sport Ireland by email and was handed delivered to Sport Ireland today at 10.45 a.m. <br/><br/>I will read the letter into the record, if that is okay.</p></speech>

It states:</p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Treacy, <br /><br />Thank you for your letter of 25 March 2019.  I apologise for the delay in responding to your letter.<br /><br />I note the concerns expressed by the Minister Ross with regards to media reports and your wish for clarification as to the circumstances of the short-term loan by the then chief executive to the association.  <br /><br />The association has engaged Mazars to carry out an independent review of all matters in this regard.  When that review is complete I will write to you in more detail in relation to the circumstances involved, as requested.  In the meantime the association will be happy to meet with you or your officials to review the association's financial records in relation to the use of State funding.<br /><br />The terms and conditions of grant approval require us to satisfy certain conditions.  I can confirm my understanding that the association has utilised all State funding in compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval. <br /><br />As you are aware from our statement of March 30 2019, the association has engaged with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and its dealings with their inquiries.  The association has established a committee, which I am chairing, to work with our external advisers to urgently address the matter of concern.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Donal Conway,<br /><br />President of the FAI.</blockquote> <p>We will be writing to the FAI probably in the next day or so.  We will be expressing our disappointment, particularly at the timing of the letter which was received yesterday evening and then hand delivered this morning.  We will be raising the context of the letter, which falls far short of what was expected from both requests by Sport Ireland.  The letter does not provide any explanation on the circumstances surrounding the loan and it repayment.  The board of the FAI has not provided any legitimate reason it cannot provide the information requested.  In the absence of information, we cannot make any adjudication on whether the terms and conditions of grant approval have been complied with.  We still await an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the loan and its repayment.  We will ask for the terms of reference of Mazars' review and an assurance that we will be consulted as part of it and that the full final report will be provided on a timely basis to Sport Ireland.  We will ask for that.We have asked for a response by close of business on Monday next.<br/><br/>I will continue now with my opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#J00400"><p>Yes, please do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#J00500"><p>Sport Ireland is also aware of media reports relating to rental payments made by the FAI on behalf of its former chief executive.  Sport Ireland has no knowledge of any rental payments which may have been made.  As with any NGB for sport, staffing and contractual arrangements are entirely a matter for the board of the FAI.</p> <p>  With respect to structural changes within the FAI, following the prior release of the FAI&rsquo;s statement on the senior management structure and on 25 March, Sport Ireland received a letter from the new FAI interim chief executive, Rea Walshe, outlining structural changes within the organisation on the back of a review of its senior management structure.</p><p>The letter outlined that the board of the FAI had commissioned a review by independent consultant, Jonathan Hall &amp;amp; Associates, and had adopted its recommendations.  It stated that the chief executive officer, Mr. John Delaney, had moved to a new position of executive vice president with immediate effect, giving an overview of this specific defined role.  The letter also confirmed that Ms Walshe had been appointed as interim chief executive with immediate effect.  Notwithstanding a media release from the FAI on Saturday, 23 March, the letter of 25 March was the first occasion on which Sport Ireland was formally notified of the review of the organisation's senior management structure and the creation of the new role of executive vice president.  Sport Ireland was not consulted on the commissioning or preparation of the report.  Sport Ireland has not received a copy of the report.<br/><br/>The code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland is a resource to assist community, voluntary and charitable organisations to develop their overall capacity in terms of how they run their organisations.  It is a voluntary code provided free to all boards, committees and executives of not-for-profit groups to encourage them to check themselves against best practice in the management of their affairs.  The Government's national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies, NGBs, and local sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  As part of this process Sport Ireland will also identify and put in place the training and supports needed by the different organisations to assist with the adoption process.  Notwithstanding the fact that NGBs, such as the FAI, are independent, autonomous organisations and are responsible for their own governance procedures, Sport Ireland provides a number of governance supports to all sporting organisations to assist in their adoption of the code.<br/><br/>In 2018, representatives of the FAI attended a number of governance seminars and governance code workshops provided by Sport Ireland.  The FAI was one of the 50 sporting bodies to utilise the governance e-learning service which assists organisations on the journey to compliance with the governance code.  According to the governance code website, the FAI is on the governance code adoption journey.  Sport Ireland understands that the FAI has established a governance committee, the remit of which is to ensure the FAI is compliant with the code.<br/><br/>With regard to the term limits of boards, while Sport Ireland does not set term limits, it does support the adoption of the governance code among all funded bodies.  While the governance code does not stipulate mandatory terms for board directors, the director term of office guidance note<i></i>states that the most common practice is that directors are appointed for a three-year term and that it is considered good practice to put a limit of two or three terms on a director's service to ensure a cycle of board renewal.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland's primary aim and responsibility is the security of and return on investment for the circa &euro;2.9 million in Exchequer funding invested by Sport Ireland in the FAI on annually.  Sport Ireland is satisfied that there are effective control mechanisms and frameworks in place with regard to its investment in the FAI and that its grant funding is used for the purposes for which it was intended.  This is verified annually by signed auditor statements and approximately every three years by Sport Ireland independent auditors.  The control mechanisms and frameworks deployed by Sport Ireland with regard to its funding to the FAI can provide strong assurance to the committee.  I have described Sport Ireland's functions as per its establishing legislation, the Sport Ireland Act 2015, and its philosophy towards working with funded bodies to develop sport.  Sport Ireland is mindful of the limits of its legal powers.  Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and, notwithstanding its focus on good governance and financial management in funded bodies, we respect the autonomy of the NGBs and the collective responsibility of their boards.  We aim to develop strong sporting organisations and identify and put in place the training and supports needed by the different organisations to assist with the adoption of better governance practices.  As per the Minister's request, Sport Ireland will continue to correspond with the president of the FAI to seek clarification as outlined earlier.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its time and I welcome any questions.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Mr. Treacy's commitment and lifelong dedication to sport and the recent Irish successes in the Special Olympics in Abu Dhabi.  I also acknowledge the presence of the Special Olympics team in the Visitors Gallery, who were welcomed to the Houses earlier by Members of the Oireachtas.  Sport is very important to them and to all of us.</p> <p>  It was agreed earlier that each member will have ten minutes for questions and answers.  As Chairman, I recognise Deputy Catherine Murphy has raised this issue long before any of these controversies arose in December.  We have had a number of communications with the FAI in respect of meeting date changes and so on.  Deputy Murphy will take the first ten minute slot, followed by Deputy Rock, who has agreed to share his time with Senator O'Mahony.  The sequence is as follows: Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Rock, Deputy Troy, Deputy Munster, Senator O'Mahony, Deputy Coppinger, Deputy O'Keeffe, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Senator Feighan.  We will have a second round of questions and answers.  I will be sticking strictly to time limits and I will indicate to members when they have one minute remaining.</p></speech>

In light of the time constraints, I will try to be brief in my questions and I would appreciate it if the witnesses could give me succinct responses.  Mr. Treacy used the word "disappointment" in regard to the letter from the FAI regarding its non-compliance with the Sport Ireland request.  Sport Ireland operates specific terms and conditions in respect of grant approval, section 4.2 of which provides that Sport Ireland may request at any time, during or after a period to which grant funding relates, such information and documentation as it may reasonably require to be satisfied as to the viability and sustainability of an organisation's overall financial position.  Section 1.1 deals with sanctions and section 10.2 reiterates those sanctions.  As such, it is within the gift of Sport Ireland to not pay grants or to seek repayment of grants.  If Sport Ireland does not receive a satisfactory response by next week, what action will it take?</p></speech>

We have asked for this information and we will ask for it again tomorrow.  If we do not get a response, it will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting on Tuesday.  It is a matter for the board to decide what action needs to be taken.  If the FAI is found to be non-compliant with the terms and conditions of funding, it will require the board to consider what actions it can take.</p></speech>

With regard to the viability of the organisation, we were told the bridging loan was to bridge a short-term problem.  Does Mr. Mulvey understand what that was?  What was the first letter he received that gave him any indication of what that loan was for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.813" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#L00200"><p>We have no idea why it required the loan.  Incidentally, if the FAI had come to us we would have looked at it and if we could have assisted it we would have, as we have done in the past with other sporting organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#L00300"><p>There was a story in today's newspapers about the prize money that came from UEFA through the organisation, which would be quite normal, in the same year.  It took a long time for that amount to be paid.  Do the witnesses have concerns about the organisation's ability in 2017 and its sustainability as a going concern given that this most unusual situation arose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.815" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#L00400"><p>We would be well aware that cashflow is an issue for it.  That would be well known within sport.  We gave the FAI 50% of the funding this year; the second payment of 25% was given at the end of March.  We have no idea why that loan was given to the FAI or why it needed a loan.  That is why we are asking the question.  We put an investment in the NGB within the FAI and it is sustained investment over a long period of time.  Taxpayers' money is going into it and we have very good programmes in place.  The viability of those programmes is critically important to us.  We want to have strong organisations that do not have cashflow problems, but we also know it has debts with Aviva Stadium and it is meeting those debt requirements.  We know that is not easy either.</p></speech>

If we could multiply it by ten, I would support as much spent on sport as possible.  We are not at cross purposes on that.  However, we are examining the sustainability of an important and big organisation, and there is a doubt about that.  Will Sport Ireland do an audit in respect of that year given the things that have been unusual about it?</p></speech>

Our investment in the FAI is 50% of its total turnover.  We audit that funding and compliance with that funding.  In the case of boxing, for example, we are investing perhaps 70% or 80% of the funding so we examine that 70% or 80%.  We are examining the entire organisation in that case, but we are limited in our audit power within organisations where we are giving a relatively small level of funding-----</p></speech>

From our point of view, it is getting reassurance that the &euro;2.7 million we give it is going to the programmes that are funded by us.  Over the years we are happy overall that the money has gone towards those programmes, which are important ones.  All its other commercial activities are not within our authority or remit.  That is the problem and I do not know how we will resolve it.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy drew attention to the change in the role from CEO to executive vice president and said Sport Ireland has not been informed about that.  Sport Ireland has a document about its investment criteria and one of the criteria it will insist on is that jobs are advertised.  According to the statement, he has moved and it happened with the unanimous approval of the board.  It is highly unusual.  It is not in compliance with Sport Ireland's investment criteria.  What can Sport Ireland do about that?</p></speech>

One cannot segment something off to a corner and say the rest of the organisation does not matter.  Those investment criteria insist on a particular set of behaviours, and advertising jobs would be one of them.  I am speaking about Sport Ireland's rules.</p></speech>

We only found out after the fact that it had a new chief executive and that the former chief executive had been moved to one side.  We are coming to this not knowing the facts behind it.  We have not seen the report, but normal procedure is that those positions would be advertised.</p></speech>

I am sure that is the case with other organisations.  However, it does not appear to be reciprocated.  Certainly this response gives us the impression that this is one-way traffic.  There has to be some sanction that Sport Ireland will impose or else this behaviour will continue.</p></speech>

We have the right to ask about terms and conditions of funding and this letter provides no information for us.

Obviously, we want to maintain the programmes and when much of the funding is going to people who work within the sport our concern is to maintain those programmes as best we can.

The normal course of action is to meet the FAI after the board decision and the confirmation of the funding, and the distribution and allocation of the funding during the year.  The events over the past couple of weeks have overtaken the process this year.  It is our intention in relation the youth field sports programme, as in the normal course, to meet the association to discuss progress, targets, etc.</p></speech>

First, we must not penalise the programmes by non-funding them.  We had this with boxing previously.  We separated the corporate issues from the funding issue in the sense that these are for development officers, programmes, summer programmes, social inclusion programmes and women in sport programmes.  It is not our intention that those who participate in the programmes lose momentum or funding for those programmes.  The board of the FAI has a corporate responsibility for this.  If we do not get the answers and, indeed, if the committee does not get the answers following its meeting with the association, then we have to revisit this issue with the association.  In the meantime, I do not want to get into a situation where those who need the money do not get it or there is any threat over it.</p></speech>

I have been a member of this committee for some time and I have seen how frustrated Sport Ireland was with the appointments made by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.

I always say to the board that at any given time we are dealing with corporate governance issues in three or four organisations.  We deal with volunteers who get on boards and that is the space we are in.  We do an awful lot of training in corporate governance with volunteers and executive staff.</p><p>Sometimes there is a very good board in place and there could be change, there might be an election and there is a new board which might not have the skills required and it is back to square one again.  That happens quite often.  It is constant and one must be on the case all the time.  We do not like it when sport is in the public light as it is today.  It is not good for it.  We need to get on with our business.  Last summer was one of the most exciting sporting eras of all time in terms of the organisations we fund.  It is like sport, there are good days and bad days.  To be here talking about governance within the FAI is not a good day for sport.  We are deeply disappointed to be here talking about this issue with the committee because we should not be here talking about governance.  We expect all of our organisations which are on a journey in applying the governance code to have the highest standards.  That is what we expect from any organisation, including the FAI.</p></speech>

All of us around the table encourage people to vote for us everyday, but there is no guarantee that they will do so.  Surely Sport Ireland must do much more than encourage?  Surely there must be a requirement that there be high standards of governance, as the 2016 code of practice stipulates.  Does Sport Ireland consistently apply the same standards across all of the governing bodies of sport?   I am looking for a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

We are dealing with different organisations.  In bigger organisations the bar is a little higher.  We are on a journey.  Government policy is that all organisations adopt a community and voluntary code by 2021.  It will then be a condition in receiving funding that that standard be maintained.</p></speech>

However, let us look at the standards Sport Ireland imposed on the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, in 2017.  At the beginning of June Mr. Treacy and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, warned the IABA that funding risked being suspended over a governance issue and a one-month deadline was set.  The IABA receives &euro;1.3 million annually from Sport Ireland.  The FAI receives &euro;2.7 million which is a smaller percentage of its overall pot but a substantial amount of Sport Ireland's funding.  Mr. Treacy has said Sport Ireland applies a different standard to bigger organisations than smaller ones.</p></speech>

Towards the end of the written submission of Sport Ireland there is a reference to term limits.  It states "while Sport Ireland does not set term limits, it does support the adoption of the Governance Code".  The most common practice is for directors to be appointed for a three-year term.  How many members of the board of Sport Ireland fail to meet common best practice?</p></speech>

Every year the auditors of the FAI give us a letter confirming that moneys from the Exchequer were expended for the purposes for which they had been given.  As I stated, we have used three auditors to audit the FAI, all of which have reported that the money we gave to the FAI was expended for the purposes for which it had been given.  We are satisfied with the audits we have undertaken and their findings. We are also satisfied that the investment made by the Government in the FAI is good value for money and that we get a very good return.  We have also verified that our terms and conditions of funding are met.  We are asking the FAI about the terms and conditions and the circumstances surrounding the loan.  We have acted when there is an issue and are acting now.  We are satisfied about what happened previously.  As I stated, we will be auditing the FAI in 2019.</p></speech>

It appears that some organisations may believe an independent external audit will only be carried out by Sport Ireland every three years and that that fact might be part of the explanation for what happened.

It is from this aspect that I ask.</p> <p>  Other committee members have asked about sanctions.  I was going to ask what specific sanction Sport Ireland will impose.  It was stated earlier that it will be a matter for the board to decide and that those who need the money are the ones who risk being deprived of it.  Nobody wants to see this happen but, at the same time, I got the distinct impression that if Sport Ireland is not satisfied and it goes to the board meeting next Tuesday, there will be no sanctions.</p></speech>

To a large degree, apart from seeking an appropriate, adequate and comprehensive reply to the correspondence we have had with the FAI, to be honest we would like to see the outcome of the committee's hearing next Wednesday, when the FAI and its officers and board will be before it.  We will have to make an assessment on that basis.  Tuesday's board meeting will take stock of the situation and we will receive a report from the executive on this.  It may be a later board meeting.  We will have to be reassured that everything is okay.  We have to be reassured before providing any further tranche of funding, of which 25% is left, that when we expend it the issues that have now arisen are answered to the satisfaction of the committee, as representatives of the Oireachtas in this matter, and that the Minister, given that this is a policy matter under the Act, also has engagement on it with the board of Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

Why do the witnesses think the FAI has this problem?  The FAI has stated it was a bridging loan.  Do the witnesses find it credible that an organisation such as the FAI would be in such a dire financial situation that it would have to resort to getting a loan of &euro;100,000 from its CEO's personal bank account?</p></speech>

This is why we have asked the questions we have asked.  We are waiting for an answer.  As the committee can see from today, we did not get an answer.  We have had experience of this down through the years.  Generally, if an organisation is in financial trouble, it comes in and speaks to us.  It might be a timing issue, such as dues or affiliation fees not being due until a month later.  We work with the organisations to oversee and make sure they meet that cashflow issue.  Many of them are very tight on funding.  This is generally the way it is done.  There is dialogue with us and we are there to help and support the organisations.  The organisations have continued and prospered.  Occasionally, they run into trouble but there is dialogue.  There was no dialogue on this.</p></speech>

My first question relates to Sport Ireland's regulatory role.  There is a slight contradiction in the opening statement, in which Sport Ireland is at pains to stress it is not a regulatory body yet the Sport Ireland Act confers considerable authority on it and, according to the opening statement, this is reinforced by responsibility for investing substantial amounts of public funding.  Sport Ireland states it is there to empower sports organisations to take responsibility for their own performance and to have best practice.  Do the witnesses agree this amounts to light touch or hands-off regulation?</p></speech>

However, even after the recent reforms on the back of a review by independent consultants which Sport Ireland was not told about, the FAI directors have been in place for more than ten years and a number of them will be staying for at least another four years.  Some of the directors will have served 14 years by the time they leave the organisation.  Will Sport Ireland be saying anything to the FAI about that?</p></speech>

The funding has never been restored to 2008 levels.  The FAI at that time was in receipt of approximately &euro;4 million.  Its funding is now at &euro;2.565 million.  In a sense, over the past ten years, the FAI has been in a steady state.  The first year we had an increase in our budget was this year.  Previously, there was designated funding for sport, for organisations like the GPA or the women's GPA, for example.  Last year, funding was made available for the women's international soccer team, in the context of promoting women in sport.  We gave it the biggest grant, for the reason just outlined by the Deputy.  The second reason is that the sport is heavily involved in areas of urban and rural deprivation.  It has a high level of inclusion and significant funding requirements for clubs that would not be in salubrious areas of our cities, towns and rural areas.  We are conscious of that fact.  Many of the programmes that are specified in the documentation we receive from the FAI are focused on that so-----</p></speech>

Irrespective of the corporate issues that we are discussing today, the FAI makes extraordinarily good use of the money we give it.  It also puts in a lot of matching funding, above and beyond that.  It invests three or four times the amount of funding that we provide.  I must say that in defence of the organisation.</p></speech>

Would Sport Ireland agree that it is totally unsatisfactory that it channels its focus into that when the dogs on the street can see that the CEO is extremely well paid?  The CEO's expenses are unknown and we will ask about them next week.  Sport Ireland is aware of all this.  It is investing money but perhaps some money should be taken from some of these other areas.  Does Sport Ireland have the right to say anything to the FAI?</p></speech>

There would have been previous discussions around the grant process, the financial cycles, the likely time for board decisions and so on.  We would have obtained information on the programme delivery timelines and it is fair to say that our preference would be to wait.  However, as our chief executive has outlined, we work with organisations and want to maintain the stability of their programmes.  We want to make sure that we get good outcomes from a participation and development point of view.  If we can be flexible, we will be and it is entirely within our procedures to pay grants early.  Certainly we were given suitable assurances that there were no impending financial issues or anything of that nature.</p></speech>

Generally, the three main field sports funding comes later in the year.  While all the other NGBs have got their funding in January or February, the decisions for the three main field sports are not made until April, May or June, and that is why we have a degree of flexibility with them to give them an early 25% drawdown.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I wanted to ask have been answered.  I will come at this from a different point of view and broaden the discussion.  I was involved in association football 30 years ago and it certainly was not well organised at a national level.  I was one of those who was delighted when the Genesis report was brought in to radically overhaul the FAI governance structures.  I recall that the then Minister, John O'Donoghue, was quite right to withdraw funding until the FAI implemented many of the key recommendations.  Is Sport Ireland satisfied that the Genesis report has been implemented in full over the past 18 years?</p></speech>

Any time I have the experience of meeting boards and seeing independent people on boards, they are bringing expertise and it adds real value to boards.  It is something we strongly advocate for.  We like to see that implemented throughout the entire sports sector because it adds value and it means we have strong boards and good skills, whether legal, financial or otherwise, and they bring skills that these sporting organisations do not have.  That was a strong recommendation in the Genesis report and we continue to strongly advocate for that.</p></speech>

InsideSport is an international website which deals with these types of corporate governance issues and covers them extensively, and that is something I follow.  What I would say, and I mean this in all sincerity, is that in the past five years, the corporate governance of our sports sector has moved on considerably.  What I have found and seen is that the corporate governance in the sports sector in Ireland is far superior to the corporate governance of sports sectors in other countries.  Corporate governance in some of our national federations is far superior to the international corporate governance in international bodies.  While we are talking about a corporate governance issue here today and rightly highlighting it, we take it extremely seriously, which is a good thing.</p></speech>

Is the FAI a symptom of that?  Is it a kind of like a Goodfellas club around the world and is it the same with every organisation?  Are there the same issues with world rugby?  Perhaps Mr. Treacy could comment on UEFA and FIFA.  Obviously, the new and emerging states in Europe and the Caucasus do not have the same structures.  Is the FAI part of that gang?</p></speech>

If Senator O'Mahony wants to have a row, we can have one.  I do not want a row; I want this to go well.  I want to make a few summarising points before we come back in.  My point is that Sport Ireland does not have the power to insist on a plan for proper corporate governance for all of these bodies.  According to the terms and conditions for grant approval as set out on its application form, Sport Ireland must be satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place for the overall governance and management of an organisation before it can approve funding.  However, Sport Ireland does not have the power to address the issue.  It can audit the funding it provides, but it cannot look at the other issues from the perspective of its legislative role.  The issue is how we ensure Sport Ireland or another body has that power.</p> <p>  In regard to that question, I was interested in what Senator Feighan said about best practice in other countries.  I do not know if it is true, but I have been told that in other countries where an application for a grant is made to the national equivalent of Sport Ireland, those other issues are vetted by the charities regulator.  That regulator has statutory powers to examine the matter and refuse certification if certain conditions are not being met.  Sport Ireland might have a view on that at our next meeting.  People want certainty that these issues can never arise again or, if they do arise, that a statutory agency is able to sort them out immediately.  That is the core issue.  I do not know if the witnesses have a view on it.  If the law needs to change, we should change it.  We will suspend while we think about that.  The key is to provide an answer to whatever weaknesses exist in the law or in respect of Sport Ireland's powers or those of the committee.</p></speech>

If anybody is concerned about judgments I made earlier, or if I upset anybody, that was not my intention.  We have had a very constructive meeting thus far.   We will shortly commence our second round of questioning, sticking to the same rotation in terms of speakers.  Before calling the first speaker, I would like to make a point to Sport Ireland, which may be helpful to the meeting.  The Sport Ireland Act 2015, page 11, sets out the criteria, terms and conditions of assistance.</p><p>Section 11 of the Sport Ireland 2015, which deals with criteria, terms and conditions of assistance, states:</p><blockquote>(1) Sport Ireland&mdash;(a) shall establish such criteria, terms and conditions for the provision of assistance (including financial assistance) under <i>section 8(4)(a)</i>as, having regard to its functions, it considers appropriate, and<br /><br />(b) may establish different criteria, terms and conditions in relation to different classes of applicants and recipients.(2) Where, in Sport Ireland&rsquo;s opinion, any person or body that has applied for or received assistance under <i>section 8(4)(a)</i>fails to meet any of the applicable criteria, terms or conditions established under <i>subsection (1)</i>, Sport Ireland may do one or more of the following:(a) withhold assistance from, or refuse to provide assistance to, that person or body;<br /><br />(b) demand a refund of any financial assistance provided under that paragraph to that person or body.(3) Sport Ireland may&mdash;(a) request any person or body applying for or receiving assistance under <i>section 8(4) (a) </i>to supply Sport Ireland with information in such form and at such time as it may require, and<br /><br />(b) withhold or refuse such assistance if satisfied that any information so requested is not forthcoming.</blockquote><p>It strengthens the statutory power of Sport Ireland apart from its own terms and conditions with respect to approval.  There is a stronger base in law for the actions being taken.</p></speech>

It states that members of the FAI ratified the introduction of an eight-year term limit for board members, which is at variance with the three-year terms.  The submission indicates that as part of rule changes and to avoid immediate loss of experience and expertise from the board, it was agreed that any board member who was the chairperson of a standing committee or the national league executive committee, and who had served more than ten years on the board, may be re-elected for up to four years.  That is what has been agreed with the FAI.</p></speech>

The Genesis report was referred to earlier and there was mention of the need for independence on the board, with which I agree.  It is interesting that at the time of the Genesis report publication, the then FAI treasurer, Mr. John Delaney, said he was quite furious that it would take five years to implement some of the recommendations.  He made a strong commitment at the time and wanted that change to happen quickly.</p> <p>  We can then look at the people on the board and every one of them chairs a standing committee.  There was an extra four years on top of the ten years, and, in some cases, the period is way beyond ten years.  Some people are on the board since 2004 and 2005. That is a significant issue.  I have no doubt they bring an expertise and I do not dispute that.  Turnover and independence on the board are important nonetheless.  Does the witness have a concern that one of the ingredients in that kind of arrangement is loyalty?  There may be groupthink in that kind of environment.  We were told the loss of expertise was a concern but it is interesting that it is not just at board level that one gets expertise, as it is evident in staffing as well.  The turnover of staffing at the FAI is quite high.  Six of ten senior staff have left and four finance directors have left in the past eight or nine years.  Two commercial directors have left and there have been four different heads of communications.  Others who have left include a lawyer and deputy chief executive.  That is the profile of what is happening in an organisation.  Does the witness see that as an organisation that is functioning well with such a profile?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.1098" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#V00900"><p>I had not seen the board or governance element raised by the Deputy.  I agree that there must be expertise and rotation in a board.  There are some critical pieces needed on every board, whether it is legal, accounting, human resources or whatever.  The spirit of the community and voluntary code is about board rotation.  People serve the time and move on after a period so someone else can come in and take that place.  That is the proper way for a board to function.  It paves the way for new members to come in with bright and new ideas to keep the place regenerated with ideas, etc.  It is good corporate governance.  People can stay on boards for far too long and the Deputy used the word "loyalty".  There is a clear role for the board, which is to challenge the executive and the management, making them accountable for the actions to be taken.  The boards approves and the management executes, which is the way it should be in every organisation.  If there are people on a board for too long, it can lead to a fudging of that process with respect to the balance of power.  Every board needs to challenge and set a high standard.  That is good corporate governance.</p></speech>

He said earlier that today is not a good day and it is never a good day when sport is on the front pages of newspapers for something other than winning something big.  That has been the profile over the past number of weeks.</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy said earlier there is one CEO.  This split position was unanimously adopted by that board over a short period, when it had recent sight of the report done by Jonathan Hall Associates.  Has Mr. Treacy seen the report?</p></speech>

That was approved seamlessly.  The FAI has a president and vice president.  The vice president is elected by the council but this executive vice president role happened as a consequence of this report.  It was approved unanimously by the board at a time there was a difficulty for the chief executive officer.  Does it strike Mr. Treacy that there is a connection between those elements and loyalty may well have played a part?</p></speech>

Where does the balance of power fall in respect of the CEO if a new person is to stamp some authority on the organisation?</p><p>Would that be an issue in terms of governance?</p></speech>

It is hard to find an example where one would have a joint CEO.  My experience in the past is that where trade unions amalgamated one would have for a period a joint general secretary or general president until the integration of the organisation.  In some business organisations, one would have an executive chairman and a chief executive officer etc. but largely, in business management theory and practice, there is one CEO, chief executive officer, who has a reporting function to the board and, as Mr. Treacy indicated, has responsibility for the operation of the organisation.  It is hard to see it.</p> <p>  Our information is - it is as much information as the committee or the public has because we have not seen the Jonathan Hall report - that this post was identified in that report.  We are reading this at third hand, we have asked for the report, we need to obtain it and we have not obtained it to date.  If that report stated there needed to be a separation out of the functions, the chief executive had too great a workload, Mr. Delaney had been elected to the UEFA executive and then seemed to have been undertaken in this role, it appears, from what we read, he would be using his position within UEFA and within the FAI to attract to the country international competitions.  In common with Northern Ireland and with the football associations, FAs, of England, Scotland and Wales, he would be using his position within UEFA and with what used to be called the home countries to attract international competition.  We do not know.  I can only surmise he does not have a role in the national game or the national organisation beyond that.  However, I am at sea, the same as the committee.</p></speech>

Good practice and good governance would suggest that Sport Ireland would be informed of two matters: the specification, and whether we had any commentary to make on it given our experience and expertise in the area; and whether we had any role on the interview board or any other arrangement.  Sometimes we have had that role.  Sometimes there is a conundrum as to whether it is a good idea to be on a selection board.  Certainly, our view here would be the appointment should conform to what obtains in public appointments systems or proper board companies.  That would follow the code of practice for the appointment of chief executive.  Largely, that is a British code on corporate governance.  There are ways of doing this right and it should be done right.</p></speech>

We have come across this on a number of occasions where one has a high-performance director wanting to bypass the chief executive and report directly to the board.  Essentially, the boards of those national governing bodies, NGB, would come to us and look for advice.  There is a clear message here - there is only one chief executive.</p> <p>  Second, we have many NGBs that are hiring chief executives on an ongoing basis and it is normal practice that Sport Ireland nominates someone to that process.  We have an organisation development unit that gives advice in terms of job descriptions and guidance in terms of the recruitment process.  That is all there for organisations that want to avail of those services.  We have people with vast experience, not from the board or from the executive, who we nominate to sit on interview boards.</p></speech>

For instance, when the UEFA European Championship took place two years ago, did any representatives from Sport Ireland attend the tournament, and if so, was it paid for by the FAI or Sport Ireland?  I ask because there was speculation in the past week about members of this committee being invited to an FAI function.  I wish to put on the record that I did not accept the invitation to attend the draw for whatever under-17 FIFA event is taking place next week, and that I did not seek or receive any tickets at any stage.  What is the protocol for such events?  When the Olympics are held, for example, I can understand that a representative from Sport Ireland would attend and I do not mean to point a finger.  My question is whether such an arrangement could cause any subsequent difficulty with governance.</p></speech>

That is the standard procedure, as it is for all sports.  If the Irish football team was playing away in a European Championship qualifier, we would certainly not attend.  If it qualified for a European Championship, Mr. Mulvey and I would usually attend.  Sport Ireland would pay for the trip, although the FAI would provide a complimentary ticket.  We would pay for our own hotel and so on.  That is the extent of the arrangement.</p></speech>

Some 570 organisations, such as schools and organisations that are much smaller than the FAI, are able to secure accreditation and be compliant with the governance code.  I find it hard to believe that a major organisation such as the FAI is still on that journey 17 years later.  Is there a reason for that?</p></speech>

I asked about the board membership of Sport Ireland and the length of service of each member because I would expect Sport Ireland, as the overarching governing body, to lead by example.  Given that Sport Ireland stipulates that the term that people can serve is limited to three years for a maximum of two or three terms, or a total of nine years, I would expect it to lead by example.  Whether the Department or Sport Ireland makes the exemption, it is not right.  While Mr. Treacy did not state he did not have confidence in the board of the FAI, he refused quite pointedly to express confidence in it.  Is Sport Ireland not taking financial sanctions against the board purely because it fears that any financial cuts will hurt athletes, rather than the people we might want to affect?</p></speech>

We will undergo a process.  We are certainly very disappointed with the letter that we received before this meeting, which was reflected in my comment.  One would not expect such a reply.  I had written an important letter but the response was disappointing.  If we decided to cut funding for the FAI tomorrow morning, we would have already given 50% of the funding this year and we would give the rest of the funding by August or September.  There would be a little time, therefore, but if we cut funding, people would ultimately be let go, while programmes that had been invested in throughout the communities would cease to exist.  That is the tricky aspect that we must balance, but we have not yet struck that balance.  In general, if we intend to cut funding, we send our auditors, and if they return with verified critical issues, we enter that territory and the board decides.</p></speech>

On what actions Sport Ireland can take, Mr. Treacy stated its powers are restricted.  As part of the Government's national sports policy of 2018, did Sport Ireland request any additional powers in order that it could have greater oversight of the governance of sporting bodies?</p></speech>

That is our approach and it is why Sport Ireland has an organisation and development unit, which proclaims and discusses governance and sets standards.  That is the only way it can work.  It is the spirit within a sporting organisation.  The principles of governance, whether leadership, exercising control of the organisation, accountability or transparency, come from the top of the organisation, not from Sport Ireland, and the top of the organisation needs to buy into the principles.  If the leadership does not apply the principles of the code, it is futile.</p></speech>

It is hard to challenge somebody, however, who sits around the table day in, day out, and is part of the decision-making process.</p><p>Governance is an issue.  There is no leadership there.  What can we do to ensure we have greater influence and control regarding this area?  </p><p> It was stated that the 2015 Act allowed Sport Ireland to conduct a wider audit in 2016 because it widened the scope.  I still come back to the fact that in the high-level review, the following areas were looked into and the statement from Sport Ireland failed to explicitly state that corporate governance was looked into as part of the 2015 Act.  I think that is wrong.  I think it should have been looked into.  </p><p> When someone asked about more frequent audits, Mr. Mulvey said Sport Ireland wishes the money to be spent on sports - sports participation and promotion.  That is very important.  I looked at the 2017 annual report published by Sport Ireland.  It showed that at 31 December 2017, almost &euro;700,000 was spent on legal fees and conciliatory and arbitration payments.  In the year ending 31 December 2016, almost &euro;2 million of Sport Ireland's funding went on legal fees and arbitration payments.  Sport Ireland may not be able to supply that today-----</p></speech>

This is a legacy issue.  The legal expenses incurred by Sport Ireland constitute a legacy issue from a previous organisation called the National Campus Development Authority in a legal case involving the National Aquatic Centre.  That is still ongoing.  In fact, it was heard again in the High Court after the plaintiff appealed again.  It has been ongoing since 2003 and accounts for the vast bulk of that expenditure.  It is an inherited legal case that the new body took over regarding the National Sports Campus.  It goes back to 2003.  I brought my concerns to the attention of four successive Ministers.  My concerns were about the continuation of this case and what it was costing and my concern that Sport Ireland should not be obliged to fund this and that it should be funded by the Exchequer directly from the Department because we never authored or brought this case.  It is one of these legacy cases.  I must be careful as it is still being heard in the High Court but that is where that arises.</p></speech>

I have no problem in doing so.<br/><br/>Regarding the second issue relating to corporate governance, we need to be clear.  The chief executive said that we are not a regulatory authority.  We are not the Charities Regulator, which lays down and will expect a code.  The Companies Act 2014 lays down criteria for governance for companies regarding how they should be run.  If there is a problem with the corporate governance of a company, and some sporting organisations are companies, it is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement that has the regulatory and investigative function.  It is not in the Act.  Policy may change on this and it might be a matter for the committee or Minister to change this.  What I do not want to do is get into a situation where Sport Ireland spends all of its money that is supposedly devoted to the promotion of sports nationally and internationally on legal matters and is in and out of the courts regarding the enforcement of bodies where other bodies have the regulatory authority to enforce but may not be doing so.  One of the things that has amazed me in all of this concerns where the auditors were.  If the auditors did not spot this and it was not reported to them, is the appellate body or investigative body of Chartered Accountants Ireland, which has regulatory powers, going to call in the auditors?  We have seen this in corporate Ireland for an awful long time.  I read an article the other day in the <i>Irish Independent</i>from somebody who sat on the Anglo Irish Bank board telling us we had light regulation.  He happened to be chairman of the audit and risk committee in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008.  We are paying &euro;29 billion for that lack of oversight and he has the absolute cheek to write in a national newspaper-----  </p></speech>

It probably suits some of the politicians here to blame Sport Ireland when questions could have been asked by politicians over the years along with successive Ministers for sport.  The witnesses from Sport Ireland state that it does not impose governance and that it must be bought into but it has not been bought into in the case of the FAI.  The witnesses would agree with that.  The only sanction Sport Ireland has is the withholding or withdrawal of grant.</p></speech>

We have a process to go through.  All of these things need to be discussed by the board itself so there is a process.  The Deputy rightly identified the major issue here, which is around the staff employed by the FAI in terms of the funding.  It is a critical issue but it is also the investment in those programmes over a long period of time because we have invested significantly in these programmes, which are very effective.

That is the market they are in at any given time.  The team that was in place was very expensive.  I am not quite sure about the team in place now but it is not as expensive.  That is a matter for the FAI.  We do not ever get into that territory with it.  It has to respond to the marketplace and that is what it does.  If we want a quality manager, we have to pay for a quality manager.  The Deputy would be better off putting that question directly to the FAI next week.</p></speech>

I am aware that several councils such as Fingal County Council, which is my local council, have introduced pitch fees which are crippling for many local grassroots teams.  Sport Ireland is pumping a certain amount of money in but there is a big hole at the other end of the boat.  Would Mr. Treacy not have thought of at least asking some questions about that?</p></speech>

Programmes are run by all the organisations.  In every sport, parents pay affiliation fees and pay for time in swimming pools, on pitches and so forth.  It is the normal course of sporting organisations running their business.  Sports do that an ongoing basis.  We have all had children playing rugby or soccer or whatever and paying their fees weekly.  That is just the way sport is organised.</p></speech>

As Mr. Treacy knows, the women's soccer team had to threaten strike action because of the treatment it was suffering, with shoddy tracksuits, equipment, etc., and lack of status.  In 2017, Sport Ireland paid &euro;1.6 million to the Gaelic Players Association, GPA, men and &euro;500,000 to the GPA, women, but it gave only &euro;145,000 to women in soccer that year, which is a lot less than it gave the Gaelic players.  It then gave the team special funding of &euro;195,000 following protests by the players.  Should Sport Ireland have been monitoring that situation more?  Participation of women in sport should be one of its goals.</p></speech>

Our view in Sport Ireland is that is not really the best mechanism because either particular sports or individual organisations within sports are singled out.  In that context, our view has been, and we have put this to successive Ministers, that we would prefer, particularly in the area of women in sport, that a fund is given to Sport Ireland and we make the decisions when and where it is appropriate to do so.  We have continued to make that point.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that we know on the ground.  The GAA is sometimes different in this regard.  When we have international teams in cricket, rugby, the FAI, basketball or hockey, the women have an equal right with the male team to participate.  We felt that singling out women's participation in particular sports was discriminatory, that the fund should be given to Sport Ireland and that we would receive applications from the national governing bodies, NGBs, in the context largely of the international representation, apart from our indigenous games, and decide that there was a case there.  That is our view still.  This year, the Government took a step in that direction by giving us &euro;2 million for women and we have allocated that in response to the applications we got from the NGBs.  That is the way forward, rather than specifically in a one or two year budget giving it to a particular programme.</p> <p>  When the dispute broke out on the women's FAI international team I was very conscious of dispute resolution.  We appointed Peter McLoone, the former president of congress and the general secretary of IMPACT at the time, as a mediator.  He mediated a settlement but from my discussions, I do not believe all commitments made arising from that mediation have been fulfilled to date.  It is something we still have to address.</p></speech>

I talked only this morning to Peter McLoone about where he feels it is and I have to meet him to talk about it.  My view throughout my career has been that if people make a deal and a settlement, they should honour it because otherwise their word will not be accepted the next time they come to it.  I assure the Deputy that we are actively considering this to ensure that all our women's teams, in all sporting disciplines, who have an international commitment are adequately funded, as best they can, with their funds.</p></speech>

No questions may arise but there are also investigative authorities.  If there is corporate malfeasance - I am not suggesting there is as I do not know - the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is the office the State has funded and assigned and given a lot of resources to undertake that duty.</p></speech>

It is a totally different mindset and way.  I know this from different matters, including aviation and the Commission for Aviation Regulation and so on.  The witnesses are right.  I fully accept that and it is important to make that distinction or draw that line in the sand.  That is not the role of Sport Ireland, nor do I think it should be.</p> <p>  From my perspective, there is a significant level of integrity, openness and calling it as it is in Sport Ireland and the people involved in it.  It is important to state that and I appreciate that.  Overall, the organisation is doing a very fine job, it is very genuine and committed.  There is a separation between Sport Ireland and the governing bodies.  The latter have a particular role, particularly when they are companies limited by guarantee, as is the case with the FAI.  From memory, the FAI got a clean audit from a very reputable firm in 2017, which was the year for which accounts were most recently lodged in the Companies Office.</p><p>My understanding is that that loan was provided in May and was repaid in July or August.  If that was the situation, a person looking at the accounts at year end will ask two questions.  He or she would wonder whether the loan was repaid, meaning that it may not be a factor from an auditor's perspective, and would also wonder about the materiality of it.  The FAI's turnover for the year in question was just north of &euro;50 million.  Some 6% of that approximately &euro;51 million came from Sport Ireland.  It is a significant amount of money, but is not huge when compared with the overall.  Sport Ireland made a profit of approximately &euro;2.7 million, and had net total assets of around &euro;22.5 million.  If a sanction was created, perhaps by withholding the second part of the payment from the FAI, it seems that its finances are in a good enough position that it would still be well able to look after the grassroots.  I am aware that there is a process in place to deal with that, but it is ultimately a factor that makes people sit up and think, and reflect.  It is not the style of Sport Ireland, nor should it be.  <br/><br/>I had to leave for a meeting earlier, so perhaps my next question has already been answered.  Were any red flags raised around the FAI over the last couple of years?  Was there anything that gave Sport Ireland pause or reason to believe that it should look at the FAI?  Was there any sense of a domino effect?  <br/><br/>Bodies in receipt of reasonably significant State funding, from Sport Ireland or otherwise, should be compelled to have an independent board governance audit carried out.  The Institute of Directors can do that, and others do it as well.  It is not very expensive, and in my view it should be done at least once every five years.  A body which grants funds has fixed criteria when it comes to decisions to grant, but there is much more involved for organisations such as the FAI which can have a material effect on the overall benefits of the process.  I suggest there should be a wider governance code in place, not a regulatory code.  I was surprised, like Senator Feighan, that there are 575 companies listed on <i>governance.ie</i>in class A, class B or class C.  The FAI is in class C on that website, but is not included.  That would be a flag for me.  What is Mr. Treacy's opinion on that? </p></speech>

It writes a statement to Sport Ireland to say that the money that we provided to it was expended for the purposes for which it was given.  Sport Ireland in turn sends our own independent auditors.  We have used three different companies to audit the FAI over the last number of years, all of which have come back with a clean audit and essentially confirmed that the money we provided to it was expended for the purposes for which it was given.  This is how we audit the funding we provide.</p> <p>  In terms of red flags, we had a long discussion here around salaries and the recent report.  These are serious issues which have only recently arisen.  We have written to the FAI about these things, and received another reply today which was not comprehensive.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.1227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#AA00800"><p>We undertake that kind of assessment at the moment in our learning and development programmes.  One of the issues about sporting organisations at the moment, given the proliferation in size, income stream and participation is that it is a wide church.  However, there are principles that should apply irrespective of size.  The Senator is quite right to say that there should be good, robust internal governance, meaning that people who have nothing to do with the organisation who have legal financial, marketing or commercial expertise should be brought on board.  The problem with some sporting organisations is that they are transitioning from self-regulated volunteer organisations made up of people who have participated in the sport over a long period of time or who are parents with children involved with the sport.  We must now move beyond that approach.  We are moving into bigger financial and participation spaces.  We also have to consider not just issues of good governance but child safety, child protection, health and safety and vetting.  We have undertaken and discharged all of these functions.  We also have to maintain professional input at executive and high-performance level, without leaving out volunteers, who we need in sports every day of the week, or tell them that they are not good enough to be on a board.  The Special Olympics, Paralympics and the Community Games cannot survive without volunteers, and we have to be careful not to exclude them from the centre of policy decision making.  They are vitally important, and they should be allied with the experts in terms of governance.</p> <p>  Ireland is struggling with corporate governance generally.  The charity sector has had very bad experiences in that area.  The sports sector has not, thankfully, had many problems with corporate governance, but other areas where State agencies have had to come into the private sector.  We are moving on and are grappling with the issue of corporate governance.  We are not the only country in the world having difficulties with this.  This is a moving part here, and we have to get to the stage where we are confident that the rules, laws, regulations and statutory instruments and the voluntary codes are adhered to, not just in spirit but in reality.  That is an educational and supervisory exercise.  One size does not fit all, but Sport Ireland calls different organisations in to make presentations about their policies and plans.  It is incumbent on Mr. Treacy, myself and other members of the board that we meet the chief executives, the high performance directors and the volunteers and go to their functions and events.  It is not all about attending at international competitions.  We have to be there in order to talk to them, to present their awards, to assist them in giving the kind of policy direction they require, and to thank and congratulate them for what they do and on their great achievements.  The story of Irish sport is extraordinary.  As Mr. Treacy said earlier, last year we won more medals internationally than ever before in a multiplicity of sports.  We are not just talking about boxing any more, but sports that many of us have never heard of.  Our Special Olympians acquit themselves extraordinarily well.  They are ambassadors, as are the Paralympians.</p><p>We will have Olympians going to Tokyo.  We hope to have the biggest team ever but we have to make sure they are nurtured, minded, supported and funded.  Behind all of those teams are boards, high performance people and development officers.  We have a series of local sports partnerships the length and breadth of the country.  I refer to the amount of work they do.  We also do dormant funding, which the members, as a committee, and the Government have gladly given to us.  In that regard, because of my work in Dublin's inner city I saw women playing soccer last night under floodlights in Sheriff Street.  That is what we need to do.  We have to make sure that happens across the country, that they have the best of facilities and that they can get as much as we can provide.</p><p> We have had ten lean years of funding for sport.  Thankfully, that changed last year, and I hope it will change further.  Our athletes need it.  I refer to what Deputy Coppinger said.  I do not believe people who use pitches should be asked for fees.  They are supplied by the State and councils.</p></speech>

The only way we will bring sport to the level to which it should be brought is to move on all fronts, and incidents like this set us back.</p></speech>

For example, Sport Ireland would want to know what will be its pot of funding.  When the likes of the FAI makes a submission for the coming year on grant aid funding, how far above or below the amount requested would it be allocated?  Before the budget each year, everybody has their hands open looking for millions of euro.  For example, the health service would be hoping to get more money than what is announced on budget day.  Are organisations fairly good in regard to their requests for funding to keep the show going?  For example, last year Sport Ireland gave them &euro;2.7 million, give or take.  Did they look for &euro;3.5 million?  Do they go way above the figure they believe they will get in their requests or are they understanding of the position on funding?</p></speech>

They are very strong in their advocacy around that.  They do it through their submissions to Sport Ireland, and our submission to the Government, but they also go in and meet the Ministers.  That is the way things are done.  When Sport Ireland went to meet the Ministers on this issue we also had a good hearing with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for sport.  We also met members of the Opposition who gave us a good hearing.  I felt for the first time that we were beginning to make substantive inroads in increasing funds for sports all round.  Sports organisations, particularly those involved in the main field sports, are great advocates for their sport but they have a lot of clout outside Sport Ireland as well.</p></speech>

I want to pay tribute to the colleagues in the Department because civil servants have worked hard to ensure they made the case for sports funding across the various Departments, along with the Ministers.  Everyone has bought into this and everyone is aligned in terms of the need for and importance of funding for sport.  It is important to state that we are all aligned in terms of the requirement to increase the budget for sport and I pay tribute to Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas and civil servants who have worked hard to make that happen.</p></speech>

That might be something we would come back to, possibly tomorrow.</p> <p>  Regarding the loan, one of the issues I would ask Sport Ireland to examine is that the loan was given at a particular time of the year and we were then told it was paid following the submission of an invoice.  An invoice is for a service as opposed to a loan.  When it is considering its response Sport Ireland might consider that particular issue, which stood out to me as being fairly strange.</p><p> The other aspect I want to cover is included in Mr. Treacy's opening statement.  The 2016 audit identified a number of things, including the board and committee structure, financial management, whistleblowing and a code of conduct.  I refer, in particular, to whistleblowing or the lack of it.  Many people have spoken to me in recent months about the FAI and one recurring issue is that people believe they might suffer consequences if they raise issues.  An individual club might lose out on a grant or people who are or were employed in the FAI might be affected.  Does Sport Ireland engage with the FAI on such issues?  Can people in any sports organisation make whistleblowing complaints to Sport Ireland?  I am talking about people who work in an organisation.</p></speech>

It should be set out clearly in order that people with a complaint know exactly where to go.  Ours is not a central body for sports organisations.  That is not our role.</p></speech>

Our internal auditors look for the existence of whistleblowing policies when they audit governing bodies of sport or a local sports partnership as part of our internal audit programme.  It will occasionally be found that a whistleblowing policy is not in place.  The audit will then recommend that one be instituted.  Implementation of that recommendation will be monitored by the Sport Ireland executive.</p></speech>

Would it be brought to the attention of Sport Ireland?  Should it be something that should be brought to its attention?  I am referring to the FAI or any other organisation.</p></speech>

I will move back to the issue of staff turnover at a high level and the impact on an organisation's functioning.  I read a newspaper article in which it was mentioned that people were complaining about things like internal relationships, not being able to talk to the same person repeatedly, the lack of continuity, etc.  Would Sport Ireland enter into dialogue with an organisation on a high staff turnover and its impact on the health of the association?  The turnover in the FAI does seem to be extraordinarily high, among senior people in particular.</p></speech>

Some of the staff we know of would have ended up in key posts with other sports organisations.  There might be a mix between people who are dissatisfied with the way they were treated or with their pay and others who are seeking promotion.  However, it is a high turnover.</p></speech>

There have been issues in other sports organisations in the past.  They include most recently the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, Basketball Ireland and Swim Ireland, all of which have had their funding cut at some stage.  It might be better to say funding was suspended or that there was at least a threat that it would happen.  I may be wrong, but a consistent approach is not taken in dealing with different sports bodies.  If that is the case, is it not sending the wrong message?  Let us examine the manner in which the FAI has treated Sport Ireland in the last fortnight.  I am referring to the letters sent, the decision made without consultation on the new position created, the original letter which did not answer the question posed by Sport Ireland and the most recent letter which arrived at the eleventh hour.  The FAI is not responding satisfactorily to the concerns of Sport Ireland and the requests made.  That has been confirmed by Sport Ireland today.  There is an inconsistency in the approach being taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.1274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#CC02200"><p>That is a little unfair.  There is a process to be gone through when we get to the point of pulling the trigger on suspending or withholding funding.  We have asked questions and not received answers.  I agree with the Deputy.  What we have received today is totally inadequate and we will be writing to the FAI along those lines tomorrow.  The board of Sport Ireland makes those decisions.  We are due to meet next week when all of these things will be considered.  However, we need to go through a process and it is only fair that we do so.</p></speech>

He also refers to recent commentary on rental payments.  It may not be Sports Ireland's responsibility <i>per se</i>, but there is great concern when we read stories about our international women's football team having to change in airport toilets and share tracksuits.  Sport Ireland made a special once-off payment of &euro;195,000 in 2018 for the women's international team.  It might not have direct responsibility for rental and contractual arrangements, but there is concern that such allocations are diverting necessary funding.  I refer to the FAI relying more on Sport Ireland rather than ensuring its funding is put to better use.</p></speech>

There should be transparency around all of those issues.  In regard to the funding of organisations, Sport Ireland contributes &euro;1 and the FAI contributes &euro;4.  Transparency in respect of CEO salary, rental agreements and so on, such that everybody can see it, is good corporate governance.</p></speech>

We all acknowledge those achievements but we are here today to try to get to the bottom of issues and to consider how we can improve further.  It was stated that the sporting organisations have come a long way.  However, there have been many scandals and issues arising in our sporting bodies over the last number of years.  Despite that, there are still governance issues in some bodies.  It appears that even when one body is caught, others fail to take note that they are being watched or to take action to get their act together.  </p> <p>  Sport Ireland has an audit and risk committee which, according to the report, comprises two board members and two independent members.  The role of the audit and risk committee is to support the board in its responsibilities around risk, control, governance and associated assurance.  According to the report, the committee also has a role in respect of governance.  In regard to the two independent members, am I correct that one is a former board member of Sport Ireland and the other is an official of the Department of Justice and Equality?  </p></speech>

As well as that, the audit and risk committee reviews its effectiveness on an annual basis.  Previous reviews would have identified gaps and those gaps have been filled, as appropriate.

There is a real alignment between Sport Ireland, the institute of sport, and the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  We are all on the same team now.  We are all wearing the same jersey, which is really good news.  There is real leadership coming from the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  Importantly for us, it is now making inroads with the corporate sector and getting sponsors on board.  It is very good news.  As I said earlier, it is about leadership and the federation is showing great leadership.</p></speech>

We have co-operated around the arrangements for Tokyo, the camp and the joint engagement on that.  Things are looking well.  Last week, the federation announced its kit sponsor, Adidas.  Things are moving in the right direction.  We now have to make sure we have the athletes.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland was not informed of the loan by the FAI.  Mr. Treacy said in his opening statement that Sport Ireland's financial controller raised a query with the FAI in regard to its liquidity in 2017 as part of the mid-year review.  Not only did the FAI not inform Sport Ireland of the extraordinary loan, it actively concealed it.  Would Mr. Treacy agree?</p></speech>

Any time we heard the organisation's name in the past was in controversial circumstances so it is nice to hear that things are going well for it.</p> <p>  The FAI had a liquidity problem and occasional problems with finances.  Is it the same in other federations, say, the Football Association of Wales or the Football Association in England?  I know the FAI had a big building project and I understand the national team did not qualify for major tournaments but that should not have been an issue because of sponsorship and given that Ireland had been qualifying for tournaments for nearly 30 years.  Is it an issue for most football associations?</p></speech>

It has debt relating to the Aviva Stadium on which it must make repayments, which is a big issue.  The FAI can run into cash flow problems and issues if they have no matches or do not qualify for a tournament and things like that.  It is on occasions like that it arises.</p> <p>  Many of our governing bodies work on a tight budget.  They do not have commercial incomes or gate receipts and, to a large degree, depend heavily on funding.  They are always tight on funding.  We have been encouraging all of them, if they have a debt in a given year, to start reducing it because one does not want it building up and, in fact, we try to encourage the NGBs to have a little bit in reserve going into every year.  That is the model for the future.</p></speech>

It is astounding after the association was so financially successful.  I cannot get it, as an accountant.</p></speech>

The integrity of their work and commitment to sport is clear to everybody.  The weakness of the law is also exceptionally clear.  As a State, a Government and an Oireachtas, we must ensure greater accountability from bodies such as the FAI if the legislation is not strong enough to provide the answers we want.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again tomorrow morning and should meet the representatives of Sport Ireland again soon.  Perhaps they could reflect on, in the meantime, and advise us what best practice is on the issues that have been raised.  We need to address that to have greater power and authority, whether that will lie with Sport Ireland, the charity regulator or whatever body is appropriate.  We need to ensure all these issues can be fully and properly addressed.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members.  I know people might have been unhappy with some of my timelines but, as an Oireachtas committee, we conducted this debate fairly, objectively, appropriately and within all the rules and regulations by which we must abide.  The truth and facts that have come out here today are important and will influence policymakers, politicians and, most of all, the court of public opinion.  The public is interested in all of these issues and I look forward to continuing our discussion with Sport Ireland in the future.</p></speech>
