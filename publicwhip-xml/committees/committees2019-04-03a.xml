The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Further Revised Estimates for 2019 for the Department of Rural and Community Development which amounts to &euro;260,282,000.  It is an opportunity for the committee to make the process more transparent and engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  The programme-based structure of the Estimate is intended to assist the committee in focusing on what the Department has committed to achieving in actual outputs and outcomes, considering whether the performance targets included in the Estimate are sufficiently descriptive of the services provided by the Department and whether they strike the right balance in meeting the needs of society, and considering if the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether the allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.  I propose to proceed programme by programme and subhead by subhead.  At the outset of our consideration of each programme I will ask the Minister or the Minister of State to give a high-level overview of it, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance and related expenditure in 2019.  Having discussed the main subheads within a programme, members may wish to raise issues related to other subheads within the programme before moving on to the next one.  This approach will assist them in their consideration of the Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  It is proposed to publish on the committee's website the opening statements and briefing documents supplied by the Department.  This will be an invaluable aid for citizens in monitoring the Department's performance.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State at the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Canney.  I also extend a warm welcome to the officials accompanying them.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#B00500"><p>I thank the select committee for its invitation to attend the discussion on the Further Revised Estimate for my Department for 2019.  A short briefing note has been circulated to members.  It provides a summary of the programme areas in the Department and sets out the planned expenditure in 2019 across the programme areas.</p> <p>  Before highlighting some of the details of expenditure in 2019, I will mention briefly the performance of the Department in 2018.  Last year was its first full year of operation.  While there were many challenges in establishing it, the allocation provided for me in 2018 was almost fully utilised.  In total, &euro;236.8 million was spent of an allocation of &euro;238.5 million.  As such, 99.3% of our allocation was spent, with the unspent money related mainly to savings on salary and administration costs.  In real terms, this means that we have delivered for communities and rural areas through a wide range of programmes and projects.  I am determined that we will continue this progress in 2019 and that the budget allocation provided for the Department will be put to best use to continue to support communities across the country.</p> <p>  I will mention briefly the importance of my Department's mission for the Government and citizens.  Rural Ireland plays a vital role in the economic and social fabric of the country.  Our sense of community across Ireland is what makes the country what it is.  The establishment of my Department was an important step in strengthening Government support for this area.  Project Ireland 2040 has built further on that support.  It recognises the economic and social importance of rural Ireland and the critical role of communities in ensuring a good quality of life for all.  Strengthening rural economies and communities is one of the core objectives of Project Ireland 2040 and the provision of &euro;1 billion through the rural regeneration and development fund ensures that funding will be available to deliver on that objective in the coming years.</p> <p>  On the allocations to the Department, gross expenditure of &euro;291 million is budgeted for in 2019.  This represents an increase of &euro;60 million, or 26%, on the 2018 provision.  The &euro;291 million budget consists of &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;138 million in capital expenditure.  In terms of the split across programmes, &euro;138 million has been allocated for expenditure on rural development programmes, &euro;148 million has been allocated for expenditure on community development programmes, while &euro;4.6 million has been provided for the Charities Regulator.</p> <p>  The &euro;138 million allocation for rural development programmes consists of &euro;123 million in capital expenditure and &euro;15 million in current expenditure.  I have allocated &euro;52 million for the rural regeneration and development fund this year.  The aim of the fund is to support ambitious projects that can drive the economic and social development of rural towns, villages and their surrounding areas.  The first call for applications took place in July 2018 and 280 applications were received.  Following the assessment process, 84 successful projects have been allocated &euro;86 million in funding.  It will be leveraged with a further &euro;31 million in matching funding, representing a total of &euro;117 million in capital investment across rural Ireland.</p> <p>  It is vital that we continue to build resilience in rural communities and make towns and villages vibrant places for families to live.  It is also particularly appropriate, with Brexit approaching, that we continue to strengthen the rural economy and support sustainable development.  The projects being funded are targeted at sectors in which they can have the greatest economic and social impact.  For example, &euro;13.6 million will be invested in the national mountain biking project which will develop recreational facilities in four locations across seven counties.  In addition, &euro;5.5 million will be invested in Athenry to assist in developing the town into a major food and tourism centre.  Investments such as these will transform many rural towns, villages and outlying areas by delivering projects in sectors such as tourism, agrifood and recreation.  I expect a second call for applications under the rural regeneration and development fund to be launched later this year.  While the fund is important for the future development of rural Ireland, I also remain focused on ensuring the continued success of existing rural schemes and programmes.  It is important that the funding schemes and programmes provide for a coherent approach to supporting rural Ireland and communities.  As well as focusing on large-scale projects through the fund, we will continue to support smaller projects and groups throughout Ireland.  Such projects can have a major impact for local areas and communities.</p> <p>  For 2019, I have allocated &euro;30 million in capital funding for the LEADER programme.  As I have noted for the committee previously, the LEADER programme is demand-led, with the level of funding required dependent on the number of projects that have moved through the approval process.  The allocation provided in 2019 is based on the level of activity in 2018, which was lower than originally planned.  However, there has recently been an increase in activity.  There are now 1,800 projects approved for funding by local action groups, LAGS, to a value of more than &euro;62 million.  There are another 377 projects going through the approval process, with a value of &euro;23.4 million.  This progress is to be welcomed and demonstrates that the changes I have made to the scheme are working.  The programme is now delivering for rural communities and I will be closely monitoring developments in the coming months to ensure this progress is maintained.</p> <p>  The other key rural development allocations in 2019 are &euro;20.3 million for national rural development schemes, &euro;15 million for the town and village renewal scheme and &euro;10 million for the local improvement scheme, LIS.  The allocation for national rural development schemes comprises &euro;5.3 million in current funding and &euro;15 million in capital funding.  The capital allocation will ensure continued investment in the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and CL&Aacute;R.  I expect approximately 180 new outdoor recreation projects to be funded in 2019.  The current allocation for national rural development schemes has increased by &euro;2 million.  The additional funding will be used to double the funding for the walks scheme.  This is welcome and recognises the contribution landowners make to local tourism by facilitating safe access to well maintained walking trails on their lands.</p><p> The town and village renewal scheme is an important part of the Government's work to rejuvenate rural Ireland.  It is having a significant impact on towns and villages across the country.  The benefits of previous funding under the scheme are being felt nationwide.  Since it was introduced in the second half of 2016, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country.  I expect the 2019 allocation of &euro;15 million to support over 200 new town and village renewal projects.  </p><p> As Deputies will be aware, the local improvement scheme supports investment in non-public rural roads to enable people to access their homes and farms.  The 2019 allocation of &euro;10 million will bring to over &euro;47 million the amount invested in this programme area since I reintroduced the scheme in September 2017.</p><p> The allocation of &euro;148 million for community development programmes comprises &euro;133 million in current expenditure and &euro;15 million in capital expenditure.  As the committee is aware, the Department administers a range of programmes which support individuals and the community and voluntary sector as a whole.  The two most significant community development programmes in terms of expenditure are the community services programme, CSP, and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.</p><p> The CSP provides financial support for community organisations to deliver local services through a social enterprise model.  The funding supports the cost of employing a manager or a specific number of full-time equivalents.  The  Futher Revised Estimate contains a provision of &euro;46 million for the CSP.  This will ensure it will continue to benefit over 400 organisations nationwide.  Over 1,900 people are supported by the programme.  A few weeks ago I announced an independent review of the CSP which seeks to ensure the programme will continue to provide the best possible support for individuals, communities and organisations across the country.</p><p> SICAP provides funding to help individuals and communities in society that are experiencing disadvantage, including disadvantaged women, disadvantaged children and families, lone parents, people with disabilities, people who have difficulties in finding employment, members of the Roma community and Travellers.  This is the second year of the new SICAP which places a greater focus on more intensive individual support and emphasises flexibility to respond to the needs of target groups at local level.  The 2019 proposed allocation of &euro;43 million will ensure SICAP can continue to support over 2,200 organisations and 27,000 individuals.</p><p> The 2019 Further Revised Estimate provides &euro;12.6 million in supports for the community and voluntary sector.  This maintains the 2018 funding level.  Funding will continue to be provided for national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, the senior alert scheme and supports for volunteering.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, will provide further detail in his opening statement.</p><p> The Further Revised Estimate includes an allocation of &euro;7.2 million for the development of libraries, up from &euro;3.9 million in 2018.  The increase reflects the importance of libraries in communities and their increased role as civic spaces and places where everyone can access technology.</p><p> The 2019 allocation for the community enhancement programme is &euro;4 million.  This will allow for additional investment to enhance community facilities in disadvantaged areas where small-scale investment can make a significant difference to communities and community groups.  The cross-Border PEACE programme has had its allocation increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2018 to &euro;5 million in 2019.  It is important that we continue to support this programme, particularly in the context of Brexit.</p><p> I have kept my remarks brief to allow a full discussion on the programmes and funding of the Department of Rural and Community Development this year.  I emphasise the good progress made by the Department in 2018 across the rural and community development areas.  The increased allocation in 2019 presents a major opportunity to support rural Ireland and communities across the country.  I am determined to keep up the momentum, to ensure we will get the most out of the allocation provided and to deliver benefits for all communities.  I will be happy to answer questions.  Before I do so, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to speak briefly about the areas within his remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#C00200"><p>I am pleased to join the committee in considering the 2019 Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Rural and Community Development.  My responsibilities include oversight of the work of the Western Development Commission, functions related to the Department's input in regional development and rural broadband provision, oversight of a number of the funding schemes under the community programme, functions related to the Dormant Accounts Fund and oversight of the Charities Regulator.  As the Minister, Deputy Ring, mentioned, Project Ireland 2040 places strong emphasis on balanced regional development which is essential if the country is to grow in a more sustainable way.  I believe the Department has a strong role to play in ensuring these objectives are achieved.</p> <p>  The Western Development Commission has an important role in supporting development in the western region.  It actively and successfully promotes the region as a great place in which to live, work and run a business.  It manages the &euro;32 million western investment fund which provides loan capital for small and medium-sized enterprises in the region.  The Further Revised Estimate for 2019 will see the commission's funding increase from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million.  This will allow it to increase the impact of the western investment fund and enhance its contribution to the work of developing the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC.  The AEC initiative aims to build an offering of scale along the west coast to drive economic development along the entire area.  It is about getting all regions, local authority areas and communities along the western seaboard to work together to build on the region's strengths and attract investment to it as a whole.  </p> <p>  In addition to the increased funding for the Western Development Commission, funding of &euro;30,000 is being made available in 2019 to each of the ten local authorities along the AEC to co-fund an AEC officer in each local authority.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#C00400"><p>The Atlantic economic corridor.  The collaborative work of the Department, the Western Development Commission and the local authorities will ensure there is a much enhanced resource working on the AEC project and that there is a co-ordinated approach to its development.</p> <p>  With regard to rural broadband provision and mobile phone coverage, the role of the Department is to support the local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  This involves officials working closely with the local authorities to identify and mitigate barriers that may delay roll-out.  In 2019 the Department will provide &euro;42,000 for each local authority to support a broadband officer whose role will be to facilitate the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure.  This essential role has been recognised by industry sources as having a transformative impact on their relationships with the local authorities and central government.</p> <p>  The Department has lead responsibility for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector and setting the policy framework in this area.  Some &euro;12.6 million is budgeted for in 2019 to provide supports for the community and voluntary sector, including approximately &euro;6.5 million for the scheme to support national organisations, &euro;2.3 million for the senior alerts scheme and &euro;3.2 million to support volunteering and a network of 21 volunteer centres throughout the country.  This funding will have a positive impact across the country.  It will support organisations and people who make an enormous contribution to furthering social and community development throughout the country.</p> <p>  The ongoing development of public participation networks, PPNs, is continuing.  The allocation for this area has been increased from &euro;1.55 million last year to &euro;1.75 million this year.  It will allow the Department to make an increased allocation available to each PPN, with matching funding of at least &euro;30,000 from the relevant local authority.  The Department has continued to provide practical support to underpin the PPNs, including the publication of a PPN user guide to support all PPN stakeholders - member organisations, secretariats, resource workers and local authorities - in making progress with a nationally consistent framework for PPNs.</p> <p>  The 2019 allocation for the Dormant Accounts Fund is &euro;12.57 million, which represents an increase of &euro;2 million on the 2018 allocation.  In line with the Dormant Accounts Acts, this funding must be used to address social, economic or educational disadvantage or support people with a disability.  In 2019 funding is earmarked for a number of projects which will address disadvantage across the country.  Social Innovation Fund Ireland is being allocated up to &euro;5 million to continue its excellent work.  The senior alerts scheme is being allocated up to &euro;2 million to supplement its funding and meet the level of demand for the scheme.  Up to &euro;2 million is being provided for capital supports for social enterprise.  Up to &euro;1.2 million is being provided to establish permanent volunteer centres in areas which do not have them.  Up to &euro;1 million is being used to support employment along the Atlantic economic corridor.</p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate provides &euro;4.6 million in funding for the Charities Regulatory Authority in 2019.</p><p>The Charities Regulator is Ireland's national statutory regulator for charitable organisations.  The general function of the regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland, in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration.  By the end of 2018, there were 9,799 charities registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority.  During 2019, the Charities Regulatory Authority will publish its second strategy statement and, in particular, develop and publish guidance to assist charities in implementing the charities code of governance.</p><p> I am delighted to be working with the Minister, Deputy Ring, in progressing our remit of supporting rural and community development, contributing to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and supporting the well-being of our communities.  I am committed to ensuring that the funding being provided to the Department supports these goals and delivers for people and communities throughout the country.  I am happy to answer any questions that committee members might have.</p></speech>

In most cases, their budget has been very well spent and helps in rural Ireland.  I will give some feedback.  I do not want to seem in any way negative as there are a great deal of positive aspects to this, which we should acknowledge.  However, there are some areas of concern that I would like the Minister to consider.</p> <p>  Some &euro;2 million in funding was provided for walkways last year and it is hoped to provide &euro;4 million this year.  I come from a very picturesque area in west Cork which was probably the first to start walkways when James O'Mahony and his team did some incredible work on the Sheep's Head Way.  I imagine when they spoke to the farmers about walkways at the time, they were looked at as if they had two heads.  However, walkways have grown and developed and we now have the Beara Way and many other successes throughout the country.  There is a considerable amount of funding available for gates, stiles and steps but the impression I get is that there is no funding extended to farmers.  There is great potential for a Mizen way and many farmers have voluntarily given access to their lands.  They receive initial funds for stiles, probably from the &euro;2 million provided, there is no long-term funding to make payments to farmers for allowing people to go through their lands.  Such payments could be used to maintain the land.  It is important that this be addressed for the sake of tourism and generating a small bit of an income because many smaller farmers are struggling.  I would appreciate if, for 2019, the Minister would look into compensating farmers all year around.  This would not require a large amount of money but it is necessary to the farmers, some of whom are giving access to their lands free of charge, having been given an initial grant.  They should be rewarded, which would encourage others to come on board and be positive for tourism in these communities in the long term.</p> <p>  The Minister brought community involvement scheme back from nowhere.  No matter how much money he has, it is never enough.  I expect Cork County Council has an endless list of people looking for schemes.  The funding for the community involvement scheme should be increased because it is greatly appreciated in rural communities.  Some council areas might have funding for only one or two schemes when they may have a list of 50 schemes.  Money cannot be got for everything but it is great that the scheme has started again.</p> <p>  I was a fierce advocate of the previous LEADER scheme.  I always took the view that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but somebody tried to fix it and it still broke.  That is the impression that I have received from communities.  Many people are finding the application process very difficult.  I was involved in community groups over the years and went through the previous application process.  There would have been somebody there at the other end of the phone, at least, but that system has gone.  I was told by someone who secured funding recently that they would never submit an application to LEADER.  It is bad when one hears community people saying that.  In another case, an application was returned requesting further information.  I do not know how many pages had to be filled in with further information.  It is an exhaustive process which is difficult for people who are giving of their time freely.  I know that everything has to be checked out to ensure it is 100% correct but more administrative staff are needed to help people.  Since the LEADER company closed in west Cork, there is nobody available to help.  The sense I get is that the funding has come back but accessing it is not as easy as it used to be.  I ask the Minister to examine this because it is very serious.  In the past, when I mentioned funding to people in west Cork, the LEADER programme was the first thing that came to mind but it is not the last.  No one discusses LEADER any longer whereas it used to be a hot topic.  The funding provided is not as good as it used to be.  The programme helped get many farm and tourism businesses up and running but that seems to be gone by the wayside.  This area requires a strong focus.</p> <p>  I do not want to hog the time but if we cover everything together, we can get through this much quicker.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, spoke about funding for broadband and mobile phone coverage but it is not going anywhere.  It is difficult to see where it will go.  I hope an announcement on rural broadband is imminent but mobile phone coverage has not been touched on.   We hit the doorsteps canvassing in elections and now that I am out now canvassing for my brother, Councillor Danny Collins, people are asking me the same question they asked during the general election campaign.  They say there is no broadband and no mobile phone coverage and ask me what I have done about it.  I have no answer for them and it is three years on from the general election.  This is a serious issue and the mobile phone companies need to be brought to the table or perhaps brought before the committee to discuss why they cannot tackle the issue.  They are running around after 5G now but, good God, some people cannot even get one bar of coverage.  This must be pulled back.  There must be some regulation to say to these companies that they can forget about their 5G and that they should go away and deliver a couple of bars of mobile phone coverage for people in their houses or communities.  That would be a great start and we could worry about 4G, 5G or 6G after that.  There is not much point in bringing up broadband now.</p> <p>  I have been involved in a community alert group in west Cork for the past 26 or 27 years.  There is funding available for aid calls but little funding for the groups.  We did a church collection in Schull and Lowertown last week and we raised &euro;450.</p><p>We have to pay for the insurance and the affiliation of Muintir na T&iacute;re.  There needs to be something more.  While some of it is covered now with grant aid in fairness, there needs to be more concentration on funding going forward because groups are begging on the doorstep.  If one is involved in a school board, one is out trying to do cake sales, if one is involved in a community alert group or a community council, one must beg from the public all the time.  Community alert groups should be concentrating on attendance at their meetings, trying to deliver for people, meeting elderly people and getting the aid calls out there.  The focus should not be on worrying if they can pay the small bills that come in and that need to be paid.  There needs to be a better concentration on funds if at all possible.</p><p> We met the Charities Regulator in Leinster House some time ago in the audiovisual room.  I presume the funding that is being referred to and that can be spent might arise where elderly members of community groups have passed away, the funding is lying there and such groups may have given it back.  My argument with the regulator was that if, for instance, there was a group in County Mayo where the members have grown elderly and are unable to continue and where &euro;10,000 was left in the account, that will go back to the Charities Regulator if that community group will be inactive in the future.  That money should go back into Mayo.  Money came out of a council in west Cork and while that money went anywhere and everywhere, it has not come back to west Cork.  If this is the money the Minister is able to spend in this regard, that needs to be looked into.  If a community has had to hand back &euro;4,000 or &euro;8,000, that money should have gone back into that community, because that is where that money came from in the first place.  It should not be distributed to the Charities Regulator and perhaps spread around Dublin or wherever.</p><p> The community services programme, CSP, is a great programme and I am involved in a group that has a number of workers through the CSP.  The issue is that the material grant was taken from it a number of years ago.  Ultimately, regardless of whether a worker is with a rural social scheme or a community employment, CE, scheme, he or she will need a strimmer and will need material and it is not available.  We need concentrate more on CSP workers.  They are landed on the community group, which must then go back to the church gate collection again to buy the strimmers or pay for the fuel to strim the graveyard or whatever the workers are doing.  They might be working in the social centre and in our case, we have a halls programme.  This funding is for whatever they need to purchase.  The CSP programme is providing the wage as such but the material grants were taken from a lot of the groups, mainly the rural groups, and they are the ones finding it the hardest to survive and to keep the doors open.  I would appreciate it if the Government would go back and look at that.</p><p> The Tidy Towns groups take a great amount of pressure off local authorities, they do a lot of fabulous work and any funds they get are greatly appreciated.  Any such groups I know very much appreciate that.</p><p> I will only talk about one more matter because I do not want to be going on all night and that is the rural regeneration fund.  A large amount of money is to be given out to community voluntary groups because that is what the Taoiseach said at the launch of this programme.  I have nothing against companies like Coillte and Teagasc but I get worried when I see such companies or a number of LEADER companies applying for funding.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has its own budget of approximately &euro;360 million and these companies are getting top-ups from the rural regeneration programme.  Then I look at community voluntary groups getting zero, so there is something wrong.</p><p> There is one project I raised in the D&aacute;il in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, where a community voluntary group in Schull spent &euro;50,000 of its own money to try to get this project to the point of being what they were told would be shovel-ready.  They are being told it is shovel-ready and then are being told it is not.  It is dribbling back and forth like a game of tennis.  They do not know whether it is shovel-ready or not.  The Minister should remember one thing.  If the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a budget of approximately &euro;360 million, these groups have no budget like that.  They could never dream about such a budget but they can guarantee jobs in a town.  Every assistance should be given to them to make sure that if they have an issue, it can be resolved within a week or two of the first announcement that they did not get funding but that is not happening.  They have never been told what the problem is, unless they have been told today, and they are begging and pleading.  This project alone would have created numerous jobs in a community that is absolutely starved because rural peninsulas are starved of employment and there is no point in denying it.</p><p> The cities are doing well and a lot of people are going from the rural communities to the cities.  I am trying to say that a body such as the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a budget of approximately &euro;360 million and Coillte has a budget.  Such bodies all have their own massive budgets.  The Minister will counter that point by telling me that they are putting forward great projects but these other community voluntary groups are failing to tick the boxes and are failing to get the funding for some reason they do not know about.  They are spending their own &euro;50,000 in their own town.  There is something wrong somewhere and I would appreciate the Government trying to put it right.</p></speech>

He mostly touched on programme A in terms of the walks programme, the LEADER programme, broadband and mobile phone coverage.  He touched on the issue of text alerts.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality but the committee received representations on that issue in Dunhill, County Waterford last week and it is an issue we hope to follow up on with the community alert groups.  The Charities Regulator is under programme C.  The CSP programme is under programme B and the rural regeneration programme is under programme A.  Schull is an area of which I am very fond and the Deputy makes a good point about the rural peninsulas and the need to invest there.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Ring and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to address the various issues that have been raised in respect of programme A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#E00300"><p>I thank Deputy Michael Collins.  To be fair, he started off very positively and I could not fault anything that he said.  He has raised some of the issues that are being raised with me every single day.  He started his contribution by talking in particular about the walks scheme and he is quite correct.  I take this opportunity again and every opportunity I get to thank farmers for their co-operation around this country.  To be fair to them, we have a great community spirit in rural Ireland.  People come from all over the world and come from cities to walk the walkways around this country.  One would not walk into somebody's garden in Dublin and expect to be able to go through it and that is why the walks scheme was set up.  I have to say that farmers have been very generous and I thank them for their co-operation.</p> <p>  In the walks scheme, we have 39 trails with payments.  We have approximately 1,900 people who are getting payment from the Department.  We have spent &euro;2 million per year on it and there has been no increase or no new call in recent years.  I am glad to say to the committee that we have an extra &euro;2 million in funding this year.  It has been doubled and I have invited expressions of interest from trail committees, community groups and other similar bodies that are entitled to apply for the scheme in 2019.  I am pleased that I am opening the scheme but I also note that I will not be able to facilitate every group and every scheme.  There will be rules and regulations but at least we have doubled the fund this year and that is something with which we should be pleased.</p> <p>  The Deputy then raised the LEADER programme and again he talked about the difficulty people have in drawing down funding from it.  There are a number of reasons why that is happening.  This morning, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and other Deputies raised questions to me in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the LEADER programme.  As a Minister, I have made 31 changes to that scheme.  I have made it easier for people to make applications, I have made it easier for the groups themselves to get the paperwork back to the Department and I have made the necessary changes to the LEADER project.  To give an update on the LEADER programme, we have approximately 1,800 projects approved to the value of &euro;62.25 million.  We are already seeing a demand for the first quarter of this year.  In the first quarter of this year, we saw an increase in the approvals and the funding that has been drawn down and I have to say that at last, the LEADER programme is beginning to happen.</p><p>We all knew that it always takes a while for the LEADER programme to ramp up.  It is no different from all the other programmes.  When profiled for the first three months of this year, we see an increase in LEADER funding, which is important.  Last year, I put &euro;35 million into the programme and that is down to &euro;30 million this year.  If we need further funding, I will certainly accommodate that.  I hope we do because if so, it means that the programme is being ramped up.  I am pleased with how it is being ramped up.  The Deputy talked about the local development company providing assistance.  With regard to the rural regeneration scheme, we told groups what has happened with their application.  I put this on the record of the D&aacute;il this morning and there is no harm to doing so again.  Most projects that were shovel-ready were approved.  Many local authorities and groups made applications that made out that they were shovel-ready.  The question of rural regeneration schemes was raised with me before we even put out applications.  I have had local authorities telling Members that they were going to Part 8 and had other works to do or did not have planning permission for some projects, and yet stated that they would be ready when they were not.<br/><br/>The Department is holding workshops around the country to assist the community groups that the Deputy talks about.  One difficulty is what we call the helping hands event.  I find in many schemes that I administer that many groups have professional people to make the applications for them.  They have the funding to do that.  There are other groups that I need to target and support that are not getting the funding that they should be getting, simply because they do not have the means to make the applications.  That is why my Department is going out with Pobal to talk to and support groups, and to help them to make applications to schemes.<br/><br/>The Deputy talked about the local improvement scheme, LIS.  I opened that scheme and it is working well.  I wish I had more funding for it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said something that I did not agree with, but I do now, and have the media on my back when I do it.  I try to rationalise and give every county a certain percentage of the money.  There are counties with a greater need for local improvement schemes than other counties.  I need to start looking at that <i>pro rata</i>and giving it to counties with a bigger demand that are actually using it when they get it.  That is in places like west Cork, Mayo, Galway and Leitrim.  Leitrim is a small county which has more local improvement schemes than any other county in the country.  I need to start to look at ways and means to give it to Leitrim and counties that have more of a need for LIS.  If I have further funding between now and the end of the year, I will do that and will not listen to media asking what we are giving to each county.<br/><br/>We support the community services programme, CSP.  Some 20 new organisations entered into that programme last year.  We were supporting more than 400 community organisations.  More than 1,900 posts have been provided for that scheme but the Department is not the employer.  It is our job to support them and to give them the necessary grant aid.  Earlier this year, I found a bit of extra funding and distributed that to groups.  I let Pobal do that.  It did not even have to make an application.  It assessed the organisations that were most in need and that funding was distributed to them.<br/><br/>The rural regeneration scheme will be very good, especially for major projects in rural areas.  It will take time.  Phase 2 of that scheme is to provide funding to get projects ready.  The local authorities have complained to me for years that they make applications and do not have the funding to put much work and resources into them.  They find that they could put money into applications and then find that there is no funding for them.  In the rural regeneration scheme, we gave funding to get projects ready for application for the scheme.  That has worked well.<br/><br/>I think I have covered all the issues.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to respond about broadband.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#F00200"><p>To clarify demarcation lines on what the Department does about broadband and mobile phones, a task force called the mobile phone and broadband task force has been set up and I chair it.  The Deputy mentioned getting everybody into the room but everybody is in the room for that task force.  There are local authorities, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the ESB, telecoms industries, officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p> <p>  We have a broadband officer appointed in every local authority.  To give an example of work carried out, the motorway from Tuam to Limerick has spare infrastructure underground, including ducts and pipes, to take whatever will come in future, such as cables.  TII has retrofitted other motorways that do not have it so that it is in place.  It has spent a few million euro of its own money to do that so that is ready and all operations can use the same duct.  They will not all look for their own space.  We have the same type of infrastructure in place from Kilcock to Galway.  These are practical examples.  When a local authority talks about upgrading the sewerage in a town, such as in Galway city, we make sure through this task force that when the work is being done, spare services in the ground will be facilitated in order that they can be used in future rather than having to dig it up.  Those are the kinds of practical things that we are doing.</p> <p>  Heretofore, the operation of road opening licences has been different in every local authority.  The charges have been different and the forms have been different.  We have standardised all of that so it is the same charge and the same form, and is done on a system that can be accessed by any telecoms industry.  It simplifies it and makes it more efficient, so that it is cheaper to install this infrastructure in future.  We are also looking at having neutral hosts for this infrastructure so that it is not owned by specific telecoms companies that will not let other telecoms companies look at it.  We brought in the Office of Public Works because it has State assets and we may be able to use some State assets to install infrastructure such as masts that may be required on land that it owns.  It has maps of and knows what assets it has in the country.  We can see if there is a black spot and whether there is a State asset that we can use to get it done fairly quickly.</p> <p>  In the Minister, Deputy Ring's native county of Mayo, for example, the broadband officer has created a digitised map application so that every piece of spare ductwork in the ground in every town in County Mayo is mapped and can be seen by the telecoms industry.  That application will be given to every other broadband officer to do the same in every county so that we do not have fellows digging up streets to find out if something is there or not.  It will take time but it is common sense to make sure that we do not dig up streets for the sake of it.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned black spots and I agree that there are black spots.  ComReg has published an up-to-date map of where the good spots are and what providers are there so that if one is buying a phone, one can look at the map first to see whether a phone will work in that area.  That was published only three or four weeks ago.  It is the most up-to-date map that we have, and it is a true map because it is done by ComReg.</p><p>People ask what we are doing about broadband and mobile phones in our Department.  We are really talking about this kind of work.  We are trying to bring about some common sense across the Departments in the context of what we are doing to create the infrastructure in order that we will not be not digging and re-digging or putting up additional poles when there are already poles in place.</p><p> Reference was made to 5G.  There is a company called Valeo in Tuam.  It invested &euro;44 million last June with the aim of becoming a global centre for the development of appliances for the autonomous car.  That is the reality in Tuam and 5G will be needed for it.  All of the infrastructure we are discussing will be required in order to enable that.  People state that nothing is happening.  To an extent, I agree.  I do not have broadband in my house.  Hopefully, when it is rolled out, it will be done in a very positive way.  The broadband officers have identified 300 locations that will be able to accommodate broadband from day one once a decision has been made on the roll-out.  It will be delivered into the communities very quickly, if not to every house, at the start of the period of delivery.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on spending all the money he had.  He spent some of it by way of forward payment for work not yet done.  For example, under LIS, some &euro;10 million was given to the local authorities but the work was not done by 31 December 2018.

State agencies have to be funded by the State, as the Deputy knows.  Communities work with the likes of the county councils, the western development commission and &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta.  Groups are coming to me who have been in contact with the LEADER groups, &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta and the local authorities.  These agencies went out and spoke to community groups.  How does the Deputy think applications are made?  A number of applications came in via the LEADER programme because the LCDCs were out meeting with and talking to various groups, and then groups made their applications.</p></speech>

We were informed that it was focusing on certain big towns in the county.  It is interesting that it picked Athenry.  The latter is a fine town; it is actually the location that has been designated to ease growth in the city.  It is not a very rural town.  It received &euro;5.5 million, mainly through the urban fund.  It is the new centre for IDA Ireland in east Galway as opposed to being an area for rural development.  I have a concern with the way this is constructed.  It might not have been the Minister's intention, but I am concerned that this will be driven in this way.  The excuse that will be given will be the national spatial strategy which is totally focused on towns and growing urban agglomerations.  I listened to Waterford County Council when the committee went there last week, and all the county and city manager could talk about was big urban development.  He did not mention rural development even though he was addressing members of this committee.  The county manager in Galway stated on Monday that the message from the Government seems to be to focus on the bigger places.  Such an approach will not help the smaller locations.</p></speech>

Some 53 schemes were instigated by local authorities, 13 by departmental agencies, nine by the local development group and LEADER, eight by commercial semi-State companies and one by a third-level institution.  The fund was open to the latter and to local development groups, agencies such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and local authorities.  We held workshops and went out to the regions.  We received very positive feedback from the communities.  I am participating in the rural roadshows and listening to people on the ground.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Athenry.   That will be a tremendous development for the region.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service are developing ideas in the six national parks in County Mayo.  It is good to have communities, State agencies and local authorities involved.  There are problems in all local authorities with pet projects.  I cannot do anything about that.  They make the applications and we adjudicate on them.  Sometimes we find that the scheme applied for does not comply with the wishes of the elected representative.  However, he or she has an input into it.  The ideas are brought before the local authorities and the elected representatives, who then have an opportunity to support or refuse to support particular projects.</p></speech>

He will remember his time on the local council.  I admire the fact that he fought to retain the dual mandate.  He knows the trick that is played.  By the time a scheme is brought to a representative, one cannot go against it because it would be like hitting someone.  The people behind the scheme do not come to the elected representative before the list is drawn up.  It is the same when a list of roads to be fixed is created.</p><p>As public representatives we know about this structural problem.  Let us suppose someone comes in with a list of six or seven projects.  It is too late to start changing them, so what do we do?  We endorse them.</p><p> I am pleased the Minister has admitted that there is a danger here.  I am reassured as long as he is aware of the danger of pet projects.  My fear is that the pet projects will be in the stronger or growing places and not the weaker ones.  I am articulating a genuine concern.  I have been listening during the past week or two and people are using Project Ireland 2040 as an excuse.  That is a problem.</p><p> The Minister stated that a LEADER company can become the promoter of a project.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The thinking was that we would get Beaumont Hospital looking for money on the basis that the hospital treats people from CL&Aacute;R areas.  The Minister is familiar with the syndrome.  We need to be careful.  I am not making a case about what the Minister has done in that particular case.  I would have preferred if it had been under a different heading from the point of view of money because for me CL&Aacute;R is CL&Aacute;R.  However, I am a little disappointed given all the extra money coming into the Department but yet no more money is being ring-fenced for CL&Aacute;R areas.  For example, would the Minister consider ring-fencing some of the rural regeneration fund for CL&Aacute;R areas in order to ensure help for areas suffering most from rural decline?  The maps show vast areas of the country.  The geographers can tell us about the rapid growth in the areas under the influence of the cities.  Then we go over a cliff and there are areas in decline.  The Minister's county is a particular example.  It would suit to focus on the areas of decline because, unfortunately, much of County Mayo does not fall within the sphere of a major city.  The idea behind the criteria relating to CL&Aacute;R was that since these areas, continuously and over a long period, failed to get investment they had declining populations.  However, the latter was the case because they had failed to attract investment and so on.  The idea was to redress that.  Will the Minister consider reallocation?  I am not suggesting he can do it this year but perhaps he could do it next year.  Would he consider directing that a certain amount of the &euro;52 million be spent on projects put forward by the various agencies in CL&Aacute;R areas in order to ensure that there is not an inexorable pull toward the centre with the authorities that will be promoting the projects?</p></speech>

I have been reviewing it as recently as this week.  On the previous occasion, we left the scheme rather open.  We are looking to clarify some of the rules and regulations relating to it.  The idea is not to make it more difficult to make applications.  From his time in the Department, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be aware of the difficulty involved.  I do not want my rural regeneration scheme to be used by the various other Departments to deal with their problems.  I must ensure that it is used specifically for what it should be used for, namely, rural regeneration to revitalise rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned CL&Aacute;R.  As he is aware, we have only &euro;5 million in the programme, which we reintroduced in 2016.  We have spent &euro;27 million on the programme.  If we average the figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018, it comes to &euro;9 million per year.  I have a little flexibility with any savings.  I look at three or four schemes from which there may be savings.  These include, CL&Aacute;R, LIS and the Tidy Towns initiative.  All these funding projects are worthy of support.  A total of 1,270 projects have been supported by the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I am pleased with the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I am not going to start tampering with the rural regeneration scheme.  I want to get it opened as quickly as possible.  As I said, seed funding was put into the local authorities.  Some communities and groups made applications to get projects ready.  I expect we will have better projects.  It will take some time.  It is like every scheme that we ever introduced.  It takes a little time for organisations, whether they are state agencies or councils, to get up-and-running and to get good projects.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the Athenry scheme and there are schemes with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the LEADER companies.  These are all good schemes.  They will learn how to develop and get better in future.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, I am keen for the programme to target areas in need.  The CL&Aacute;R programme has worked well.  The rural regeneration scheme will be a good scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy knows about some of the schemes we had in the past under LEADER, town and village funding and other bits and pieces of funding.  If a project comes to the rural regeneration scheme, it is guaranteed to get substantial funding in order to enable completion.  However, there is one thing I will not allow.  I am making this clear to the Deputy, other members and the officials in the Department.  The projects get one shot; those involved are not coming back to finish a project for which they have received funding.  If a group made an application this year but finds that it needs more money next year, it will not get it.  Such a project can stall where it is.  If it is shovel-ready or ready to go and if we are informed that the latter is the case and that part of the funding already allocated relates to it, then it gets the remainder from the Department.</p> <p>  Members will know of the pilot scheme we operated with six towns.  We have given &euro;100,000 to each of the local authorities involved to enable them to sit down with communities, the local chamber of commerce, if there is one in the town, and whatever community groups are in place.  We hope they will come back with ideas to help us to regenerate towns and villages.  The six towns might come back with different ideas or with a common denominator of one or two schemes they would like to see put in place.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government.  We want to see what the towns throw up or what proposals they might bring to Government.  Another Department had a scheme involving grant aid to refurbish old houses but it simply did not work.  Why was that the case?  The scheme was not right in the first instance.  We have to operate certain schemes.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the CL&Aacute;R programme, the town and village renewal scheme and the outdoor recreation scheme.  We know why the LEADER programme did not work.  We tied it up in knots with rules and regulations.  I have freed up the programme by making 32 changes.  We know what to do if we do not want something to work.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows from his time here that we cannot make rules and regulations so difficult that applicants are unable to draw down funding.  Six towns have been selected, namely, Boyle, Callan, Ballinrobe, Banagher, Castleblayney and Cappoquin.  That is a representative group nationally, although I could have included another 20 towns.  We are hoping they will use the funding we have given them to employ people with some good ideas.  Private sector concerns have contacted me to make proposals for the scheme.  I did not entertain the proposals and insisted they speak to the groups directly and to the local authorities.  That is not my game.  My game is to provide the funding and I want the groups to come back with proposals.  It will then be my job to go back to the Government and see what I can do to revitalise towns and villages around the country.  What is needed?  Perhaps simple things can help, for example, making compulsory purchase orders which councils need to use more.</p><p> Ballinrobe is in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's area but it is a town I have a great love for. </p></speech>

I wish I had got the right part of it back.  Ballinrobe is a fine town, which I am glad to get back to my constituency, but south Mayo, which was assigned to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's constituency, is good country and I always did well in it.  It has gone through a very difficult time but it has a great community group, which has done great work, on which I compliment it.  The town is fighting back and making a revival and is getting funding from my Department and other Departments.  As the Deputy knows, the State broadcaster visited Ballinrobe on many occasions and always highlighted the negativity, but there is a great deal of positivity in the town.  It has wonderful facilities.  I want to see this happening in other towns.</p></speech>

The population of the town has increased significantly, with housing estates all over the edge of the town.  There is more employment in the area than there ever was, thank God, thanks to McHale, ECC Timber Products and other companies.  While the main street is maith go leor, the street leading off it has always been derelict and needs major refurbishment.  The centre of the town is not as vibrant as it was.  This shows that the solution is not simple.  Most people believe that town decline is caused by population loss and so on.  In the case of Ballinrobe, the population has exploded and there is a very good employment situation, yet the heart of the town is still not what it was.  I have thought for some time that it would be good to map what was in the town in its heyday in the 1970s.  What businesses were in the premises on the main street and why are they no longer there?  I would expect to find that there were lots of grocery shops, hardware shops and pubs and that these have been replaced by major supermarkets at the edge of town and convenience stores in petrol station forecourts.  These are not bad things because if the major multinational companies did not locate at the edge of the town, people would go to Castlebar or Claremorris to shop.  Nobody can tell me people do not do go to those types of shops.</p> <p>  Such a mapping exercise would highlight the real problem.  The way the town was used has become redundant and we need to create new uses for it.  Shopping habits have changed and nothing will bring back the old shopping habits.  Why would it when online shopping is available?  The town centre should be used more for recreational shopping as I describe it, in other words, going out for a meal.  Somebody said to me recently that in the old days people ate at home and went out to drink, whereas now they drink at home and go out to eat.  All these changes must be examined.  If we are serious about addressing this problem, we must acknowledge that the issue is not just the area's population or employment conditions.  It is connected to the old function of the town.  Obviously, there is no longer a video shop and there are not half as many pubs as there used to be.  Does the Minister understand what I am saying?  It would be ideal to map what was in Ballinrobe and similar towns in their perceived heyday 30 years ago, find out why those businesses no longer exist and suggest what could replace them.  The problem is more complicated that we sometimes believe.</p> <p>  My second point concerns future efforts, rather than this year's Estimate.  One thing that has always puzzled me slightly - it was a given before my tenure and during the Minister's tenure but it is worthy of examination - is that administrative costs account for 20% of the LEADER budget.  Most Departments directly providing grants manage to achieve a figure of 5% for administration costs.  Should we examine the processes in place in LEADER to find out why it is such an expensive project to administer?  If we reduced administration costs to 10% of &euro;20 million, there would be another &euro;200,000 to spend on the ground.  The amount spent on the administration of a programme for allocating grants is very high.  We can dress it up any way we like, with animation and all sorts of fancy European terms, but essentially LEADER is just a grant-giving programme.  Groups make an application, secure a grant and spend it. </p></speech>

He is right that more people are living and working in rural Ireland than ever before.  He is also right about towns and villages.  The shops that were there in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s are gone.  They were challenged by multinational companies such as Dunnes Stores and Tesco and those that are left are being challenged by online retail, which is causing a difficulty.  The pilot scheme for Ballinrobe was intended as an example of what could be done to regenerate a town.  We provided &euro;1,100,000 in the recent rural regeneration and development fund project to be used exactly as the Deputy described.  We are trying to regenerate the town centre and the market houses.  We provided funding as part of the town and village renewal scheme and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy knows that Ballinrobe is a fantastic town with a fantastic racecourse and golf club.  The one thing that is missing is a hotel.  As the Deputy knows, there were three applications but none ever came to fruition.  That is a pity because we could have done with a hotel in the town.  I remember holding clinics in Belmullet, a town the Deputy knows well, in my early days in politics when one would hardly find somewhere to get a cup of tea.  Now there are two hotels that are doing fantastically well. They provide a great service for weddings, funerals and so on and have given the town a great lift.  Ballinrobe has been chosen as a pilot for the rural regeneration and development fund to show how a town can be regenerated.  There is a great future for the town with its community group and young people.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a very interesting point when he spoke of mapping what was in Ballinrobe in earlier times.  When I think about my home town of Westport, families in the town have carried on.  Sons, daughters and in-laws have modernised family businesses and some have moved to different businesses.  The Hughes family established one of the most successful companies in the world, let alone Ireland.  The company operates out of Westport and trades all over the world as a multinational company.  The Kavanagh Group, which is based in the town, runs a hotel business and is involved in the tourism sector and supermarket business.  It modernises every year and keeps ahead of the posse.  I am working on Ballinrobe and hope we can give the town the support and back-up it needs.</p> <p>  The local area groups, LAGs, get 25% of the LEADER funding to meet administrative costs.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows what happens with administrative costs.</p><p>I know the administrative costs for last year and this year.  They might be a bit more than the actual project.  </p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice did a great deal of work on getting this project to the stage where we could get funding for it.  That is in a small town and it be a real game changer.  Without this fund, the town would never have got out of the mess it was in.  Kinvara, which is another small town, will get a boardwalk that will bring people from the castle to the town.  There will also be a walkway and cycleway all the way from Ballinderreen to Kinvara.</p></speech>

What I was about to say is that it involved Clonbur, which is another small town.  Not all the money went to Athenry.  It was provided right across the county and that will continue.

I listened carefully and they spoke about two places in Connemara - An Cheathr&uacute; Rua and An Cloch&aacute;n - and that was it.  It was argued that we could not spread the jam too thin.  That worries me because that is a very common syndrome.  Even when I look at the stuff that is written here, I can see this hierarchy of cities, towns, villages and surrounding areas.  Most people - 1 million people, including me - live in surrounding areas.  They are not in a place and are treated as appendages to somewhere else.  That is very dangerous when we are talking about rural regeneration as we understand the term "rural" in Ireland.  I made the point the other day that with their vision of it, St. Thomas' GAA club might as well pack up its hurley sticks and so might Ballyhale Shamrocks GAA because they will not be there for the next generation to play hurling.  These places no longer count even though they are highly successful communities.  They are not in the areas where the authorities want to see growth.</p></speech>

What Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was probably trying to say is that we are just flagging it to the Department that some county managers may have a vision that may not be compatible with what we, as elected representatives, or the Department may want to do and that it might be worth keeping an eye on it.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister on the local improvement schemes.  He spoke about some counties having large numbers of by-roads and back roads.  In my opinion, the west has more of them than anywhere else in the country.  We welcome the funding that comes when it comes.  Sometimes the roads programme could be run from May to September.  If funding is provided, could the local authorities be given a bit more space?  I do not mind if they get the money up-front as long as they get it and the roads are done.  Could they get an extra month or two to ensure they have time to get enough of the programme done?  I have seen where the Department has gone out and checked whether work was done properly.  In fairness, good work is being done.</p> <p>  I spoke to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the next issue I wish to raise.  In fairness, the Minister of State came to a meeting about it one evening.  There is an undercurrent at the moment for which the Department is not responsible.  Many voluntary groups around the country are being told that they need this or that form of insurance for Tidy Towns.  Villages are all trying to get funding from the &euro;6.2 million and &euro;13 million available for small areas.  A list is coming out showing what can be done with or without construction.  Somebody building a wall in a town obviously needs to produce a methods statement.  The Minister knows the towns in the west better than anyone.  Someone might be cutting grass at the edge of the road but there might not be a kerb.  We are approaching a stage where there is talk of three-day or one-day courses being required.  We must bear in mind that we will be on our knees if we lose these voluntary groups.  Other organisations are basically saying they cannot send their people out if the local community does not sign off on this, that or the other.  We must remember that these are volunteers filling out a form and signing their names as part of a community group to make their towns better.  In fairness, with the funding the Government has given over the past number of years, most of our small towns are looking much better.  There is a query at the moment.  In fairness to the Chairman and the staff here, they are trying to get the different bodies together.  A town with more than 1,000 cars travelling through it is in a different category when it comes to this insurance.  I am talking about towns like Milltown.  There is a fair bit of fear among voluntary bodies that do not know where they stand at the moment and I am concerned that this fear is spreading.  We had a private meeting about it.  I do not want to say too much about this.  We are talking about bringing people in here to try to nail the issue down.  What are the Minister's views on it?  </p> <p>  In fairness to the Minister, he is very good at spending money.  Is there any hope that responsibility for the likes of the CCTV set-up could be transferred to him?  Regarding the walks and the different funds, could community groups get a calendar regarding when CL&Aacute;R and all various other schemes are coming?  With the new drink driving laws, we all get it in the ear about the pubs.  If we are bringing out new schemes, such as those relating to rural transport, buses or something to solve the problem for communities, would the Department be prepared to take them over?</p><p>This year there is a worrying development under the heading of community sewerage schemes, with which the Minister will be familiar from his own area.  The new set-up is such that funding can be obtained only if one taps into the Irish Water network.  Will the Minister's Department work with the Department responsible for the environment?  The latter has stated to us, probably to fob us off, that the Department of Rural and Community Development will be launching a new scheme.</p><p> On hillwalkers, a couple of months ago the Minister spoke about legislation to indemnify farmers.  How is it progressing?</p><p> Reference has been made to towns of various sizes.  All towns - big, medium and small - need a little money.  There is no point in saying they do not.  Could funding be ring-fenced for towns with fewer than 500 people, which we call small villages, to bring them up a little?  Such towns, by comparison with bigger ones, feel like the child who never grew when applying for funding.  They feel it is harder to obtain funding when in with the big boys.</p><p> When will the CL&Aacute;R programme review be carried out?  There are areas that are under pressure and the circumstances of which have changed that probably now qualify under the programme but are not included.</p><p> Will there be a focus on areas included in the REDZ scheme?  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, it has been proved that CL&Aacute;R programme areas are struggling a little.  Could they be helped a little more?</p></speech>

Removing it was the biggest mistake ever made.  The Deputies know my views on the issue.  Taking Deputies out of county councils was the biggest mistake ever made because at least they know what legislation is passing through the D&aacute;il.  When the dual mandate was removed, the happiest people were the county managers in every corner of the country.  I did my best to oppose it and there were those who supported me in that regard.  The abolition should never have happened.  Under the old Western Health Board, there was accountability.  When there was a county and a regional structure in place, there was accountability.  Now we have the HSE and other such bodies.  The media believed the best thing one could ever do was to keep elected public representatives away from everything.  We are elected; we are the ones who put our names on the ballot paper and we are the representatives of the people.</p> <p>  The local improvement scheme was mentioned.   It is a good scheme and working well, but I need to obtain additional funding for it.  I need to consider the areas that are in more need than the ones benefiting from the allocation.  This year I capped the allocation for householders at &euro;1,200.  Although it went unnoticed, it will result in a fairer system.  Members know that people who are paying their local property tax and, in some cases, water charges because they are included in group schemes are paying.  Allocations of &euro;1,500, &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 were expected in such cases, but I have capped the sum at &euro;1,200, which will help the bigger schemes.  It is only fair.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to voluntary groups.  We have great voluntary groups in this country and among the greatest are the Tidy Towns committees.  I was the first Minister to give a separate allocation to every Tidy Towns group throughout the country and I did so for two reasons.  First, the Government appreciates the work the Tidy Towns committees are doing.  Second, we are thanking the volunteers for the work they do.  Most importantly, the volunteers are doing work the local authorities are not doing and that the State should be doing.  But for the voluntary sector, this would be a poorer country.  The local authorities should stop hindering, in any way, community and voluntary groups.  Pencil pushers in the local authorities should not be trying to affect the good work being done by Tidy Towns groups or any other voluntary group.  The local authorities and any other body funded by the State should be working for and supporting volunteers, not putting obstacles in their way.  No group should have to be brought before a committee.  We should be thanking, encouraging and helping them, not putting obstacles in their way.  I do not want some individual who has nothing else to be doing to be considering ways by which progress could be held back.</p> <p>  On CCTV systems, we were trying to get the scheme into the Department, but we encountered some difficulties with data protection.  The scheme is now in place.  Monitoring CCTV systems seems to be the difficulty.  It is a question of who is monitoring.  We will have to wait and see what happens in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about smaller towns and villages.  This year I sent two instructions in that regard.  When I recently met the county managers or chief executives of all of the local authorities, I gave them a calendar of programmes for which I will be allocating funding this year.  They now know the position on all programmes.</p></speech>

There is no difficulty in that regard.  I asked my officials to send it to all members of the committee and anyone who wanted it.  I wrote to the CEOs outlining my Department's programmes and when I was opening them.  They now know that there is scheme continuity.  This is the third year.  My Department has been in place for almost two years.  Before that, in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs we started to open up some of the schemes again.  As I said, the local authorities now know that there is programme continuity.  They also know that they may not have had the capacity in the past but that they will now need to have it.  Many local authorities, including mine and that of Deputy Carey, have a director of services dedicated to dealing with rural issues and rural schemes.  All local authorities will need to do this.</p> <p>  The REDZ scheme was included in the town and village category.  An instruction I gave the local authorities this year in respect of towns and villages was related to the exact point raised by the Deputy.  I want towns and villages that have not received funding before to be included this time.  I do not want the same towns and villages to receive all of the funding again.  I want to see new villages and towns included.  The title of the scheme refers to towns and villages.  The village is as important as the town.  The county councils have received that instruction from me this year.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about the CL&Aacute;R programme review.  I hope to have it towards the end of the year.  Even in my region there are areas that are included in the programme but which have moved on and there are areas that are not included in it that should be.  We need to carry out the review.</p></speech>

The programme is due for review and we will be getting somebody to carry it out for us.  The same process will be used for the review as was used for the previous one.  It involves the college in Maynooth, although the same people will not be used.  We need to carry out the review and include some new areas.</p><p> I think I have covered all of the issues the Deputy raised, except the most important one, namely, the indemnity scheme.  I will be very careful in what I say about that scheme.  We have been working to develop a national indemnity scheme and it is a very complex matter.  My Department has been advised that a scheme like the one envisaged will require legislation to be implemented.  We will have to use two existing Acts, the Occupiers' Liability Act and the National Treasury Management Agency Act, which are under the control of other Ministers.  Therefore, I will have to discuss the matter with the relevant Ministers.  Officials from my Department are also having meetings with the Attorney General.  We are making progress, but it is a complex matter, one that will require more than a simple legislative initiative.  If I bring it forward, I want it to be right.  I have given an undertaking that we will try to bring forward legislation.  The reason we are not further on with it is that Brexit has been the priority in recent weeks.  All other legislation has been put on hold.  Brexit was the subject of the most important legislation we had to deal with.  The Office of the Attorney General is heavily engaged with my office on this issue.  I am also dependent on two other Ministers in the case of the Acts mentioned, but we are making progress.  We need to do something about the issue because, as I have said previously, I cannot have a situation where there are claims against the family of landowners, their home and land.  We need to deal with the issue and want to do so as quickly as possible as we have talked about it for a long time.  We are now trying to implement legislation.</p></speech>

To solve the pub question and resolve the issue of transport in rural parts of Ireland, one idea I came up with was having minibuses under the auspices of development groups which exist in every town.  Would the Minister be in favour of such a scheme and would his Department be prepared to work on it?  The other matter was sewerage schemes.</p></speech>

I think there is approximately &euro;16 million available for RuralLink between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  My Department would be the ideal fit for it.  I am sure it can be negotiated at a later date.  This is a new Department and we need to look at anything that would assist rural Ireland, including the rural social scheme.  There is a debate on it taking place between my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  My Department would be the ideal fit for the rural social scheme and other social schemes.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was a member of the Government that established the scheme.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection covers activation programmes.  It only wants to get people back to work.  It is about the live register.  The rural social scheme and others are community schemes that work very well and we would be in a great deal of difficulty if we did not have them as they do a great deal of fine work.  I have always been a strong supporter of the rural social scheme and want to keep such schemes going.</p> <p>  The issue of water and sewerage schemes has been raised by many Deputies.  I am getting my officials to talk to officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about them.  I do not have a problem with trying to find funding to support group water and sewerage schemes, but it is not my job to provide the bulk of the money.  We should support the scheme within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That is why we are talking to officials of that Department and I am talking to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I have discussed with him the fact that something must be done about small sewerage schemes.  I see no difficulty with my Department having a scheme to top up small water and sewerage schemes, but it will not be the lead Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCS2019040300002#M00400"><p>We are coming to the end of the discussion on programme A and I have a few comments to make.  I welcome the Minister's highlighting Tidy Towns groups which are among our greatest groups.  The Minister's expression of thanks to them as a community initiative is most welcome, as is the financial support he has provided which is well received in communities.  In County Clare, particularly Ennis, we have enjoyed huge success in the Tidy Towns competition and long may it continue.  It is welcome that the Minister has published a schedule of schemes and communicated it to the CEOs of the various local authorities.  I ask him to circulate it to the committee in order that we will know when the rolling schemes will open.  It is a very welcome development that the Minister has reopened the rural development scheme.  I note that we have received two tranches a year for the last couple of years.  It is very welcome to receive this money, but one tranche provided earlier in the year might be better.  Let the local authorities plan on that basis.  The second tranche is received at the end of the year and while it is welcome, it puts pressure on the local authorities to have works done at what may not be the best time of year, namely, during the winter months.  I propose that the Minister consider allocating one tranche and providing it earlier in the year.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice on sewerage schemes.  The Minister will be well aware of the representations I have made in that regard.  In County Clare there were two applications made under sewerage scheme heading of the rural regeneration and development fund for schemes in Broadford and Cooraclare.  Unfortunately, the schemes did not come through.  There is a genuine need to put in place a proper programme to allow communities to realise their potential.  A sewerage scheme in a small rural community is a basic service, but they cannot have it if the necessary funding or programme is not in place.  I welcome the Minister's comments.  Communities such those in Broadford, Carrigaholt, Cooraclare and Doolin in a thriving tourist area in north Clare do not have proper sewerage facilities and the prospects of having them without a programme are slim.  I recognise the Minister's commitment and the interest he has expressed in working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in that regard.  The director of services for County Clare met officials of that Department and I had hoped some progress would be made as a result.  I recognise the Minister's commitment to put together a scheme in conjunction with Irish Water, the local authorities and the communities that will work for them.</p> <p>  I compliment the Minister on his involvement in putting together a rural regeneration and development fund.  It is a groundbreaking initiative which will unlock the potential of communities across the country.  County Clare benefited immensely in the last round of funding in which it received &euro;7.5 million.  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Fitzmaurice said the money is not getting into rural areas, but I can say it is.  The locations around Lough Derg, Mountshannon and Holy Island in County Clare are to benefit from an injection of nearly &euro;1 million.  The plan is to establish east Clare as a tourism area, which is very welcome.  It comes in conjunction with the &euro;500,000 given to further develop the blueway along Lough Derg.  In this instance we see an example of how one scheme can complement another, which is very welcome.</p><p>We have seen an injection of money into Loop Head in west Clare.  Lahinch Seaworld has received &euro;2.7 million.  The Irish Open golf tournament is happening in Lahinch this year, and I would welcome everyone down to County Clare to see what a spectacle they are going to put on.  That is very welcome news.  The Vandeleur walled garden is another initiative in west Clare.  Last year, Ennistymon got an allocation of &euro;1 million for the development of a digital hub.  We are doing very well in Clare in terms of the rural regeneration programme.  I encourage the Minister to continue that work and that allocation.  He might come back to me on a few of the points I have raised.</p></speech>

We are so lucky to have it.  I just have to keep putting it on the record.  All the Deputies have praised the movement this evening.  Ireland is a better place and our towns, villages and cities are better places because of the Tidy Towns committees.  I know it is probably not politically correct but I want to take this opportunity to thank SuperValu for its sponsorship over the years.  It has  been a great community supporter.  I am grateful to Martin Kelleher, the managing director of SuperValu, for that support.  I am also grateful to all the other sponsors who have been very supportive of the Tidy Towns initiative.</p> <p>  I have no problem sending a copy of that letter to the committee.  It is just a very simple letter outlining the proposals for the year ahead and giving the local authorities a direction on the way we are going, what schemes are coming up and when, to give them an opportunity to prepare and plan for them.</p> <p>  On the local infrastructure scheme, LIS, I know what the Deputy is saying.  I had meant to respond to Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Even when I have given the early funding in February, sometimes by September they did not have it spent.  I know they want to do other roads first.  I was a member of a local authority.  The local authorities have always been telling me that they like to get the LIS money at the end of the year because it keeps their staff and workers employed.  Particularly for the second tranche of money, one of the conditions is that they have the capacity to complete the work.  They all tell us they have the capacity but the minute they get the money, they have no capacity.  It is very hard for me to operate with them but I do my best.  I provide the funding as best I can.</p> <p>  On sewerage and water schemes, to be fair to the Deputy, he pushed that County Clare one very hard.  What we do not want, especially with the rural regeneration scheme, is to be a substitute for the schemes of any other Department.  We want to provide new schemes that complement existing funding from other Departments and we have no problem with that.  I will look at the water and sewerage issue but the lead agency will have to be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It will have to come up with a small scheme.  The economy has gone through a difficult time and a lot of local areas are developing again.  A lot of areas need group water schemes and, particularly, sewerage schemes.  To be fair to the communities, they are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and set up the schemes.  What we need to do is give them some support.</p> <p>  The Chairman has made many representations for the rural regeneration scheme in his county, including Kilrush, Loop Head, Lahinch, Ennistymon and the walled gardens.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, I planted a tree there and I would say that tree is well up now, as it were.  These are all fine projects.  These issues link in with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, especially in respect of the national parks, for which County Clare will be getting some funding as it has one of the finest national parks in the country.  We only have six national parks and sometimes people do not realise the asset they have.  In Canada, America and other parts of the world, when they have a national park, they think they have the greatest tourism attraction.  We have six of them, one as good as the other.  They are tremendous assets that are not being used.  I have to say to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that, to be fair, the National Parks and Wildlife Service did not get a lot of funding in recent years.  When I went into the old Department, I dealt with the staffing problems it had.  We set out a programme for it and got it extra funding.  The national parks are a great asset and we should be making more of them.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has bought into the concept now and realises they are a tourist attraction and a tourism asset.  I hope I have covered all the issues raised.</p></speech>

The funding was intended originally to go to community groups in the main.  I refer to the community services programme.  I understand each company must now top up the wage by &euro;2,000.  Up to 2012, there was a euro-for-euro refund of all wage costs, including the PRSI.  Has the requirement to come up with the income to pay that part of the wage put pressure on the more vulnerable groups?  The Minister said he would like to get the rural social scheme back in his Department.  I might give him a bit of a thought process on that.  He is probably finding it difficult to get an increase in the money for the community services project.</p><p>It has not increased this year.  In fact, it has been squeezed in recent years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looks on that as 100% spending.  If the Minister got a further &euro;5 million, the Department would not give him credit for taking people off the dole.  The project was put under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because, if that Department's Minister was of a mind, she could prove within her budget that taking someone off of farm assist and putting him or her on the RSI had a minimal net cost.  On the other hand, if the Minister before us had the RSI without the farm assist, he would have to look for the full money, and he knows how willing and welcome the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would be to hand over that.  If the Minister is trying for the RSI, I suggest that he take the farm assist scheme with it at a minimum.  As he created jobs through the RSI, he could prove that he was making a saving.  All he would need to show would be the difference between someone being on the RSI compared with farm assist.  I can see the argument from two points of view, but it is complex.</p><p> I am worried, as I can see from this document that this year's budget for the community services programme, CSP, is the same as last year.  I am not saying it would be easy, but the Minister is not managing to leverage extra money out of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Many fantastic community facilities have been built over the years.  Community groups are building new heritage facilities and so on around the country through the rural development fund.  The Minister will need many more community services to run these places, which are semi-viable.  The Crossroads community centre in Cong was in my constituency and is now in the Minister's constituency.  If that was run under the CSP, one could not keep the doors open.  That is true of all of these large centres.  Why would we not keep them open from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m.?  Some staff resources would be needed.</p></speech>

The CSP is a good initiative.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the minimum wage and the shortfall that groups must meet.  It is putting pressure on them.  I am aware of Obair in Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare.  It is a large community services project.  When the committee was in Dunhill last week, we met a group that complained to us about this issue.  It must come up with &euro;20,000 per year.  That is a massive burden for a community group to carry.</p> <p>  Regarding taking on other schemes, the Minister mentioned that Local Link would sit better within his Department.  I would agree.  In recent days, an issue has arisen in County Clare with its Local Link service, which is known as Clare Bus.  It has lost the tender to provide the dispatch centre in Feakle, which is a rural community.  Six jobs are provided through delivering that service, which is tailor made for the community and has worked well over many years.  The provider knows its customers and is in tune with them.  For example, if it gets a phone call an hour before a bus departs, it can change the route and pick up people at their homes.  It is disturbing that the community is not in a position to retain that service.  I will raise this question with the National Transport Authority, NTA, but the programme would be better understood were it within the Minister's Department.  I encourage him to do what he can to take it under his umbrella.</p></speech>

When the Minister speaks to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, he can argue that, if he increased the number by 1,000, all he would need would be to show the net saving on the farm assist scheme versus the RSI.  That would be a problem if the programmes were in two different Departments.</p></speech>

There needs to be the same criteria for both.  We will put a watch on that, as we do not want to be tied into a situation where we do not have the funding or where we get into difficulties because we are implementing the scheme but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is making the ground rules.</p> <p>  Regarding the CSP, we gave an additional &euro;1 million to the most financially vulnerable organisations to assist them in meeting the minimum wage condition.  We did that through Pobal.  We did not ask groups to make applications.  Instead, Pobal had their information, sat down with them and did the job for me.  To be fair, there is also a review of the CSP under way.  Deputies will give out about all of the reviews that are happening, but I want this one to be completed by mid-September.  I need to find out what are the difficulties.  The minimum wage issue is turning out to be a significant one.  Were I to fund that condition now, it would cost me &euro;4 million more.  If we are to do anything on this matter next year, I will have to do so with the Minister for Finance when budget time comes.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, the CSP is meant to be only a contribution.  We are not the employer.  These services do a good job.  I must be careful.  We give &euro;32,000 for the manager and &euro;19,033 for an individual worker.  My Department provides a substantial amount of money.  I will have to negotiate with the Department of Finance regarding the minimum wage.</p> <p>  The Chairman discussed another scheme we needed to take on.  Like the RSI, rural transport would be a better fit in my Department.  A few other schemes would fit into my Department nicely.  This is something the Government needs to review now that the Department is up and running.  The Department is working well.  I compliment the staff on the tremendous work, effort and commitment they have put into it.  It has been difficult.  Mine is the first new Department in a while.  When the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was formulated, at least there was Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's old Department from which to start.  Mine was established from the bottom up.  My officials worked under difficult circumstances.  From top to bottom, we have a tremendous team.  With the Secretary General, assistant secretaries and other staff, we have a committed workforce in Ballina and Dublin.  It has been difficult, as there have been many moves, but whoever inherits it will get a good Department.</p> <p>  I believe I addressed the six Clare Bus jobs.</p> <p>  The CSP is a great programme that provides services where county councils, the HSE and other parts of the State will not.  However, I must be careful that a project under it does not displace any existing business.  I regularly get complaints about us funding groups that compete against businesses that are employing people and paying their taxes and rates.  It is a great scheme, though, and is working well.  I would like further funding for it.  Some community service projects are finding it difficult to replace retirees.  Now that unemployment has decreased from 15.5% to almost 5%, it is creating a problem.</p></speech>

The Dormant Accounts Acts provide the framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts.</p><p>The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders or policyholders with their funds but, in order to utilise the unused funds, the legislation also introduces a scheme for their disbursement.  This money is added to the Government debt.  The moneys are voted upon in government.  The Department is responsible for the management of the overall fund and the delivery of some of the measures within the action plans.</p><p> For this year, 2019, our Department will have &euro;12 million.  The key measures that will be supported through that will be the social inclusion fund and the senior alert scheme.  The funding for the social inclusion fund is &euro;5 million and the funding for the senior alert scheme is &euro;2 million.  The funding for social enterprise is &euro;2 million.  The money will first be allocated for either the social inclusion scheme or Pobal and then it will be given to the community groups.  All the projects funded are published on the website.</p><p> We are also allocating money, &euro;1.2 million, for the capital fund for the development of the volunteer centres.  Up to &euro;1 million has been allocated for employment along the Atlantic economic corridor.  All the groups that get the money are on the website so there is transparency.</p></speech>

It was necessary to introduce regulation but I always had reservations in that community trust is fundamental in so many small local charities around the country.  I refer to where the community knows the individuals concerned.  Applying the same criteria to small local charities as to big international charities, whose staff knock on doors in urban areas and are not known to anybody, is wrong.  We must ensure proportionality in the application of the rules by the Charities Regulator.  Corporate governance is important but it cannot become so great that it sucks considerable sums of money from the funds of very small groups through auditing fees and fees for experts required to fill out forms and so on.  Where this happens, the little group that handles a few thousand euro cannot do so anymore.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this issue because it is serious.  We were worried about it from the very beginning of this road.  At every level of bureaucracy, there is such a cautious approach taken that there is no proportionality left.</p></speech>

In November of last year, we launched the charities governance code.  It consists of six principles of governance: advancing charitable purpose; behaving with integrity; leading people; exercising control; working effectively; and being accountable and transparent.  One of the main points the code has recognised is diversity in the sector.  It aims to be proportionate and it has been written with volunteer-only charities and charities with small numbers of staff in mind.  It sets out 32 core standards that all charities should meet but also contains 17 additional standards that reflect best practice for the larger ones.  Proportionality has been recognised in the code, as desired by the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Charities Regulator will provide guidance so charities and trustees meet all the core standards.  This year will be one of learning and preparation for the charities but they will be expected to comply with the code in 2020.  From 2021, charities will be expected to report on their compliance with it.  At the heart of the code is proportionality.  The difference between the large charities and the small ones is accounted for.  The code has a simple step-by-step guide for the smaller charities and the bigger ones have a lot more work to do to satisfy the criteria.  That has been recognised.</p></speech>

Everybody knows the people in question and there is no question of having to identify them.  They might need a small grant from the HSE, for example, and they are asked for a charity number.  Then they are told to form a company and then they have accounts audited.  The charity might be dealing with only &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 per year.  The chance of a large sum of money going missing in that set of circumstances is nil because there is not a large sum.  The chance of a small sum going missing is very small but it does not seem to be the case that there is proper proportionality.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is receiving complaints about this.  Proper proportionality would involve the taking into account of compliance costs.  In some cases, because of the insistence on having to obtain a charity number, it is not worthwhile applying for small grants.</p></speech>

If one notes what happened with some charities, one realises there ought to be governance and transparency.  The money is coming from the public purse to help the charities.  I understand what the Deputy is saying about the smaller organisations but we have to protect the public and have governance.  The code was produced following consultation with the sector.  All welcome it.  It is a new code and it is being worked on so that, by next year, the charities will be using it fully.  They will be getting advice and help on its introduction to ensure they are meeting the proper governance standards.  If one were to exempt some groups on the grounds that the individuals concerned are known-----</p></speech>

We need to assist the charities in respect of the code and ensure the documents with which they have to work are written in plain English to ensure compliance.  We give them the backup to make sure this happens.</p></speech>

What I see happening here is akin to what happened in the banking sector.  The big banks lost a few hundred billion euro and we then introduced a whole lot of regulations for credit unions that removed their community element.  We are trying to turn them into mini banks even though they did not lose any of the money about which we are talking.  What went astray in credit unions was minuscule, yet we are getting rid of the community element.  We are killing volunteerism and making it such a nightmare for people to operate that much of the money the Minister of State is saying we are preventing from going to waste is just going towards audit fees and so on.  Therefore, I am not sure many communities would agree with the Minister of State that the measures are protecting them from whatever he is trying to protect them from.</p></speech>

I asked whether there would be public consultation on the new rural planning arrangements.  He said there would not.</p><p>He told me the Department had already consulted the local authorities but what he meant was that it had consulted senior planners in the local authorities, not members of the public or politicians.  Normally, when a sector is consulted, the strongest part of the organised sector is consulted, rather than the small, disorganised part which does not have representative bodies and cannot be consulted easily.</p></speech>

This will mean that once the governance has been done correctly for one organisation, this work will not have to be done again.  If an organisation is applying for funding, it can use the same document to apply for funding from other organisations.  There is a conflict between non-compliance and compliance.  We must have compliance and transparency when we are giving out public money.  I am aware that difficulties arise in that regard but coaching and help is available.  The regulator is meeting the charity groups to help them in that regard.  A series of meetings is being held nationwide to help people complete these forms as required and advise them on the best way forward.  That is the approach that is needed, rather than saying we will not allow them do this or that because that creates an environment which could be risky in the long term.</p></speech>

I contacted the regulator on behalf of a community group.  Unfortunately, I do not have the reply with me but basically I was told it could not talk to me.  The community group in question was aware that I have experience in administration and it asked me to call the regulator to find out exactly what it needed.  It is time that State agencies did what all Departments do, namely, recognise that under the law, it is a presumption that a public representative approaching an agency or Department has the permission of the person on whose behalf he or she is making the approach.  Otherwise, public representatives will not be able to do our business representing our people and resolving these kinds of problems for the weakest in society or those who are the least organised but might be doing the best work.</p></speech>

I will give an overview of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s funding relationship with the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, including the control mechanisms and management arrangements relating to its grant funding.<br/><br/>At the outset it is important to state that Sport Ireland was established in 2015 under the Sport Ireland Act and is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport in Ireland.  The functions of Sport Ireland are prescribed in section 8 of the Irish Sports Council Act and include powers to develop participation in sport and high performance sport; eliminate doping in sport; develop coaching; develop guidelines on the protection of children in sport; and the development of the national sports campus.<br/><br/>The Sport Ireland Act confers considerable authority in Sport Ireland and this is reinforced by our responsibility in investing substantial amounts of public funding into sport.  As a statutory agency we seek to develop strong sporting organisations and recognise the considerable public interest in a successful Irish sports sector.  That said, we must be mindful of the limits of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s legal powers.  Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and, notwithstanding our focus on good governance and financial management in funded bodies, we respect the autonomy of the national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland is responsible for the investment of public funds in sport and the subsequent oversight and accountability of this investment.  All procedures and interactions with NGBs reflect this responsibility.<br/><br/>NGBs are independent autonomous organisations.  In accordance with the key corporate governance principles, the board of any NGB is collectively responsible for leading and directing the organisation&rsquo;s activities.  Good governance recommends that the board cannot avoid its ultimate responsibility for actions undertaken in the name of the organisation.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland places a high premium on good governance and encourages high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  As the development agency, it is our aim to provide leadership in this area, empowering sport organisations to take responsibility for their own governance and meet the challenges they face.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland assists all funded bodies to achieve excellence in all areas of their work and provides a number of interventions in the area of governance.  This is broken down into a series of meaningful pieces of work, ensuring both growth and sustainability moving forward.<br/><br/>In 2018, representatives of the FAI attended a number of governance seminars and governance code workshops provided by Sport Ireland.  The FAI was also one of the 50 sporting organisations to utilise the governance elearning services which assist organisations on the journey to compliance with the governance code. <br/><br/>As the body tasked with the development of sport in Ireland, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s primary aim and responsibility is the security of, and return on investment for, the approximately &euro;2.9 million in Exchequer funding invested in the FAI on an annual basis.  To that end, Sport Ireland is satisfied that effective control mechanisms and frameworks are in place with regard to our investment in the FAI. Sport Ireland is satisfied that our funding invested in the FAI is fully accounted for and expended on the purpose for which it was intended.<b></b>This is verified on an annual basis by our financial controller based on reviews of the FAI&rsquo;s financial statements and signed auditor statements stating that all our grants were expended for the purposes for which they were intended.<br/><br/>As a further control mechanism, Sport Ireland also commissions additional external independent audits approximately every three years.  These audits independently review the FAI&rsquo;s compliance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant terms and conditions and its overall management arrangements as they relate to our grant funding.<br/><br/>I will now outline in more detail the full oversight procedures and control frameworks within Sport Ireland with regard to our grant funding to the FAI.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland invests in the long-term sustainability of NGBs.  Since 1999, the Irish Sports Council, now Sport Ireland, primarily invests in the FAI through the youth field sport programme.  This grant of &euro;2.5 million is directed towards participation and technical development programmes.  While funding is allocated to the FAI on an annual basis, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s strategy clearly demonstrates a commitment that extends beyond the one-year period.<br/><br/>In 2018, for every &euro;1 of Sport Ireland investment, the FAI invested &euro;4 from its own resources.</p><p>These Sport Ireland funds are spent on grassroots, education, player development, and central and regional development staff.  It is important to note that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s youth field sport grant goes towards technical department staff costs only, that is, development officers, national co-ordinators and programme-specific administrators.  It is explicitly stipulated that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s funding does not include any other salaries, such as high-performance salaries or salaries for those working in the professional game.  During 2017, this equated to the part-funding of 57 members of staff, of an annual average of 193 employed by the FAI.  All other staff costs, including the role of chief executive, are funded by the normal business and other commercial operations of the FAI and are not financially supported by Sport Ireland.  This is explicitly agreed with the FAI in writing and is subject to audit verification.  The youth field sport investment is broadly aimed at encouraging and creating more opportunities for young people throughout Ireland to participate in soccer.  Programmes are based on a shared ethos of developing the grassroots of the games, growing participation numbers, improving standards and embracing communities outside of the traditional base of the sport.  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s youth field sport investment supports detailed action plans which are implemented by a team of development officers and volunteers. </p><p> As well as a number of initiatives specifically aimed at bringing young people into sport, there are programmes that develop clubs and build links with communities.  Also, with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s support, the FAI builds on the expertise of teachers, coaches, referees and volunteers in order that it can provide a quality experience for children and young people who become involved in sport.  There is a strong emphasis within FAI programmes on disadvantaged areas, social inclusion, people with ethnic minority backgrounds and opportunities for players with a disability.  Sport Ireland also invests &euro;142,000 in the FAI through the women in sport programme, which aims to raise overall physical activity levels among women and girls and support women&rsquo;s roles within sporting organisations.  In 2018, Sport Ireland also invested &euro;195,000 in the women&rsquo;s national team.  The core objective of the fund is to raise standards and improve the standard of playing and training environments.  A full breakdown of all funding allocated to the FAI since 2008 has been provided to the committee as part of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s submission.  The committee should note that in 2017, our investment in the FAI represented approximately 5% of its total annual income, with the other 95% coming from the FAI&rsquo;s commercial activity, including sponsorship deals, broadcasting and gate receipts. </p><p> On control and management arrangements, specifically for the funding invested by Sport Ireland in the FAI, there are six layers of control in place.  The first is that there is strategic alignment between Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to increasing sports participation and the development of sport in Ireland, and the FAI's aim to develop participation and volunteer-led local clubs, educate coaches and referees, and promote women's and girls' football.  The aims are outlined in our respective strategies. </p><p> Second, Sport Ireland operates a detailed grant application process for the FAI.  Once received, detailed grant applications are assessed by the senior management team, including me.  The FAI&rsquo;s application for funding is underpinned by an annual programme for action that must assist the achievement of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s aims and objectives.  The board of Sport Ireland is presented with a comprehensive paper outlining the funding recommendations and the board makes the final decisions on the allocation of funds to the FAI. </p><p> Third, Sport Ireland has in place detailed terms and conditions of grant approval, which are reviewed on an annual basis for effectiveness and relevance.  These terms and conditions are signed by the FAI&rsquo;s president and chief executive annually, and are returned to Sport Ireland and retained on file.  Among other things, the terms and conditions include a requirement to notify Sport Ireland in writing without delay in the event of any material deterioration in the FAI&rsquo;s financial position, or of any other matter which may jeopardise the organisation&rsquo;s overall financial viability. </p><p> Fourth, Sport Ireland operates ongoing performance monitoring of the FAI programmes in which we invest throughout the year.  There is regular and ongoing liaison between Sport Ireland and the FAI at various levels.  Sport Ireland periodically meets the FAI to discuss performance, progress and any other issues that may arise.  Sport Ireland staff also perform periodic verification visits to observe courses, seminars, grassroots programmes and other work undertaken within the scope of the funding.  The FAI provides comprehensive information to Sport Ireland on its funded programmes, events and levels of participation throughout the year, which includes submitting an interim report and an end-of-year report which show the FAI's performance against targets. </p><p> Fifth, the FAI is required to submit its financial statements and a note from its annual general meeting to Sport Ireland in a timely fashion.  The financial statements must include an auditor&rsquo;s statement confirming that the Sport Ireland grant was expended for the purposes for which it was intended.  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller analyses the financial statements submitted by the FAI and highlights any concerns or questions that may arise.  Any queries must be satisfactorily addressed prior to the release of the FAI&rsquo;s final grant payment for the year. </p><p> Sixth, at the direction of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee, this entire system as it relates to the FAI is also audited by an independent external auditor every three years. </p><p> Turning to Sport Ireland's audits of the FAI, Sport Ireland has an audit and risk committee, which commissions audits of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grantee organisations.  Over the past decade, the FAI has been audited by Sport Ireland&rsquo;s independent auditors on more occasions than has any other sporting organisation.  Independent audits of the FAI have been completed on Sport Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, with all findings reported to Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee.  The scope of the most recent audit, completed in 2016, included a review of compliance with the Sport Ireland grant terms and conditions. The scope of this audit also included consideration of overall FAI governance and management arrangements as they related to the grant funding of &euro;2.7 million received from Sport Ireland.  This included a high level review in the following areas: board or committee structure and oversight, with reporting and minutes maintained; risk management practices, including formal risk identification, monitoring and reporting; financial management, controls and procedures; whistleblowing policies; and, code of conduct policies and related procedures.  The overall audit opinion concluded that reasonable assurance can be placed on the effectiveness and operation of internal controls.  It should be noted that reasonable assurance was the highest level of classification available.  No high-priority item was identified, while one medium-priority and two low-priority items were identified.</p><p> The 2014 audit did not identify any significant or important items and concluded that it was apparent that the FAI had put in place processes designed to comply with the terms and conditions as set out by Sport Ireland with regard to grant aided expenditure programmes.  The 2010 audit concluded that the system in place provided substantial assurance over the establishment, management and monitoring of contractual arrangements by way of the funding process between Sport Ireland and the FAI.  Three separate independent audit firms, therefore, have provided Sport Ireland with the highest level of assurance that all funding is fully accounted for and expended for the purposes for which it was intended, and that the terms and conditions of funding are being complied with.  The committee should be aware that in November 2018, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s audit and risk committee approved our 2019 audit plan, which includes a provision for an audit of the FAI, as per our normal procedures.  The internal audit plan was presented to the board of Sport Ireland at its meeting in February 2019 and agreed to.</p><p> On the conditions of funding, a copy of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval was provided to the committee for reference.  With specific reference to the FAI, in accordance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval, all grant funding made available by Sport Ireland must be expended in accordance with the organisation&rsquo;s funding submission as approved by Sport Ireland.  The FAI must submit to Sport Ireland a copy of its financial statement to the end of the accounting year for the mid-year review process.  All grants received from Sport Ireland must be separately identified as income in the organisation&rsquo;s annual financial statements.  The FAI, and all organisations in receipt of more than &euro;200,000, must present its financial statements with accounts fully audited by a registered auditor in accordance with Irish generally accepted accounting principles, including a signed audit opinion specifying the auditor&rsquo;s name and address, and a statement from the auditor that each grant was expended in accordance with the approved submission.</p><p>The committee should note that, as part of the mid-year financial review of the FAI&rsquo;s 2017 financial statements and in advance of the final tranche of 2018 funding being released to the FAI, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller raised a query with the FAI regarding its 2017 liquidity position, specifically the introduction of a bank overdraft facility of &euro;1.3 million and the increased net debt position in 2017.  The query was responded to by the FAI's director of finance, who stated: </p><blockquote>The Net Current Liabilities position is a common annual position mainly driven by Deferred Income balances where advance funds from grants, sponsorship &amp;amp; commercial agreements are being released over the life of the respective agreement.  The overdraft position at Dec 2017 was within our Overdraft Facility with our Banking partners and was a matter of timing rather than a liquidity concern &ndash; the balance has been in credit for the majority of 2018 to date.  The Balance Sheet position was reviewed by the audit team as part of going concern procedures, including reviewing future budgets, and no concerns were raised.</blockquote><p>The committee should also note that the &euro;100,000 loan from the chief executive to the FAI was not disclosed as a separate note in the 2017 financial statements and this information was not made available to Sport Ireland at any stage.<br/><br/>With respect to the release of grant payments to the FAI, in line with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s code of governance and business conduct, the chief executive has the authority to pay to funded bodies that operate on an ongoing basis up to 50% of their previous year's allocation in advance of the formal approval by the board. The board of Sport Ireland is informed of payment at the next opportunity.  In recent years the FAI has written to Sport Ireland requesting an early drawdown of a portion of funding.  Sport Ireland has always demonstrated a flexibility and willingness to facilitate the FAI,<i></i>as we have with other national governing bodies, NGBs, with early drawdowns of portions of funding where possible and feasible to do so.  In assessing an early drawdown request, the following are considered: procedures within Sport Ireland&rsquo;s code of governance and business conduct; the cyclical nature of funding and Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to funding a programme beyond any one-year period; the NGBs' programme of action and programme delivery timelines; and, the risk appetite and achievement of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objectives. <br/><br/>The committee should note there are a number of reasons a funded body may request early drawdown of a portion of funding, including but not limited to the scheduling of home fixtures; financial cycles for the funded body and Sport Ireland; the hosting of major events; the timing and delivery of the funded programme and costs already incurred; and, the schedule of the Sport Ireland grant process and board decisions.  Sport Ireland pays the majority of NGBs 75% of their annual funds in January and February for the year in question.  However, board decisions on the award of funding to the FAI under the youth field sports programme is typically reached later, during quarter 2 or quarter 3.  Sport Ireland has brought forward the dates for board decision on the youth field sports programme to April, in 2018, and March, in 2019. <br/><br/>It is important to note that final payment to funded bodies in any given year<i>, </i>following formal approval by the board of Sport Ireland, is only released following the annual general meeting of the organisation, the provision of an interim report, the provision of financial statements for the preceding year, which must be reviewed and approved by Sport Ireland&rsquo;s financial controller, and the funded body meeting other compliance obligations.<br/><br/>Regarding current ongoing matters in the FAI, following media reports concerning a loan of &euro;100,000 to the organisation by its now former chief executive, and at the request of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, Sport Ireland wrote to the president of the FAI on 19 March seeking urgent clarification from the board of the FAI on the circustanmces of the loan and its repayment.  Sport Ireland also sought an explanation on why we were not notified at any stage in 2017 about any apparent deterioration in the FAI&rsquo;s financial position, which is a requirement of the terms and conditions of grant approval.  Sport Ireland received a response from the president of the FAI, which acknowledged the loan of &euro;100,000 to the FAI by its then chief executive.  However, the contents of the FAI letter did not sufficiently explain the circumstances of this loan and its repayment, nor fully address the matter of compliance with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval.<br/><br/>On Monday, 25 March, Sport Ireland again wrote to the president of the FAI re-seeking clarification on the circumstances of this loan.  More detail was also requested by Sport Ireland in order to assess compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval.  Sport Ireland also sought reconfirmation that all State funding provided to the FAI  had been spent for the purposes intended and in accordance with approved submissions.  We also asked the FAI to fully apprise us of any other significant issues that had arisen or were likely to arise, including key risks and actions proposed and how it proposed to manage them.  That was the letter.  At the time of this submission, I stated a second letter had not been received but a second letter was received last evening in the office of Sport Ireland by email and was handed delivered to Sport Ireland today at 10.45 a.m. <br/><br/>I will read the letter into the record, if that is okay.</p></speech>

It states:</p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Treacy, <br /><br />Thank you for your letter of 25 March 2019.  I apologise for the delay in responding to your letter.<br /><br />I note the concerns expressed by the Minister Ross with regards to media reports and your wish for clarification as to the circumstances of the short-term loan by the then chief executive to the association.  <br /><br />The association has engaged Mazars to carry out an independent review of all matters in this regard.  When that review is complete I will write to you in more detail in relation to the circumstances involved, as requested.  In the meantime the association will be happy to meet with you or your officials to review the association's financial records in relation to the use of State funding.<br /><br />The terms and conditions of grant approval require us to satisfy certain conditions.  I can confirm my understanding that the association has utilised all State funding in compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval. <br /><br />As you are aware from our statement of March 30 2019, the association has engaged with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and its dealings with their inquiries.  The association has established a committee, which I am chairing, to work with our external advisers to urgently address the matter of concern.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Donal Conway,<br /><br />President of the FAI.</blockquote> <p>We will be writing to the FAI probably in the next day or so.  We will be expressing our disappointment, particularly at the timing of the letter which was received yesterday evening and then hand delivered this morning.  We will be raising the context of the letter, which falls far short of what was expected from both requests by Sport Ireland.  The letter does not provide any explanation on the circumstances surrounding the loan and it repayment.  The board of the FAI has not provided any legitimate reason it cannot provide the information requested.  In the absence of information, we cannot make any adjudication on whether the terms and conditions of grant approval have been complied with.  We still await an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the loan and its repayment.  We will ask for the terms of reference of Mazars' review and an assurance that we will be consulted as part of it and that the full final report will be provided on a timely basis to Sport Ireland.  We will ask for that.We have asked for a response by close of business on Monday next.<br/><br/>I will continue now with my opening statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#J00500"><p>Sport Ireland is also aware of media reports relating to rental payments made by the FAI on behalf of its former chief executive.  Sport Ireland has no knowledge of any rental payments which may have been made.  As with any NGB for sport, staffing and contractual arrangements are entirely a matter for the board of the FAI.</p> <p>  With respect to structural changes within the FAI, following the prior release of the FAI&rsquo;s statement on the senior management structure and on 25 March, Sport Ireland received a letter from the new FAI interim chief executive, Rea Walshe, outlining structural changes within the organisation on the back of a review of its senior management structure.</p><p>The letter outlined that the board of the FAI had commissioned a review by independent consultant, Jonathan Hall &amp;amp; Associates, and had adopted its recommendations.  It stated that the chief executive officer, Mr. John Delaney, had moved to a new position of executive vice president with immediate effect, giving an overview of this specific defined role.  The letter also confirmed that Ms Walshe had been appointed as interim chief executive with immediate effect.  Notwithstanding a media release from the FAI on Saturday, 23 March, the letter of 25 March was the first occasion on which Sport Ireland was formally notified of the review of the organisation's senior management structure and the creation of the new role of executive vice president.  Sport Ireland was not consulted on the commissioning or preparation of the report.  Sport Ireland has not received a copy of the report.<br/><br/>The code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland is a resource to assist community, voluntary and charitable organisations to develop their overall capacity in terms of how they run their organisations.  It is a voluntary code provided free to all boards, committees and executives of not-for-profit groups to encourage them to check themselves against best practice in the management of their affairs.  The Government's national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies, NGBs, and local sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  As part of this process Sport Ireland will also identify and put in place the training and supports needed by the different organisations to assist with the adoption process.  Notwithstanding the fact that NGBs, such as the FAI, are independent, autonomous organisations and are responsible for their own governance procedures, Sport Ireland provides a number of governance supports to all sporting organisations to assist in their adoption of the code.<br/><br/>In 2018, representatives of the FAI attended a number of governance seminars and governance code workshops provided by Sport Ireland.  The FAI was one of the 50 sporting bodies to utilise the governance e-learning service which assists organisations on the journey to compliance with the governance code.  According to the governance code website, the FAI is on the governance code adoption journey.  Sport Ireland understands that the FAI has established a governance committee, the remit of which is to ensure the FAI is compliant with the code.<br/><br/>With regard to the term limits of boards, while Sport Ireland does not set term limits, it does support the adoption of the governance code among all funded bodies.  While the governance code does not stipulate mandatory terms for board directors, the director term of office guidance note<i></i>states that the most common practice is that directors are appointed for a three-year term and that it is considered good practice to put a limit of two or three terms on a director's service to ensure a cycle of board renewal.<br/><br/>Sport Ireland's primary aim and responsibility is the security of and return on investment for the circa &euro;2.9 million in Exchequer funding invested by Sport Ireland in the FAI on annually.  Sport Ireland is satisfied that there are effective control mechanisms and frameworks in place with regard to its investment in the FAI and that its grant funding is used for the purposes for which it was intended.  This is verified annually by signed auditor statements and approximately every three years by Sport Ireland independent auditors.  The control mechanisms and frameworks deployed by Sport Ireland with regard to its funding to the FAI can provide strong assurance to the committee.  I have described Sport Ireland's functions as per its establishing legislation, the Sport Ireland Act 2015, and its philosophy towards working with funded bodies to develop sport.  Sport Ireland is mindful of the limits of its legal powers.  Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and, notwithstanding its focus on good governance and financial management in funded bodies, we respect the autonomy of the NGBs and the collective responsibility of their boards.  We aim to develop strong sporting organisations and identify and put in place the training and supports needed by the different organisations to assist with the adoption of better governance practices.  As per the Minister's request, Sport Ireland will continue to correspond with the president of the FAI to seek clarification as outlined earlier.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its time and I welcome any questions.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Mr. Treacy's commitment and lifelong dedication to sport and the recent Irish successes in the Special Olympics in Abu Dhabi.  I also acknowledge the presence of the Special Olympics team in the Visitors Gallery, who were welcomed to the Houses earlier by Members of the Oireachtas.  Sport is very important to them and to all of us.</p> <p>  It was agreed earlier that each member will have ten minutes for questions and answers.  As Chairman, I recognise Deputy Catherine Murphy has raised this issue long before any of these controversies arose in December.  We have had a number of communications with the FAI in respect of meeting date changes and so on.  Deputy Murphy will take the first ten minute slot, followed by Deputy Rock, who has agreed to share his time with Senator O'Mahony.  The sequence is as follows: Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Rock, Deputy Troy, Deputy Munster, Senator O'Mahony, Deputy Coppinger, Deputy O'Keeffe, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Senator Feighan.  We will have a second round of questions and answers.  I will be sticking strictly to time limits and I will indicate to members when they have one minute remaining.</p></speech>

In light of the time constraints, I will try to be brief in my questions and I would appreciate it if the witnesses could give me succinct responses.  Mr. Treacy used the word "disappointment" in regard to the letter from the FAI regarding its non-compliance with the Sport Ireland request.  Sport Ireland operates specific terms and conditions in respect of grant approval, section 4.2 of which provides that Sport Ireland may request at any time, during or after a period to which grant funding relates, such information and documentation as it may reasonably require to be satisfied as to the viability and sustainability of an organisation's overall financial position.  Section 1.1 deals with sanctions and section 10.2 reiterates those sanctions.  As such, it is within the gift of Sport Ireland to not pay grants or to seek repayment of grants.  If Sport Ireland does not receive a satisfactory response by next week, what action will it take?</p></speech>

We have asked for this information and we will ask for it again tomorrow.  If we do not get a response, it will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting on Tuesday.  It is a matter for the board to decide what action needs to be taken.  If the FAI is found to be non-compliant with the terms and conditions of funding, it will require the board to consider what actions it can take.</p></speech>

With regard to the viability of the organisation, we were told the bridging loan was to bridge a short-term problem.  Does Mr. Mulvey understand what that was?  What was the first letter he received that gave him any indication of what that loan was for?</p></speech>

Incidentally, if the FAI had come to us we would have looked at it and if we could have assisted it we would have, as we have done in the past with other sporting organisations.</p></speech>

It took a long time for that amount to be paid.  Do the witnesses have concerns about the organisation's ability in 2017 and its sustainability as a going concern given that this most unusual situation arose?</p></speech>

That would be well known within sport.  We gave the FAI 50% of the funding this year; the second payment of 25% was given at the end of March.  We have no idea why that loan was given to the FAI or why it needed a loan.  That is why we are asking the question.  We put an investment in the NGB within the FAI and it is sustained investment over a long period of time.  Taxpayers' money is going into it and we have very good programmes in place.  The viability of those programmes is critically important to us.  We want to have strong organisations that do not have cashflow problems, but we also know it has debts with Aviva Stadium and it is meeting those debt requirements.  We know that is not easy either.</p></speech>

If we could multiply it by ten, I would support as much spent on sport as possible.  We are not at cross purposes on that.  However, we are examining the sustainability of an important and big organisation, and there is a doubt about that.  Will Sport Ireland do an audit in respect of that year given the things that have been unusual about it?</p></speech>

Our investment in the FAI is 50% of its total turnover.  We audit that funding and compliance with that funding.  In the case of boxing, for example, we are investing perhaps 70% or 80% of the funding so we examine that 70% or 80%.  We are examining the entire organisation in that case, but we are limited in our audit power within organisations where we are giving a relatively small level of funding-----</p></speech>

From our point of view, it is getting reassurance that the &euro;2.7 million we give it is going to the programmes that are funded by us.  Over the years we are happy overall that the money has gone towards those programmes, which are important ones.  All its other commercial activities are not within our authority or remit.  That is the problem and I do not know how we will resolve it.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy drew attention to the change in the role from CEO to executive vice president and said Sport Ireland has not been informed about that.  Sport Ireland has a document about its investment criteria and one of the criteria it will insist on is that jobs are advertised.  According to the statement, he has moved and it happened with the unanimous approval of the board.  It is highly unusual.  It is not in compliance with Sport Ireland's investment criteria.  What can Sport Ireland do about that?</p></speech>

One cannot segment something off to a corner and say the rest of the organisation does not matter.  Those investment criteria insist on a particular set of behaviours, and advertising jobs would be one of them.  I am speaking about Sport Ireland's rules.</p></speech>

We only found out after the fact that it had a new chief executive and that the former chief executive had been moved to one side.  We are coming to this not knowing the facts behind it.  We have not seen the report, but normal procedure is that those positions would be advertised.</p></speech>

I am sure that is the case with other organisations.  However, it does not appear to be reciprocated.  Certainly this response gives us the impression that this is one-way traffic.

We then have to take our fiduciary duties seriously.

First, we must not penalise the programmes by non-funding them.  We had this with boxing previously.  We separated the corporate issues from the funding issue in the sense that these are for development officers, programmes, summer programmes, social inclusion programmes and women in sport programmes.  It is not our intention that those who participate in the programmes lose momentum or funding for those programmes.  The board of the FAI has a corporate responsibility for this.  If we do not get the answers and, indeed, if the committee does not get the answers following its meeting with the association, then we have to revisit this issue with the association.  In the meantime, I do not want to get into a situation where those who need the money do not get it or there is any threat over it.</p></speech>

I have been a member of this committee for some time and I have seen how frustrated Sport Ireland was with the appointments made by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA.

I always say to the board that at any given time we are dealing with corporate governance issues in three or four organisations.  We deal with volunteers who get on boards and that is the space we are in.  We do an awful lot of training in corporate governance with volunteers and executive staff.</p><p>Sometimes there is a very good board in place and there could be change, there might be an election and there is a new board which might not have the skills required and it is back to square one again.  That happens quite often.  It is constant and one must be on the case all the time.  We do not like it when sport is in the public light as it is today.  It is not good for it.  We need to get on with our business.  Last summer was one of the most exciting sporting eras of all time in terms of the organisations we fund.  It is like sport, there are good days and bad days.  To be here talking about governance within the FAI is not a good day for sport.  We are deeply disappointed to be here talking about this issue with the committee because we should not be here talking about governance.  We expect all of our organisations which are on a journey in applying the governance code to have the highest standards.  That is what we expect from any organisation, including the FAI.</p></speech>

All of us around the table encourage people to vote for us everyday, but there is no guarantee that they will do so.  Surely Sport Ireland must do much more than encourage?  Surely there must be a requirement that there be high standards of governance, as the 2016 code of practice stipulates.  Does Sport Ireland consistently apply the same standards across all of the governing bodies of sport?   I am looking for a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

However, let us look at the standards Sport Ireland imposed on the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, in 2017.  At the beginning of June Mr. Treacy and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, warned the IABA that funding risked being suspended over a governance issue and a one-month deadline was set.  The IABA receives &euro;1.3 million annually from Sport Ireland.  The FAI receives &euro;2.7 million which is a smaller percentage of its overall pot but a substantial amount of Sport Ireland's funding.  Mr. Treacy has said Sport Ireland applies a different standard to bigger organisations than smaller ones.</p></speech>

Every year the auditors of the FAI give us a letter confirming that moneys from the Exchequer were expended for the purposes for which they had been given.  As I stated, we have used three auditors to audit the FAI, all of which have reported that the money we gave to the FAI was expended for the purposes for which it had been given.  We are satisfied with the audits we have undertaken and their findings. We are also satisfied that the investment made by the Government in the FAI is good value for money and that we get a very good return.  We have also verified that our terms and conditions of funding are met.  We are asking the FAI about the terms and conditions and the circumstances surrounding the loan.  We have acted when there is an issue and are acting now.  We are satisfied about what happened previously.  As I stated, we will be auditing the FAI in 2019.</p></speech>

We will have to make an assessment on that basis.  Tuesday's board meeting will take stock of the situation and we will receive a report from the executive on this.  It may be a later board meeting.  We will have to be reassured that everything is okay.  We have to be reassured before providing any further tranche of funding, of which 25% is left, that when we expend it the issues that have now arisen are answered to the satisfaction of the committee, as representatives of the Oireachtas in this matter, and that the Minister, given that this is a policy matter under the Act, also has engagement on it with the board of Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

Why do the witnesses think the FAI has this problem?  The FAI has stated it was a bridging loan.

This is why we have asked the questions we have asked.  We are waiting for an answer.  As the committee can see from today, we did not get an answer.  We have had experience of this down through the years.  Generally, if an organisation is in financial trouble, it comes in and speaks to us.  It might be a timing issue, such as dues or affiliation fees not being due until a month later.  We work with the organisations to oversee and make sure they meet that cashflow issue.  Many of them are very tight on funding.  This is generally the way it is done.  There is dialogue with us and we are there to help and support the organisations.  The organisations have continued and prospered.  Occasionally, they run into trouble but there is dialogue.  There was no dialogue on this.</p></speech>

My first question relates to Sport Ireland's regulatory role.  There is a slight contradiction in the opening statement, in which Sport Ireland is at pains to stress it is not a regulatory body yet the Sport Ireland Act confers considerable authority on it and, according to the opening statement, this is reinforced by responsibility for investing substantial amounts of public funding.  Sport Ireland states it is there to empower sports organisations to take responsibility for their own performance and to have best practice.  Do the witnesses agree this amounts to light touch or hands-off regulation?</p></speech>

As has been alluded to previously, best practice holds that people would not serve more than two or possibly three three-year terms on a board.  However, even after the recent reforms on the back of a review by independent consultants which Sport Ireland was not told about, the FAI directors have been in place for more than ten years and a number of them will be staying for at least another four years.  Some of the directors will have served 14 years by the time they leave the organisation.  Will Sport Ireland be saying anything to the FAI about that?</p></speech>

It is significant, even though the overall funding level is low.  Sport Ireland has said that it satisfied that the FAI has spent that funding in the way it should.

The funding has never been restored to 2008 levels.  The FAI at that time was in receipt of approximately &euro;4 million.  Its funding is now at &euro;2.565 million.  In a sense, over the past ten years, the FAI has been in a steady state.  The first year we had an increase in our budget was this year.  Previously, there was designated funding for sport, for organisations like the GPA or the women's GPA, for example.  Last year, funding was made available for the women's international soccer team, in the context of promoting women in sport.  We gave it the biggest grant, for the reason just outlined by the Deputy.  The second reason is that the sport is heavily involved in areas of urban and rural deprivation.  It has a high level of inclusion and significant funding requirements for clubs that would not be in salubrious areas of our cities, towns and rural areas.  We are conscious of that fact.

Irrespective of the corporate issues that we are discussing today, the FAI makes extraordinarily good use of the money we give it.  It also puts in a lot of matching funding, above and beyond that.

There would have been previous discussions around the grant process, the financial cycles, the likely time for board decisions and so on.  We would have obtained information on the programme delivery timelines and it is fair to say that our preference would be to wait.  However, as our chief executive has outlined, we work with organisations and want to maintain the stability of their programmes.  We want to make sure that we get good outcomes from a participation and development point of view.  If we can be flexible, we will be and it is entirely within our procedures to pay grants early.  Certainly we were given suitable assurances that there were no impending financial issues or anything of that nature.</p></speech>

Generally, the three main field sports funding comes later in the year.  While all the other NGBs have got their funding in January or February, the decisions for the three main field sports are not made until April, May or June, and that is why we have a degree of flexibility with them to give them an early 25% drawdown.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I wanted to ask have been answered.  I will come at this from a different point of view and broaden the discussion.  I was involved in association football 30 years ago and it certainly was not well organised at a national level.  I was one of those who was delighted when the Genesis report was brought in to radically overhaul the FAI governance structures.  I recall that the then Minister, John O'Donoghue, was quite right to withdraw funding until the FAI implemented many of the key recommendations.  Is Sport Ireland satisfied that the Genesis report has been implemented in full over the past 18 years?</p></speech>

Any time I have the experience of meeting boards and seeing independent people on boards, they are bringing expertise and it adds real value to boards.  It is something we strongly advocate for.  We like to see that implemented throughout the entire sports sector because it adds value and it means we have strong boards and good skills, whether legal, financial or otherwise, and they bring skills that these sporting organisations do not have.  That was a strong recommendation in the Genesis report and we continue to strongly advocate for that.</p></speech>

InsideSport is an international website which deals with these types of corporate governance issues and covers them extensively, and that is something I follow.  What I would say, and I mean this in all sincerity, is that in the past five years, the corporate governance of our sports sector has moved on considerably.  What I have found and seen is that the corporate governance in the sports sector in Ireland is far superior to the corporate governance of sports sectors in other countries.  Corporate governance in some of our national federations is far superior to the international corporate governance in international bodies.  While we are talking about a corporate governance issue here today and rightly highlighting it, we take it extremely seriously, which is a good thing.</p></speech>

Is the FAI a symptom of that?  Is it a kind of like a Goodfellas club around the world and is it the same with every organisation?  Are there the same issues with world rugby?  Perhaps Mr. Treacy could comment on UEFA and FIFA.  Obviously, the new and emerging states in Europe and the Caucasus do not have the same structures.  Is the FAI part of that gang?</p></speech>

If Senator O'Mahony wants to have a row, we can have one.  I do not want a row; I want this to go well.  I want to make a few summarising points before we come back in.  My point is that Sport Ireland does not have the power to insist on a plan for proper corporate governance for all of these bodies.  According to the terms and conditions for grant approval as set out on its application form, Sport Ireland must be satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place for the overall governance and management of an organisation before it can approve funding.  However, Sport Ireland does not have the power to address the issue.  It can audit the funding it provides, but it cannot look at the other issues from the perspective of its legislative role.  The issue is how we ensure Sport Ireland or another body has that power.</p> <p>  In regard to that question, I was interested in what Senator Feighan said about best practice in other countries.  I do not know if it is true, but I have been told that in other countries where an application for a grant is made to the national equivalent of Sport Ireland, those other issues are vetted by the charities regulator.  That regulator has statutory powers to examine the matter and refuse certification if certain conditions are not being met.  Sport Ireland might have a view on that at our next meeting.  People want certainty that these issues can never arise again or, if they do arise, that a statutory agency is able to sort them out immediately.  That is the core issue.  I do not know if the witnesses have a view on it.  If the law needs to change, we should change it.  We will suspend while we think about that.  The key is to provide an answer to whatever weaknesses exist in the law or in respect of Sport Ireland's powers or those of the committee.</p></speech>

If anybody is concerned about judgments I made earlier, or if I upset anybody, that was not my intention.  We have had a very constructive meeting thus far.   We will shortly commence our second round of questioning, sticking to the same rotation in terms of speakers.  Before calling the first speaker, I would like to make a point to Sport Ireland, which may be helpful to the meeting.  The Sport Ireland Act 2015, page 11, sets out the criteria, terms and conditions of assistance.</p><p>Section 11 of the Sport Ireland 2015, which deals with criteria, terms and conditions of assistance, states:</p><blockquote>(1) Sport Ireland&mdash;(a) shall establish such criteria, terms and conditions for the provision of assistance (including financial assistance) under <i>section 8(4)(a)</i>as, having regard to its functions, it considers appropriate, and<br /><br />(b) may establish different criteria, terms and conditions in relation to different classes of applicants and recipients.(2) Where, in Sport Ireland&rsquo;s opinion, any person or body that has applied for or received assistance under <i>section 8(4)(a)</i>fails to meet any of the applicable criteria, terms or conditions established under <i>subsection (1)</i>, Sport Ireland may do one or more of the following:(a) withhold assistance from, or refuse to provide assistance to, that person or body;<br /><br />(b) demand a refund of any financial assistance provided under that paragraph to that person or body.(3) Sport Ireland may&mdash;(a) request any person or body applying for or receiving assistance under <i>section 8(4) (a) </i>to supply Sport Ireland with information in such form and at such time as it may require, and<br /><br />(b) withhold or refuse such assistance if satisfied that any information so requested is not forthcoming.</blockquote><p>It strengthens the statutory power of Sport Ireland apart from its own terms and conditions with respect to approval.  There is a stronger base in law for the actions being taken.</p></speech>

It states that members of the FAI ratified the introduction of an eight-year term limit for board members, which is at variance with the three-year terms.  The submission indicates that as part of rule changes and to avoid immediate loss of experience and expertise from the board, it was agreed that any board member who was the chairperson of a standing committee or the national league executive committee, and who had served more than ten years on the board, may be re-elected for up to four years.  That is what has been agreed with the FAI.</p></speech>

The Genesis report was referred to earlier and there was mention of the need for independence on the board, with which I agree.  It is interesting that at the time of the Genesis report publication, the then FAI treasurer, Mr. John Delaney, said he was quite furious that it would take five years to implement some of the recommendations.  He made a strong commitment at the time and wanted that change to happen quickly.</p> <p>  We can then look at the people on the board and every one of them chairs a standing committee.  There was an extra four years on top of the ten years, and, in some cases, the period is way beyond ten years.  Some people are on the board since 2004 and 2005. That is a significant issue.  I have no doubt they bring an expertise and I do not dispute that.  Turnover and independence on the board are important nonetheless.  Does the witness have a concern that one of the ingredients in that kind of arrangement is loyalty?  There may be groupthink in that kind of environment.  We were told the loss of expertise was a concern but it is interesting that it is not just at board level that one gets expertise, as it is evident in staffing as well.  The turnover of staffing at the FAI is quite high.  Six of ten senior staff have left and four finance directors have left in the past eight or nine years.  Two commercial directors have left and there have been four different heads of communications.  Others who have left include a lawyer and deputy chief executive.  That is the profile of what is happening in an organisation.  Does the witness see that as an organisation that is functioning well with such a profile?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.519" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#V00900"><p>I had not seen the board or governance element raised by the Deputy.  I agree that there must be expertise and rotation in a board.  There are some critical pieces needed on every board, whether it is legal, accounting, human resources or whatever.  The spirit of the community and voluntary code is about board rotation.  People serve the time and move on after a period so someone else can come in and take that place.  That is the proper way for a board to function.  It paves the way for new members to come in with bright and new ideas to keep the place regenerated with ideas, etc.  It is good corporate governance.  People can stay on boards for far too long and the Deputy used the word "loyalty".  There is a clear role for the board, which is to challenge the executive and the management, making them accountable for the actions to be taken.  The boards approves and the management executes, which is the way it should be in every organisation.  If there are people on a board for too long, it can lead to a fudging of that process with respect to the balance of power.  Every board needs to challenge and set a high standard.  That is good corporate governance.</p></speech>

He said earlier that today is not a good day and it is never a good day when sport is on the front pages of newspapers for something other than winning something big.  That has been the profile over the past number of weeks.</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy said earlier there is one CEO.  This split position was unanimously adopted by that board over a short period, when it had recent sight of the report done by Jonathan Hall Associates.  Has Mr. Treacy seen the report?</p></speech>

That was approved seamlessly.  The FAI has a president and vice president.  The vice president is elected by the council but this executive vice president role happened as a consequence of this report.  It was approved unanimously by the board at a time there was a difficulty for the chief executive officer.  Does it strike Mr. Treacy that there is a connection between those elements and loyalty may well have played a part?</p></speech>

The job description for a CEO means he or she would have responsibility for all paid staff within the FAI.  It is the only way that will work.</p></speech>

Where does the balance of power fall in respect of the CEO if a new person is to stamp some authority on the organisation?</p><p>Would that be an issue in terms of governance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#W00200"><p>Yes, I would feel that.  It is hard to find an example where one would have a joint CEO.  My experience in the past is that where trade unions amalgamated one would have for a period a joint general secretary or general president until the integration of the organisation.  In some business organisations, one would have an executive chairman and a chief executive officer etc. but largely, in business management theory and practice, there is one CEO, chief executive officer, who has a reporting function to the board and, as Mr. Treacy indicated, has responsibility for the operation of the organisation.  It is hard to see it.</p> <p>  Our information is - it is as much information as the committee or the public has because we have not seen the Jonathan Hall report - that this post was identified in that report.  We are reading this at third hand, we have asked for the report, we need to obtain it and we have not obtained it to date.  If that report stated there needed to be a separation out of the functions, the chief executive had too great a workload, Mr. Delaney had been elected to the UEFA executive and then seemed to have been undertaken in this role, it appears, from what we read, he would be using his position within UEFA and within the FAI to attract to the country international competitions.  In common with Northern Ireland and with the football associations, FAs, of England, Scotland and Wales, he would be using his position within UEFA and with what used to be called the home countries to attract international competition.  We do not know.  I can only surmise he does not have a role in the national game or the national organisation beyond that.  However, I am at sea, the same as the committee.</p></speech>

Good practice and good governance would suggest that Sport Ireland would be informed of two matters: the specification, and whether we had any commentary to make on it given our experience and expertise in the area; and whether we had any role on the interview board or any other arrangement.  Sometimes we have had that role.  Sometimes there is a conundrum as to whether it is a good idea to be on a selection board.  Certainly, our view here would be the appointment should conform to what obtains in public appointments systems or proper board companies.  That would follow the code of practice for the appointment of chief executive.  Largely, that is a British code on corporate governance.  There are ways of doing this right and it should be done right.</p></speech>

We have come across this on a number of occasions where one has a high-performance director wanting to bypass the chief executive and report directly to the board.  Essentially, the boards of those national governing bodies, NGB, would come to us and look for advice.  There is a clear message here - there is only one chief executive.</p> <p>  Second, we have many NGBs that are hiring chief executives on an ongoing basis and it is normal practice that Sport Ireland nominates someone to that process.  We have an organisation development unit that gives advice in terms of job descriptions and guidance in terms of the recruitment process.  That is all there for organisations that want to avail of those services.  We have people with vast experience, not from the board or from the executive, who we nominate to sit on interview boards.</p></speech>

For instance, when the UEFA European Championship took place two years ago, did any representatives from Sport Ireland attend the tournament, and if so, was it paid for by the FAI or Sport Ireland?  I ask because there was speculation in the past week about members of this committee being invited to an FAI function.  I wish to put on the record that I did not accept the invitation to attend the draw for whatever under-17 FIFA event is taking place next week, and that I did not seek or receive any tickets at any stage.  What is the protocol for such events?  When the Olympics are held, for example, I can understand that a representative from Sport Ireland would attend and I do not mean to point a finger.  My question is whether such an arrangement could cause any subsequent difficulty with governance.</p></speech>

That is the standard procedure, as it is for all sports.  If the Irish football team was playing away in a European Championship qualifier, we would certainly not attend.  If it qualified for a European Championship, Mr. Mulvey and I would usually attend.  Sport Ireland would pay for the trip, although the FAI would provide a complimentary ticket.  We would pay for our own hotel and so on.  That is the extent of the arrangement.</p></speech>

Some 570 organisations, such as schools and organisations that are much smaller than the FAI, are able to secure accreditation and be compliant with the governance code.  I find it hard to believe that a major organisation such as the FAI is still on that journey 17 years later.  Is there a reason for that?</p></speech>

I asked about the board membership of Sport Ireland and the length of service of each member because I would expect Sport Ireland, as the overarching governing body, to lead by example.  Given that Sport Ireland stipulates that the term that people can serve is limited to three years for a maximum of two or three terms, or a total of nine years, I would expect it to lead by example.  Whether the Department or Sport Ireland makes the exemption, it is not right.  While Mr. Treacy did not state he did not have confidence in the board of the FAI, he refused quite pointedly to express confidence in it.  Is Sport Ireland not taking financial sanctions against the board purely because it fears that any financial cuts will hurt athletes, rather than the people we might want to affect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#X01900"><p>Financial sanctions are always the last resort and we do not like to use them.  We will undergo a process.  We are certainly very disappointed with the letter that we received before this meeting, which was reflected in my comment.  One would not expect such a reply.  I had written an important letter but the response was disappointing.  If we decided to cut funding for the FAI tomorrow morning, we would have already given 50% of the funding this year and we would give the rest of the funding by August or September.  There would be a little time, therefore, but if we cut funding, people would ultimately be let go, while programmes that had been invested in throughout the communities would cease to exist.  That is the tricky aspect that we must balance, but we have not yet struck that balance.  In general, if we intend to cut funding, we send our auditors, and if they return with verified critical issues, we enter that territory and the board decides.</p></speech>

On what actions Sport Ireland can take, Mr. Treacy stated its powers are restricted.  As part of the Government's national sports policy of 2018, did Sport Ireland request any additional powers in order that it could have greater oversight of the governance of sporting bodies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#X02100"><p>I always say one does not impose governance; rather, the organisations must buy into it.  That is our approach and it is why Sport Ireland has an organisation and development unit, which proclaims and discusses governance and sets standards.  That is the only way it can work.  It is the spirit within a sporting organisation.  The principles of governance, whether leadership, exercising control of the organisation, accountability or transparency, come from the top of the organisation, not from Sport Ireland, and the top of the organisation needs to buy into the principles.  If the leadership does not apply the principles of the code, it is futile.</p></speech>

It is hard to challenge somebody, however, who sits around the table day in, day out, and is part of the decision-making process.</p><p>Governance is an issue.  There is no leadership there.  What can we do to ensure we have greater influence and control regarding this area?  </p><p> It was stated that the 2015 Act allowed Sport Ireland to conduct a wider audit in 2016 because it widened the scope.  I still come back to the fact that in the high-level review, the following areas were looked into and the statement from Sport Ireland failed to explicitly state that corporate governance was looked into as part of the 2015 Act.  I think that is wrong.  I think it should have been looked into.  </p><p> When someone asked about more frequent audits, Mr. Mulvey said Sport Ireland wishes the money to be spent on sports - sports participation and promotion.  That is very important.  I looked at the 2017 annual report published by Sport Ireland.  It showed that at 31 December 2017, almost &euro;700,000 was spent on legal fees and conciliatory and arbitration payments.  In the year ending 31 December 2016, almost &euro;2 million of Sport Ireland's funding went on legal fees and arbitration payments.  Sport Ireland may not be able to supply that today-----</p></speech>

This is a legacy issue.  The legal expenses incurred by Sport Ireland constitute a legacy issue from a previous organisation called the National Campus Development Authority in a legal case involving the National Aquatic Centre.  That is still ongoing.  In fact, it was heard again in the High Court after the plaintiff appealed again.  It has been ongoing since 2003 and accounts for the vast bulk of that expenditure.  It is an inherited legal case that the new body took over regarding the National Sports Campus.  It goes back to 2003.  I brought my concerns to the attention of four successive Ministers.  My concerns were about the continuation of this case and what it was costing and my concern that Sport Ireland should not be obliged to fund this and that it should be funded by the Exchequer directly from the Department because we never authored or brought this case.  It is one of these legacy cases.  I must be careful as it is still being heard in the High Court but that is where that arises.</p></speech>

I have no problem in doing so.<br/><br/>Regarding the second issue relating to corporate governance, we need to be clear.  The chief executive said that we are not a regulatory authority.  We are not the Charities Regulator, which lays down and will expect a code.  The Companies Act 2014 lays down criteria for governance for companies regarding how they should be run.  If there is a problem with the corporate governance of a company, and some sporting organisations are companies, it is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement that has the regulatory and investigative function.  It is not in the Act.  Policy may change on this and it might be a matter for the committee or Minister to change this.  What I do not want to do is get into a situation where Sport Ireland spends all of its money that is supposedly devoted to the promotion of sports nationally and internationally on legal matters and is in and out of the courts regarding the enforcement of bodies where other bodies have the regulatory authority to enforce but may not be doing so.  One of the things that has amazed me in all of this concerns where the auditors were.  If the auditors did not spot this and it was not reported to them, is the appellate body or investigative body of Chartered Accountants Ireland, which has regulatory powers, going to call in the auditors?  We have seen this in corporate Ireland for an awful long time.  I read an article the other day in the <i>Irish Independent</i>from somebody who sat on the Anglo Irish Bank board telling us we had light regulation.  He happened to be chairman of the audit and risk committee in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008.  We are paying &euro;29 billion for that lack of oversight and he has the absolute cheek to write in a national newspaper-----  </p></speech>

It probably suits some of the politicians here to blame Sport Ireland when questions could have been asked by politicians over the years along with successive Ministers for sport.  The witnesses from Sport Ireland state that it does not impose governance and that it must be bought into but it has not been bought into in the case of the FAI.  The witnesses would agree with that.  The only sanction Sport Ireland has is the withholding or withdrawal of grant.</p></speech>

We have a process to go through.  All of these things need to be discussed by the board itself so there is a process.  The Deputy rightly identified the major issue here, which is around the staff employed by the FAI in terms of the funding.  It is a critical issue but it is also the investment in those programmes over a long period of time because we have invested significantly in these programmes, which are very effective.

That is the market they are in at any given time.  The team that was in place was very expensive.  I am not quite sure about the team in place now but it is not as expensive.  That is a matter for the FAI.  We do not ever get into that territory with it.  It has to respond to the marketplace and that is what it does.  If we want a quality manager, we have to pay for a quality manager.  The Deputy would be better off putting that question directly to the FAI next week.</p></speech>

I am aware that several councils such as Fingal County Council, which is my local council, have introduced pitch fees which are crippling for many local grassroots teams.  Sport Ireland is pumping a certain amount of money in but there is a big hole at the other end of the boat.  Would Mr. Treacy not have thought of at least asking some questions about that?</p></speech>

Programmes are run by all the organisations.  In every sport, parents pay affiliation fees and pay for time in swimming pools, on pitches and so forth.  It is the normal course of sporting organisations running their business.  Sports do that an ongoing basis.  We have all had children playing rugby or soccer or whatever and paying their fees weekly.  That is just the way sport is organised.</p></speech>

As Mr. Treacy knows, the women's soccer team had to threaten strike action because of the treatment it was suffering, with shoddy tracksuits, equipment, etc., and lack of status.  In 2017, Sport Ireland paid &euro;1.6 million to the Gaelic Players Association, GPA, men and &euro;500,000 to the GPA, women, but it gave only &euro;145,000 to women in soccer that year, which is a lot less than it gave the Gaelic players.  It then gave the team special funding of &euro;195,000 following protests by the players.  Should Sport Ireland have been monitoring that situation more?  Participation of women in sport should be one of its goals.</p></speech>

Our view in Sport Ireland is that is not really the best mechanism because either particular sports or individual organisations within sports are singled out.  In that context, our view has been, and we have put this to successive Ministers, that we would prefer, particularly in the area of women in sport, that a fund is given to Sport Ireland and we make the decisions when and where it is appropriate to do so.  We have continued to make that point.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that we know on the ground.  The GAA is sometimes different in this regard.  When we have international teams in cricket, rugby, the FAI, basketball or hockey, the women have an equal right with the male team to participate.  We felt that singling out women's participation in particular sports was discriminatory, that the fund should be given to Sport Ireland and that we would receive applications from the national governing bodies, NGBs, in the context largely of the international representation, apart from our indigenous games, and decide that there was a case there.  That is our view still.  This year, the Government took a step in that direction by giving us &euro;2 million for women and we have allocated that in response to the applications we got from the NGBs.  That is the way forward, rather than specifically in a one or two year budget giving it to a particular programme.</p> <p>  When the dispute broke out on the women's FAI international team I was very conscious of dispute resolution.  We appointed Peter McLoone, the former president of congress and the general secretary of IMPACT at the time, as a mediator.  He mediated a settlement but from my discussions, I do not believe all commitments made arising from that mediation have been fulfilled to date.  It is something we still have to address.</p></speech>

It is a totally different mindset and way.  I know this from different matters, including aviation and the Commission for Aviation Regulation and so on.  The witnesses are right.  I fully accept that and it is important to make that distinction or draw that line in the sand.  That is not the role of Sport Ireland, nor do I think it should be.</p> <p>  From my perspective, there is a significant level of integrity, openness and calling it as it is in Sport Ireland and the people involved in it.  It is important to state that and I appreciate that.  Overall, the organisation is doing a very fine job, it is very genuine and committed.  There is a separation between Sport Ireland and the governing bodies.  The latter have a particular role, particularly when they are companies limited by guarantee, as is the case with the FAI.  From memory, the FAI got a clean audit from a very reputable firm in 2017, which was the year for which accounts were most recently lodged in the Companies Office.</p><p>My understanding is that that loan was provided in May and was repaid in July or August.  If that was the situation, a person looking at the accounts at year end will ask two questions.  He or she would wonder whether the loan was repaid, meaning that it may not be a factor from an auditor's perspective, and would also wonder about the materiality of it.  The FAI's turnover for the year in question was just north of &euro;50 million.  Some 6% of that approximately &euro;51 million came from Sport Ireland.  It is a significant amount of money, but is not huge when compared with the overall.  Sport Ireland made a profit of approximately &euro;2.7 million, and had net total assets of around &euro;22.5 million.  If a sanction was created, perhaps by withholding the second part of the payment from the FAI, it seems that its finances are in a good enough position that it would still be well able to look after the grassroots.  I am aware that there is a process in place to deal with that, but it is ultimately a factor that makes people sit up and think, and reflect.  It is not the style of Sport Ireland, nor should it be.  <br/><br/>I had to leave for a meeting earlier, so perhaps my next question has already been answered.  Were any red flags raised around the FAI over the last couple of years?  Was there anything that gave Sport Ireland pause or reason to believe that it should look at the FAI?  Was there any sense of a domino effect?  <br/><br/>Bodies in receipt of reasonably significant State funding, from Sport Ireland or otherwise, should be compelled to have an independent board governance audit carried out.  The Institute of Directors can do that, and others do it as well.  It is not very expensive, and in my view it should be done at least once every five years.  A body which grants funds has fixed criteria when it comes to decisions to grant, but there is much more involved for organisations such as the FAI which can have a material effect on the overall benefits of the process.  I suggest there should be a wider governance code in place, not a regulatory code.  I was surprised, like Senator Feighan, that there are 575 companies listed on <i>governance.ie</i>in class A, class B or class C.  The FAI is in class C on that website, but is not included.  That would be a flag for me.  What is Mr. Treacy's opinion on that? </p></speech>

It writes a statement to Sport Ireland to say that the money that we provided to it was expended for the purposes for which it was given.  Sport Ireland in turn sends our own independent auditors.  We have used three different companies to audit the FAI over the last number of years, all of which have come back with a clean audit and essentially confirmed that the money we provided to it was expended for the purposes for which it was given.  This is how we audit the funding we provide.</p> <p>  In terms of red flags, we had a long discussion here around salaries and the recent report.  These are serious issues which have only recently arisen.  We have written to the FAI about these things, and received another reply today which was not comprehensive.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#AA00800"><p>We undertake that kind of assessment at the moment in our learning and development programmes.  One of the issues about sporting organisations at the moment, given the proliferation in size, income stream and participation is that it is a wide church.  However, there are principles that should apply irrespective of size.  The Senator is quite right to say that there should be good, robust internal governance, meaning that people who have nothing to do with the organisation who have legal financial, marketing or commercial expertise should be brought on board.  The problem with some sporting organisations is that they are transitioning from self-regulated volunteer organisations made up of people who have participated in the sport over a long period of time or who are parents with children involved with the sport.  We must now move beyond that approach.  We are moving into bigger financial and participation spaces.  We also have to consider not just issues of good governance but child safety, child protection, health and safety and vetting.  We have undertaken and discharged all of these functions.  We also have to maintain professional input at executive and high-performance level, without leaving out volunteers, who we need in sports every day of the week, or tell them that they are not good enough to be on a board.  The Special Olympics, Paralympics and the Community Games cannot survive without volunteers, and we have to be careful not to exclude them from the centre of policy decision making.  They are vitally important, and they should be allied with the experts in terms of governance.</p> <p>  Ireland is struggling with corporate governance generally.  The charity sector has had very bad experiences in that area.  The sports sector has not, thankfully, had many problems with corporate governance, but other areas where State agencies have had to come into the private sector.  We are moving on and are grappling with the issue of corporate governance.  We are not the only country in the world having difficulties with this.  This is a moving part here, and we have to get to the stage where we are confident that the rules, laws, regulations and statutory instruments and the voluntary codes are adhered to, not just in spirit but in reality.  That is an educational and supervisory exercise.  One size does not fit all, but Sport Ireland calls different organisations in to make presentations about their policies and plans.  It is incumbent on Mr. Treacy, myself and other members of the board that we meet the chief executives, the high performance directors and the volunteers and go to their functions and events.  It is not all about attending at international competitions.  We have to be there in order to talk to them, to present their awards, to assist them in giving the kind of policy direction they require, and to thank and congratulate them for what they do and on their great achievements.  The story of Irish sport is extraordinary.  As Mr. Treacy said earlier, last year we won more medals internationally than ever before in a multiplicity of sports.  We are not just talking about boxing any more, but sports that many of us have never heard of.  Our Special Olympians acquit themselves extraordinarily well.  They are ambassadors, as are the Paralympians.</p><p>We will have Olympians going to Tokyo.  We hope to have the biggest team ever but we have to make sure they are nurtured, minded, supported and funded.  Behind all of those teams are boards, high performance people and development officers.  We have a series of local sports partnerships the length and breadth of the country.  I refer to the amount of work they do.  We also do dormant funding, which the members, as a committee, and the Government have gladly given to us.  In that regard, because of my work in Dublin's inner city I saw women playing soccer last night under floodlights in Sheriff Street.  That is what we need to do.  We have to make sure that happens across the country, that they have the best of facilities and that they can get as much as we can provide.</p><p> We have had ten lean years of funding for sport.  Thankfully, that changed last year, and I hope it will change further.  Our athletes need it.  I refer to what Deputy Coppinger said.  I do not believe people who use pitches should be asked for fees.  They are supplied by the State and councils.</p></speech>

It has been very co-operative in providing assistance to us because our campus is based within its planning area.  It has been very helpful to us, and I hope that continues.  The only way we will bring sport to the level to which it should be brought is to move on all fronts, and incidents like this set us back.</p></speech>

For example, Sport Ireland would want to know what will be its pot of funding.  When the likes of the FAI makes a submission for the coming year on grant aid funding, how far above or below the amount requested would it be allocated?  Before the budget each year, everybody has their hands open looking for millions of euro.  For example, the health service would be hoping to get more money than what is announced on budget day.  Are organisations fairly good in regard to their requests for funding to keep the show going?  For example, last year Sport Ireland gave them &euro;2.7 million, give or take.  Did they look for &euro;3.5 million?  Do they go way above the figure they believe they will get in their requests or are they understanding of the position on funding?</p></speech>

They are very strong in their advocacy around that.  They do it through their submissions to Sport Ireland, and our submission to the Government, but they also go in and meet the Ministers.  That is the way things are done.  When Sport Ireland went to meet the Ministers on this issue we also had a good hearing with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for sport.  We also met members of the Opposition who gave us a good hearing.  I felt for the first time that we were beginning to make substantive inroads in increasing funds for sports all round.  Sports organisations, particularly those involved in the main field sports, are great advocates for their sport but they have a lot of clout outside Sport Ireland as well.</p></speech>

I want to pay tribute to the colleagues in the Department because civil servants have worked hard to ensure they made the case for sports funding across the various Departments, along with the Ministers.  Everyone has bought into this and everyone is aligned in terms of the need for and importance of funding for sport.  It is important to state that we are all aligned in terms of the requirement to increase the budget for sport and I pay tribute to Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas and civil servants who have worked hard to make that happen.</p></speech>

The Minister made a special allocation in that regard last year.  Our view is that we would prefer women in sport would come through our programmes and that we would deal directly with the sporting organisations but sometimes there is a realpolitik around these issues.  I am always conscious that there are women's teams participating in different sports internationally which do not have the same clout and we need to advocate on their behalf.</p></speech>

That might be something we would come back to, possibly tomorrow.</p> <p>  Regarding the loan, one of the issues I would ask Sport Ireland to examine is that the loan was given at a particular time of the year and we were then told it was paid following the submission of an invoice.  An invoice is for a service as opposed to a loan.  When it is considering its response Sport Ireland might consider that particular issue, which stood out to me as being fairly strange.</p><p> The other aspect I want to cover is included in Mr. Treacy's opening statement.  The 2016 audit identified a number of things, including the board and committee structure, financial management, whistleblowing and a code of conduct.  I refer, in particular, to whistleblowing or the lack of it.  Many people have spoken to me in recent months about the FAI and one recurring issue is that people believe they might suffer consequences if they raise issues.  An individual club might lose out on a grant or people who are or were employed in the FAI might be affected.  Does Sport Ireland engage with the FAI on such issues?  Can people in any sports organisation make whistleblowing complaints to Sport Ireland?  I am talking about people who work in an organisation.</p></speech>

Our internal auditors look for the existence of whistleblowing policies when they audit governing bodies of sport or a local sports partnership as part of our internal audit programme.  It will occasionally be found that a whistleblowing policy is not in place.  The audit will then recommend that one be instituted.  Implementation of that recommendation will be monitored by the Sport Ireland executive.</p></speech>

I may address that issue with the FAI next week.  Would Sport Ireland be made aware of any abnormal pay-out for things such as court activity in respect of harassment or such issues?  Would it be brought to the attention of Sport Ireland?  Should it be something that should be brought to its attention?  I am referring to the FAI or any other organisation.</p></speech>

I know that some claims came through the adjudication service that involved sports organisations.  I cannot recall the incidents, but there may have been two or three from different organisations.

I will move back to the issue of staff turnover at a high level and the impact on an organisation's functioning.  I read a newspaper article in which it was mentioned that people were complaining about things like internal relationships, not being able to talk to the same person repeatedly, the lack of continuity, etc.  Would Sport Ireland enter into dialogue with an organisation on a high staff turnover and its impact on the health of the association?  The turnover in the FAI does seem to be extraordinarily high, among senior people in particular.</p></speech>

Some of the staff we know of would have ended up in key posts with other sports organisations.  There might be a mix between people who are dissatisfied with the way they were treated or with their pay and others who are seeking promotion.  However, it is a high turnover.</p></speech>

There have been issues in other sports organisations in the past.  They include most recently the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, Basketball Ireland and Swim Ireland, all of which have had their funding cut at some stage.  It might be better to say funding was suspended or that there was at least a threat that it would happen.  I may be wrong, but a consistent approach is not taken in dealing with different sports bodies.  If that is the case, is it not sending the wrong message?  Let us examine the manner in which the FAI has treated Sport Ireland in the last fortnight.  I am referring to the letters sent, the decision made without consultation on the new position created, the original letter which did not answer the question posed by Sport Ireland and the most recent letter which arrived at the eleventh hour.  The FAI is not responding satisfactorily to the concerns of Sport Ireland and the requests made.  That has been confirmed by Sport Ireland today.  There is an inconsistency in the approach being taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-03a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019040300002#CC02200"><p>That is a little unfair.  There is a process to be gone through when we get to the point of pulling the trigger on suspending or withholding funding.  We have asked questions and not received answers.  I agree with the Deputy.  What we have received today is totally inadequate and we will be writing to the FAI along those lines tomorrow.  The board of Sport Ireland makes those decisions.  We are due to meet next week when all of these things will be considered.  However, we need to go through a process and it is only fair that we do so.</p></speech>

He also refers to recent commentary on rental payments.  It may not be Sports Ireland's responsibility <i>per se</i>, but there is great concern when we read stories about our international women's football team having to change in airport toilets and share tracksuits.  Sport Ireland made a special once-off payment of &euro;195,000 in 2018 for the women's international team.  It might not have direct responsibility for rental and contractual arrangements, but there is concern that such allocations are diverting necessary funding.  I refer to the FAI relying more on Sport Ireland rather than ensuring its funding is put to better use.</p></speech>

There should be transparency around all of those issues.  In regard to the funding of organisations, Sport Ireland contributes &euro;1 and the FAI contributes &euro;4.  Transparency in respect of CEO salary, rental agreements and so on, such that everybody can see it, is good corporate governance.</p></speech>

We all acknowledge those achievements but we are here today to try to get to the bottom of issues and to consider how we can improve further.  It was stated that the sporting organisations have come a long way.  However, there have been many scandals and issues arising in our sporting bodies over the last number of years.  Despite that, there are still governance issues in some bodies.  It appears that even when one body is caught, others fail to take note that they are being watched or to take action to get their act together.  </p> <p>  Sport Ireland has an audit and risk committee which, according to the report, comprises two board members and two independent members.  The role of the audit and risk committee is to support the board in its responsibilities around risk, control, governance and associated assurance.  According to the report, the committee also has a role in respect of governance.  In regard to the two independent members, am I correct that one is a former board member of Sport Ireland and the other is an official of the Department of Justice and Equality?  </p></speech>

Oversight of governance is a function of Sport Ireland as well.  We have rigorous processes around all of our funding.  We deal with risk at a very high level within all of the different units and senior managers report to the audit committee on a regular basis, providing their risk profile across the various programmes that they operate.  They also handle issues highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Financial statements are approved by them.  The right expertise is on that audit committee.

Two new members were added in the last year or so.  An external member was added the year before that from the Department of Justice and Equality.  As well as that, the audit and risk committee reviews its effectiveness on an annual basis.  Previous reviews would have identified gaps and those gaps have been filled, as appropriate.  In terms of additional expertise, last year a former board member with specific experience in financial matters and auditing was appointed to the audit and risk committee.</p></speech>

There is a real alignment between Sport Ireland, the institute of sport, and the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  We are all on the same team now.  We are all wearing the same jersey, which is really good news.  There is real leadership coming from the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  Importantly for us, it is now making inroads with the corporate sector and getting sponsors on board.  It is very good news.

It is on occasions like that it arises.</p> <p>  Many of our governing bodies work on a tight budget.  They do not have commercial incomes or gate receipts and, to a large degree, depend heavily on funding.  They are always tight on funding.  We have been encouraging all of them, if they have a debt in a given year, to start reducing it because one does not want it building up and, in fact, we try to encourage the NGBs to have a little bit in reserve going into every year.  That is the model for the future.</p></speech>

It is astounding after the association was so financially successful.  I cannot get it, as an accountant.</p></speech>

The integrity of their work and commitment to sport is clear to everybody.  The weakness of the law is also exceptionally clear.  As a State, a Government and an Oireachtas, we must ensure greater accountability from bodies such as the FAI if the legislation is not strong enough to provide the answers we want.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again tomorrow morning and should meet the representatives of Sport Ireland again soon.  Perhaps they could reflect on, in the meantime, and advise us what best practice is on the issues that have been raised.  We need to address that to have greater power and authority, whether that will lie with Sport Ireland, the charity regulator or whatever body is appropriate.  We need to ensure all these issues can be fully and properly addressed.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members.  I know people might have been unhappy with some of my timelines but, as an Oireachtas committee, we conducted this debate fairly, objectively, appropriately and within all the rules and regulations by which we must abide.  The truth and facts that have come out here today are important and will influence policymakers, politicians and, most of all, the court of public opinion.  The public is interested in all of these issues and I look forward to continuing our discussion with Sport Ireland in the future.</p></speech>
