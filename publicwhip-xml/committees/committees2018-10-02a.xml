I have met many representatives of farming bodies and organisations, as has the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to listen to the issues at the heart of the farming community.  As the 2019 Estimates process is not finalised, members can appreciate that I am not in a position to discuss the finer details of my Department's proposals.  I will focus on expenditure so far in 2018, and in the coming months as well as the challenges for 2019.</p> <p>  It is important to note the ongoing vital contribution the agrifood sector makes to the economy, particularly the rural economy, as well as the important role the international trading environment plays in sustaining this contribution.</p><p>It is important to note the ongoing vital contribution that the agrifood sector makes to the Irish economy, particularly the rural economy, as well as the important role the international trading environment plays in sustaining this contribution.  It is clear the biggest challenge comes in the form of Brexit.  The sector employs 173,000 people, including those involved with primary production and processing and in the food and beverages sector, which has a total of almost 8% of total employment in 2017.  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector is our shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025, and having direct input from all stakeholders in the agrifood supply chain, along with the Department and State agencies in strategy formation and implementation, is crucial.</p><p> In terms of responding to the significant challenges we face as a sector, from Brexit to climate change to geopolitical developments outside our control, doubling down on the key Food Wise themes of market development competitiveness, innovation, human capital and environmental sustainability is more important than ever.  Brexit poses enormous challenges for the agrifood and fisheries sectors by virtue of their exposure to the UK market.  The United Kingdom is Ireland&rsquo;s largest export market for agrifood products at &euro;5.2 billion in 2017, while Ireland is the UK&rsquo;s largest export market at &euro;4.1 billion of products in 2017.  The most immediate impact of Brexit has been the difficulties caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro.  Possible long-term impacts relate to the potential need to apply import controls in respect of animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin imported from the UK, the certification of Irish agrifood exports to the UK and the possibility of a hard Brexit resulting in tariffs on trade.  The challenge has been to take effective steps to mitigate the immediate impacts and to intensify market diversification efforts in order to reduce our exposure to the UK market.  These challenges are being addressed through budgetary measures covering building competitiveness and resilience on and off farm, and through market diversification and development.</p><p> Brexit preparation is complicated by uncertainty surrounding the current negotiations and the potential final trading relationship between the EU and the UK.  Nevertheless, my Department&rsquo;s Brexit planning, guided by recent Government decisions, is well advanced.  Officials have been working with other Departments and agencies to ensure they are prepared to fulfil their legal obligations as efficiently as possible when the UK exits the EU.  I am pleased that significant progress has been made in the development of a long-term investment loan scheme for Irish SMEs, including farmers.  This scheme has been developed by my Department in co-operation with the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance, the European Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  By its nature, the detail of this scheme has taken time to develop and negotiate between all the parties involved.</p><p> This scheme will be of particular benefit to the Irish agrifood sector, including farmers, the seafood sector and agrifood businesses.  It will enable them to invest in their businesses and innovate for future growth.  This is a key Brexit response for which I made financial provision in budget 2018.  This will bring longer term unsecured investment finance to the Irish market in the region of eight to ten years, with interest rates typically less than 5%.  This type of long-term unsecured investment finance is not currently available for many farmers and food businesses or the seafood sector.  This has been identified as a critical need.  The loan scheme will be of particular benefit to young and new entrant farmers, as well as smaller scale farmers who typically have less bargaining power with their banking institutions.</p><p> In terms of efforts towards market diversification, Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia and Africa.  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets and I am ready to respond to other opportunities that may arise.  In keeping with Food Wise 2025 priorities, I led a successful trade mission to the US and Canada in February, while in May I led a trade mission to China.  For the remainder of 2018, I will lead a trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will travel to China in November.  These and other missions planned for 2019 will serve to enhance and improve existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products.  The destinations are in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise completed by Bord Bia in December 2017 at my request.  Bord Bia's resources have been increased significantly over recent years, together with an increased focus by my Department&rsquo;s market access team on opening new markets, particularly for meat exports.  In terms of product diversification, I am pleased to note that the funding provided for the prepared consumer food centre at Ashtown is making good progress.</p><p>This is to address the situation where, traditionally, investment in research and development within the sector has been low throughout the industry given that 76% of prepared consumer food companies in Ireland are small.  The &euro;5 million is being used for the purchase of specialist processing and packaging equipment, which companies can pilot with a view to scaling up their production and-or their operations.</p><p> Overall in 2018, the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to &euro;1.557 billion.  Our expenditure to date is &euro;977 million, which is &euro;113 million ahead of the same time last year.</p><p> We are now entering year four of our seven-year rural development payment, RDP, scheme and many of our schemes are reaching peak payment rates.  Earlier this year, I presented a review of our RDP expenditure to this committee.  As I stated then, projections are that the RDP will not just be fully spent but will require &euro;105 million of transitional funding from the next programme, additional to the &euro;4 billion provided for if implementation continues at current levels.</p><p> Delivering on the RDP is challenging and I am delighted that Ireland is performing well.  Ireland leads in implementation and has the second highest rate of drawdown of EU funds among member states.  The allocated budget for 2018 for the RDP is &euro;625 million and I expect this to be fully spent.  This includes the increased allocation of &euro;25 million to the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme announced in budget 2018.   A sum of &euro;186 million was issued for 2018 ANC payments in September, an increase of &euro;23 million compared with this time last year, and the vast majority of the additional allocation is distributed.  Some 19,000 farmers continue to participate in the sheep welfare scheme in year 2.  Advance payments are due to commence in November 2018.  It is estimated that expenditure in 2018 will total &euro;18 million.  I will make full provision in the Estimates for our commitments to participants under the RDP schemes in 2019.</p><p> This year has proved to be exceptionally difficult year in terms of weather, with storms early this year turning to drought conditions with consequent implications for fodder availability.  In supporting farmers through this time, I implemented a number of measures.  I allocated funding to support the importation of up to 85,000 tonnes of fodder and &euro;2.75 million towards incentivising the production of fodder on up to 25,000 ha of arable lands that would normally lie fallow over the winter period.  These measures, coupled with additional flexibilities for later application of fertiliser granted under the nitrates regulations and additional flexibilities under the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme, are maximising fodder availability.  While many farms remain in deficit, these measures have resulted in improving the fodder situation throughout the country.</p><p> The seafood industry faces ongoing challenges, including the significant Brexit challenge.  In 2018, by providing world-class landing facilities for our industry such as the Department's investment for a major quay extension in Castletownbere, County Cork, which will double landing facilities on Dinish Island, we are protecting our coastal communities.  Together with a range of investments in products and markets funded under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, seafood development programme, we are creating the opportunity for the seafood industry to continue to expand and prosper.  I recognise that such support has never been more important given the particular challenges faced by the sector.</p><p> The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post-2020 reform presents a different set of challenges.  It comes against the backdrop of Brexit and other newer European Union priorities such as security and migration, and the global challenge of climate change.  The European Commission's proposals involve new ambition, in terms of the environment and climate change, an increased emphasis on knowledge transfer, technology adoption and competitiveness, and new incentives for young farmers, all while maintaining vital supports for farm income.  The budgetary allocation for the 2021 to 2027 period will be a critical determinant of how those challenges can be met.</p><p> I have been working hard with my European colleagues to secure agreement on the restoration of the CAP budget to current levels in the next period.  This effort has paid dividends as up to 20 member states have joined this alliance and we will continue to work together to build consensus on this point.  As we go into another reform, I will continue work with my colleagues in Europe to ensure the best deal is secured for farmers, the agricultural sector and the rural economy as a whole.</p><p> As mentioned earlier, I am conscious that this has been a difficult year for the beef sector in the context of weather and the associated range of challenges.  My Department is continuing to examine appropriate measures to support all agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector.  This is a particular focus in terms of our policy negotiation objectives in the next CAP reform and we will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector.  </p><p> I would like to make an important point.  As a community, we in Ireland must embrace the challenge of addressing climate change and other environmental imperatives.</p><p>Agriculture will have to make its contribution, and it is clear that any new CAP must be configured to help us to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018100200002#O00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending this meeting, the purpose of which is to discuss key issues in advance of the budget.  I will start with one of the Minister's final points, which is the need for additional supports for the beef sector and, in particular, the suckler cow sector.  We have discussed this issue on many occasions in the D&aacute;il and I have pointed out that it must be prioritised.  The Minister will know from the National Ploughing Championships that it is being prioritised by farming organisations as well.  Indeed, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has produced a report and research on the suckler cow sector and the benefit of any additional support that would go to it.</p> <p>  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that it is simply a matter for the next CAP.  The beef sector is under massive pressure at present and many farmers are considering their future in the suckler sector.  They are looking to the Minister and the Government for an indication, at a minimum, of movement towards the introduction of a payment of &euro;200 per suckler cow and progress on that in this budget.  We must get to the stage where that is in place.  We can discuss the format and how it is introduced, but the Minister has an opportunity in the budget to do something to indicate to the beef and suckler cow sector that he understands its very precarious situation.  That requires movement from the Minister on additional funding for the suckler cow sector.  I hope we will see something in that regard next week.  The Minister's stance so far has been that he would not consider it.  The furthest he has gone, and that is only belatedly, is to say it is something he would consider as part of the next CAP.  That simply does not wash and is insufficient.  Farmers need to see something happening in this budget.</p> <p>  Another key issue for priority - the Minister addressed it earlier - is the imminent fodder crisis, particularly the need for short-term support in the form of a low-interest loan scheme to assist farmers with the pressure many are under after the drought in the summer in respect of merchant debt and short-term credit.  Again, the farming organisations have been clear in seeking assistance from the Government in that regard, specifically seeking a loan scheme under the auspices of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to assist farmers with the credit pressure they are under.  That must be addressed in the budget.  Unfortunately, the Minister's lack of delivery regarding the Brexit loan scheme is simply unacceptable.  It is almost a year since the funding was allocated for that, but the scheme is still not in place.  As winter approaches, it will be important to have an allocation for a hardship scheme for farmers who might find themselves in a difficult position.  We hope that will not come to pass but it is important that provision is made for it.</p> <p>  Another key issue, and I seek feedback from the Minister on this as it is not the first budget in which it has been presented to him, is the farm management deposit scheme.  Given the volatility of the sector, it is an additional income volatility tool to provide additional assistance and capacity to farmers to be able to manage their income, plan ahead and be in a position to buffer against pressures such as those we have seen this year.</p> <p>  In addition, I wish to raise the issue of harness racing, which the committee has discussed on a few occasions.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on it.  The committee has been in correspondence with the Minister regarding seed capital to support that.  Will an allocation be made in the budget?</p><p>It is important to refer to the current price of beef with the Minister today and the difficulties being experienced by farmers in that regard.  The beef forum is coming up this week.  The forum last met in February but it has failed the beef sector so far.  The price of beef in the UK has been increasing in recent weeks while pressure is being exerted by the factories on the beef price here.  In the context of the upcoming budget and with the beef forum due to meet this week, the Minister must address the unacceptable situation whereby prices are being squeezed.  In particular, I urge the Minister to ensure that at the beef forum this week he makes it crystal clear to the factories that a fair price must be given to farmers, especially given the additional pressures they have experienced because of the weather this year, with many having to sell additional stock.  That must not be used by the factories to cut margins further and leave farmers in an even more difficult situation.  </p><p> I know we are discussing the budget today but if a hard Brexit comes to pass next March, that will be an earthquake-like shock to the agriculture sector.  It is absolutely critical that the Minister makes provision in this year's budget for that possibility so that the Department is in a position to assist the sector and to mitigate against the challenges that a hard Brexit presents.  I hope the Minister will give us some clarification today and an update on the supports that will be made available and the provisions that will be made in this year's budget in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018100200002#P00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance today.  I attended a meeting last night in Ballinasloe on the issue of the suckler herd and I estimate there were between 400 and 500 farmers present.  They were all feeling huge pressure because of the impact of the beef sector on the suckler cow sector.  They are in a real crisis.</p> <p>  As I pointed out last night, it is four years since farmers protested outside supermarkets and meat factories around the country because of the pressure they were under.  While the beef forum was set up in response, it has not worked.  It has been a failure because farmers are still in the same position.  Farmers are demanding that the Government ensures that they get fair play with regard to price.  A package also needs to be put in place to support the suckler cow sector if it is to have a future.  The Government must show that it is prepared to invest in the sector and that it understands the plight of suckler farmers who are mainly along the western seaboard and in the Border region.  A full 80% of the stock in that part of the world are suckler cows and farmers really need to get a lift.  I look forward to the Minister's comments in that regard.  I know that there has been talk of farmers being given &euro;200 per suckler cow and while it may fall somewhere short of that, we need to see some provision being made in the budget.</p> <p>  I will refer now to Brexit and its potential impact.  We spoke earlier about the impact Brexit will have on small food producers.  In the context of Food Wise 2025, I believe there is too much emphasis on volume and not enough on value.  Mr. Joe Burke from Bord Bia made a presentation last night and pointed out that the price we are getting for our beef is pretty much average on a global scale.  That is an issue that we must face.  We need to consider value, find ways to get a higher price and ensure that the higher price is returned to the farmer.  </p> <p>  In the context of the budget, the issue of young farmers has been talked about for quite some time in terms of what we can do to deliver for that small sector of farmers who want to get into the industry but feel that they are locked out because they cannot get any entitlements or a break.  Will there be something for them in the budget?</p><p>Last year, additional moneys were provided for ANCs, which was welcome.  Will additional money, which is needed, be provided this year?  The Minister is smiling but the farming sector is under the most pressure.  This land is the least productive but, at the same time, it produces a major benefit for the farmers who work it.  Many of them feel they are being squeezed out.</p><p> According to the Minister's opening contribution, approximately 19,000 farmers participate in the sheep welfare scheme.  There is pressure to go down the route of using the new digital tags.  Is there a possibility of increasing the payment to cover this?  There should be an increase of &euro;5 per ewe, which would at least give the sector additional help in this regard.</p><p> We were told an attempt would be made to provide access to more cheap loans.  The problem goes beyond loans at this stage for many farmers.  They feel that even if they secured a loan, they would not have the capacity to pay it back.  This is why the ANC, sheep welfare and suckler cow schemes are vital in putting money into the hands of farmers who need it.</p><p> The State aid rules on support from the Government could be a significant problem for us, particularly with regard to Brexit.  If there is a hard Brexit, many food companies that export mainly to Britain will be left in a serious position.  Their only hope of survival without shedding jobs, which is something we do not want them to do, is for the State to assist them but if it does so, it will be in breach of State aid rules.  Have negotiations taken place with the European Commission to ensure we can get a by-ball in this regard?  We need one if we are going to try to sustain the industry.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the seafood industry.  The committee will write to the Minister about the delays faced in aquaculture with regard to getting salmon farm licences.  It is strangling the sector.  It is not really an issue of investment but of the Department stepping up to the mark and recognising it is an industry that has potential and delivering for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018100200002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their presentation.  The farming and agrifood sectors are looking to next week's budget to see the Government's commitment to the industry.  This year has been difficult and farmers are under extreme financial pressure.  We had one of the longest winters, a non-existent spring and then the problem of an extremely dry summer.  The income level of many enterprises is zero and significant merchant debt has built up over the winter and summer.  Cows were fed this summer in the same way as they were fed in January and February.  Farmers have large bills and are facing into a winter with inadequate fodder.  The cost of fodder has spiralled, as has the cost of concentrate feed.  We are in the first days of October but grass growth has stopped quickly or slowed down significantly.  This is sending shivers down farmers' spines.  Feeding will have to commence at full winter rate quickly.</p> <p>  It is disappointing to be debating the 2019 budget when commitments given in the 2018 budget have still not been delivered.  I refer specifically to the low-interest Brexit loans.  To still be waiting for them 12 months later is disappointing in the extreme.  It is essential that low-cost loans are announced in the budget.</p><p>In 2016, when the Minister announced the introduction of low-interest loans I said that not enough money had been allocated to this and that the money allocated would not be adequate to cater to the demand.  </p><p> There is a huge amount of pent-up frustration among farmers on the issue of credit.  The document we have been presented with mentions an interest rate of 5%.  That is not a low-cost loan.  Bank of Ireland appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  It has a loan scheme which offers significantly lower rates than that.  The problem with the banks is that many of the farmers who are most in need of credit will not get access to the loans.  It happened last time around, when farmers who were under the most financial pressure did not get access to the low-cost loans.  Farmers who converted loans they had into low-cost loans were probably benefitted most.  Low-cost loans must be a part of next week's budget.  Teagasc or another Government agency should have a role to play to ensure that those farmers most in need of low-cost loans get adequate access to it.  That is absolutely essential.</p><p> Our beef sector is now at a critical crossroads.  Men are now making decisions about their futures, and are waiting until after the budget next week to decide whether or not to exit the industry.  Factories have exploited the situation this summer by cutting prices without justifying such a move to farmers.  That decision had implications all the way down the pricing structure, down to the price of the calf.  The beef forum has to be used to bring transparency to the industry and to show us exactly what a side of beef is worth.  The price of steers is very disappointing at the moment, given the price of culled cows a couple of months ago.  With the price of beef rising in the UK, and our factories dropping prices week by week, it is completely unjustified.  The lack of live exports is playing a huge part in the ability of factories to exploit the situation.  Funding for Bord Bia to increase live exports is absolutely essential.  The closure of the Turkish market at the moment is also a factor.  Bord Bia needs extra resources.  </p><p> The Minister spoke about market diversification.  I do not disagree with that sentiment, but in reality, over a 12-month period, how practical is it?  Brexit is coming at us very quickly.  We can examine how Ireland has been heavily dependent on the UK market over the years, and Bord Bia has always focused on reducing that dependency.  However, the dependency has only reduced by a few percentage points over the years.  We have other products, notably cheddar cheese, which are only exported to the UK, so while we should try to pursue diversification it will not solve all of our issues.  </p><p> Next week we have to see an announcement of low-cost loans, a movement towards a &euro;200 payment for suckler cows, and some movement on the sheep sector, particularly hill ewes.  These measures are required to restore profitability to the sector.  Areas of natural constraint payments have to be further increased in order to bring them back to previous levels.  Those payments were cut by Fianna F&aacute;il nine or ten years ago; that does not need to be said.  We are where we are, and there is a different economic situation now.  Those payments have to be restored.  </p><p> On the taxation front, the thresholds for inheritance and the transfer of family farms need to be increased.  Agricultural relief has to be maintained at its current level, and the taxation incentives in place, whether stock relief or stamp duty exemptions for young farmers, are all absolutely essential.  I cannot stress enough how important next week's budget is.  Farmers are looking to the budget to see if there is a serious commitment to the sector.  Men are making decisions about their futures.</p><p>I have met individuals in the past couple of months who have never thought of ceasing the farming enterprises in which they are involved.  However, they are thinking about doing so now.  They wonder if there is any commitment to their sector, and they might move away from it.</p><p> A small number of farmers are involved in the pig sector, but it is under huge pressure.  Farmers working in it will need low-cost loans to survive.  They are caught in a perfect storm; there has been a severe drop in pig prices while the price of inputs have increased dramatically.  The sector does not get much media attention, but it is under huge pressure.  It is an important industry for the country.</p><p> Rural Ireland will look anxiously at next week's budget.  It wants to see a commitment to different sectors, and a commitment to keep profitable farming in place, whether dairy, beef, grain or pig.  All sectors are under huge financial pressure.  Next week's budget is hugely important.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018100200002#S00300"><p>There are, but there is a degree of commonality as well.  I will try to deal with each of the topics.</p> <p>  The issue of access to credit was raised by all three speakers.  Ensuring access to credit is not a core activity of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It must be acknowledged, however, that our initial foray into this area was due to the fact that the banking system was not functioning as it should in terms of providing access to working capital for the farming community.  There have been many studies, including, if I recall correctly, the Central Bank quarter 2 report from 2016, in which the cost of credit across the eurozone was reviewed.  Those studies found that Ireland was in the relegation zone in terms of the league table relating to the cost of credit.  We made our initial foray into the provision of working capital and &euro;150 million was made available at a rate of 2.95%.  That product was a success and 4,249 farmers benefited from it.  As Deputy Cahill pointed out, however, many did not.  In the context of the 136,000 farmers operating in this country, 4,249 it is a relatively small number of beneficiaries, but the benefit of it was far greater than just in the context of those who drew down loans.  It generated competition in the marketplace for other products as the financial institutions responded.  There is evidence that there are now similar products for working capital.  The market has responded.  The pillar banks that delivered the &euro;150 million loan scheme have taken initiatives.  One of the products is a three-year loan of &euro;30,000 at a rate that is virtually identical to that which applied in the context of the &euro;150 million loan scheme.</p> <p>  The question now is whether it is beneficial to invest another tranche of taxpayers' money into developing a product that is already in the market place thanks to the financial institutions, or whether there is another area of activity in which there is a need for greater competition.  I acknowledge that in the context of last year's budget there was a demand for both.  In the context of the &euro;25 million we secured in last year's budget for this purpose, we take the view that, because of the competition that has been stimulated in the area of working capital, in order to build resilience in the industry and for primary producers, the appropriate response is to focus on the area of access to affordable capital for investment purposes rather than for working capital.</p> <p>  I accept that there is concern in this regard.  Some people would like to see movement in both areas.  There are those who dispute the fact that there is sufficient competitions.  However, all of the indications are that, whether it is via the pillar banks, merchant credit delivered through co-ops or the activities of particular credit unions, there is a great deal more competition in that area.</p><p>Relatively speaking, the bigger return for investment in that space now relates to supporting affordable finance for capital investment.  We got &euro;25 million and we are working with a number of strategic partners to deliver a product in the area of capital investment.  I have outlined the detail of that.</p><p> On unsecured borrowing, it is important that we compare like with like.  We are talking about unsecured borrowing over a period of eight to ten years.  In that context, the relevant products are not available at competitive rates.  What we envisage is to have a product that would be available at less than 5%.  Such a product is not in the marketplace at present.  For example, unsecured borrowing is not available for young farmers or new food businesses at present.  In the context of unsecured borrowing, &euro;500,000 is the cap and the minimum loan amount is &euro;50,000.  Those are the parameters that would apply to the new product we would develop.  People ask why this product is not in the marketplace already.  We delivered earlier this year - also through SBCI - a &euro;300 million working capital fund for the SME sector.  Of this, 40% was ring-fenced for the agrifood business.  It was not until we got that product into the marketplace that we were ready to engage with SBCI and a number of other partners, including the European Investment Fund, in terms of delivery.  There was an announcement last year to the effect that the money we obtained would be paid over in order to secure the availability of the fund.  However, the product was never going to be available for draw down until the start of the year.  The detail of what is involved is available now and we will work on the remaining steps that need to be taken in order to deliver it to the market.</p><p> In terms of the sequence of events, first the &euro;150 million was made available and then the &euro;300 million fund was launched in March.  At that point, we began our engagement with SBCI, the European Investment Fund and the Departments of Finance and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  There are so many parts to the fund that we do not control all the levers relating to it.  If we did, we probably would have a product in the marketplace already.  As already stated,  we are dealing with a number of partners.  We will get that product out to market.  It will be different and it is not a repetition of the previous one because competition has been leveraged by virtue of the previous initiative we took in that space.</p><p> The other matters to which everyone referred are the beef and suckler cow sectors.  I acknowledge that a challenging scenario exists and that it has been tied in to the beef forum, beef prices, etc.  The beef forum is a useful creation to enable engagement between all of the stakeholders on the range of issues and I personally will raise with the processors the obligation to recognise that this is a symbiotic relationship between beef farmers and the processing sector.  It is not a forum where prices can be fixed.  That is clearly understood and acknowledged by all of the farm organisations.  I want a situation whereby primary producers get a fair return for their product.  The forum is an opportunity to engage on a range of issues.</p><p> One of the initiatives we have put forward in respect of the beef sector is on the agenda for discussion tomorrow.  We provided funding for it via the RDP.  There were calls in recent weeks for the beef forum to be convened and we have acceded to these.  One of the items on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting is how we might progress matters in respect of the producer organisation for which we have provided funding.  It is not a panacea for all of the ills, as I have said, but it works in other commodity areas.  It works in other jurisdictions in terms of the beef sector and there is potential for it to have greater clout in terms of engagement with the processing sector than would be the case with farmers acting individually.  That is something I will explore with the forum when it meets tomorrow.</p><p> Deputy Cahill referred to live exports in the context of the beef sector.  The numbers are running significantly higher.  The figures for 2017 were up 30% on those for 2016.  Likewise, the figures for 2018 are up 30% on those for 2017.</p><p>Significantly, in respect of the beef sector, in the spring and early summer of 2018 primarily, 147,000 calves were exported.  Deputy Cahill raised, in particular, the Turkish market in the context of live exports.  The devaluation of the currency in Turkey as a consequence of geopolitical events outside of our control means market is in some difficulty for us now.  We are always looking for new market opportunities, whether it is in EU countries such as Spain for weanlings, some of which find a migratory route from Spain into north Africa, or for sales directly to north Africa, particularly to Libya.  I met recently an Egyptian delegation here.  We are active in exploring all those opportunities.  I am committed to live exports as an important outlet for competition in the marketplace and will remain active in that space.  I have met all the live exporters at a round-table meeting in the Department to emphasise the importance of the sector to the beef industry and that their continued participation and activity in that space is important.</p><p> On Bord Bia funding, one should look at the trajectory and the staff complement.  It has gone in the right direction.  It faces challenges not only in the area of beef but in also in other commodity areas because of Brexit.  There has been a significant increase in its funding and in its staff recruitment.  Not all of the judgment should be based on the numbers of additional staff, although I understand in the region of 30 additional staff have been recruited.  Contract staff are also being used to deliver assistance to companies on the ground.  There is a great deal of activity in that area.</p><p> I am acutely aware of the issues relating to suckler cow enterprises.  We need to be measured.  I accept there is a challenge in the sector.  I am committed to ensuring that it remains a key producer of high quality beef because of the associated benefits associated with export earnings, etc., and the primary objective to ensure that we get a fair return for the primary producer but it is important that we do not overstate the extent to which there is a flight from suckler cows as well.  The issue needs to be addressed in different fora both in the context of domestic and CAP policy, but there was always an expectation that following the abolition of dairy quotas, there would be a rebalancing.  That has not happened to the extent that many experts predicted.  The reduction in the herd is 7% since the dairy quotas were abolished.  It is most pronounced in the areas where there was direct migration to dairy enterprises.  The largest reductions were in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Cork, with some people moving entirely to a dairy holding by eliminating a beef enterprise.  The reduction is not as great as has been suggested.  We need to do everything we can through the policy instruments available, including CAP, under which the greatest level of supports is provided, to ensure those in the sector can see a future for themselves.</p><p> We have, for example, delivered on ANC payments.  Many beef farmers have been beneficiaries of this.  We put an additional &euro;25 million into ANC payments this year and we focused it on those who operate on the most marginal land.  Some of the members referred to the prevalence of this enterprise on the western seaboard, in particular, and much of that land was the beneficiary of the focused approach we took in the Department in respect of the additional money.</p><p> On the issue of food wise 2025 strategy, Deputy Martin Kenny stated that there was an overemphasis on volume rather than value.  There is no volume target in the strategy.  The ambition is to increase the value of our exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  There is no volume target for any specific commodity.  In essence, the strategy identifies the impediments or roadblocks for all commodities.</p><p>It is the function of all stakeholders to clear those impediments and roadblocks to enable the industry, whether it is the dairy, pork, sheepmeat, beef or tillage sectors, to respond to the opportunities that will be presented.  No volume target is set in respect of beef or dairy but there is a value target.  As we seek to develop products that go higher up the value added chain, value rather than volume will drive returns.  We are addressing the roadblocks and allowing the industry to respond.  People have said we should rein in our ambition because of Brexit or climate change but, on the contrary, it has never been more important to have a blueprint containing our stated ambition.  These obstacles stop us from achieving that ambition.  The figure of &euro;19 billion, or 23,000 jobs, may be achieved but we should focus on the impediments and on human capital, sustainability and the other pillars of Food Wise 2025.</p><p> Electronic identification, EID, was mentioned, which is something I have not had the opportunity to discuss at the committee previously.  No one would defend the existing system as being fit for purpose but whether we feel obliged to defend it, when the Food Safety Authority of Ireland said our current traceability system was not fit for purpose, it was a game changer.  Having received the report, doing nothing was not an option.  We decided to address it and the best available technology is clearly electronic identification.  We have responded substantially to the concerns of the industry in respect of the timeline and the cost to farmers.  I have always acknowledged that there is a cost but there is also a cost associated with doing nothing.  It was never an option to fail to respond to the food safety report, which stated that the fact that we did not have traceability could become an issue of public health.  If we could not recall products, it could have consequences in the marketplace and for our reputation and, therefore, we moved on it.  No party to the process, whether marts or farmers, is entirely happy about it but there is an obligation on all stakeholders to respond and we have come up with a reasonable response.  We have moved on the support we are paying to farmers, with a maximum of up to &euro;100, and we have made financial assistance available to marts as central points for recording data.  We have made a reasonable effort on an issue on which we had no choice but to proceed.  EID is now being introduced in the sheep sector and that matches what neighbouring jurisdictions have done.  It is the best available technology and it is inevitable that it will become the identification process for the bovine sector as well.  It will be more affordable in the context of the value of a bovine carcass as opposed to a sheep carcass.</p><p> Deputy Kenny asked about state aid rules.  There is ongoing engagement at EU level about enabling the State to engage directly with enterprises that are directly impacted.  I spoke about generational renewal recently.  The taxation issues referred to by Deputy Cahill, such as stamp duty and stock reliefs, are all important but the best signal we can send to young people is one that will enable them to see an opportunity to generate an income and make a career out of the industry of their choice, akin to their peers in any other sector.</p><p>That is what motivates me in the negotiations on CAP reform.</p><p> I would be concerned if the signal we were sending by reducing the budget, albeit in a framework of identified supports for generational renewal, was that Europe is cutting its budget for the agricultural sector and its support for farm families producing high-quality products and delivering on things such as water quality and biodiversity, which are deemed to be for the public good.  It would be dangerous to send out such a signal in light of the fact that global demand will increase by 70% by 2050 as a result of growing populations.  We will need additional food to meet the needs of those populations.  The age profile is reaching a critical point.  How can we produce the necessary food if no one takes up the challenge in the future?  There is a high risk of land that is used for productive agricultural purposes being abandoned and there are risks of increased urbanisation, desertification, etc.</p><p> The incentives are important in the context of the issues raised by Deputy Cahill but the most important signal we can send to young people is that the CAP values what they do and funds it accordingly.  We have been very active in trying to get other member states to dig deeper in terms of financial contributions.  We have to signal that we are prepared to pay more but Europe can only spend money which it is given by member states.  There has to be a unanimous decision on the part of all member states to increase the budget.  The Commission cannot borrow money to spend.  Other member states see other challenges such as, for example, in the areas of migration and security.  I acknowledge that there are big challenges in that regard.  Those in the Mediterranean region see people landing on their shores on a daily basis so migration and security are really important issues for them.  However, those challenges need new money and are not a reason to raid the CAP budget.  We are trying to encourage other member states to acknowledge that.  Following the Swedish election results, a Eurosceptic party now has the balance of power.  What are the prospects of Sweden contributing more to the CAP when the criticism from such member states is that the response of the Commission did not go far enough?</p><p> Deputy McConalogue also asked about fodder.  The response of the stakeholder group to the fodder crisis was quite phenomenal and we owe a debt of gratitude to every one of them, as well as to the farm organisations.  The recommendations and the initiatives we have taken all grew from that group but the best thing that came out of the process was the advice given to individual farmers by Teagasc, private consultants or the co-operatives.  The figure in the audit of July was 28% but in early October it had fallen to 11%.  There has been a lot of endeavour and people have been baling silage at a ferocious rate over the past week or ten days.  It is probably tapering off now but a lot of progress is being made.  Quite a volume of May silage is yet to be harvested and other stuff is coming in under the tillage initiative.  If we can keep cattle out until the start of November and can hope for a normal spring, we will have the bones of a solution alongside the fodder initiatives, GLAS flexibilities and the extension of the dates for slurry spreading.  The stakeholders have made an enormous contribution to that.</p><p> I am aware of the point made by Deputy McConalogue about the farm management deposit scheme.</p><p>He also mentioned the low-interest loans.  There is a cash-flow problem for farmers as well, which is partly why there was a request to the commission to bring forward the payments.  It is money that would come to farmers anyway but they asked it to be brought forward at a time when cash-flow is pinched.  It is an assistance, and those early payments enable &euro;260 million of additional money to be put in the rural economy.  We in the Department are likely to need a supplementary Estimate to enable us to fund that higher level of payment, whether it is the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme or the 85% imbalance under green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, organics, which are the two main schemes driving the reason for the supplementary.</p><p> In the broader context, the agri-taxation committee that sat and was reviewed over the past number of months has delivered an enormous amount.  There are some outstanding issues such as the farm management deposits scheme that would be of great benefit to the farming community but I suspect there is unlikely to be any great take-up of it in the year ahead because of the challenges therein.  Not many people would require to shelter income because of cost and, therefore, it would primarily be of benefit to the dairy sector.  It will not be an issue for the beef people whom we talked about earlier, who make up the greatest number of farmers in the livestock sector.  I suspect that even on the tillage side there may not be any great demand for it.  As a hedge to volatility, however, it is an outstanding issue that remains important.</p><p> On Brexit, I remain convinced we can get a deal.  Any deal we get will not be as good as the current arrangements because if one is outside the Single Market or the customs union it cannot be as good as what is currently available.  In that sense it is an exercise in damage limitation.  I remain convinced we can get a deal and once the Tory party conference is out of the way I think we will enter a more realistic engagement rather than megaphone diplomacy, of which there is an element at the moment.</p><p> On harness racing, we have looked at it and given some funding earlier this year.  Some &euro;64,000 was given in funding this year as a training initiative or pilot project to tackle what is a big problem on the roads, as Deputy Cahill will be aware in his own neck of the woods and elsewhere.  There is a problem in the northside of Cork city also.  We have worked with the association to try to enable it to organise itself better in order that it may become an instrument for further funding in this area, and we have made some progress with it.</p></speech>

On the other issues, I have met with the pig sector in the IFA as well as individual operators.</p><p>I acknowledge it is a difficult challenge which has been complicated at EU level most recently by an extension of African swine fever into Belgium.  The biggest imperative for the industry now is to maintain our own biosecurity in this area, and there is a high level of engagement to create an awareness of that.  As an island nation, we have certain natural advantages with biosecurity but there is no room for complacency.  From the engagement I have had I appreciate that credit and the labour force are big issues for the sector, as are prices.  Bord Bia has a promotion in China and other parts of Asia this year, which is an important matter.  There has also been an issue with the ceiling of grant aid for investment in pig units.  We are looking at whatever flexibilities might be there under the rural development plan, RDP, which are not evident as we speak, to see if we could grant more aid for investment in farming.  It must be borne in mind, however, that it is to facilitate improved welfare circumstances on farms, thereby eliminating the use of antibiotics and so on.  It does not facilitate greater production volumes but it makes it more welfare friendly and hopefully more efficient also.  There is no easy fix here.  We have engaged with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, also on the overall issue of merchant credit and how SBCI might get involved in that space, generally speaking, but it is at an early stage.</p><p> On the hardship scheme, there are obviously the State's means-tested welfare schemes but in the context of the overall response by the Department to the fodder issue, which I think is what Deputy McConalogue was referring to, we have responded clearly to all the issues that have been raised at the stakeholder forum.  The forum continues to meet and will be important in continuing to assess where we are and what interventions are needed.</p></speech>

For the first time in a long time, we see fodder coming from west to east.  There is a substantial cost involved in that also.

It is not unprecedented, therefore, but it is unusual.  We will consider looking at all of that.  The overwhelming objective and emphasis have been to close the gap and get the tillage initiative up and running.  We remain open to engaging on that issue but it is not something we have considered in detail at this stage.</p></speech>

I ask him to flesh out a bit further where the Department is with regard to achieving something and working towards the &euro;200 payment per suckler cow or at least getting the process started.  As the Minister will be aware, the sector is under massive pressure and farmers are looking in this budget for a signal that the Government understands where they are, understands the income pressure they are under, and will move to deliver something for them.  I emphasise the importance of the Minister taking that on board and pushing it with the Minister for Finance to try to achieve an allocation in this budget in order that something can be done and there can be some type of margin delivered to the suckler farmers.  It is simply not sustainable that they will continue in business but not get paid for their work.</p></speech>

It has great potential to generate business in rural areas where we are looking for ideas to retain communities.  There is already significant interest in sports horses.  I believe some plans have been presented to the Minister and funds will be needed to assist in those.  I hope we will see something that would be meaningful for local economies in rural Ireland develop from that.</p><p> In order to ensure genetic diversity in Irish rare breeds in accordance with our EU obligations, there are complaints from the Irish Rare Breeds Society that the support it has received from the Department is minimal, not meaningful and not impactful.  What is the Minister looking for in this budget for them?  What is his view on supporting them further?</p><p> My biggest concern here today is the suckler cow.  I know the Minister wants to support the beef sector and the suckler farmers.  I acknowledge the measures that are there, the beef data and genomics scheme, the establishment of the beef producer organisations, all the new markets the Minister has worked towards opening, alongside Bord Bia and all the other measures that help.  The truth is, notwithstanding all the efforts, morale is very low among suckler cow farmers.  In the west and north-west, where I am located, we have not had the worst of the weather this summer, in fact we probably had the best of the weather, a combination of sun and rain and we do not have the fodder problem.  Over the past few years, however, we have been battling an extended winter every year.  We have had fodder shortages and the fodder crisis last year.  There are pressures on slurry storage and spreading, poor factory prices and poor prices at the mart.  We also have cash flow problems.  Brexit, Mercosur, and climate action measures will be laid upon farmers, including the threat hanging over them of a carbon tax..  There is evidence to be concerned about the sustainability of the suckler cow herd's future and, unless there is intervention right now, there will be problems in the future.  The farming organisations have been ventilating the situation of these farmers.  From what I can see, and to judge from the figures produced by the farmers I have met and their personal situations, they are making little or no money or are losing money and if they did not get other farm payments they would be in a desperate situation.  This is backed up by the Department's Food Wise 2015 beef group which is recommending further supports for sucklers and I would support this also. </p><p> When I talk about farmers setting out their income an example is the farmer showing me that it costs him &euro;900 a year to keep his suckler cow yet when he sells the calf he gets &euro;850.  I do not know why or how anybody would or could sustain that.  Reality will bite.  The reality is that farming is a vocation and while the older and more mature farmer may stick with the vocation to the end, the younger generation may not.  I know the Minister says we need to encourage younger farmers, whether in respect of land mobility or otherwise but in another case, a suckler cow farmer who has 80 head of cattle contacted me; his son is 30 years old and is very interested in and loves farming.  He bought an old house for &euro;60,000 which he needs to do up.  He went to the bank where he was more or less laughed at.  The bank told him he would not get a cent based on any of his accounts.  He has a trade and was told to go back to his trade because that would be the only way he could ever hope to get a mortgage or to build any future for himself.  There is no future in that suckler cow farm the way he sees it now.  Unless farmers have other work there is no great incentive for them.</p><p>The day will come when younger people walk away from this because they have had more education opportunities and have better options.  That does not suit us or our country.  It is no secret that the average age of farmers, especially suckler cow farmers, is quite high.  If the young farmers do not take up the baton the suckler cow numbers will plummet.  I am not being alarmist, all the facts are stacking up towards this.  I know the Minister wants to support the beef sector but I believe that if this happens and the suckler cow herd plummets, where I live in the west and north-west will be unrecognisable.  In the west 81% of cows are suckler cows.  I think in Mayo they account for 84%, in Roscommon and Leitrim, 93%.  That is from a report conducted by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the National University of Ireland Cork, NUIC.  The suckler cow is the basic production machine for a vast industry, not only are we getting traceable quality and affordable food but if the numbers drop from the percentages that I have quoted we can forget about the meat factories, the marts, the merchants in my area, the vets, and all the spin-off industries from the suckler cow.  I welcome payments on the areas of natural constraint, ANC, and the increase, which is very important but dairy people get that same payment.  What is needed at this juncture is a targeted payment in this budget.  We have to be realistic about the Common Agricultural Policy and look forward.  I know the Minister has talked about the constraints and the challenges and that he is fighting with the Commissioner, Phil Hogan and the whole of Government but we need a targeted payment in the budget recognising the pressures the suckler cow farmer is under, which are well documented, but also the significance and importance of the suckler cow.  It is absolutely critical where I am from.  I am in no doubt about it.  We can talk about towns and villages and all the rest, but the fabric of rural Ireland is the suckler cow and it is critical that there is action to support the farmers.  At the very least a signal should be given in this budget that there is hope and that they fit into the bigger scheme.  This is a critical, pivotal time for the suckler cow farmer.  Notwithstanding any campaigns that farm organisations run, again and again people tell me their stories of sons and daughters and their own circumstances and they are fed up.  They are not people fighting with me about Government.  We need to act because there is an awful lot at stake here.</p></speech>

This is a very large brief, which has a lot going for it.  Fodder was mentioned and I need to touch on some issues regarding that.  We had snow, storms and drought in my part of the world, and there has been a significant uptake in the amount of fodder made in the past few weeks, even last weekend.  The knock-on effect, however, for me and others involved in the industry is the financial implications of the fodder crisis, whether in June, July and August, when large quantities of meal, round bales and whatever else, was being fed.</p> <p>  The fodder crisis has moved on to become a financial crisis in many ways and we must now manage that through the institutions.  I do not think the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a direct responsibility to manage the funding but the pillar banks need to come on board and be more amenable to that.</p><p>I have heard alarming reports, even as recently as this morning and I will share the information with the Minister after the meeting, about pillar banks being slow to deal with the farming community.  The merchant credit that built up in June, July and August needs to be moved off the books and maybe moved away via a two or three year loan so that farmers can move through this phase and on to the next phase.  I hope that the Minister will engage with the pillar banks to ensure that there is no blockage, and work is done to ensure that the banks engage with the agricultural community thus allowing funding to flow. </p><p> During the summer a very interesting TB forum took place and the Minister announced that the new chairman is Mr. Michael Cronin.  The incidence of TB has dramatically declined in the past few years.  In the past the figure was 8% but it reduced to 3.5% in 2017.  The TB forum is something that we need to acknowledge and it is very worthy.  I ask the Minister to clarify how the forum will work so that Ireland is TB free by 2030.  How does he think the badger vaccination programme or the start of same is working?  What about the announcements published in newspapers today on the outlook for TB and herd restrictions?  One of the issues that I picked up on the ground today is that people are confused, seek clarity and want to know where we will go with the proposals.  I realise that the proposals might be quite restrictive.  I ask the Minister to inform us more about these issues.</p><p> The Minister spoke, quite rightly, about Brexit as did many members here.  I do not have a great knowledge of the fishing industry but I met a group of individuals who work in the fishing industry last night.  They are deeply concerned about the impact Brexit will have on their industry, on their access to the UK territorial waters and the knock-on effects in terms of the so-called EU fleet arriving into Irish waters without having access to the UK territorial waters.  I ask the Minister to comment on the issue.  To me, it is one of the issues that has not been spoken about enough.  The people who work in the industry feel very left out of the equation.  They believe the conversation is more about cheddar cheese instead of mackerel.  I ask him to make a statement on the matter.</p><p> Finally, I wish to mention Food Wise 2025, which is an important policy that the Government pushed out several years.  What is the Minister's view of that policy in terms of the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action?  I refer to the all-party Oireachtas committee of 22 members who will consider issues of climate change such as ensuring there is a mitigation policy.  Is he concerned about the Food Wise policy in terms of these proposals?  I realise that we are going through a process at present and that his report will not be published until 15 January.  Does the Minister feel threatened by the proposals?  Does he believe they will have a large impact on the beef industry, in particular?  Some of the unfortunate evidence heard by the committee of late has given the impression that we would be better off moving out of the beef industry and claiming the payments regarding climate.  That is a very significant statement that we have seen come out of that committee in the past few weeks.  I ask the Minister to comment on these issues because they create great concerns about the industry.    </p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to make a short contribution.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his attendance and entering into this dialogue with us.  It is important that we discuss these issues pre-budget.  I know that Deputies McConalogue and Cahill have covered most of the issues.  Therefore, when I refer to the suckler cow scheme or things like that I do not expect the Minister to go back over things because he has already answered.  I wish to put it on record that the suckler cow scheme is very important to my part of the country - to the west, midlands and north west.  The scheme is as important to my area as the dairy business is to the south of the country but in reality the scheme cannot continue, which other speakers have said here.</p><p>I am alarmed by the fact that farmers with good arable land are saying that the work is not profitable, that they cannot break even in many situations and their only option is forestry.  I want to put it on the record that I am not anti-forestry.  I believe that we need forestry, it is important for reducing carbon count and the sector creates quite a lot of jobs.  As the Minister well knows, the reality is that if a farmer walked into his or her local bank tomorrow morning and said he or she wanted to develop their farm and forestry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>a suckler herd then he or she will get better terms from the bank for forestry.  It is a pity that good arable land, which farmers have worked as agricultural land for years, will be lost to forestry and that has happened repeatedly in my county and constituency of Galway-Roscommon.  Since I became a Deputy I have received a lot of representations on the matter.  We need to support the suckler cow business in some shape or form.  As members will know, my party has, for a number of years, given a commitment to securing a payment of &euro;200 per suckler cow.  People have constantly raised the matter with me but I will leave it there because the Minister has dealt with it.  <br/><br/>Obviously the Minister is not going to give us clues about what the budget will include.  Recently farmers, the IFA and others have told us in briefings about the benefits of renewable energy.  We should get far more serious with the farming industry in terms of renewable energy.  Farmers are prepared to produce renewable energy and huge opportunities await them.  Surely the Government should go out of its way to assist farmers to become more involved in the production of renewable energy.<br/><br/>Deputy Cahill mentioned the pig sector.  Fewer than 300 pig farmers remain in this country and there are only eight or ten of them in my constituency.  The industry has been really rough for quite a number of years.  I certainly would not like to see a situation develop where there are zero pig farmers in this country.  These people work very hard and they need protection and support.  <br/><br/>I wish to mention drainage schemes.  Prior to my going into media I was a qualified horticulturist and I was involved in soil testing for a number of years.  It is very noticeable that the quality of the soil has deteriorated in recent years.  Due to rain patterns a lot of the nutrients have been washed out of our soil.  Therefore, it is vital for the future of farming, particularly in the many areas of heavy soil, to reintroduce a drainage scheme.  There has not been a proper drainage scheme for many years and farmers badly need it for their farms.  I ask the Minister to reintroduce the scheme and provide a budget for same because it is vitally important.  <br/><br/>Finally, will money be provided to farmers for diversification such as agri-tourism or whatever?  </p></speech>

I am glad of the opportunity to speak. </p> <p>  I wish to mention the fair deal scheme for farmers who get sick.  We welcome the cap of three years.  We hope that money will be provided in the budget to finance the scheme.  I am very concerned that the value of the farm, including the dwelling house, will be assessed when determining the percentage to be paid by a farmer.  It will be very onerous and tough for a young farmer if his father is in a nursing home, hospital or whatever.  Let us say a farm is valued at &euro;500,000, which would not be a very big farm, and 7.5% means a cost of &euro;37,500 a year.  That percentage, even with the three year cap, means a total of over &euro;100,000 must be paid, which will place an awful financial handicap on any young farmer trying to start out in the business.</p><p>It is more than a fifth of the value of the farm.  It is going to be very tough and one could not call that a fair deal at all.  It is a very lousy deal for a youngster trying to start out, where maybe his father is taken out of the farm all of a sudden with a stroke or a heart attack.  It is a very unfair situation.  To every other person it is the family home.  There should be some other way of assessing the farm and the family home.  The family home is included in the farm as well.  It is very severe and an attack on a young fellow starting out and I do not know how people will cope with that.</p><p> I want to support the suckler cow.  Where I come from that is all we have back there and the farther westwards one goes the more sucklers there are, where in north Kerry it is more milk-based farming.  In our side of the country, it is the suckler cow and people are struggling.  In the marts of Cahirciveen, Milltown, Castleisland, Waterville and Macroom, the farmers are taking an awful roasting.</p></speech>

Suckler cow farmers are taking a lot of heat and a trouncing at present, with the cost of feed, meals and fertilizer.  How can the fertilizer companies account for increasing the cost every year regardless of whether the farmers have a good or bad year?    Is there no way to control this?  We hear this morning of the cost of diesel fuel increasing.  The talk is that the Government is increasing the cost of fuel.  If it does that it is going to affect the farming community in a very adverse way.  I ask the Minister, when he is around that Cabinet table, to do something to ensure that diesel does not go up in price any further, regardless of whether it is the Minister, Deputy Ross or the Green Party or whoever is calling for this because of climate change or whatever.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018100200002#DD00500"><p>I do not agree with it.  It is very unfair to be increasing the cost of VAT and carbon tax when we consider that fuel coming in to the country is so dear at the present time.  I asked on the Order of Business that it be reduced rather than increased and I am not good today when I hear that the Stock Market is increasing it rather than reducing it.  There is room for manoeuvre when the cost has already gone up.  The Government tax take has increased as the cost of the barrel of oil comes in and I believe there is therefore room to manoeuvre and to reduce the cost somewhat to help people with home heating oil, and all fuels.</p> <p>  As to areas of natural constraint, ANC, all farmers payments were reduced in 2008.  We got &euro;500 back last year but we need the rest of it and more with the way the thing is going.</p> <p>  Hen harrier designation may not affect farmers and other Deputies here, but it certainly affects part of Kerry and north-west Cork.  Farmers are not being compensated as regards the hen harrier designation for not being able to work their land the way they would like to.  They cannot plant their land and it is useless and worthless.  I said at some forum here that we hear about houses and people being robbed at night, and of break-ins but this is daylight robbery.</p><p>Those who own the designated lands and have struggled to buy it, or who have had the land handed down to them are not being compensated.  Many of these farms are now worthless because of the Department's hen harrier designation.</p><p> There are plenty of places in Kerry suitable for forestry.  We have a rule, however, that there has to be 80% green ground in any plot that someone would want to plant.  We are not far away from the Minister, and if one goes around any part of our side of the country, one will see that people are lucky to have the 20% of green ground and 80% of all other kinds of ground.  It is not arable land and it would be suitable for forestry.  There were grants to plant all of that kind of ground in the past and that is where everything has gone wrong.  The rules changed and this is impeding the planting of forests.  </p><p> There is another problem, which is not of the Minister's making.  Many farmers now want to take that forestry out of their lands.  They are looking for planning permission from the forestry service, or from the county councils, and there is what are called "serial objectors" putting in objections to farmers building roadways and entrances into the places where the forestry was planted.  This will militate against farmers in the future.  They will know that if they plant that ground, they might not ever be able to take the timber out of it, or sell what they grow.  It is going to adversely affect farmers in the future planting forests because they will be afraid that they will not be able to get anything out of it.</p><p> Some legislation needs to be brought forward to deal with these serial objectors and to stop this because it is criminal what they are doing to poor people who planted their land, hoped to retire and have a bit of money to help them in their old age.  This is a problem in many farms around where I live.</p></speech>

Something will have to be done for those who have applied and who had dealt unwittingly with leasing companies.  One person I know of paid a lot of money out of his own pocket and went to the leasing company then for the rest to purchase a vacuum pack.  He is owed &euro;10,300 and cannot get it.  He is being robbed of his TAMS grant.  I am asking the Minister to do something for the people who are caught, and to make it clear from here on, that anyone who deals with a leasing company will not get their TAMS grant because this is hurting many people.  The Minister knows these people and so do I.  Something will have to be done at Government level to ensure that these poor people get their grant and to put some impediment in place so that these companies are not allowed to give money where the farmer is trying to access a TAMS grant.  I am pleading with the Minister as this is important to the people affected.  There may not be a great number of them but there are enough to require that something be done for them.  They are asking us, who are elected by the people.  I am asking the Minister and his Government to do something about this issue, where people are unwittingly being caught by the leasing companies in the way they access their funding from them rather than from the bank.</p></speech>

I was told there were no problems yet recently the Department released figures showing that a substantial number of applicants were in fear of not meeting the deadline on completing the work.  Would the Department consider extending time to those farmers?  Otherwise they may not get the work done in time to qualify for this round of TAMS.</p> <p>  I lend my support to the request that the Minister look after the suckler premium.  I know we are talking about a big demand for the &euro;200 but at least it could get started because the beef industry is in a bit of a crisis at the moment.</p> <p>  An issue raised in a few circles in my area concerns some kind of nitrates derogation.  We had a very dry summer and many farmers took the gamble of putting out fertiliser but there was no take up.  They went again and then the Department gave them extra time for the spreading of fertiliser.  Some farmers may have gone over the limits in spreading nitrogen.  Will the Minister be flexible when they apply for a derogation to allow for that because the first round was not taken up and they took advantage of the good weather in September to put down a few extra bags?  </p> <p>  Many farmers cannot afford to take out any more loans.  While I will not go down the road of the meal voucher the best judge of a farmer and his inputs and constraints in the past six or 12 months are the merchants and the co-operatives.  The Minister should consider putting a loan facility through their good selves because they are the ones who have the bills to be paid.  The last time the Minister did the farm loan I do not think the right farmers got the loan.  I think the Minister would be in agreement on that.  The bank manager took the first customer who came in and was at the top of the list, and those with a good cash flow.  It is leaving some farmers at a disadvantage.  Maybe the Minister could make some kind of loan system available through the co-ops and the merchants such that they would carry the book and pay the farmer and he would eventually pay it back to the co-ops.  They are the people who will be caught at the end of the day and in that way the farmer who is badly in need and who will be short of fodder will be helped. </p></speech>

The beef and suckler cow sector is one of the main issues raised.  That is understandable but it was not until Senator Mulherin and Deputy Murphy raised the issue that the climate change context was raised as well.  Very often the Department is accused, rightly or wrongly, of not having joined-up thinking.  It is imperative that anything we do, whether budgetary or at CAP level is consistent with the obligations we face under challenging targets for reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.  That is something I am acutely conscious of in the context of the sector.</p><p>An effectively coupled payment of &euro;200 per cow is the demand, and although I have heard it described as a targeted payment on every cow, it is not the direction we should go in the context of our climate change obligations.</p><p> We need to make sure that, whatever we do, we are consistent with the direction of travel we have been going in the context, for example, of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, which aims to drive efficiencies in the herd and improve its genetic merit and I am conscious of that.  I am in the middle of the overall budget figures.  I cannot go any further than that but I am aware of the issues for the sector, as I am for the broader farming community.  Anything done at any level has to be done within that framework, otherwise we would, rightly, be open to the charge that we were not being consistent and a coupled payment is not the direction we should consider travelling. </p><p> Senator Lombard asked if I see the climate change agenda as a threat to agriculture.  It could well be but I also think we are starting from a position of strength in the debate.  There is no one issue that will resolve all this.</p><p> Deputy Murphy asked about renewable energy, whether anaerobic digestion or solar panels.  We have to be open to all of those initiatives, whether milk recording or BDGP, the use of sexed semen, protected urea or anaerobic digestors.  The range of issues, from sequestration to new technologies to monetising the value of waste, will have to be invoked to enable us to meet the targets.  It could be said that, with the exception of BDGP and the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the last CAP did not drive that agenda sufficiently.  Certainly the next one will.  What is on the table now is putting far more conditionality on payments in the future.  The smart farm programme is a collaboration between the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and it shows that where farmers embrace these on-farm initiatives they deliver a good story in terms of sustainability but they also deliver from a financial perspective.  They make the farmers more profitable.  We need to work harder at demystifying all this talk about sustainability and talk about the practical things.  For example, one of the biggest challenges we face almost immediately is ammonia emissions.  Simple things like moving to the trailing shoe or the splash plate deliver very significant improvements, as does protected urea as opposed to calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN.  I appreciate there is a price differential there but it has been suggested to me, and this is worth exploring, that if the volume of CAN or protected urea rose significantly then the differential might drop and there is a significant dividend from that.  They are things we can do in bite-size approaches to the sustainability agenda.  It will not necessarily be the new quota on the dairy side.  I acknowledge what has been done by the dairy industry to anticipate the challenges but we will all have to do more.</p><p> The Department will have to lead.  That is right because it would be financially punitive not to do so.  The market is also saying we need to do this.  That is increasingly the request in the markets we want to be in, where there are consumers with higher spending power who are asking about the sustainability credentials in the broader definition of sustainability, such as environmental and welfare issues, and anti-microbial resistance, which are all part of this.</p><p>Consumers in those markets with higher spending power are asking about sustainability credentials under the broader definition of "sustainability", including environmental sustainability, welfare issues, antimicrobial resistance and so on.  All that is part of this agenda.  As with farming more generally, we can find a solution within that framework that enables us to meet those targets, challenging as they are, while also protecting the family farm structure.  Much of it goes back to the question of an adequate CAP budget.  </p><p> Senator Lombard raised the matter of the TB forum.  The challenge for that forum is to come up with evidence-based policy recommendations that will enable us to achieve the objective of eliminating TB by 2030.  It is a substantial challenge and represents a substantial budgetary line in my Department on an annual basis.  While the overall incidence of TB is going down, the size of individual herds is increasing significantly and, therefore, the cost of a herd outbreak is greater than it would have been in the past.  The Department appreciates the efforts of farmers in this area over the years.  We are on the cusp of achieving the complete elimination of TB but it requires a final push from everybody.  The forum is the right thing at the right time and I have no doubt that its current members and Chairman will do a good job.  </p><p>The Senator also referred to the fishing industry.  In essence, what the fishing industry - unlike farming - faces in the event of a calamitous Brexit is having its field taken away.  In essence, that is what is involved because we catch 60% of our most valuable stock, mackerel, in what is deemed to be UK territorial waters as well as 40% of our second most valuable stock.  A full third of the total value of the Irish industry is in UK waters.  In a way, that debunks the argument that the industry was short-changed in terms of EU membership.  The Irish fishing industry benefitted from the fact that it could fish in other waters and make a profit.  We are clued into this issue in the context of our Brexit negotiations and will work side by side with the fishing industry, both the catching and the processing arms, on it.  Our position is exactly the same as that of the industry and we are working with all of the equally affected member states that have an exposure to catching stocks in UK territorial waters.  We have fed our analysis into the Barnier task force and our position is shared by all of the programme officers.  As I said earlier, I hope there will be a profitable outcome on it.</p><p> Some members raised the ANC issue.  We allocated an additional &euro;25 million in funding to that scheme this year, with &euro;13 million going to mountain-type land, &euro;9 million to severely handicapped land and &euro;3 million to less severely handicapped land.  That means that those farming mountain-type land will see their payments increase from &euro;109.71 to &euro;135 on the first 10 ha.  Payments have issued to some farmers and others will receive payments as they meet the stocking requirement.  Payments will increase from &euro;95 to &euro;112 for those farming severely handicapped land.  This is a significant and focused increase.  Senator Muherin referred to the fact that dairy farmers receive payments under the ANC scheme but tillage farmers do not, even though there are some tillage farmers on ANC-type land.  To put that observation in a broader context, the challenge with regard to CAP reform is to direct resources such that they deliver the greatest dividend.  Proposals on how those scarce resources can be best targeted are awaited from all of the farming organisations.</p><p>Deputy Eugene Murphy raised the issue of drainage schemes.  I would love to have a better answer for him but, in the context of climate change, the suggestions in some quarters are to re-wet lands rather than drain them.</p></speech>

The issue in the context of the delivery of public goods - a broad term in the context of CAP relating to farm families producing high quality produce while protecting water quality, biodiversity and so on - is ensuring farmers are adequately remunerated for that delivery.  The Deputy asked if a drainage grant would be reintroduced but I do not see that happening because that would be seen to be moving in the opposite direction to the climate change-----</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, has been engaged on this issue for some time.  A proposal went to Government recently and was approved and I expect that there will be substantial progress on that issue in 2019.</p> <p>  On the issue of hen harriers, Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Martin Kenny and Cahill, who all raised this matter previously, will be aware that there is a &euro;25 million locally-led scheme and payments will go to those farmers who have been approved under the scheme this month.  I have always said that the cumulative effect of the hen harrier scheme and the threat response plan, which involves restricted access to afforestation as an option on that land, will deliver for those farmers.  Payments under the hen harrier scheme will commence this month.  </p> <p>  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of the sport horse industry and we all celebrate the recent successes of the Irish sport horse sector on the international stage.  The industry achieves quite spectacularly and has enormous potential.  The Indecon report on the sector was published some time ago.  The Government was of the view that the governance issues identified in that report needed to be addressed.  The plan was that once those issues were addressed, funding would follow.  A new, slimmed down board was recently appointed and a new chief executive is in place and is working well.  Improvements can be seen now and, in the context of the budgetary debate that is ongoing, we will remain focused on what we can do in that sector.  There is potential but there are infrastructure deficits in the sector.  I met some people from the sport horse industry informally last Friday in Kilkenny.  They were hugely enthusiastic in terms of their ambition.  Rome was not built in a day and the industry has an extensive shopping list.  It has also conducted considerable research and produced several reports.  I would like to see the trajectory continuing in the right direction in respect of funding and while it will never be enough, we remain supportive of the sector as it tries to achieve its ambitions.</p> <p>  On rare breeds, I am not aware of the details of Senator Mulherin's concerns but we did marginally increase the funding available.

He is looking for a great deal of flexibility in terms of TAMS, nitrates and loans via the co-operatives.</p><p>I am straying a bit out of my comfort zone.  First, there has not been an issue.  I have a lot of engagement with all the co-ops.  This is the first time it has been raised with me as an option that the product could be delivered via the co-ops.  They would have to be approved as financial intermediaries.  I am not sure it is a runner.  I dealt with the issue of access to loans in some detail earlier.</p><p> I would like to deal with TAMS.  I was at a meeting last night.  Some members of the joint committee were at a similar meeting.  I was on a beef farm in County Laois and I had a meeting subsequently in Portlaoise last night.  The issues being raised in questions here are similar to those exercising the minds of the farming community generally.  TAMS approvals initially lasted for three years.  It proved difficult to manage the Department's liability - to make provision against it - without knowing when the farmer would draw down or activate his application or approval.  For that reason, we have restricted it to 12 months for buildings and six months for plants.  This gives us a better chance and that is evidenced in our outturns for this year.  The first set of three-year approvals is starting to expire now.  The people in question can reapply.  Tranches are open and being approved all the time.  We are issuing approval letters now for the most recent tranche, which closed on 8 or 10 September.  Approvals in respect of those applications are issuing now.  There is a rolling tranche of TAMS applications.  We have restricted it to 12 months to try to get a better handle on the Department's contingent liabilities.  There is a bit of sense in that.</p></speech>

All of that is feeding into the calls for a TAMS extension.  The Minister cannot tell farmers to go away and apply again.  They probably have to come in under new specifications.</p></speech>

There might well be an upside to reapplying.  It is a question of resubmitting the old application.  We can look at the case of somebody who is in the middle of an implementation under this scheme.  I cannot make a commitment on the hoof.  There are downsides to doing these works out of cash flow.  Obviously, this year has been difficult.  People whose applications are expiring and who do not intend to take up their approvals are entirely within their rights to reapply and, all other things being equal, will be approved on the basis that their previous applications were approved.  It is not overly onerous to resubmit the same application.  We are turning over the approvals every couple of months.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss the budget.  Will something be put in place in the budget to help young farmers who are entering the industry?  That is one of the issues we need to deal with.  We have a bunch of forgotten farmers.  We do not want to see any more farmers being put into that category.</p> <p>  While I do not want to delay the meeting, I would like to raise two more issues.  I understand that some money was provided to harness racers, who have been mentioned, to compile a report into the industry as it moves forward.  That report has been completed and presented.  The harness racers have proposed a budget request that sets out how they need to get themselves established over the next period of time.  It comes to approximately &euro;1 million per annum.  Given that approximately &euro;65 million is provided to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon, it would be appropriate to find some way of providing money to support this sector.</p> <p>  I was not here when Deputy Eugene Murphy spoke about drainage.  Drainage is an issue where it is appropriate.  We have to reflect on the appropriateness of drainage in areas of heavier land.  The issue of fodder comes into this.  Drainage can bring about a longer grazing season and get more land into meadow, but the problem we find in many parts of the country - certainly in the west and in areas of heavier soil - is that the land is too wet, unfortunately.  If a drainage scheme were in place, it would open up possibilities where appropriate.  I understand that it is not appropriate everywhere.  Common sense has to be applied.  There is a need for a drainage scheme in appropriate places where it would work and where it would help farmers to increase their productivity.</p></speech>

As the Chairman will know, at the recent meeting of the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we asked the Minister, Deputy Naughten, about the consultation document on the national energy and climate action plan.  Last week, his Secretary General said that the completion of the document was imminent and that it was about to go on to his desk, but today the Minister said that he did not receive anything.  With the committee's timelines being so tight, access to information is crucial.  Part of the committee's job is to open up this process.  We, as a committee, should not be backward in asking Departments for documents and, if they are not presenting them, we should ask why.  For example, and perhaps the Clerk to the Committee will confirm, we said that in advance of the Secretary General at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport coming here on Thursday, we would get some of the Department's proposals for the new plan.  What we need to avoid is what we had last week, which was a Secretary General listing everything contained in previous documents that anyone can read for themselves.  Listing things is of no use to the committee.  What we need is to know what is new.  I do not know whether we have received the presentation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in advance, which is what we asked for.</p></speech>

It is a great honour to be asked to present here.  It was also an honour to be asked to present at the Citizens' Assembly, which I did last year, and I talked about climate change and its impact.  My remarks today will follow on from the remarks that I made at the meeting of the Citizens' Assembly and the great discussions that I had there with those citizens about climate change and the challenges of climate change.</p> <p>  I will quickly say a few words about myself.  I have worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  I was a co-ordinating lead author in the fifth assessment report and for the working group 1 part of that report, which is about the physical basis of climate change.  My research interest is in looking at the causes of climate change.  I also work at the Met Office Hadley Centre where we look both at the observations and the predictions of future change.</p> <p>  The first slide of my presentation asks the following question.  What is the link between extreme weather events and either human induced climate change or natural climate variability?  That was a question that the Citizens' Assembly, in particular, asked me to consider.  It is one where, in scientific research, we have made quite a lot of advances.</p><p>This is important because citizens around the world are asking questions when they are affected by heatwaves, droughts and other extreme weather events of that sort.  It is understandable and right that they are asking whether such events are a sign of climate change.  People are asking scientists whether it is right to make a link between such events and climate change.  Like everyone else, scientists are aware that there are natural variations in our climate.  There have always been heatwaves.  There have been floods and droughts in the past.  It can be seen that the predictions which have been made over many years - going right back to the early reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 1990, which made it clear it was expected that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, would happen with increasing frequency - have been coming true and playing out over the intervening years.  The predictions that were made by the scientific community more than 20 years ago are becoming a reality before our eyes.  Our observations are bearing out what the climate models have been saying.</p><p> I have provided some examples of this in the presentation I have furnished to the joint committee.  The first slide following the headline slide refers to the question of a link between extreme events and human-induced climate change.  It mentions the flooding in Ireland in the winter of 2015-16 and some of the storms that have been seen in Ireland.  It includes a photograph of the railway line to Cornwall, in the west of England, which was washed away in January 2014.  This happened close to my home in Devon.  This slide also includes a map of the temperatures we saw in the summer of 2018, which was a particularly hot summer in Ireland and in the UK.  The temperature anomalies depicted in the map show the difference between this summer's temperatures and average summer temperatures.  The red parts of the map show the areas where temperatures were warmer than the average.  It can be seen that this summer, temperatures in large parts of the northern hemisphere were much higher than average.  There was a heatwave in Japan.  There were extreme temperatures in northern Scandinavia, North America and Europe.  The unusual thing about the summer of 2018 was that there were heatwaves in many parts of the northern hemisphere.  In the UK, comparisons were made with and the heatwave of 1976, when there was an extended period of heatwave and drought.  The UK Met Office made the point that this summer, weather conditions across the northern hemisphere as a whole were different from 1976.  It was not the case in 1976 that there were warm temperatures throughout the northern hemisphere.</p><p> The third slide, at the bottom of the first page of my presentation, contains a graph based on a remarkable set of scientific observations and measurements that have been taken from the summit of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa since the 1950s.  The graph shows that carbon dioxide concentrations at that location are more than 400 parts per million, which is the highest level they have reached for at least 800,000 years, and have increased steadily by more than 2 parts per million by volume every year.  There is a seasonal cycle in carbon dioxide concentrations due to processes in the land.  In the spring, the biosphere takes up carbon dioxide.  It is almost like it breathes it in during the spring and breathes it out during the autumn and winter.  The reason for the annual cycle across the globe as a whole is that there is more land in the northern hemisphere than there is in the southern hemisphere.  This means that the seasonal cycle for the north wins out relative to the south.  It is a scientific fact that carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing.  It has been well established for a long time that a natural greenhouse effect in the atmosphere keeps temperatures on the surface of the earth approximately 33&deg; Celsius warmer than they would be if we did not have an atmosphere.  Solar radiation from the sun acts to warm up the atmosphere more than it would if we did not have this natural greenhouse effect.  Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and through human activities, we are adding to this greenhouse gas and thereby enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and warming up the planet.</p><p> The next slide, which depicts average global temperatures, is based on a set of data compiled by the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre in collaboration with the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia.  It shows the average temperatures at the surface of our planet going back to 1850.  We can construct reliable, instrument-based measures of global average temperature over this period by looking at readings taken from land-based thermometers and weather stations, as well as measurements of the temperature of the surface of the sea taken from ships.  It can be seen from this slide that temperatures have been warming up.  Temperatures are now approximately 1&deg; Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average, which is considered to be the average between 1850 and 1900.  It is worth remembering that number when they think about climate change in the context of remarks I will make in a minute.  It can be noticed from this slide that temperatures vary from year to year.  The grey band in the graph represents our scientific uncertainty about making this measurement.  While there is some scientific uncertainty, the 1&deg; Celsius increase to which I have referred is way outside that uncertainty.  As the intergovernmental panel put it, warming is unequivocal.  It is of the nature of a scientific fact.</p><p> The next graph I have prepared is taken from the intergovernmental panel's fifth assessment report, which was published in 2013.  It is another way of illustrating the average surface temperatures across the globe.  There are fewer points marked on this graph because it depicts the average for every decade.  The end of the graph shows that temperatures are approximately 1&deg; Celsius warmer than they were at the start of the previous century.  The variations that are seen when the figures are averaged across an entire decade are smaller than the year-to-year variations seen in the previous graph.  We have averaged out some of the variations.</p><p> The blue band on the next graph relates to climate models that have been run in the past period in an attempt to see whether we can simulate what has been happening in observations if we include only natural causes of climate change when we run our climate models.  We know that the solar output varies on an 11-year cycle.  That has been included in these climate model simulations.  Explosive volcanic eruptions occasionally eject dust way up into the higher atmosphere, which can temporarily cool temperatures.  We also know that there are natural climate variations.  Members may have heard about the El Ni&ntilde;o southern oscillation, which occasionally means temperatures are warmer.  All of those things have been included in the climate models represented in the graph to which I refer.  It is clear from the graph that such factors do not explain the observed warming, which is well outside of anything that could possibly be accounted for by taking account of natural factors only.</p><p> The red band on the next graph shows what happens when the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations I have mentioned - it is now at 400 parts per million by volume in the atmosphere - is included in the climate models shown in the previous graph.  Other human-induced factors, including factors associated with air pollution, aerosols and the effects of pollutants in the atmosphere, are also included for the purposes of this graph.  It can be seen in this graph that the observed warming is well accounted for by these climate models when these factors are included in them.  I referred earlier to projections that were made in the early 1990s on the basis of an earlier generation of climate models, which were not as sophisticated as those being used by the scientific community now.</p><p>What has happened since is consistent with what the scientific community was saying even back in the 1990s.<br/><br/>The next slide shows a couple of photographs from the plenary meeting I attended with governments to agree the fifth assessment report.  The governments agreed with our scientific statement that human influence on the climate system is clear.  I apologise as the next slide works a little better as an animation but I can describe what I seek to explain.  It illustrates what happens with a warming world for extremes, such as heatwaves.  We can think of pre-industrial climate, when climate was relatively stable, as it was for many thousands of years before the industrial era.  We can plot temperatures in a particular place and see that some years were warmer and some were colder.  Many years are average and only occasionally do we see particularly hot or cold years.  We can then think about what happens if the climate is warmed.  Even if climate is warmed by only 1&deg; Celsius in the global average, which is where we are now, the probability increases significantly of having extreme temperatures in Ireland or Europe over a summer season.  That is a property of the basic mathematics of the issue.  What were very rare events have now become much more frequent.<br/><br/>I was involved with a pioneering study that looked at the European heatwave of 2003.  It was fair to say this was something of a wake-up call for citizens of Europe as the European average temperatures were the highest they have been in the entire instrumental record of temperatures for Europe.  This led to many tens of thousands of people dying in the heatwave, particularly vulnerable elderly people in urban centres.  It was a wake-up call as maybe people did not realise how vulnerable elderly people could be in such a heatwave.  We did a study, published in <i>Nature</i>in 2004, and found that as a result of this effect of warming on the risk of heatwaves, human influence had very likely at least doubled the risk of European summer temperatures being as hot as in 2003.  We have come back to the work since and published a paper in 2015.  We found the conclusion was robust.  We have improved climate models and the study was still correct.  We also found the risk of such heatwaves has continued to increase with further warming.  Events that would occur twice per century in the early 2000s are now expected to occur twice per decade.<br/><br/>What about heavy rainfall and flooding?  Storm Desmond had a major impact in December 2015.  I have a graph that I showed to the Citizens' Assembly.  It is a map produced in a collaboration between Met &Eacute;ireann and the Met Office demonstrating rainfall anomalies, or how unusual were the rainfall totals in that month relative to a climatological average, which is often taken to be 1961 to 1990.  The rainfall averages were extremely high in particular parts, including Ireland, north-west England and western Scotland and Wales.  These were very extreme rainfall totals.<br/><br/>How can this be related to climate change?  It is important to underline there was much variability in climate, and looking at rainfall in particular there is much variation.  In our experience we know some months are particularly wet or dry, and there is much variation.  There is an important scientific fact to be mentioned, which is that in a warmer atmosphere, there is more moisture.  This is a rather basic physical property of how the atmosphere behaves as sea surface temperatures and the oceans warm, leading to more evaporation and the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increasing.  That means there is approximately 6% to 7% more moisture in the air for every 1&deg; Celsius of warming.  I indicated earlier that it is approximately 1&deg; Celsius warmer in the global average than in pre-industrial times, and that means there is approximately 6% or 7% more moisture in the air.  That is what one would expect from physical principles, and it is what has been observed from satellite data.  We have the observations to bear that out and it is what is happening.<br/><br/>What does this mean for extreme weather events and the risk of floods and droughts?  In a scientific sense we must be a little careful as we must recognise there is much weather variation.  The weather in this part of the world is very much associated with what is happening in the Atlantic Ocean and the storm tracks that bring storms across the Atlantic and hit us in our part of the world.  We need to do some careful analysis and I thank Dr. Conor Murphy from Maynooth University for the result included in the documentation.  He and his colleagues did an analysis of Storm Desmond in which they found evidence for this human fingerprint on this event.  It is interesting as Storm Desmond was associated with what is known as an atmospheric river, a natural phenomenon that brings moisture from subtropical latitudes and transports it to the mid-latitudes, such as here in Ireland.  We have seen such events in Cumbria, and parts of the world like New Zealand have also experienced the effects of atmospheric rivers.  The point is that the analysis of Storm Desmond indicates that with warmer ocean temperatures and their effect whereby the atmosphere contains more moisture, there is a very much increased risk that when atmospheric rivers occur they will bring higher moisture than we had in pre-industrial times.  Therefore, the impact of these atmospheric rivers is greater.<br/><br/>I will move to what this means for the future.  The next slide has two graphs taken again from the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  In 2013, we agreed a conclusion with governments in the plenary.  The statement indicates that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system, while limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.  The graphs illustrate the point.  The first shows global average temperatures, indicating how they are projected to increase with continued emissions and what might be referred to as a business as usual scenario.  They show temperatures increasing by the order of 4&deg; Celsius or more relative to pre-industrial levels.  A change of 4&deg; Celsius or 5&deg; Celsius is significant.  To put it in context, in the last ice age, when the climate was radically different from now and we had large ice caps covering many of today's inhabited areas, global average temperatures were only 5&deg; Celsius colder than now.  It a major shift in the climate.  If emissions are reduced, warming will be very much less.  The graph on the slide indicates the dramatic changes to Arctic sea ice that would result under continued emission rises.  Under a business as usual scenario, there is the potential that there would be no Arctic sea ice at all in the summer.<br/><br/>I will move to what this means for Ireland.</p><p>I thank my colleague from the Irish scientific community, Dr. Conor Murphy from Maynooth, for this.  We see a picture of drier summers, wetter winters and increasing temperatures in the summer.  What is being done here is to relate the probability of the types of season that we had in the past.  If one thinks back to the particularly dry summer here of 1995, one in every eight years could be as dry as that summer by the end of this century with continued emissions.  Likewise, one in eight years could be as wet as the winter of 1994.  The temperature of the 1995 summer could be once every seven years because warming would make that summer a relatively cool summer in the new climate.  Therefore, only one in seven years could be as cool as that summer.  It shows that with continued emissions what would once have been thought of as rather hot summers could become rather cool.</p><p> On the impact of climate change, this last set of graphs is taken from some work we did at the Met Office, and it looks at the impacts that could be avoided with mitigation.  The basic point is that with continued emissions the risks of exposure to heatwaves and the risks to food security, flooding, water stress and water availability across the globe are significant and substantial.  These graphs show that with continued emissions, and with continued business as usual, large factions of the population will be affected by substantial and significant impacts that would be difficult, if at all possible, to cope with.  If the Paris Agreement of 2015, which states that governments should strive to keep warming to below 2&deg; Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels and make efforts to keep warming to below 1.5&deg; Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, is successful, at least some of those impacts could be avoided.  As I stated at the beginning, we are now already at 1&deg; Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels.  The Paris Agreement to limit warming to well below 2&deg; Celsius needs to be thought of in that context.</p><p> To sum up, I restate the point that climate is warming, and that with increasing warming comes an increasing risk of some of the impacts I have talked about, namely, heatwaves, heavy rainfall, flooding and other impacts of climate change.  Taking action to limit climate change will significantly reduce the severity of impacts on people and society.</p></speech>

I thank the professor for his straightforward and relatively simple explanation of the science of climate change.  As parliamentarians, we are regularly confronted by people, sometimes within these four walls, who tend to be deniers of climate change.  The old standard is that they look back to the Ice Age and they indicate how different things were then, and they look to hot events that took place in the past.  The professor's explanation of the change in average temperatures is one of the best and clearest explanations we have seen for some time.  If we are to be successful as parliamentarians in attempting to show leadership about climate change, we must bring people with us, and we must move to some extent away from academia and into the vernacular, trying to talk about the practical implications of climate change.  In one sense we must draw a line under the science.</p> <p>  Climate change is there and it is happening.  The professor's rather simple explanation of the average temperature rising suggests the only reason for it is the level of industrialisation that has taken place in society and the impact of CO2  emissions, among other harmful gases.  That is a fact.  We need to quickly bring into focus the impact of all this, as the professor has done.  His final slide boils down the work that we have to do as parliamentarians, which in the first instance is to inform and create the dialogue and discussion.  I recall previous work that a committee in this House did on the failure of the Lisbon treaty.  A rather wise journalist appeared before us and explained in clear terms that the Lisbon treaty was lost because people did not understand it and they were not talking about it or the implications of it because it was not boiled down to relatively straightforward conversations that could be had in the pub, the shop or where people congregate.  The point was made that if we are not talking about it in here, it is unlikely people will talk about it outside.  This is why I was anxious to see somebody like the professor appear before the committee who moves on to some extent from academia and science to the causes and effects.  The effect is clear.  In the past ten years we have seen such extreme weather events, such as storms and flooding, which created enormous difficulties for people.</p> <p>  Much of the time we wish and hope we will have a hot summer, but when we get a hot summer it is much more extreme and prolonged than we are used to.  We are now deeply concerned with the impact on our capacity to provide water for citizens or the impact on farmers to be able to grow fodder to get them through the winter period.  While it is good to have a nice July and August, the extremes bring into really sharp focus the serious effects.  It is incumbent on us to hammer home the message that these events will happen more regularly and the weather patterns will change, according to the predictions.  Someone must talk about the science but it is incumbent on us to talk about the effect which we see happening.</p> <p>  Again, I welcome and thank the professor for his relatively simple presentation.  For far too long climate change has been locked up in scientific investigation, mapping, logging and so on, which is all wonderful work, but it has not found its way into the general dialogue.  It is starting now, as a result of people realising that something must be happening, this is not normal and the changes in weather patterns have a negative impact.  We must move to the next stage, in this committee and in this Parliament, and take difficult decisions which will require leadership from the Government and the Opposition to implement them in such a way as to address or mitigate, to some extent, the really negative impact of a continuation of climate change.</p></speech>

This has been a useful tutorial for us in an academic sense and a fruitful exercise.  One of the professor's slides mentions the global average surface temperature change from 1850 to 2000.  Are we talking about an increase in temperature of up to 5&deg; Celsius?</p><p>What will be the permutations for life of the planet if the average temperature increases by that amount by 2100?  Will we be in an existential crisis at that stage if we keep going the way we are going?</p><p> What kind of radical measures do governments need to take now in respect of policies that will halt the effects of human-induced climate change?  The key message that I have taken from Professor Stott's intervention is that human-induced climate change is a major contributory factor to the increases in temperature.  If I understand the professor correctly, he is stating that if we continue to go in the way we are going in terms of the production of carbon, we will overshoot what is envisaged in the Paris Agreement as a result of human-induced climate change and that the lack of policy interventions by governments across the globe means that the change being implemented is not radical enough to halt the effects of temperature increases as measured on the Celsius scale.  Will the professor expand on that a little?</p></speech>

His contribution - in plain straightforward language - was very useful.  Let us assume we have moved beyond denial.  The evidence across the globe stacks up - it is undeniable that there is climate change.  The vast majority of people accept that.  The danger of rising sea levels to infrastructure is an issue that bothered Ireland because it is an island nation.  At the present rate of increase in global warming, will Professor Stott tell us what this means for the city of Liverpool or for London, which has a population of 8 million or 9 million people?  Some of the households in those cities are situated just a couple of metres above water level?  What is the timeline?  What is the extent of the risk?</p> <p>  It may be unfair to ask Professor Stott about the Irish situation because he is probably more familiar with the situation in England.  However, does what he envisages mean that there could eventually be seawater flowing up Kildare Street?  I was at an event earlier in the year at which was displayed a map on which one quarter of Ireland was shown as being underwater.  Everybody talks about what Government needs to do - and I am sure Government needs to take action - but individuals, local authorities, businesses, households and farmers have to do something.  In terms of society overall, what are the three biggest things we need to do in the next two to three years?</p></speech>

It is a great list of questions.  I will go through them in order.</p> <p>  Yes, we need to move on and the scientific community is ready to respond to the new challenge we have in the scientific community.  The fifth assessment report, AR5, in which I was involved was a very important staging post.  Human influence on the climate system is clear.  It was a very clear statement.  What the scientific community is ready to do - and I provided an example from Maynooth University - is provide our science in order to understand exactly what the risks are, understand them on a more granular level and help citizens to respond.  Climate change is now part of everyday conservation in light of some of the recent events in the UK and Ireland, such as the floods, the heatwave and the drought.  The scientific community is ready to engage in that discussion and to help citizens and governments respond in the most appropriate way to this challenge.  It is a really important challenge for the scientific community because it requires us to provide further refinement into our levels of prediction.  For example, we need to have an even greater understanding of exactly how particular localities would be affected by climate change.</p> <p>  Let me stress again the clear point that the basic physics mean there is an increasing frequency of many of these types of extreme weather events.  We have seen these events play out and they are giving us a lot of confidence that the climate model projects are reliable and that we can use them to provide an extra level of detail.</p> <p>  We had a question on the implications of business-as-usual scenario, with the member pointing to the graph that shows a rise in temperature of 4o Celsius or 5o Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels.  Earlier, I related that to the climate of the most recent ice age.  There is no doubt that emissions continuing to grow and a business-as-usual mindset remaining in place for the rest of the century will lead to levels of warming weather and significant risks.  I refer, for example, to rising sea levels resulting from the melting of the west Antarctic ice sheet and the melting of ice in Greenland.  There are significant challenges associated with food security.  In circumstances where there is 4o Celsius or 5o Celsius of warming, there is a significantly enhanced risk of the sort of drought that would mean, potentially, that the world would really struggle its population.  One can see already that there is not total food security in certain parts of the world.  With levels of climate change such as those to which I refer, feeding the world's population will become extremely challenging.  There are significant risks associated with rising sea levels and concomitant flooding.  As the item on the infographic relating to the water stress hows, there will be a challenge in the context of ensuring that people will have access to water.  Given that there are concomitant risks, climate change is also a threat multiplier as well.  There are already particular levels of threat in existence even without climate change.  However, the latter is then adding to those stresses in terms of, for example, migration.</p> <p>  To be honest, scientifically, it is difficult to paint a picture of the type of world I am describing.  This is where we need to look very much in a risk-based context.  We can paint pictures of what could happen.  I could talk at length about the west Antarctic ice sheet and the fact that there is this massive body of ice that is what we term "dynamically unstable" because seawater is warming and melting the ice from beneath.  The latter process poses the risk of the entire mass of ice being dislodged.  If the scientific community or I were asked to give a precise probability of that to which I refer happening, we would both potentially struggle to do so.  What I can tell members, however, is that there is a risk of it happening and that the impact would be considerable.</p> <p>  We need to think about food security and other issues in the same sort of way, particularly as they have such major impacts.  As a scientist, I can say that there is plenty of evidence to support the supposition that we really do not want to discover what a world such as that which I am describing would look like in reality.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Stott" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100200002#G00200"><p>Yes.  We can draw on the scientific evidence to imagine a "2&deg; world".  We have scientifically examined the measures that need to be taken to make it at least likely - a 66% chance - that we will not exceed an increase of 2 degrees Celsius on pre-industrial levels.  We can see the global measures we need to take.  For example, we need to reduce emissions by 50% by 2050 and to zero net emissions by approximately 2080 or towards the latter end of this century.  Essentially, this means the world must put itself on a trajectory towards zero emissions and, in the grand scheme of things, in quite a short length of time, although beyond the length of time many of us expect to see, but it is the length of time our children and grandchildren could well see.</p> <p>  We must remember that it is the developed nations of the world that have been responsible for many of the emissions.  I argue that the next question is for politicians, rather than me as a scientist; it is a question of equity in how the burden is to be shared among nations.  The scientific point is that very considerable reductions need to happen to get to the 2&deg; world mentioned in the Paris agreement.  That brings us to the question of sea levels, etc.  As an aside, I was born in Liverpool and have a connection with the city.  The sea level is currently rising by over 3 mm a year.  It should be borne in mind that because of the way climate works, "sea level" is termed as an "integrator", which means that it sums up the net effect of everything being done as a consequence of human emissions over long periods.  It is not something that can be switched on and off.  There is a very long-term commitment - over many centuries - to continued sea level rises as a result of the emissions we are seeing today.  Sea level rises also significantly increase the risk of storm surges that have been alluded to.  There is a gradually increasing sea level which is clearly attributable to human-induced emissions which result in a warming of the oceans which leads to expansion and also the melting of snow and ice on land.</p> <p>  The scientific community now has a very good and robust explanation and all of the terms in the equation add up.  There is very strong scientific confidence in their attribution to rising sea levels.  The risk to places like Liverpool and London, as mentioned, is increasing.  It is a little like the way I spoke about rising temperatures and heatwaves.  I refer to the curve of the background level in sea levels gradually increasing.  The Thames Barrier protects London from the consequences of a storm surge, but the risk of overtopping is being increased very significantly because of a baseline rise in the sea level.  Thanks to the Thames Barrier, London is currently protected, but if we consider the high levels of global warming with continued high emissions, the question of the Thames Barrier needs to be reconsidered.</p> <p>  Having precise numbers depends on where we look and the configuration of a particular city, the sea bed and all the rest.  This is where the scientific community is ready to provide the detailed assessments.  There would be differences between Liverpool, London, Dublin or wherever else we might look.  I will not give precise numbers, but the scientific community is ready to advise on the matter.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions which I will ask quickly.  </p> <p>  What are attribution signs and how has the concept evolved in recent years?  Does the growing confidence in attribution signs change the way climate change policies should be evaluated for costs and benefits?  For example, if we know that increases in temperature will make weather events more likely and intense, how should we measure the potential cost of actions to reduce emissions against the likelihood of these risks?</p> <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann does not communicate climate science or risk in its forecasting.  Does best practice involve reporting climate risk through the meteorological service or what is the best way of doing it?  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is drafting a summary for policymakers of its latest report on how to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The BBC has reported that the differences between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius are quite stark.  For example, 10 million fewer people would lose their homes and become refugees; 2 million sq. km of permafrost would be saved over centuries and there would be a 50% global reduction in the level of water scarcity.  Does such an analysis and information make us demand more ambitious climate change mitigation policies or are we looking for enough already?</p> <p>  Climate Action Network Europe has published an infographic which estimates that in 2017 extreme weather events in Europe caused &euro;14 billion worth of damage.  It estimates that with an increase of 3 degrees Celsius this figure could increase to &euro;190 billion.  What would be the total cost of damage for Ireland in either scenario?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his questions.  </p> <p>  I have been involved in the attribution science area for a long time.  The nub is trying to understand the world in which we live today and the counterfactual world in which we could be living if we had not collectively changed the climate.  In comparing the two scenarios we can work out how things have changed in ways which are attributable to human induced emissions.  We have shown that we can do this reliably because we have the climate models and understanding to simulate quite accurately on a large scale the current climate and how it has changed over time.  For example, the work I did on the European heatwave is robust and the calculations I made demonstrated that the risk of such a heatwave had more than doubled.  Subsequent work indicates that the work I did was quite robust.</p> <p>  That brings me to the question of a cost-benefit analysis.  The science is starting to try to assess the probability of such events and using attribution science to do so.  That is to what the question alludes.  It is probably fair to say it is still difficult to be very precise about the cost-benefit trade-off.</p><p>One needs to understand quite clearly what the costs are, including the avoided costs, and the role adaptation has played.  We are adapting.  If we look back to the 2003 heatwave, lessons were learned and, thankfully, some of the impacts of it have not been felt since, because the societal systems are better adapted to supporting vulnerable people through heatwaves.</p><p> It is not a straightforward exercise.  The science can, nevertheless, inform this, especially when it is thought of in a risk context, and can highlight some of the risks and provide storylines of what might happen, what is happening and what we might have avoided.  In that storyline context, that can be quite helpful.</p><p> On the question on the meteorological service, I refer to the Met Office in the UK.  We are now working in the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, which was set up many years ago by our Prime Minister at the time, Mrs. Thatcher.  We have had a long remit to look at climate projections.  Later this year we will be releasing a new set of climate projections for the UK.  That will provide a lot of information in this risk-based context and will provide probabilistic information, because we cannot provide a single figure as to what the temperature or heatwaves will be in 50 years' time.  What we can provide is a probability, and provide that contextual information for people to understand that and to engage in planning.  However one does this exercise, it is important to do this in the probabilistic sense, which folds in one's scientific understanding.  There are plenty of quite sophisticated uses where that information can be taken and applied it in their particular context.  As to 1.5&deg; report, what I learned just as I came in, is that the committee will hear evidence from the co-chair of working group one, and the co-chair of working group three, who are currently at the plenary meeting in Korea, agreeing that report.  This is happening this week.  It would be most appropriate to defer that answer to them, if the committee agrees.  For sure, as one goes to higher levels of warming, there will be more overall net consequences of climate change, which is true relative to 1.5&deg; Celsius.  The co-chairs will be able to provide the committee with much more information on that, which will be in light of a report that will have been approved and published.</p><p> As to costs, there are very significant costs associated with extreme weather such as heatwaves, floods, droughts and windstorms.  They increase with climate change, but I do not have a precise number for Ireland.  It is a good question to ask, however, as to what sort of estimates might be available here.</p></speech>

My question is slightly different from some of the questions that have gone before.  If we accept that the phenomenon of climate change is a global one and deal with it in that context, there is no doubt that human activity is hastening change and what is happening in the environment.  When we consider that the global population is 7.5 billion and is predicted to rise to 9.3 billion by 2050, that is going to have an effect.  When we consider this on a <i>per capita</i>basis, because we accept there are more people on the planet which will have a bigger impact, how much is that changing as we go forward, when we consider people are becoming more aware of these issues?</p><p>I refer to the studies carried out on the impact of climate change on developed countries compared to underdeveloped countries, that is, First World countries compared to Third World countries, or the impact of climate change between different continents.  I am interested to learn, in the wake of the Kyoto and Paris Agreements, about countries that could benefit from climate change, and do not have a huge appetite to join us on this issue and try to deal with climate change.  We all accept that we have responsibility to deal with this and to address the problems and to lead by example, especially the UK and Ireland.  Could this good work be offset by an appetite in other parts of the world to industrialise and grow?  If that is the case, how do we address this conundrum of collective responsibility?</p></speech>

I have done a lot of work in the past few years with Chinese scientists, not just around the attribution science but around the whole area of climate science, as part of a collaborative project I am involved in.  It has been very interesting for me to learn a little about the context in China, and to meet some academics talking about the challenges, and to meet colleagues from the Chinese meteorological administration.  What I learned there is that China is facing some very significant challenges around, for example, food security - feeding its population - and issues to do with flooding and drought.  Chinese scientists have been writing very important papers about how climate change is changing the risk of these extreme weather events.  It is clear to me, as a scientist, that the Government in China takes these threats of climate change to its population very seriously.  I take that to mean that when China engages in this international political discussion, it is taking that evidence and those impacts on board.  This is in the context of looking across the globe, and seeing some countries feeling the benefits from climate change.  That may be the case but if one looks across the world, it is probably true to say that the great majority of countries have very significant challenges, including the example I have given of China.  While China clearly has its own policies, which I will not go into, one of the issues it is addressing is the issue of its population.  This is a serious issue, and it is true of many places.</p> <p>  On the impacts, one of the things the scientific evidence is showing is that many of the areas in the tropics are significantly affected by climate change.  These are countries that are very poor and vulnerable.  There are very big challenges there.  That is something we need to stress because if we think of drought, in particular, the signal of climate change is rather large, relative to the variations in those place in the tropics.  The hazard is large there, as is the vulnerability, and therefore, the impact is also.</p> <p>  Impacts, including deleterious ones, are being felt in many parts of the world.  One obvious positive benefit is the potential in some northern high latitudes for crops.  Studies have looked at that and looking at the global picture, they have concluded that, in the context of continued emissions, it is very clear the net effect is a negative impact.</p></speech>

Sometimes we hear in policy discussions on this issue the argument - maybe this is not the professor's science area because he is connected with the IPCC reports -  that we might not have to concentrate on methane gas emissions.  Due to their short lifecycle, they are not as significant as the CO2 lifecycle, which is much longer.  Does the professor have a sense of that?</p><p>Would it be an appropriate response to discount methane somewhat or are other factors, such as the melting of tundra ice resulting in the release of methane, moving us beyond natural tipping points and bringing methane back into the frame?  Perhaps that is outside Professor Stott's area of expertise but if he had a view on it, I would appreciate it.  </p><p> My understanding is that in recent years, carbon-equivalent global emissions have started to stabilise somewhat - for three or four years they were relatively stable - but that the concentrations in the atmosphere of CO2 equivalent gases have increased significantly from approximately 2.5 parts per million to almost 3 parts per million.  Does that tell Professor Stott anything?  Is there anything significant we should read into this or is it just a result of natural variability?</p><p> I have seen the work of Jennifer Francis from Rutgers University on explaining the phenomenon by which the jet stream is altering and becoming slightly stuck in a more undulating pattern.  She argues this is a result of some of the changes occurring in the ice caps.  In those circumstances, if Ireland were to end up on a down point of a jet stream groove, as it were, we could end up with a colder climate.</p><p> Professor Stott will present some of his assessments on the more local implications of climate change to the UK Government in the next six months or so.  Can he give us a sneak preview of any of that?  He mentioned wetter winters and drier summers.  We have had similar research from Maynooth University, which has done some very good work on this issue, but the granularity is difficult.  Does Professor Stott have a general sense of what the implications might be from looking at this incredibly complex system with all the moving parts?  Ireland is not a great distance from the UK.  Will Professor Stott share the latest available information on the specific conditions we might expect here in 20, 30, 40 or 50 years?</p></speech>

I will take them one by one.  If I have interpreted the question on methane correctly, there are two sides, one on emissions and one on the impacts of climate change.  There is no getting away from the fact that we need to reduce emissions if we are to move away from what I call a business as usual scenario.  There is no easy fix.  We cannot play methane off against CO2 or nitrous oxide or something else.  There has to be a concerted effort to achieve 50% global reductions by 2050.  That means we have to tackle all the human induced greenhouse gases and take a co-ordinated approach.  We cannot only look at methane, for example.  There is no easy fix unfortunately.</p></speech>

That is the big picture and there is no getting away from it.  One can get into very detailed arguments about timing and exactly what we do in which year and what a particular country does in which year but that was not the spirit of my remark.  My remark concerned the big picture.  That is the context in which one has to view it.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the tundra.  One of the risks of continued climate change arises from the fact there is methane in the tundra.  The methane clathrates right at the bottom of the ocean must also be considered.  If one is talking about the more extreme warming rates, there are risks we cannot quantify very precisely.  There could be very large releases of methane which could have a significant warming effect.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on emissions versus concentrations, the big picture still stands.  Emissions and concentrations continue to increase.  There are some variations from year to year potentially to do with economic activity and there are probably difficulties with precisely measuring emissions.  The big picture is it is certainly the case that emissions and concentrations continue to increase.  The only way to stabilise the concentrations is to reduce the emissions.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the jet stream and the work of Jennifer Francis.  There is some fascinating work being done on trying to unpick the issue of the jet stream, which carries our weather systems and varies.  For example, the position of the jet stream was relevant to the sort of weather conditions we had this summer.  Exactly how the jet stream is varying and exactly how it might be impacted are subjects of intense scientific debate.  So far there is not very strong scientific consensus that there is a very direct link between, for example, the Arctic sea ice decline, which is very clear and absolutely the case, and how that is affecting the jet stream.  There have been lots of studies about that and about precisely how the jet stream is changing.  What we do know is that the high latitudes are warming up more than the lower latitudes.  The Arctic is warming up much more rapidly than the lower latitudes and that is changing the temperature gradient of the surface.  We also know about what is happening at the upper atmosphere.  Potentially it could be pushing the jet stream further north and potentially weakening it.  </p> <p>  Taking account of some of those details does not change the overall message that, broadly speaking, summers are getting warmer and are expected to get warmer and that there will be wetter winters.  The day after tomorrow type scenario of a dramatic change towards colder temperatures in Ireland or the UK is not likely.  The day after tomorrow scenario is associated with overturning circulation and the currents in the Atlantic Ocean and the idea that the whole system shuts down and potentially cools down temperatures at these latitudes.  One might think of it as a risk but I would say it is a low probability that can only be thought of in the context of more extreme levels of climate change.  What we need to concentrate on in terms of planning and adaptation are the narratives around warmer summers and wetter winters and then to add the details on to that.  In terms of the UK climate predictions, we will do that later this year.  </p></speech>

He gave a very interesting presentation and I appreciate his attendance to assist our committee.  I was thinking about the graph concerning the 1&deg; Celsius temperature increase.  If we do not get our act together globally, at what point will the temperature increase by 4&deg; Celsius?  How many decades or centuries are we looking at?  What would the planet look like if we experienced such an increase?</p></speech>

It shows a scenario, which in the jargon is called RCP8.5, which is the business as usual scenario of continued emissions.  One of the graphs with a red band shows the different climate models and is a portrayal of the scientific uncertainty.</p><p> In answer to the Deputy's question about 4&deg; Celsius, and remembering that there is a slight technicality here because this is being referenced relative to the 1981 to 2010 average, so one must read it off quite carefully in terms of where that is, but looking at the median of that towards the latter part of this century, maybe about the 2080s or so, it can be seen from that that there is some uncertainty about when that 4&deg; Celsius will be crossed.  There could be a range of times.  If climate is warming up faster, it could be earlier, perhaps as soon as the 2060s, or it could be considerably later than that, depending on whether we are lucky or unlucky in terms of the exact climate sensitivity.</p><p> In terms of the impact of that, I refer back to my earlier comments that once we reach 4&deg; Celsius or more, then to some extent we will be in a scenario where there are these risks that we know exist and that we know have very significant impacts, for example, in terms of food security, agriculture, a sea level rise from melting ice from Greenland and the west Antarctic, and significant increases in flooding events, heatwaves and droughts.  At such levels of warming, it is difficult to be very precise about the probabilities of such impacts and what that will mean.  The last graph I showed members illustrated the level at 5&deg; Celsius when we would see impacts on huge numbers of the global population.  These graphs show that there are not many parts of the world that will escape this, and this raises the question of how we will adapt.  It is a difficult question to answer.  It is hard to know how the global population would be able to cope with such impacts.  It is hard to be precise.  It is much easier to paint the picture of the graph I displayed, with the heatwaves, the cropland decline, the flooding and the water stress, which summarises briefly from an exercise that we did in the Met Office.  It is easier to paint a general picture of an extremely challenging situation that would be very difficult for people to cope with.</p></speech>

There must be an impact on the ecology.  If the water temperatures are increasing, there will be all sorts of impacts.  How will fish survive, for example, or what kind of microbial activity will follow and what impact will that have on us?  It is Armageddon stuff we are talking about.  If the pollinators are impacted, there will be no one to pollinate our plants.  I do not think that we have thought through the seriousness of this at all.</p></speech>

I have not yet mentioned ocean acidification, which is another impact of climate change.  The ocean is becoming less alkaline as a result of carbon dioxide being taken up and there is a substantial threat to marine organisms to make their shells because of the ocean's changed chemistry.  We are already starting to see the impact of climate change in the oceans through coral reef bleaching as temperatures rise, to which the effects of ocean acidification is added.  Discussion has begun on using geoengineering to geoengineer our way out of the climate issue through, for instance, putting dust into the atmosphere which might cool the planet.  That would not address ocean acidification because, if we continue to pump out carbon dioxide, the ocean will continue to draw it down and it will continue to have this impact on the ocean ecosystems.  That is an important point to remember.</p></speech>

Professor Stott said that the Met Office had a long remit to look at climate projections.  What is its relationship with the BBC in terms of using its service to explain what is happening with the weather relative to the individual?  Does it have a specific policy remit in that regard?</p> <p>  I am interested in Professor Stott's views on policies.  It seems there is a policy where when a broadcaster features a climate scientist, they automatically have a climate change denier on too.  That seems insane at this point.  We should not give a platform to people like that at this stage when we are trying to explain to citizens what is going on, why the climate is changing and why we must make certain decisions.  We have failed badly here in getting our message across.  Our meteorological service in this country should be doing more to explain to the population what is happening.  Does the Met Office in the UK have policies that enable it to do that?  Met offices around the world are doing very innovative things in communicating what is going on.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for the BBC but I understand that there is a clear understanding that it is not productive to have someone saying things that are scientifically not correct.  I have some experience of this myself.  Lord Lawson was on the BBC "Today" programme where he said things to the effect that global warming had stopped.  I was on the "Today" programme the next day to correct that statement and state that that was not the case.  With the new guidance that has come out very recently, the BBC has recognised that it is not productive to have such a non-debate because the established fact is that climate is changing and that there is a relationship to human emissions.</p> <p>  The Met Office has a wide remit to advise Government on a range of issues relating to climate change.  We take opportunities whenever we can and wherever it is appropriate to communicate to the press.  For instance, during the recent heatwave there was considerable interest in the media and I was interviewed for the 10 o'clock news on the BBC by David Shukman to talk about the heatwave and how it was linked to climate change.  That remit is seen in the context of a general remit to communicate our findings to the British public, and it is in that spirit.  We try to do this in a way that is scientifically informative and to be available when asked.   We try to bring our latest science to that.  The Met Office often produces briefing notes and we provide information when there are particular weather events or there are particular issues on which this scientific information would be useful.  We try to do that at those moments.  The BBC is one means by which we can communicate this but there are others such as newspapers, online, and social media.</p><p>There are other means by which that can be communicated as well.</p></speech>

I was involved in a study that examined extremely heavy rainfall and flooding in New Zealand.  New Zealand has atmospheric rivers as well.  Basically, it is what happens when there is a plume of air moving up from the subtropics, which brings air that is more normally found much further south in the northern hemisphere.  It brings that air, heavily laden with moisture, in a steady plume from much warmer ocean temperatures than we are used to here, transporting it many thousands of kilometres up to our latitudes.  The issue is that due to how the atmosphere works this stream of air can be quite steady for many hours, even for several days, and basically dumps rain in a particular locality.  It is almost like bringing somebody else's weather to our shores.  When it happens it shows our vulnerability to that type of weather event.  The issue with climate change, as the study from Maynooth University has shown, is that with warmer ocean temperatures - I spoke about 6% or 7% more moisture in the atmosphere for 1&deg; Celsius of warming - that is loading the atmosphere even more and the impact when it happens is even greater than it would have been without climate change.</p></speech>

Faced with these challenges, one proposition being made is that perhaps there is another way to keep global temperatures from increasing by 4&deg; Celsius or 5&deg; Celsius.  One suggestion is that if dust were to be put very high in the atmosphere, it would cool climates.  This is basically mimicking what happens naturally when there is a big explosive volcanic eruption.  There was one example of that in 1991 when Pinatubo exploded.  That temporarily cooled the climate for a year or two before the dust fell back down out of the very high atmosphere.  One could say that perhaps that could be done artificially, but there are a couple of issues to think about with that.  The one I alluded to is that it would not deal with the fact that we are continuing to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, therefore, continuing to make the ocean more acidic.  The second point is that it has major impacts on rainfall patterns.  Doing such a massive thing to the climate has massive impacts.</p></speech>

Professor Stott can correct me if I am wrong but it would be similar to the hole in the ozone 30 years ago.  When CFCs were banned, the hole started to close up.  Is there any evidence based around that or anything on the flip side?</p></speech>

The ozone hole is starting to recover so we have seen how we turned the corner on that.  The thing about the global temperatures is that due to the long timescales in terms of how the climate works and in terms of this thing called "commitment", the scenario we are looking at is stabilising temperatures, at least over timescales of decades.  To reduce temperatures, one is in the scenario of trying to take greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.  The analogy of the ozone hole, where the ozone hole recovered, for the climate change problem would be that potentially humanity would succeed collectively in stabilising temperatures.  If they were stabilised at a sufficiently low level, that would be an achievement comparable to the ozone hole.  The reason for that in terms of stabilisation is the long timescales and the long commitment that past emissions have made to our warming.  The issue with climate change is that our emissions cumulatively lead to an overall level of warming, so that would be the analogous success there.</p></speech>

The point is that there are changes we must adapt to no matter what happens.  The adaptation issue is important and real.  We do not live in the climate we used to have.  We have lived in a changed climate that brings additional challenges so we must adapt.  However, we must also mitigate emissions to prevent those high levels.</p></speech>

We are engaging this afternoon with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, who has responsibility for natural resources and digital development.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I wish to advise that submissions and opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to this meeting.

I will keep my opening statement brief to allow the committee sufficient time to examine the programme expenditure to the outturn at the end of June.  I am joined by Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, who has responsibility for community affairs, natural resources and digital development.</p><p>I am also joined by Finola Rossi, our finance officer, Jim Whelan from our finance unit, Ciara Kennedy the national broadband plan division, Ben King from the Eircode division, Triona Quill from the broadcasting policy division, Eileen O&rsquo;Connor from the energy efficiency and affordability division and Eileen Doyle from the mining division.</p><p> The total provision for my Department for 2018 is &euro;587 million, comprising &euro;215 million for capital investment - including a &euro;6 million carryover from last year - and &euro;372 million for current spending, of which &euro;222 million, or approximately 60%, represents a pass-through in TV licence receipts.  By the end of June, my Department had spent &euro;62.4 million of its capital allocation, representing 90% of the profiled expenditure.  On current expenditure, my Department has spent &euro;172.9 million, representing 96% of profiled expenditure.  Appropriations-in-aid are running at &euro;110.2 million, representing 96% of profiled receipts.</p><p> This year my Department continues to progress projects in areas of national strategic importance, including: the national broadband plan, in line with the Government&rsquo;s ambition that opportunities presented by digital transformation will be available to every community and every premises in Ireland; the trading online voucher scheme to support more small companies to trade online and to help them increase sales, jobs and exports; the digital skills for citizens training programme, to help some 25,000 citizens to get online for the first time and participate in the digital economy and society; continued investment in energy efficiency in our residential, public and commercial building stock and homes of those in energy poverty to drive the reduction of CO2 emissions from the built environment;  the electric vehicle grant scheme aimed at decarbonising transport; the integrated mapping for the sustainable development of Ireland's marine resource programme, INFOMAR, and Tellus geo-environmental mapping projects; protecting our natural environment and promoting the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy; and progressing the climate action agenda and Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.</p></speech>

On the national broadband plan, the Department is behind on the spending projections to the tune of approximately &euro;4 million.  Can the Minister provide an indication as to why that is the  case?  Was the Department behind in terms of the roll-out?  Had the Department projected that the roll-out would begin sooner and could the Minister bring us up to date on where we are on that project?</p></speech>

Due to the complexity of the procurement process and the scale of the project, it can be difficult to accurately forecast the monthly expenditure on an annual basis.  For example, expenditure on certain activities in a particular month or quarter may not be reflected until subsequent months or quarters.  The level of underspend has no impact on progress in the national broadband plan procurement process and the timeline for the subsequent roll-out.  Additional expenditure would not have led to the conclusion of the procurement process any faster or, subsequently, to an earlier start point to the roll-out.  That does not have a bearing on the roll-out and the money that has been required at various times in the process has been available to that process.  As members can see, year on year there have been sufficient funds there to do that.  Thankfully, we are nearing the end of this complex process and the Department is currently evaluating the final tender which was received towards the end of last month.</p></speech>

Is the Minister satisfied that the tender that has been lodged is in compliance with that detailed procurement process that was under way?  Is he also satisfied that the new bidder has sufficient capacity to meet the expectations as set out?</p><p>Has the Minister checked the legal standing of the company?

It is appropriate for such a mechanism to be put in place for a procurement process of this scale and duration.  I have been advised that the bidder submitted a request for approval of an alteration in the bidder membership before the procurement process entered its final stage and that the Department assessed this request in accordance with the criteria, as set out in the procurement documentation and procurement rules.  I understand the change in the bidder membership was approved following this assessment.  I have also been advised by the Department that the bidder for the national broadband plan procurement process is led by Granahan McCourt and that the bidder has nominated a number of key subcontractors, including Enet, Nokia, Actavo, the Kelly Group and the KN Group to assist with the actual delivery and physical roll-out of the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

It has been long, detailed and frustratingly slow, particularly for the 543,000 families, businesses, farms and schools across the country that have been waiting on high-speed broadband.  All of these matters are part of the evaluation that is ongoing at the moment, and I am not going to comment on the detail of that evaluation.  It is taking place within the Department at the moment.</p></speech>

The reality is that a venture capital company is the bidder for one of the largest infrastructural projects this State has ever offered, and probably ever will offer.  I find it somewhat troubling that the Minister is still expressing absolute confident in an "iterative" procurement process, as he has described it in the past.  It has been through every machination.  We have seen some of the biggest companies, those which normally roll-out this kind of infrastructure, including Eir, the ESB, Vodafone, John Laing plc and SSE, and which are all household names and recognised for their capacity to roll-out this type of infrastructure, pull out of this process.  We are left with one venture capital company based in the United States which is now fronting up to deliver this infrastructure.  I hope it happens.  I do not want to pour cold water on the desire of the Minister to roll out this project.  I share his desire to see that happen.  However, I have serious reservations and concerns about a process that goes on for such a long time and the stated intention of which - to roll-out the service - has been delayed so many times, yet at the end of the process a venture capital company that is accustomed to taking high risks for high reward and which will suffer no real reputational loss if it does not work is the sole bidder.  My real concern is that the companies I have mentioned - ESB, Vodafone, Eir, SSE and John Laing plc - have departed the scene because they did not see a value proposition for them.  If that does not send a signal to the Minister and his Department that there is potentially something very wrong here, that leads to more questions.  The Minister now has an opportunity to explain to us why he believes we are still on track.</p></speech>

I have explained that in detail.  This is a competitive dialogue procurement process.  It is unusual in an Irish context to have such a process.  It is unusual to have such a large project here.  A competitive dialogue procurement process is the only type of procurement that is available when one does not know what the final solution will be.  When this process started on 22 or 23 December 2016 we did not know what the final solution would be.  We did not know if there would be a wireless-based solution or fibre-based solution.  Three bidders suggested a fibre-based solution, and each has withdrawn at different times during this process, for one reason or another.</p><p>They have given their reasons.  They are all commercial companies and have to make their own decisions.  However, I am confident that this process will provide us with a bidder and a final solution that will deliver high-speed broadband to every home in Ireland.  That evaluation is ongoing.  I await the completion of that evaluation.  Once I have it to hand, I can go to the Government.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that the process was unusual.  The competitive dialogue was certainly unusual.  It could be well argued that it has delivered a rather unusual result.  All of the commercial companies I have mentioned which have such vast amount of experience in rolling out such infrastructure, Vodafone, ESB, SSE and John Lang, have fallen by the wayside.  The unusual result is that a venture capital company is now the sole bidder and the company charged with delivery.  If the Minister does not consider that an unusual result, he should.  It should create very considerable concern for the State, which has so much money and reputation tied up in this and which has responsibility for rolling out this broadband.  I know it will take time to establish whether this is the right decision, but grave concerns have been expressed by myself and others during this process.  It is incumbent on the Minister and to think very seriously about where he is going from here and whether there is the capacity to roll out this really important service within the expected timeline.</p></speech>

I will try to cover them as concisely as possible.  By the end of June, &euro;3.941 million had been spent under subhead A3.  The total Estimate was just over &euro;19 million.  What proportion of that has been spent on the national broadband plan?  Why has there been such a large underspend in that regard?  That is one question.</p> <p>  The Minister's answers on the broadband plan to date have been strange.  I am not sure how a Government can plan its functions and budgeting for the next several years without having some ballpark figures for what has been earmarked for this, that and the other under the capital plan.  How much is the Government budgeting for the national broadband plan?  The Minister has submitted some figures.  Surely to God the Minister for Finance has asked him to pencil in a range of figures for what is needed from the coming years' capital budgets to fund the national broadband plan.  Is it between &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million, between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion or between &euro;1 billion and  &euro;1.5 billion?  I do not know, but the taxpayer would like to know and, as a Member of Parliament, so would I.</p> <p>  There have not just been dropouts in this process.  The day that Eir was allowed to choose the richest 300,000 pickings out of 840,000 was one of the days when this process went under and got into trouble.  I said it to the Minister on the day of that press release.  I was being constructive.  My red lights were flashing and the Minister's should have been flashing too.  The Minister has followed this very closely.  I do not doubt that he wants to get broadband into every home in the country.  I do not doubt his sincerity.  However, I have said to him many times that this plan is in serious financial, legal and logistical trouble.  As Deputy Dooley stated, it is in the hands of venture capitalists.  Two venture capitalists are making mincemeat of the Department and the 80 officials involved, whether they are direct employees of the Department or were subcontracted to help with this.</p><p>One is the French owner of Eir, which was sold off by Deputy Dooley's party in 1999.  That was unfortunate because if we owned the infrastructure, as the ESB now owns its infrastructure, we would be in a completely different place.  We need to be in that place but we are not there.  Many right-wing commentators even starting to say it is where we should be, and that we should use infrastructure controlled by the State.   However, we are where we are.</p><p> I have believed for a long time that we are in serious trouble.  I want jobs to be created in rural areas.  I represent a rural constituency, as does the Minister, and I do not want people driving to Dublin every day when they could work in towns such as Timahoe, Coolrain, Camross, Mountrath and Rosenallis in County Laois and towns in County Offaly.  Are the costs accelerating?  Are the delays in announcing when the tendering process will be complete being caused by legal difficulties as we try to join up the impossible?  We are dealing with newcomers to the consortium now, people who have been in and out of the High Court more often than some barristers, such as Senator McDowell.  These people have the best legal advice, not just in this country but in the western world, and the Minister is up against the big guys here.  The State and the taxpayer will be casualties as might part of the rural broadband scheme.</p><p> Is the cost increasing because of the cherry-picking and because SIRO, ESB, Vodafone and several components of the Enet consortium have now jumped ship?  Are we not now in a much more precarious situation because of the dropouts?  We are caught between two venture capitalists - the owner of Eir and the owners of the Enet consortium, which is still in the bidding process.</p><p>  The cost to the Department is &euro;19 million.  Why is it so low?  What proportion is being spent on the broadband plan?  I hope the Minister does not tell me that the Government has not put in a ballpark figure for the capital expenditure on the NBP.  There has to be a range and some official, the Minister or his deputy must put a figure on it.</p></speech>

The spend to the end of September was &euro;6.7 million, of which &euro;5.6 million related to the NBP.  The &euro;15 million that was allocated was for the national broadband plan.  The variation is due, in the main, to the lower than anticipated expenditure levels on the NBP, which reflected the stage and the complexity of the procurement process.  The variance also relates to the timing of payments relating to Eircode postcodes.  The significant aspect relates to the plan, and not just this year.  In previous years, there was also an underspend because procurement was a complicated process.</p> <p>  On funding, an initial stimulus allocation of &euro;275 million for the State-led intervention under the NBP is in the Government's six-year capital plan.  It was always acknowledged that further Exchequer funding would be needed over the lifetime of the plan.  Funding in principle of &euro;500 million from the European Investment Bank was announced in April for the plan and &euro;75 million was also committed under the European regional development fund.  Following discussions and subject to the completion of the assessment by my officials, and their presentation to me, there will be further engagement with the Department of Finance.</p><p>On Deputy Dooley's point, over the past five years &euro;2.75 billion has been invested in building our high-speed broadband networks across the country, the vast majority of which are a direct result of the national broadband plan and of people wanting to get ahead of the plan.  Deputy Stanley highlighted one aspect of that, but there are other companies.  Deputies Dooley and Stanley, in particular, have spoken to private telecoms companies, and I am sure Deputy Eamon Ryan has also, and it has been explained to them that the investment being put in here is not just in relation to market share in Ireland, but it is being used as a test bed for other parts of Europe because of our unique circumstances, our national broadband plan and the broadband task force which has facilitated the speedy deployment of infrastructure across the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has assisted me with that.  There is no doubt that there is now a far more friendly and positive atmosphere to direct investment in this country.  There is direct engagement with a senior official in each local authority, which facilitates the roll-out of infrastructure, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure around the country.</p><p> I would say to Deputy Dooley that this is a unique project, and there is nowhere else we can compare this to because nowhere else has decided to bring this scale of speed of broadband to rural areas.  Nowhere else in Europe has the type of isolated rural communities and homes that we have here.  The objective and scale of this project are unique.  It has been complex and frustrating but we are nearing the end of the process.</p></speech>

He said there was &euro;275 million in the six-year capital plan.  There is a &euro;500 million loan from the European Investment Bank, EIB, and &euro;75 million from the European Investment Fund, EIF.  This all comes to &euro;0.85 billion.  What period of time does this cover?  He said the figure of &euro;275 million was for six years.  Over what period of time does the Minister expect the &euro;500 million from the EIB and the &euro;75 million from the EIF to be spent?</p> <p>  I think the Minister is nervous of this process.  If I was in his shoes and sitting in his seat, I would be nervous of it because of the precarious situation.  He said it was an unusual process.  It is the most unusual process I have ever heard of.  I am not an expert in commercial activity but I am around long enough, as are most people in this room, to know that if one is bidding for anything, or if one plans to build a house, a bungalow or an extension, one does not run with the first person to put in a bid.  The county councils cannot do that.  They must get up to five tenders, and they must get three bids for works of more than &euro;500.  Here the State will potentially spend billions of euro and there is one tender.  It is lunacy and the Government has no control over it.  The Department's officials, that is, the 80 people in total employed in this project, will be made into minced meat.  The taxpayer will pick up this bill.</p></speech>

If one was building a house, one would go for a standard tender, such as a four-bedroom, three-bedroom, two-bedroom, one-bedroom or five or six-bedroom house, and it is easy to set the specifications for that.  However, Science Foundation Ireland, for example, holds a number of different competitions where it sets a challenge to provide a solution.  How one comes up with the solution is all part of the bid process and it is the same with this.</p><p>Prices were submitted last year at the end of the tendering process but, independent of that, the Department, through its own expertise, had independently costed the project.  We had a good idea of the price this would come in at and what the costings would be for materials, labour, roll-out, etc.</p></speech>

Each year, will he tell the provider the number he wants done and will that be on the public record?  Will he benchmark them and monitor each stage to ensure there is an ongoing examination in the public interest?  This is the most serious project since electrification.</p> <p>  Will the people who get the State procurement in the diverse and spread-out areas of the country have high-speed download on a par with other areas in the country or will they be poor relations?

Ireland has lost large companies, one after the other, which had decades of experience in putting wires up in the country.  The Minister says it is competitive dialogue but there are no competitors.  The remaining players have no experience when compared with the ESB, Vodafone, John Laing Group and so on.  We are in trouble on this.</p> <p>  What is the role of Enet or the other companies the Minister mentioned in this?  Are they being contracted by Mr. McCourt?</p> <p>  Representatives from Eir appeared before the committee a few weeks ago and they clearly indicated that the NBP should be done on the electricity wires.  That was strange, because one would think they would generate a lot of money from using their poles, but they could not have been clearer in saying that does not make any sense.  Why would there be two sets of poles?  They said it would be much better to use the ESB poles because they are connected to every house whereas the telephone poles are not.  Eir does not want to continue with the 2 million telephone poles.  Does the Minister expect that the electricity wires will be used to get to houses rather than the telephone poles?</p> <p>  What percentage of houses does the Minister think will end up with fibre to the home?  What percentage will use another technology?  Can the Minister give an indication on that?</p> <p>  Is the cost of &euro;5.5 million so far this year mainly for lawyers and consultants?  Is it the case that nothing has physically been spent anywhere and all the money was for advisers to the scheme?</p><p>My main question is whether ESB poles will be used.  I have nothing against Mr. McCourt or his previous experience but the Minister is taking a big gamble.  If something goes wrong with ESB, SSE Airtricity or Vodafone, these companies have 10,000 people to call on in order to resolve the problem.  What happens if it goes belly up and the remaining bidders, who do not have that substantive presence in the country, state that it is more difficult than they thought and that they cannot proceed?  What recourse would the State have in the context of picking up the pieces?  I could see how we might do it with SSE Airtricity or Vodafone because their operations are huge, but it seems that we are involved in a very unusual process.</p></speech>

The EIB funding will be drawn down by the bidder rather than the State.  In response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, as part of this competitive dialogue and procurement process, all of the bidders in this process would have had to prove at various stages during the procurement process that they had the capacity and financial resources to deliver this project.  That is all part of the assessment criteria and the assessment of the final bid.  That must be clearly evidenced and documented.</p> <p>  Will ESB poles be used?  I am sure that not only ESB poles but also other ESB infrastructure, the metropolitan area networks across the country and other State-owned infrastructure will be used.  We are looking at potentially up to 100% fibre, which will not be the case.  We do not know how much less than that it will be.  This is part of the ongoing work and engagement that has been taking place between the bidder and the Department.</p></speech>

I am not directly involved in this procurement process.  I am relaying the information I have received from the procurement team to the Deputy.  The bidder, Granahan McCourt, issued a statement on 18 September outlining the people involved in this bid and their role.  Any alteration to the make up of the consortium must go through an approval process within the Department and the procurement team.</p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Reilly's questions about the preparatory work by councils, some councils are very good.  However, I think the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, would agree with me that we are disappointed with some local authorities.  We have been engaging with these local authorities.  It is important that every local authority is ready to roll this out.  The current roll-out with regard to the Eir network is happening across the country at the same time.  The same thing will happen with regard to the roll-out of this.  There will be timelines involved and targets to be achieved in the same way as Eir has had targets to meet.</p><p>At present, they have built out to 220,000 premises.  The recent data submitted by Eir to the Department indicates the company has passed 180,000 premises nationwide as part of the rural deployment.  However, the information received from Eir on its overall fibre deployment indicates that close to 220,000 premises have been passed throughout the country.  That is the current state of play.</p><p> Senator Joe O'Reilly asked me whether those on the final phase of the national broadband plan will be the poor relation in terms of speed.  In fact, the exact opposite is the case.  The standard delivery that we are looking at is 150 Mb of download speed and 100 Mb of upload speed.  A business would be able to avail of up to 1 Gbit of download speeds.  These are very significant numbers.  The reason is that at the start of this process the target for the definition of high-speed broadband was 30 Mbps.  As I have consistently said throughout this, what we did not want is a situation when we awarded the contract that we would have a technology that was obsolete.  That happened with the national broadband scheme previously.  If we had been looking for a 30 Mbps download speed it would effectively be obsolete by the time we would complete the build-out.  We have written into the procurement process that it must meet the changing demand.  As the committee will be aware, the European Commission is setting demands of a gigabit society.  We can accommodate this within the infrastructure that we are rolling out and we are determined to do that.  I think I have answered those questions.</p><p> Senator Joe O'Reilly asked me about setting year-by-year targets.  The draft NBP contract includes extensive governance and oversight mechanisms to ensure the efficient and effective roll-out of the network.  These measures include monitoring of build-out milestones and key performance indicators on both a time and deployment area basis.  Monitoring and reporting will occur monthly, quarterly and annually, a bit like the ongoing monitoring of the Eir contract.</p></speech>

The committee spent a long time putting a report together.  I would have differed in terms of what was recommended at the end of it, which was basically that the State would use Revenue to collect it.  I put forward a proposal on behalf of my party that there would be registration, both at purchase and at the point of connection to a service, that would bring everybody onto a database.  If one were on the database and did not have a licence, one would automatically receive a fine bar one could give a valid explanation as to why, for instance, if one had got rid of a television altogether.  Otherwise, viewers would be caught within that net.</p> <p>  It is frustrating that we are here again and the licence fee receipts are still &euro;40 million down.  What action is being taken?  We came together and did a lot of work on that report.</p><p>Members of the committee made a significant contribution to it.  It is an issue the Minister has discussed with myself and other Deputies in the House.  We do not want to see the licence fee increased but surely we must get in most of the &euro;40 million to deal with the issues in RT&Eacute;.</p><p> My second question relates to the &euro;190,724,000.  Given what is going on, is that a realistic target to bring in?  That is a huge sum and I wonder if it is realistic.</p></speech>

First, there is the broadcasting (amendment) Bill which has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny here and is now with the parliamentary draftsman.  We hope to get a draft of that very soon.  The second strand, which was on foot of this committee's report recommendations, is that a working group has been established on foot of a Government decision in July of this year to examine the possible options to reform the collection of the TV licence fee. The working group will consider a number of options for the reform of the TV licence collection.  It is intended that the group will report back to Government by the end of March 2019 with its recommendations.  To answer Deputy Stanley's question regarding the proposal from the committee relating to revenue, other possible options will be examined in relation to the practical delivery-----</p></speech>

That is approximately &euro;12 million and it goes to An Post.  That leaves &euro;50 million which is either not collected or collected and given to a body other than the intended beneficiary.  I reiterate my view that if the local property tax is in the hands of Revenue, as well as details every dwelling in the country, then subject to situations where there are multiple occupancies of single properties - for example, in Dublin where there might be four apartments in a building and the landlord pays his or her local property tax on the entire building - there is a mechanism to impose a flat rate per house.</p><p>It seems to me the whole rationale for a television licence has completely fallen away.

The Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, talked about only people in caves not having some form of such things and then we got the celebrated cave tax, as was proposed.  If we are being honest about it, there is a very simple mechanism, which is to impose a sum per household regardless of whether they have a big yoke up on the wall or are looking at laptops around the house, however they are looking at this material.  It should be possible to extend it to bedrooms in hotels or something like that.  How many hotels would let rooms without making broadcasting available in them?  We know what the catchment area for the licence fee is.  The Minister will be loath at this stage to pull the carpet out from under An Post and take &euro;12 million from it but it is largely wasted money.  We could adjust the local property tax and collect the same amount of money.</p> <p>  There is another point on which I would like some information from the Minister.  We are inundated, as we drive between this place and where we live, with advertisements telling us about paying the licence fee and all the rest of it.  The ads are getting more sophisticated, humorous and amusing to try to keep us interested.  Does RT&Eacute; provide that advertising free?  Does An Post pay for it?  Is it a subsidy to RT&Eacute;?  I think the Minister's Department pays for the advertising on RT&Eacute; that tries to persuade people to buy their licences.  It is ridiculous to urge people to do what one could do by pressing a few buttons on a computer.  It would be simple to extract information from the system using Revenue's local property tax system.</p> <p>  I will return to the multiple dwelling issues.  There are electricity connections too.  One can work out fairly quickly what a household would owe that way.  We could do it instead of procrastinating and establishing working groups to consider it.  It is a year since I suggested it here.  Surely the Minister can come up with a "Yea" or "Nay" to it and say it is the sensible way to deal with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018100200002#V00400"><p>I will make substantially the same point.  RT&Eacute; is in a crisis.  Yesterday the BAI took the unusual step of issuing a statement effectively telling the Government to get off its hands and provide the money or the mechanism to allow RT&Eacute; to access the money.  I am critical of RT&Eacute;.  Today we asked for the executives of RT&Eacute; to appear before the committee to address their failings as identified in a recent peer review carried out by the European Broadcasting Union.  RT&Eacute; has a long way to go in addressing its internal matters around value for money and all of that.  The BAI is the independent authority charged by the State with protecting and preserving our State broadcasting service.  In its determination, RT&Eacute; and TG4 are significantly underfunded and that is a matter for us and the Minister.  We can deal with the legacy issues in RT&Eacute; and we will.  This committee has always been good at holding RT&Eacute; to account in that regard.  We will bring the director general before us and challenge her and her management team on what they are not achieving.</p><p>Undoubtedly the retort will be that they do not have the wherewithal to do it because politicians have sat on their hands and not grappled with the funding issue.  We took the challenge from the Minister.  He is good at giving us challenges and he has referred quite a lot to the committee.  We carried out a detailed piece of work.  We did not shy away from making tough enough recommendations that are not necessarily politically advantageous to any of us or to our parties but we did so in the best interests of public service broadcasting.</p><p> As are others, I am frustrated that it will continue to take another working group until quarter 1 or quarter 2 of next year.  Where is this going?  There was plenty of scope in the document provided by the committee to give the Minister the wherewithal to draft a memo and take it to the Government.  For some reason the Minister chose not to do this and he has passed it on to another committee.  That is disappointing.</p><p> This cannot be taken in isolation.  There is a real crisis here.  We do not have to get into the background of it.  I have my views on the way in which the Government is looking at this.  The Taoiseach, in particular, seems to be infatuated to some extent with the personalities and aura of money that revolves around the social media companies.  He is adept at getting selfies with the presidents of the various social media companies and we know his desire to promote himself through fake accounts or others on social media.  There is an important foundation that our State broadcaster provides in holding all of us to account in a really independent way.  It is an important cornerstone of our democracy.  It is under challenge and attack because of the way in which social media companies are developing and evolving.  They are getting the advertising spend and the eyeballs and, sadly, RT&Eacute;, TG4 and other broadcasters are not able to keep pace.  We really need action and no more procrastination.</p><p> Independent broadcasters, in particular independent radio broadcasters, that do excellent work and under their licence carry out public service broadcasting, have also been under significant attack as a result of the shift away from more mainstream media activity.  They also need support in developing public service content.  I appeal to the Minister to look at what support can be provided to them.  We published a Bill to assist local radio stations, in particular, and regional radio stations in the production of public service content through a mechanism similar to the sound and vision fund.  In an overall context, will the Minister look at providing the appropriate funding?  It really is important in terms of the preservation and protection of our democracy.</p></speech>

It is part of what we are looking at, with regard to whether there is a far more effective way of collecting it, in terms of the broadcasting (amendment) Bill.  We will bring forward primary legislation on this issue.  The working group is specifically looking at how we could implement in practical terms some of these measures.  The Senator raised the issue of bedrooms in hotels.  If we look around the room we see four televisions.  Each colleague has a television in his or her office.  There are more than 1,000 televisions in Leinster House for a single TV licence.  It is very hard to justify this.  Many areas need to be examined with regard to how the television licence applies.  With regard to Senator McDowell's question on who funds advertising, it is funded by RT&Eacute; itself.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Dooley, what we are trying to do is come up with how to implement it in practical terms.  If I came forward with a proposal that we could not implement on the ground, he would be the very one who would come in here and tell me he had told me so, that I would not be able to implement it and that I had got it wrong.</p><p>The working group, which comprises various Departments and agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, will examine how we will implement this practically and maximise the return on television licence collections.</p><p> Senator McDowell is correct.  If a significant amount of money was raised, we could consider a reduction in the overall cost of the licence to consumers.  I am glad that the Senator has changed his approach to this matter.  Before the committee hearings, he was critical of the fact that people would have to pay for television licences for their second homes, perhaps in County Roscommon or elsewhere.  Instead of calls for incremental increases, there is the potential for a reduction in the overall licence fee once we determine how to implement this.</p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about local radio stations.  Through the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill and due to the important role that they play, we intend to reduce the fees that such stations pay to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  This will provide them with a financial benefit.  If anyone doubts the public service role that local radio plays, he or she should remember how, when electricity went out around the country during Storm Ophelia, the only way the emergency services and National Emergency Co-ordination Group could get messages out to the public was through local radio.  It was an effective tool, as were the national radio services provided by the private and public sectors.  We want to see that role acknowledged through the Bill.  We also want to provide bursaries for young journalists in the broadcasting sector.  My preference is to see those bursaries extended into print journalism, but we must start somewhere and this legislation provides for that.</p></speech>

The number of new electric vehicles, EVs, is to be 1,200 this year.  What is being done to increase the figure?  The Government has a target of 500,000 by 2030.  How will achieving that be possible at the current rate of progress?</p></speech>

I will get the Deputy the exact number, as I do not know it off the top of my head.</p><p>It comprises of a combination of supports, including a &euro;5,000 VRT relief and a &euro;5,000 purchase grant.  On top of this, every purchaser of a new EV or second-hand EV registered since 1 January of this year will be entitled to a grant of up to &euro;600 to support the installation of a home charger.  We have also provided a grant of up to &euro;7,000 for the purchase of EVs as taxis, hackneys or limousines.  We have reduced the benefit-in-kind to 0% for battery EVs since the beginning of 2018 and they now attract a low tax rate.  The issue that is continually raised by, thankfully, rural colleagues is the charging network.  Additional significant money is being invested in the network this year and we intend to replicate or increase that next year.  We accept that the infrastructure built over the past number of years requires upgrade and modernisation, some of which we cannot even get spares for now.  There has been a time lag in this regard because of the decision of the CRU regarding the ESB's ownership of the network.  We now have a roadmap.  When I was in San Francisco three weeks ago, I met people from a company that is working on new technology that could help to extend the roll-out of EV charging points throughout the country.  This company is currently engaged with the ESB in this regard.</p></speech>

There are only a relatively small number of charging points in many areas and they are often not working or are poorly policed by local authority traffic wardens in terms of parking.  There is need for a rethink in regard to the roll-out of this network and its rapid delivery.  Another issue which I have been pushing with the Department of Finance through Fianna F&aacute;il's negotiators from a budget perspective is the tax relief on the hybrid model.  I understand the Minister is a user.  The current relief expires this year but it needs to be rolled out for a further term.  There is little doubt that people have range anxiety and, like the Minister and others, distance issues in regard to the electric vehicle.  It is not a suitable mode of transport for many people owing to the current range.  To get people to move towards the hybrid model, the tax relief needs to be extended.  I am sure this has been identified by Department and it will continue to pursue it.  Hopefully, it will come to pass in the forthcoming budget.</p> <p>  As I said the greatest issue regarding the EVs is the roll-out of the fast-charging network, which when available will act as a good advertisement for moving to these vehicles.</p></speech>

There are many people for whom an EV would be suitable.  In terms of the roadshow, we are working with staff in car sales and showrooms encouraging people to test drive an EV.  For many people who commute to Dublin or other major towns, and some rural and provincial towns, an electric vehicle would be suitable.  For Deputy Dooley and I, an electric vehicle, because of range, is not suitable.  The hybrid model is the solution in this regard.  As stated by the Deputy, I drive a Toyota hybrid.  There are a range of hybrids on the market.  I would encourage colleagues who are thinking about replacing their vehicles to consider a hybrid vehicle.  It is important that the budget sends the right messages in this regard.</p><p>They are part of the ongoing engagement I am having with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on the budget measures that will be announced next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018100200002#Z00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  What measures is the Government taking to try to address the big problem of transport in general?  There are, of course, domestic vehicles but then there are also the large trucks.  There is a desire to try to move some of the commercial vehicles more towards compressed natural gas.  Looking at our public transport fleet, what can be done there?  A dreadful decision was taken recently to purchase 110 buses, I think, it was last year, in exactly the same format as before.  They are just diesel buses.  That was really regrettable and I know it is something the Minister has a strong view on.  What can he do from his Department to ensure that does not happen again and to try to promote a move away from petrol and diesel within the semi-State commercial area and in the commercial sector generally?  In addition, the whole area of heating needs to be looked at as a way of reducing our emissions.  I see there is some money for the deep retrofit programme under a pilot programme.  We have looked at our targets in the past and we have to ramp up the deep retrofits to get to where we would expect to be.  Forget about 2020.  We would really have to accelerate activity to get there even by 2030.  Can we hope, or can we help the Minister, to get more moneys from the Exchequer through the budget to assist in that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018100200002#Z00300"><p>I will deal with the deep retrofit first.  The big challenge for me at the moment is not actually more money.  It is to actively encourage people to carry out these upgrades now.  The other challenge is to get contractors to do it because many of the contractors are not prepared to get into this sector.  We are going to see a significant ramp-up in the next few years in the funding that is going to be available but it is important we have the capacity within the system to carry out the work and the demand as well.  What we have done with the warmer homes scheme is expanded the range of work that will be carried out.  It is extended now, effectively, to a deep retrofit.</p> <p>  We are wrapping homes with external wall insulation if they do not have cavity walls, doing the attics and looking at whether the windows and doors need replacing as well as the heating system.  We are talking about a significant investment.  It is free of charge to anyone in receipt of the fuel allowance, anyone long-term unemployed with children, anyone receiving the carer's allowance, where the carer is residing with the person being cared for and anyone receiving the domiciliary care allowance.  There is a significant amount of money there now.  It would really assist me if colleagues would encourage their own constituents to apply to the SEAI for that.  The application form is very simple and the SEAI takes it from there.  It is funded directly by my Department to provide this service to the public and I encourage people to do that.  That is based on the knowledge and understanding we have gained from the deep retrofit pilot here in Dublin. </p> <p>   On the issue of trucks and heavy goods vehicles, I do not disagree with Deputy Dooley's point on public transport.  As and from the middle of next year, all public transport vehicles purchased will be low emission vehicles.  That is set out in the national development plan.  In respect of the commercial semi-State sector, An Post has now announced it is transitioning its fleet to one that will be completely zero emissions in the next decade.  That is right across the country, starting initially inside the canals in Dublin over the next 18 months and then extending beyond.  The Garda has purchased electric vehicles as has the Defence Forces.  We are actively encouraging other State and semi-State bodies to do the same.  Electric vehicles can deal with some of the heavy goods vehicle demand.  In fact, we are launching a new electric light goods vehicle in Dublin tomorrow morning.  The other side of it then is compressed natural gas and biogas.</p><p>We hope we will be in a position to make an announcement soon regarding the supports for biomethane.  A paper on that, which would allow for Bio-CNG in the market is due.  It is operational in the Deputy's constituency.  We attended the launch of Clean Ireland and the operation of its refuse trucks in Shannon.  Hopefully, we will see more of that happening throughout the country.</p></speech>

Once again, the Minister has limited time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018100200002#AA00300"><p>I appreciate that.  I had to go to the D&aacute;il for Questions to the Taoiseach and am glad to come back in on this.  I have a few questions about energy.  How is the &euro;500 million climate fund being managed?  What are the timelines for spending it?  How does it fit into the budget process?  There is a risk that in response to just about everything the Minister asks for, the Minister for Finance will say that it will come from the climate fund.  How does that integrate with the standard budget process?</p> <p>  With regard to EVs, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action last week, the ESB said that we should have a public fund for fast-charging points in recognition that of the problem in this regard.  If two or three charging points are installed in car parks in every hospital, Garda station, library, council office, primary healthcare centre or Department building, there would be a significant network.  Most of the public car parking in Dublin city centre comprises public service car parking places.  We got a sense that approximately &euro;25 million would be needed for an immediate quick injection of charging points.  I am interested in whether the Minister is considering that.  How do we deal with the legacy investment?  We made an investment of approximately &euro;25 million ten years ago.  What happens to that?  Is it written off?  Is it just transferred to the ESB as its asset and the new CRU process continues?  </p> <p>  In respect of the deep retrofit programme, is it not time to make a switch and say that we will no longer do small jobs?  There is a risk that if we do a small job and come back five years later believing that we need a bigger job, it will be harder to do.  Perhaps the Minister would be correct to say at this point that the axe will fall and that from hereon, they will all be big jobs; with the financing securitised and the construction standardised in order that contractors can do 100 or 500 jobs.  Then we will get the contractors to engage.  Surely now is the time to do that.  The scale is so significant that it must involve retrofitting every house.  To make that happen, perhaps it is time to switch to deep retrofitting everything.  </p> <p>  Following on from the meeting of the joint committee last week, we were told by the Secretary General that in the next day or two, we would have a copy of the consultation paper the Minister is presenting on the national energy and climate plan.  Could we get that in advance of the committee's meeting on Thursday?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about a deep retrofit.  What we are trying to do now is move away from carrying out small works on homes to ramping up the warmer homes scheme.  We have also launched a pilot deep retrofit scheme for people who are not fuel poor to look at the type and scale of work that needs to be done on individual houses so that we have a template to ramp that up.  Significant capital funding is available through the national development plan to do that.</p> <p>  I have also been in discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, who has been engaging with his former colleagues and Teagasc with regard to how we could use the agricultural advisory network throughout the country to assist in encouraging people to carry out deep retrofits of their homes and upgrade them.  We have had some engagement with the EIB about funding to see whether we could put a structure in place that would encourage people to pay as they save in respect of energy.</p><p>Only last week, I wrote to all of the commercial banks asking them to look at bringing in incentives for people who carry out energy upgrades of their homes or who buy an electric or low-emission vehicle.  From 2019, the NZEB regulations in respect of new builds will mean that new homes will experience a 70% improvement in energy and carbon dioxide emission performance compared to the 2005 standards.  That is a significant step forward.  </p><p> The climate action fund was launched on 9 July.  Yesterday was the closing date and a total of 100 applications were received.  One of those applications is from An Post, which is considering rolling out charging points to post offices and where it has public car parking spaces in the State.  A number of those parking spaces are accessible to the public.  The intention is that the climate action fund will drive the agenda to roll out some of this infrastructure because the funding will come from motorists and that will be invested in the alternative infrastructure that is needed to drive innovation.  We require primary legislation to formally establish the fund.  The fund will be continually replenished over time.  It will be a separate fund that will be drawn down from through proposals and bids.  In the short term, the intention is to ensure we can start to invest immediately in the building and upgrading of infrastructure.  We have a comprehensive network but we need to upgrade it so that we cab gave timely repairs and more fast chargers available at locations.  That is part of the discussions that have been ongoing between this company in the US and the ESB.</p></speech>

In a country that must deep retrofit everything, permitting fossil fuel heating seems like madness.  If it involves other Ministers such as the Minister for Education and Skills, could the Minister not just insist that we stop using fossil fuel heating now?</p></speech>

It is something we want to see and schools are a good example of that.  Through the SEAI, the Government is carrying retrofits of schools and the intention is that every public building will be retrofitted over the next decade as part of the NDP.  It makes far more sense that as new public buildings are being constructed, they will be built without a reliance on fossil fuels.</p></speech>

Funding of &euro;26.7 million under this programme allows my Department to provide reliable geoscience support for environmental protection and the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources.  The programme provides funding of &euro;3.7 million for mining services, including &euro;1.4 million for remediation works at historic mining sites at Avoca and Silvermines.  It also includes an allocation of some &euro;12 million for Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, services, including &euro;8 million for the for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by GSI in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  The Tellus project consists of airplane-mounted geophysical measurements and ground geo-chemical sampling.</p><p>Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps, new radon mapping and agricultural mineral maps.  This data will also facilitate better land use planning and research.  Under the GSI groundwater programme, ongoing monitoring will provide key data relating to Turlough flooding to the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the local authorities.  Expenditure on the national resources programme to the end of June was &euro;7.2 million, representing 66% of profiled expenditure.</p><p> I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the exploration and mining division and of GSI over the past week in assisting and advising Monaghan County Council on the mine collapse at Drumgossatt, County Monaghan.  This is a matter of significant concern to that community and I compliment the team for their ongoing work and advice in this regard.</p></speech>

Exploration of these wells costs approximately &euro;100 million a pop, that being the cost of the Dunquin field a number of years ago.  There is no investment by the Department in offshore wind in the same seas.  Wind is our greatest resource.  We do not need exploration; we know it is there.  How is it that all this money is being spent on petroleum exploration yet no drilling is taking place and, at the same time, no work is being done on capturing an energy resource that everybody knows is going to be the future for energy?  Why are we investing in the dead resource rather than the new one?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned that the cost of drilling a well is &euro;100 million but that is private investment, not State investment.  I agree with him that offshore potential is significant.  In this regard, Ireland has been described as the equivalent of Saudi Arabia in regard to oil.  The Taoiseach's office has taken over responsibility for the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Foreshore licensing is highly complex and it has been a matter of responsibility for many Departments over the years.  The Taoiseach's office has taken a leadership role in advancing the Bill, as the delay in dealing with it has stagnated development of the offshore energy.</p></speech>

Consideration should be given to moving that spend and the attention of our engineers and so on to the licensing of offshore wind, marine engineering and the international licensing and regulatory environment.  These skills could be put to good use in offshore development.  We are regularly hearing at the Joint Committee on Climate Action hearings that nothing is happening because a licensing and administrative structural process has not been progressed.  The Minister of State is a Galway man.  This is going to make the west coast wealthy.  Why are we betting all of our money on the old energy rather than the new one?</p> <p>  Will there be a new round of licensing for oil companies in Ireland and, if so, what is the timeline for it?</p></speech>

We are currently dealing with the 2015 round.  On the issue of investment in other areas of offshore energy, the SEAI and the Marine Institute are investing in research on offshore wave and tidal potential.  There are three test sites, one of which is in Galway Bay.  The planning process for it was controversial but nevertheless permission was granted for floating devices on wind, tidal and wave energy.  There is a smaller test site off the Cork coast and another is planned for Belmullet.  There is investment by the Department in the offshore area, including in respect of new technologies.</p></speech>

It is a long shot but worth doing.  The State needs to invest in licensing, planning and strategic environmental assessment, and seabed and other surveys for offshore wind energy, which is not a 20-year bed or a five-year bed.  This is happening on a large scale in other European countries, America, Japan, Chile and elsewhere.  Ireland is being left behind and forgotten about.  We could raise significant funding in Brussels immediately if we had in place a licensing process for west of Ireland offshore wind but nothing is happening.  The Minister of State, is from Galway.  Investment in this area would switch on County Galway and counties Mayo and Donegal but there is nothing in this regard in the budget.</p></speech>

The potential for the west coast is huge.  There are also pitfalls in terms of the weather extremes in that area.  This issue is being examined in the context of scaling up the size of wind turbines.  It is generally accepted that the higher the turbine, the greater the potential to generate energy.  Testing of the floating devices is ongoing.  The delay in progressing the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013 is stagnating development in regard to the offshore.  The Taoiseach is prioritising this legislation and it is hoped it will progress quickly having been delayed for some time.</p></speech>

I am nervous because rounds issued in the past were granted during interregnums.  I suggest that the Department put a hold on new licence applications until the democratic will of this House is made clear.  I understand there is no money order requirement in the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2013 and, therefore, it is highly likely it will progress to Committee and Report Stages.  We should be careful not to agree licences when we are dealing with legislation that may create difficulties in that regard.</p></speech>

The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;18.8 million towards the single allocation platform, SAP, costs of IFI and the Loughs Agency, a North-South body co-funded by my Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  A sum of &euro;14.3 million for non-pay current and capital expenditure by the two agencies is also included in the programme.  The 2018 grant allows IFI to continue to deliver on its licensing and enforcement responsibilities along with rehabilitation of our rivers and streams.  The delivery of a wide-ranging set of investments, innovations and promotions under the national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected and enhanced for both their economic and recreational value to the communities and visitors they serve across Ireland.</p><p>Expenditure on the inland fisheries programme to the end of June was &euro;13 million, which represents 97% of profiled expenditure.  I will refer to two areas we are looking at now.  One is the eel hardship scheme, the Minister and I will be briefed on in the coming weeks, if not this week.There is &euro;1.2 million in the 2018 Estimates to finalise that scheme and a commitment for the scheme in 2019 and 2020 as well.  There is also &euro;300,000 for the <i>lagarosiphon major</i>weed control programme on Lough Corrib.  That is vital to ensure that important brown trout fishery and lake is protected against invasive weed.  There is also a &euro;1 million capital allocation for the agreed project to replace IFI's rigid inflatable boats, RIBs.  This is a health and safety matter following the recent tragedy involving a Coast Guard RIB.  The IFI worked extensively with the Marine Survey Office on a revised technical specification.  The first RIB was delivered to County Donegal in June 2018 and another two are planned in the coming weeks.  The IFI also intends to use an estimated &euro;1.2 million to replace end-of-life vehicles within its fleet. </p></speech>

We received a briefing note, I presume from the Department, which is welcome.  One of the key metrics I would love to see, however, is the salmon run this year river by river.  The Department or IFI could provide it to me separately and directly.  It not does not use river by river in this assessment but that is one of the key metrics because that would measure what is happening in the Atlantic as well as in our rivers.  Has the Minister of State heard any anecdotes or does he have any evidence on this from IFI?  Perhaps it is still too early and the salmon are still running.  Was the end of drift netting ten or 15 years ago has been successful?  I am interested in the number of rivers going in and out of catch and release, or any catch, as an indicator.  What is the status of our wild salmon population?</p></speech>

We have had a difficult decade but there are signs over the past year or two that figures are improving.  It is hard to know the exact cause, although there has been speculation on whether it could be global warming, sea lice or supertrawlers.  We do not know.  We are part of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, NASCO, area, which is an international committee that collaborates and works to protect the fisheries.</p><p>We have a scientifically managed salmon fishery.  Salmon numbers are either counted or an assessment is taken of fry and redds.  It is internationally accepted that we use the best expertise we have to try to measure salmon stocks.  We have a conservation limit and if that is reached, the river can be open or closed or under catch and release.  It is very much a scientific basis for the 147 rivers, or sections of rivers, and estuaries.  The number of salmon that return in comparison to the smolts that leave our river system has been a worrying trend for some time.  There is, anecdotally, a view that circumstances have improved in the past year or so and they are positive for the coming year as well.  We will publish the figures for this year in the next month or so with a view to making recommendations for next year on whether rivers will be open, closed or catch and release.</p></speech>

I look forward to reading that report when it comes out.  Our ultimate metric is what has happened, water quality, fish numbers and aquatic life.  All the other metrics are interesting but the primary purpose is to restore natural biodiversity.  If we are succeeding or failing in that, then everything else - the number of inspections, fines, prosecutions or whatever - is of secondary importance.</p></speech>

The Bill was passed with cross-party support in the Chamber that evening.  I will reiterate many of the points I raised on that occasion again today.</p><p>This is a pro-consumer initiative and will greatly enhance consumer protections and rights in the unregulated area of the sale of gift vouchers and their terms and conditions and enhance transparency in this regard.  This legislative proposal will ensure Irish consumers can select a gift card or voucher at their own discretion and have full access to the terms and conditions of the product they are buying.  They will also have the certainty that the product they are buying will last for a certain period of time.  Gift cards which are e-money products are subject to regulation and protections under EU electronic money directives, EU anti-money laundering laws and EU payments services directives.  That is an important distinction which I wish to make at the outset.  However, gift vouchers and gift cards remain mainly unregulated in Ireland, with approximately two thirds of the market completely unregulated according to industry estimates.</p><p>The unregulated sector concerns mainly shopping centre cards and single-brand store cards.  Furthermore, there is no protection of funds loaded on cards.  Retailers can use such funds as normal working capital and if a retailer collapses the funds are lost to consumers.  Finally, there is no consumer protection legislation for these unregulated gift cards and vouchers governing expiry dates, mandatory requirements on transparency, security of funds or fees charged.  This is very concerning during the busy shopping period when peak shopping takes place.  For example, Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year for the sale of gift vouchers.  However, consumers receiving the gift vouchers can often be left unawares regarding the terms and conditions that apply.  Specifically, the period of time for which vouchers remain valid can vary.  As a result, consumers are left shortchanged when they go to redeem them.  It is fair to say that some retailers are more flexible than others but currently they have the right to refuse to honour the voucher outside of the defined period.</p><p>During the last seven years successive Governments have failed to protect consumers by not enacting consumer protection legislation to regulate gift vouchers.  This was acknowledged in the heads of a 2015 Government consumer rights Bill that has remained in limbo since then.  The heads of that Bill state &ldquo;the proposals in [this] Chapter are the first legislative provisions to deal specifically with these products&rdquo;, that is gift vouchers.  </p><p>My Bill provides for new provisions to regulate the sale of gift vouchers and the contracts for their supply by amending the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The Bill establishes a definition for gift vouchers.  This takes in all types of such products whether they are cards, written certificates or in electronic or other formats.  For the first time in Irish consumer law, the Bill proposes that there can be no expiry date on gift vouchers &ldquo;which is not less than a five year period&rdquo;.  In other words, all gift vouchers would remain valid for five years.  This five-year expiry date has been deployed in other jurisdictions to good effect.  Moreover, under this Bill an obligation is imposed on the trader to inform the consumer of any fees associated with the sale of the voucher before the consumer is bound by the gift voucher contract.  Gift voucher contracts can provide for restrictions on their use.  The Bill enhances consumer protections by providing that a consumer must be informed of any restrictions associated with a gift voucher before being bound by any such contract.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of other parties in this area and I hope all parties can work together in the Oireachtas to progress this legislation to Committee Stage swiftly as it represents the most advanced proposal currently in the legislative process.  Under successive Governments there has been no movement on the 2015 heads of a Bill to regulate gift vouchers, with Ministers citing coming EU legislation which has primacy over domestic legislation as a reason for not prioritising.  In November 2017, I raised the issue of the non-movement on this 2015 Bill.  Then Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen said to me in reply:</p><blockquote>I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.</blockquote> <p>We learned over the summer that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, intends to bring forward another Bill in the area.  I note that the Government is now saying that given the slower than expected progress of EU proposals, it has been converted overnight to the cause of regulating gift vouchers.  I hope the Government will consider supporting the passage of my Bill, which is at the most advanced legislative stage of any proposal in the field.</p><p>I wish to update the committee of something of which it is probably aware.  On 18 September I received correspondence form the Ceann Comhairle indicating that he was satisfied that a money message from the Government is required in respect of incidental expenses arising for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as a result of the proposed inclusion of gift vouchers in its enforcement remit under the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The Bills Office has requested a money message from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and asked that an initial indication be given within three weeks as to whether it will be provided.  I urge the Government to grant a money message so that this Bill can proceed to Committee Stage and enable members to have further input into the legislative process.  I look forward to bringing this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible to ensure that consumer rights are protected. </p><p>Members may have discussed the correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle.  I was sent a copy and I believe it was sent to the committee Chair.  It was dated 18 September.  It asked for the Department of Public Expenditure to respond on the issue of the money message due to these incidental expenses.  It also noted that there is nothing in the Bill requiring a financial resolution or consultation with the European Central Bank, ECB, and the request was only for a money message.</p></speech>

As members know, I have worked in retail all my life.  I have sold an awful lot of vouchers in my day.  This Bill is very timely.  We are now facing into the busiest period for any retail, the period before Christmas.  There is no doubt about it; consumers need to know when they purchase a voucher from a retailer, online or in person, what the value of the voucher is, the restrictions on its use and the expiry date.  These must be stated upfront.  As I have said, I have worked for a long time in the retail sector.  Where I worked previously, in a family jewellery business, we sold a lot of vouchers.</p><p>There were no limits on the vouchers, which was very welcome to consumers.  People sometimes receive a voucher as a present for a birthday or Christmas but, because they did not purchase it themselves, they are not aware of the terms and conditions.  They might put it away or into their bag or wallet and might not pull it out for 12 or 18 months, when they discover the voucher has gone out of date.  That means the person who paid &euro;50, &euro;75 or &euro;100 for the voucher loses their money and the person who sold it is a beneficiary.  As Deputy Collins said, there are differences in approach from various retailers, with different rules applying.  They are not regulated at the moment but it is timely to regulate them now.  A customer's voucher may be out of date by one day in one shop but, in another, a voucher might be valid for three or five years.</p><p> In the context of the issue of a money message, can the Deputy explain how an expense might arise?  Is it for the enforcement of any regulation that we might bring in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-02a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018100200002#D00200"><p>Yes.  The correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle mentioned incidental expenses.  The budget of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is in the order of &euro;12.8 billion per annum, which is fairly significant.  The Bill states that there should be basic transparency.  It states that the person who purchases the gift voucher goes into the transaction with their eyes wide open.  The person who is the recipient of a gift voucher should know the exact terms and conditions, as well as details of its expiry.  Gift vouchers often have very little text on them or any details relating to the expiry date.  I imagine we are all on the same page on this.</p> <p>  It is estimated that the spend on gift vouchers per annum is some &euro;350 million, which is a very significant amount of money.  Pricewatch, which monitors prices in conjunction with the Consumers' Association of Ireland, estimates that between 15% and 20% of vouchers are never cashed in.  Some get lost but in many cases people put them away, not thinking they have expiry dates.  People who do not use a voucher are at a huge loss in such circumstances.</p> <p>  This is about bringing certainty, transparency and a bit of definition to what people sign up to when they buy a voucher.  There is an important distinction between vouchers and electronic money, which we discussed on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Electronic money cards, such as One4all cards which can be used in an array of situations, are properly and appropriately regulated by the EU Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2018 and by the anti-money laundering regulations.  We are not really concerned with that segment of the market.  It accounts for one third of the spend of &euro;350 million to which I referred but we are concerned about the other two thirds.</p> <p>  There are also issues around the presentation of a voucher.  One is the issue of whether a person is entitled to receive change if they present a voucher for &euro;100 to buy goods or a service costing &euro;80.  In some cases change has been refused when this happens and there have even been cases where the balance on the voucher is cancelled.  There have been cases where a person presented two vouchers to purchase a single product or service but they were declined.  In others, people present a voucher when a shop is holding a sale but the shop may have a policy not to accept vouchers at such time.  Similarly, some pubs or restaurants do not accept vouchers at busy times.  All these things need to be transparent in the terms and conditions of a voucher or gift card so that, when the purchaser is buying one, they know exactly what they are signing up to.</p></speech>

A pub or a shop should not refuse to accept gift vouchers just because it is busy on a Sunday.  Retail Ireland and Chambers Ireland are very supportive of a five-year timeline, while Retail Excellence is more supportive of a three-year timeline.  Has Deputy Collins given any thought to what happens if a stand-alone, single retailer uses money from vouchers for cash flow?</p></speech>

In the case of the One4all card, the electronic money is held in escrow and is secure but this is not the case with vouchers.  There is no such regulation for a single-store branded voucher from a shop, hotel, restaurant or chain store.  If any such businesses close or change ownership, the person holding the gift voucher becomes an unsecured creditor, effectively putting them at the end of the line to get their money back.

In the course of researching the Bill I came across an article which referenced Dermott Jewell, who advocates on behalf of the Consumers Association of Ireland.  It stated that, in August 2016 the Consumers' Association of Ireland, frustrated by the lack of progress on the issue, wrote to the leading retail representative bodies, Retail Excellence Ireland and Retail Ireland, asking them to agree to a six-year limit on all vouchers sold by their members.</p><p>It said that Irish consumers have for too long been issued with credit notes and vouchers, paid for in hard cash, with expiry dates that in reality devalue their money in the unacceptable, retailer determined three, six or 12 month period of time.  Dermott Jewell went on to say that after the period of time the note becomes of no value, a worthless piece of paper, but there is no loss to the retailer who has the money for nothing safely in the bank.  He said he was not surprised that both retail groups ignored his correspondence and did not give a response.</p></speech>

If a person loses a &euro;50 note he or she has no recourse, and if the person loses a voucher the majority of retailers feel the person has no recourse either unless, perhaps, they know the person well and have kept a record of it.  Did you give any thought to that?</p></speech>

It is a valid point.  It is not specifically referenced at present but there is no reason that it cannot be included by way of an amendment which would require anybody who is engaged in selling gift cards or vouchers to keep a register.  Many of them do not.  Again, this is not rocket science.  It is achievable.  It is not something that is going to send the dial on the money message indicator into the red in terms of it being a charge on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

This is the quietest time of the year and in November and December we sold nothing but vouchers so I have a keen interest in selling vouchers.  People used to return to us in January, February and March, our busiest time, to spend those vouchers.  I thank Deputy Collins for bringing the Bill forward.  As I indicated in my contribution on Second Stage, we will support it.  It is important to regulate this area given how much money is spent on gift vouchers.  It can be a source of great frustration when people can no longer spend the money on a card or are penalised by fees if they lost the card or it is missing.  It is welcome that there is cross-party support for the Bill.  The Social Democrats had previously brought forward a Bill on this topic and I understand the Government is to bring forward its own Bill.  Would it not be a better use of our time if the Government worked with the Opposition on Bills when they are already in the legislative system instead of progressing those Bills, scrutinising them and then starting again with a new Government Bill?  That is the case with this Bill and with my anti-ticket touting Bill.  I make that observation because it appears that we could get things done more quickly if this was the case.</p> <p>  Regarding a matter I raised on Second Stage, I have been in contact with a business that wanted me to raise an issue that will arise for it due to changes in this area.  This company sells vouchers for specific described events such as motorised racing experiences, hot air balloon trips and so forth.  A monetary value is not specified for these vouchers, which is why they are often an attractive option for gifts.  The company has highlighted the effect a five year timeframe could have on its business, as the cost of an event when the voucher is purchased could be very different from the cost five years later.  Insurance and fuel costs are constantly jumping, always higher of course, and one can understand the company's concern about that.  Will Deputy Collins and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, consider this when they are progressing their respective Bills to see if a solution can be found for this situation?</p> <p>  On another matter, has Deputy Collins examined where similar legislation has been introduced in Europe or elsewhere and has been successful?  Again, I thank him for bringing the Bill forward as it is very important.</p></speech>

We found in our research that it helped to reduce greatly the value of gift vouchers that were unpresented and were just left idle.  The percentage shrunk to low single digit figures, which is good.  The transparency aspect with regard to the terms and conditions that will attach to a gift card or voucher is important.  This point was made to me and it arose at my constituency clinics.  We are all constituency public representatives so we come across all sorts of scenarios.  Many gift vouchers are purchased for children and minors, be it for birthdays, communions, confirmations and the like, and they are the people who are feeling the brunt of it.  They tend to stockpile them for particular reasons and then when they go and present the vouchers it is a huge disappointment to them that the face value of the gift card or voucher has been discounted because a period of time has elapsed.  If a child presents a voucher for &euro;100 and it is the practice of the organisation that has issued and sold that voucher to discount it by &euro;10 every month or after six months, the fact that these types of practices are available is not obvious to the purchaser or indeed the recipient of the gift voucher.  It is not fair.</p></speech>

I have two questions relating to what he is proposing around transparency.  If a particular retail outlet stipulates in its terms and conditions that this reduces by &euro;10 every six months or whatever, is he saying that this is okay or is he saying that the value should just hold and that if it is &euro;100 it remains &euro;100?  Second, has he been in discussions with the Minister about his Bill?</p></speech>

It is about making the purchaser of the voucher completely aware that when purchasing the card or voucher he or she knows it is being purchased with set terms and conditions, whatever they may be.  We are not getting into prescribing fees or the discounting.  The Bill prescribes the five year definitive period of time.  It also defines a gift voucher because it is not defined in law at present.  However, we are not getting into the detail or telling people what to do.  That is a business issue and the marketplace will dictate much of it.  If people are shopping around and they know retailer X is offering a &euro;100 voucher with a discount down to &euro;50 or &euro;60 within a defined period of time and retailer Y is offering one that remains at face value of &euro;100, where will they go?  The market will decide that.</p></speech>

It is well worth doing.  I note that Senator Bacik brought forward a similar gift voucher Bill in 2009.  I believe this is in the interests of the small retailer as well because confidence in the gift voucher means it will continue, unlike if it loses that confidence.  Two small restaurants opened near my home two years ago and I decided to buy vouchers from them because I wanted to direct business their way and to help the local small urban village that needed the investment.</p><p>It was a good way to support local businesses.  What struck me about having a register is its simplicity.  The businesses recorded my name and the amount I paid in a book and issued me with a voucher.  One of the people to whom I gave the voucher lost it.  There was never a question raised about this because it was recorded in the book.  For businesses, not just consumers, confidence in gift vouchers is very important.  We often encourage the purchase of gift vouchers in urban villages from the small struggling shops to try to shore up the business.  </p><p> I have two questions.  As to the money order, could I suggest that the costings of the Bill be taken from what is currently adjusted as there is an existing consumer protection budget?  The cost could come from currently allocated resources and there would therefore be no be need for a money message.  </p><p>I was going to ask Deputy Billy Kelleher who was beside me the second question.  There was a problem with section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act.  Does this Bill run foul of the same section 55?</p></speech>

The thrust of her Bill, this Bill and Deputy Richard Bruton's Bill has been bouncing around the system in here for the bones of ten years.  It is high time we dealt with this as we are all on the same page.  The Senator asked about section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act 2017.  That is something that could be reviewed by the Attorney General's office if the Bill receives a money message and proceeds to Committee Stage to get final clarity.  We are proposing that the full consumer protections of 2017 be extended to gift vouchers.  We are adding to domestic legislation as opposed to amending the overarching EU directive that is directly applicable in Ireland.  If in the opinion of the Attorney General's office it would be best from a legislative perspective to have a standalone piece of legislation, and not amend the 2007 Act, I will be open to this in order to progress the Bill to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, all of us have had bad experiences with vouchers at some stage.  This committee has always worked very constructively, with a very strong lead from the Chair, on any matters that have come before it.</p> <p>  This is the third matter.  We have previously had Deputy Quinlivan's Bill concerning the sale of tickets and the banded hours Bill from Deputy Cullinane.  Good legislation has been introduced but rather than progress the legislation, the Government asks us to wait and says it has its own Bill.  It reminds me of the kid in the playground who says "that is my ball", and grabs it back.  If the general public knew how business is being done in here, they would be a bit gobsmacked.  This strikes me as a perfectly good Bill.  As the Chair said earlier, no legislation is perfect but we can work with it.  The idea that our well-paid civil servants spend an awful lot of time duplicating work that has already been done, good work by Deputy Niall Collins in this case, and by Deputies Quinlivan and Cullinane prior to this, makes absolutely no sense.  We just need to call that out.</p></speech>

We are currently at a crossroads.  I read recently that by 2020, 80% of all clothes will be bought online.  We have high streets and towns and villages everywhere that are crying out for footfall.  I know we get the footfall at Christmas.  As Senator Humphreys has said, if one goes into one's local store and buys a voucher, it is in the knowledge that an item will be purchased in that shop and not online.  I am always preaching, as I have a retail background, to shop local, buy local and support local.  It is so important.  The first step in that direction is to regulate the whole gift voucher practice.  As Deputy Niall Collins has pointed out, 65% of all gift vouchers in Ireland are not regulated.  It is a free-for-all if we are to be honest.  It is high time that we had regulation.  I take the Senator's points, because I had the same conversation this morning with the secretariat, that we seem to be spending a lot of time going over similar Bills from Opposition parties and from Government.  If we all pulled together, perhaps, we could get one of these Bills over the line, and the consumer would be the winner.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Collins for coming in here today.</p></speech>

I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and we will have the learned people from the Department to speak after me, who I am sure will give the committee some useful insights on this.  Like any piece of legislation it can be amended and improved.  This is the first offering and not the complete article.</p> <p>  I wish to also put on the record that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has called for guidelines on the use of gift vouchers and gift cards but it has not called for legislation.  That has been out there in the ether for a while.  It is time we put something more definitive into legislation because it is such a big spend within our economy.</p></speech>

The comments will draw, among other things, on stakeholder submissions on the gift voucher provisions of the scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill 2015, as well as on responses to the recent consultation on the Unfair Contract Terms (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2018, the scheme of which was approved by Government on 12 June 2018.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins's Bill proposes to make a term of less than five years for gift vouchers a prohibited commercial practice under section 55 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  That Act gives effect to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, UCPD, and section 55 transposes the blacklist of prohibited commercial practices in Annex I of the directive.  While there are attractions to proceeding in this way, there is one major drawback.  As the UCPD is a maximum harmonisation instrument, providing for the regulation of gift voucher expiry dates as part of a prohibition on commercial practices runs the risk of legal challenge on the grounds of incompatibility with EU law.</p><p>This is not an abstract risk.  Sections 47 and 48 of the Consumer Protection Act, which deal with payment surcharges, were not commenced following advice from the then Attorney General that their provisions were incompatible with the maximum harmonisation status of the unfair commercial practices directive, UCPD.  For this reason, the gift voucher provisions in the schemes of the 2015 and 2018 Bills do not take the form of an addition to the commercial practices prohibited under the Consumer Protection Act, but are framed instead in terms of a prohibition on contract terms which provide for a duration of less than five years for gift vouchers.  As the directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts is a minimum harmonisation instrument, a provision framed in this way does not run a similar risk of legal challenge.</p><p> The definition of "gift voucher" in section 1 of Deputy Niall Collins' Bill, which is similar to that in the scheme of the 2015 legislation, states that it means a voucher in any form, including a card, an electronic certificate or a written certificate, supplied by a trader which the consumer is entitled to apply towards the purchase of goods, digital content or services covered by the voucher.  There is a need to examine whether the broad nature of this definition could potentially bring some products within its scope that would not normally be regarded as gift vouchers or in respect of which a five-year minimum term might not necessarily be appropriate.  Among the products which the definition might be held to encompass are vouchers issued under loyalty schemes operated by retailers, Groupon-type vouchers that give access to goods or services at a discounted price for a limited time period as well as a range of prepaid instruments, including transport cards such as Leap cards, the pay-as-you-go cards issued by electricity and gas suppliers, petrol and diesel cards, and phone cards.  It has also been suggested however that the definition of gift voucher should be broadened to include certain products that would likely fall outside its scope, in particular postal orders, credit notes and gift cheques.</p><p> As drafted, the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Bill would apply to all gift vouchers within the meaning of what it defines as gift vouchers, including gift vouchers such as the One4all and FromMe2You gift cards that are regulated under the regulations that give effect to the electronic money and payment services directives.  In the speech moving his Bill&rsquo;s second reading on 21 June, Deputy Niall Collins stated that electronic money products operated in a highly regulated environment and that his Bill sought to provide consumer protection in the two-thirds of the market which was highly unregulated.  It was not clear whether the Deputy favours excluding gift vouchers that come within the scope of the electronic money and payment services directives from the scope of the Bill but his intervention today has been a helpful clarification.  A number of respondents to the recent consultation argued strongly for the exclusion of electronic money gift vouchers from the proposed Government legislation on the ground that their inclusion would involve a double regulation of these products that could lead to confusion as well as possible legal conflicts.  The legal advice obtained by the Department is that the provisions of the proposed Government Bill on expiry dates and on the regulation of gift voucher fees are not in conflict with the provisions of relevant EU directives, in particular the electronic money directive.</p><p> I now turn to expiry date provision.  Section 2 provides that a trader shall not include a term in a gift voucher contract which provides for an expiry date of less than five years from the date of sale of the voucher.  The proposed Government Bill includes a similar provision, as does the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Shortall, the Consumer Rights (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2017.  Expiry dates for gift vouchers vary from six months to ten years, with the majority being valid for one to two years.  In the retail sector, expiry dates for vouchers issued by large retailers are typically for two years from either the date of purchase or of last use.  In the travel and hospitality sectors, an expiry date of one year is common.  In its response to the recent public consultation, Retail Ireland which represents retailers with over 3,000 outlets throughout Ireland stated that it would not oppose the proposed five year minimum term for gift voucher contracts.  Chambers Ireland, which represents 43 affiliated chambers throughout the Republic, stated that five years was a reasonable minimum term for gift vouchers.  Retail Excellence, which represents over 1,800 retailers, favoured a minimum expiry date of three years for gift vouchers not regulated by the electronic money directive, while the Consumers&rsquo; Association favours a minimum term of six years.</p><p> Opposition to the proposed expiry date provision was expressed mainly by gift voucher issuers and service providers whose business model depends on the revenues obtained from vouchers not redeemed in full or part before their 12-month expiry date.  These are mainly vouchers usable in a single shopping centre, the processing and other services relating to which are provided by third parties.  The businesses involved in the supply of these cards maintain that a five year minimum term for gift vouchers would make it unviable to provide this type of gift card.  While a minimum five-year term for gift vouchers would also impact on small retailers and service providers that currently issue vouchers with a one or two year expiry date, this type of voucher is still often provided in paper form and does not generally involve significant costs for the trader.</p><p> During the Second Stage debate, Deputy Quinlivan drew attention to vouchers which are not for a specified monetary amount but instead entitle the holder to avail of a specified experience or activity such as a hotel stay, restaurant meal, a beauty treatment or an outdoor activity.  A number of businesses which offer this type of voucher expressed concern in responses to the recent consultation about the possible adverse effects of a five year term for gift vouchers.  In particular, they argued that the cost to the business of a voucher issued in 2018 for an activity or experience availed of in 2023 could have risen substantially in the interim due to increases in insurance, energy or other costs.  Some of this concern may be overstated in that the introduction of a five year expiry date will not mean that large numbers of voucher holders will wait until year five to redeem their vouchers.  Business costs may also be stable or even fall over a five-year period, however the implications of a minimum five-year term for this particular type of voucher merits further consideration.</p><p> Section 2 further provides that, before consumers are bound by a gift voucher contract, the trader must ensure that they are informed of any fees charged for the voucher and of any restrictions on its use.  While these are clearly worthwhile provisions, their scope needs further consideration.  Electronic money gift vouchers are subject to wide-ranging information requirements under the regulations that give effect to the electronic money and payment services directives.  Gift voucher contracts that do not constitute financial services contracts such as the paper vouchers issued by many small retailers and service providers are subject to the information requirements of the regulations that give effect to the consumer rights directive.  There is an information gap, however, in respect of gift vouchers and cards that are not electronic money products but which are outside the scope of the consumer rights directive by virtue of being financial services contracts.</p><p> We are happy to answer any questions the committee may have on this or any other points raised.</p></speech>

Surely there is a simple business decision which involves putting a simple valuation on that voucher that would change practices but it would not have a major impact on businesses.</p> <p>  I presume Mr. Grace has taken on board that we are not talking about electronic money, as Deputy Niall Collins said.  Does Mr. Grace find that the Bill as proposed is unworkable in the context of section 55 of the 2007 Act?</p></speech>

Just because a gift voucher has a period of five years does not mean that everyone waits four years and 364 days to do something.  Many people use them very quickly.  The Senator is correct and we believe some of the problems that may arise in this regard may be overstated.</p> <p>  On the second issue, it is quite clear that the unfair commercial practices directive is a maximum harmonisation measure of the European Union.  It was transposed into Irish law by the Consumer Protection Act, and section 55 set out the blacklist in that regard.  Therefore, our view, which is backed by legal opinion, is that the Bill as drafted would conflict with that.  The issue is not the five-year term, it is the manner in which the Consumer Protection Act is being amended.  That is why, when the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, announced her Bill, it was in the context of the unfair contract terms Bill.  It is the same end result; we are getting to the same station but we are taking a different train.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  It would be very useful for us to get that advice or a note summarising the advice if we are not allowed to see the advice.

I want to tease out something Mr. Grace said.  Lots of people use gift vouchers within a short space of time but if they have a gift voucher for a photographer, for example, they might wait until the next year to use it because they might have a holy communion or confirmation in their family.  In that case, the gift voucher might be lying in a drawer for a year and a half but for the most part gift vouchers are spent quickly.  I have found that if people have a gift voucher for &euro;100 and spent &euro;85 of it, the &euro;15 might never be used.  I think one would find that across the board.  We all accept that 65% of gift vouchers that are purchased are not regulated.  There must be regulation.  I understand how some people might think five years is a step too far for some businesses.  I do not have a problem with it.  I agree with what Senator Humphreys said about whether it was a hotel stay, a hot air balloon or a weekend away.  I bought a charity voucher last year for a weekend away and it did not specify; it was for bed and breakfast for two nights with an evening meal bit it did not specify that.  I am sure if people had to specify they would be able to do so quite easily.</p> <p>  Can we go back to the money message issue with Deputy Collins's Bill?  If the Bill was to proceed and was technically sound and became law, I do not see where a huge cost to the State would arise from the Bill.  Would it be from an enforcement point of view?  Is that where the cost would come in?  That is where I do not really understand the money message in this case.  The retailer who is selling the voucher would have to provide the voucher and details.  How would that revert back to the State?</p></speech>

The enforcement costs for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, are the issue here.</p></speech>

When new legislation is brought in, there is an onus on the regulator to inform consumers and businesses about it and there would generally be some kind of information campaign.</p></speech>

Anything like this would displace something that would have to be done if there were no extra resources given.  In that sense, if there is additionally of functions, there would have to be additional resources, otherwise something else would have to be suppressed.  It is like the water in the bath analogy.</p></speech>

Mr. Cox and Mr. Grace stated there would be awareness and enforcement costs.  I do not think those costs would be such that it could prevent a Bill going forward.  Some Bills would be way more costly to the State.</p> <p>  I went over the draft scheme of the Minister's Bill.  I will refer to a section in it.  It was explained earlier that the money for One4All vouchers is secure and held in an escrow account.  We will discuss this later.  After 12 months there is a cost on the One4All voucher and its value starts to decrease.  I think it varies between &euro;1.40 to &euro;3 depending on the amount of the voucher.  Mr. Cox and Mr. Grace stated they might look at that.  Will they expand on it?</p></speech>

One4All charges &euro;1.45 a month after 12 months.  The Retail Excellence Ireland voucher, which is called FromMe2You, charges &euro;1.40 a month after 12 months.  In the past some of the single shopping centre cards have charged &euro;3 a month after 12 months but some of them have recently moved to a different model under which the card expires after 12 months and one has the option of renewing it for a further three or six months at a cost of &euro;9.95 or thereabouts.  We are assessing to see how many cards apply fees.  Interestingly, Aer Lingus has started to apply a fee of &euro;1.45 a month after 12 months.  Previously it had a 12-month expiry date.  It is part of the Government Bill that the Minister would have power in the future to regulate the fees.</p></speech>

The money is stored in the electronic money account, which can be done for an electronic money product, and under the electronic money directive a fee can be charged that is reasonable and proportionate.</p><p>The directive is silent about other fees.  The argument of the electronic money providers is that they do incur substantial costs in safeguarding the money.  They must keep 102% of the funds in the segregated account.  In the present interest rate environment, they are charged up to 0.5% by the bank for the privilege of keeping their money.  They also incur costs under anti-money laundering legislation and normal business costs that they must meet to provide the product.  They argue that, if they cannot charge those fees, their product will not be viable.  The main purpose of the recent consultation was to get information on the fees and the revenue from them in order to assist the Minister to determine fees in the future.</p></speech>

I have heard people complaining that they thought they had &euro;30 or &euro;40 on a voucher and, when they go to spend it, they discover that is not the case.  If the value of the voucher is falling by &euro;1.45 every month, it reduces very quickly.  We are all familiar with One4All voucher, especially when different companies and factories use them as Christmas bonuses to avoid tax liability.  They have become very popular.  I am glad Mr. Cox clarified that and I noticed that will be examined under the Minister's Bill and that is welcome.</p></speech>

Maybe 2% or 3% of vouchers are not redeemed at all and another 2% to 3% are not redeemed in full.  It is important not to get the issue out of proportion.  Of those electronic money vouchers, 95% probably are redeemed in full within 12 months, or not long after 12 months.  There is still an issue.  The Department has had the same representations as the Chairman about vouchers being eroded quickly, particularly low value vouchers.  If one has a &euro;500 voucher-----</p></speech>

Most people use them fairly quickly but, if they are not used within a certain period, the chances of a consumer remembering them diminishes and it is almost guaranteed that it will be months and months before they are used, if they ever are.  There is a cyclical hump of usage and then very small usage thereafter.  That is where the fees issue comes in.  After 18 months, a consumer goes to use it and finds it has half the value he or she thought it had.</p></speech>

Those providers have a valid concern in that some people prefer to give someone an experience rather than a voucher for a particular amount.  The legislation should not necessarily state they cannot do that any longer.  It is an issue the Department intends to look at and it will consult with some of the providers of experience gift vouchers.</p></speech>

Some of those were multiples that were representing different organisations.  How do public consultations work?  Does the Department advertise in newspapers and online?  Is that the gist of it?</p></speech>

We do not take advertisements out in the newspapers any longer, partly because not that many people read newspapers, to be perfectly honest, and partly on cost grounds.  The Minister publicised it.  When the closing date was coming up, she went on Twitter and the Department brought out a press statement encouraging people to get in.  A serious effort was made to get the maximum number of contributions.</p></speech>

There is a list of people to whom we market directly and their views were solicited.  The Department tried to maximise engagement, but people often do not respond until they see the Bill itself.</p></speech>

It has come to my attention since we started talking about this Bill that a number of outlets are taking a gift voucher for a certain amount and then refusing to give change.  Is there anything in the Department's proposals that covers this, or is it something it is looking at?  I see the witnesses nodding, so it is obviously something that has crossed their desks.</p></speech>

It is not currently in our Bill, but the Minister is open to considering other issues.</p> <p>  It is wrong to say there is no regulation of gift vouchers at the moment.  Gift voucher contracts are subject to general consumer protection legislation and refusing to give change could be held to be an unfair commercial practice under the Consumer Protection Act and not telling people that they would not get change could be a misleading omission under the Consumer Protection Act.  It could also be an unfair contract term under the unfair contract terms regulations.  The Department is not responsible for enforcing that legislation, but there are information requirements for gift voucher contracts under the regulations that give effect to the consumer rights directive.  There is quite a lot of legislation on gift vouchers.  It is just not specific to gift vouchers and some of it could address that particular practice.</p> <p>  I am not sure how widespread the practice is.  There have been individual instances of it brought to the Department's attention.  It is something it will look at, particularly on the information side.</p></speech>

That did the rounds on some radio programmes.  If a consumer had a voucher for &euro;250 and the flight cost &euro;212, they would never see that &euro;38, or it is unlikely they would see it.  It got a lot of traction.</p></speech>
