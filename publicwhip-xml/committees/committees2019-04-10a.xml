I want to welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials.  I have already cautioned members and I ask the Minister and his colleagues to please make sure their mobile phones are on silent.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041000002#D00200"><p>Thank you Chairman and members.  I am pleased to be here.  I thank the committee for taking this matter this morning.  I am joined by officials, Mr. Patrick McCabe and Mr. John Dunphy.</p> <p>The purpose of the motions is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for Ireland to opt-in to Regulation 2018/1726 which relates to the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, or eu-LISA for short.  Ireland already participates in the eu-LISA agency on the basis of our opt-in to eu-LISA establishing Regulation EU/1077/2011 which is repealed by this regulation.   It is therefore necessary for Ireland to opt in to the new regulation which strengthens the mandate of eu-LISA.</p> <p>As a European Union agency, eu-LISA has effectively contributed to the establishment of a co-ordinated, effective and coherent IT environment for the management of large-scale freedom, security and justice IT systems.  euLisa has enabled the pooling of expertise, the harnessing of synergies and allowed a more flexible framework than was possible when the systems were developed and managed by the commission, with certain tasks entrusted to public sector bodies in two member states.  The new regulation will benefit member states and agencies who are end users of the relevant large scale IT systems by enhancing the role of eu-LISA with regard to future developments in IT systems and providing support to member states when required.  Ireland has representatives who attend the advisory groups in respect of the IT systems in which we participate which are the SIS II and Eurodac.  Representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also participate in the management board of eu-LISA which, among other tasks, appoints and oversees the work of the agency&rsquo;s executive director.</p> <p>The support of eu-LISA and our other partner member states has been invaluable to Ireland in the development of our own solutions for these large scale IT systems.  The participation of euLISA is of particular importance for the Garda&rsquo;s project to connect to the Schengen information system, SIS II.  Technical experts from eu-LISA have been involved both on the ground in Dublin and through web attendance at workshops on topics such as data migration.  euLisa, working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to build and test the systems necessary to ensure that Ireland is in a position to go live on SIS II early next year.</p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in eu-LISA has also been important for our connection to the update of Ireland&rsquo;s national Eurodac systems, as required by our participation in the Eurodac regulation.  The Oireachtas approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in both SIS II and Eurodac and we are now bound by our obligations under those regulations.  The support of eu-LISA is vital in meeting these obligations.  </p> <p>This regulation expanding eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate will ensure that the agency is adapted to meet current challenges at EU level in the area of migration and security, and provide a proper legal basis for euLISA&rsquo;s operation and management of the planned new IT systems.  Before going into some detail about the new eu-LISA regulation, I merely wish to emphasise that participation in the eu-LISA agency does not mean that Ireland will be opting into any additional regulations in respect of any EU large-scale IT system.   Continued participation in eu-LISA would not oblige Ireland to participate in the new systems under its expanded mandate.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in such systems is a matter for the individual legal bases governing such IT systems.</p> <p>In particular, I want to acknowledge concerns of Deputies which were raised last night in the D&aacute;il on the proposed interoperability of EU large-scale IT systems.  It is true that eu-LISA will have a mandate to develop any technical features of interoperability which may arise as a result of proposals in this area.  However, I want to be very clear that it is not the case that Ireland will participate in measures relating to the interoperability of large-scale EU IT systems in the justice and home affairs area as a result of our opt-in to this eu-LISA regulation.  Ireland has the option under Article 4 of Protocol 21 to participate in the forthcoming interoperability regulations following their adoption.  These proposals have not yet been agreed at Union level so the decision to exercise our opt-in would require the consent of the Oireachtas under the justice and home affairs protocol.  There would be a debate on the merits of interoperability regulation at that point.  Therefore, I would ask that Deputies not by any manner of means conflate interoperability with this eu-LISA regulation which Ireland will participate in only in so far as it relates to the systems in which we already participate.  It would not be appropriate to have a debate on the interoperability proposals which have not yet been agreed at this time because no decision has been made as to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in it.  Ireland does not yet participate in all of the systems that is proposed to make interoperable, for example the ECRIS-TCN system.  For this reason I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General and I decided not to propose to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in under Article 3 of Protocol 21 when the interoperability proposals were published.  These proposals are somewhat complex and would require a dedicated discussion as to their merits but that is not the topic before us this morning.  The number of EU large-scale IT systems has grown and it is therefore important to place eu-LISA&rsquo;s responsibility for their operational management on a statutory footing.  In this regard this regulation achieves this goal in respect of the entry-exit system and the EU travel information and authorisation system.  Additionally, eu-LISA will now be enabled to provide more support and advice to member states.  The regulation places additional responsibility on eu-LISA for improving the quality of the data, establishing common data quality indicators and developing an anonymised central repository for reporting and statistics.  The regulation extends eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate concerning research in particular, giving eu-LISA the task of implementing the parts of the framework programme for research and innovation which relate to IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  </p> <p>It is proposed that more pilot projects may be entrusted to eu-LISA.  The new mandate of eu-LISA offers the possibility of support to the Commission and to member states in periods of exceptional need.  I believe, therefore, that it is essential that Ireland is an active partner in Europe&rsquo;s fight against terrorism in the effort to ensure effective management of our borders.  eu-Lisa is an essential agency that has demonstrated significant added value and whose expanded mandate effectively addresses gaps in the current systems.  We look forward to continuing to play an active role in the agency, bearing in mind our limited participation which focuses on the field of police cooperation.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt in to the regulation and continue what has been a beneficial relationship within eu-LISA.    Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041000002#E00100"><p>I fully appreciate that the motions allow us to opt in to only certain aspects of the regulation, one which has been passed anyway so there is nothing we can do about it at this stage.  Because we are not in Schengen most of it does not apply to us anyway.  I do accept that, including the most controversial aspects that we discussed last night, but that does not mean that we have not got an obligation to be critical of those or make points about them.  I do want to put them on the record because the interoperability proposals that this committee yellow-carded last October are at the back of this.  We sent a reasoned opinion to the Commission on its proposals for the interoperable border and security systems, which is nearly like an EU Stasi at this stage, whereby Big Brother is most definitely watching if one was not born inside the EU.  I will not repeat the points but the European Data Protection Commissioner has huge problems with it.  What we are doing today is extending the competencies of an existing body.  I get that.  We are extending it in such a way that it can implement the controversial interoperability proposals that we were unhappy about in October.  The concerns about linking migration and terrorism, which is at the heart of this, remain.  We need to have a serious discussion on that, why it is happening and how we should respond to it.  In the opinion on the interoperability proposals last autumn the European Data Protection Supervisor signalled his concerns about the implications and called for a wider debate.  That is the reason we asked for it to be discussed in the House, because there has not been any debate at all on this in the EU or in Ireland.  It is creating a mega interoperable database, which is a serious problem that I do not think the citizens of Europe have been consulted on, so we need to have these conversations.  I make no apologies that we demanded a discussion on it last night because nothing good can come of this linking of migration and terrorism.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to be clear in his response.  Are we effectively only opting in to the police co-operation aspects of SIS 2?  Is that it?  If we agree to these motions, are we signing up to any of the other aspects such as VIS, the border aspects of SIS II, EES and ETIAS or do we remain entirely outside of those?  They are my two questions.</p></speech>

It is important that data protection be upheld in respect of any further development of these systems.  Members will be aware that SIS II is supervised by the European Data Protection Supervisor.  The supervision is allocated to the data protection authorities in each member state, so any concerns that people might have about any perceived transgressions in respect of data protection can be can allayed on the basis that when Ireland connects to SIS II the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be obliged to investigate any complaints that might be received.</p> <p>  I add to that the fact that we have already undergone Schengen evaluation in the area of data protection, so any concerns that Deputies might have can be addressed by assurances on the part of the Office of the Data Protection Commission here.  Ireland will not be participating in ETIAS or VIS and EES on the border aspects of SIS II.  The legal solution that we have agreed explicitly provides that we can participate in the regulation without having to opt in to the underlying Schengen acquis.  Ireland is not a party to either the visa aspects or the border aspects of the Schengen framework and that position will not in any way be affected or impacted upon by this regulation.</p></speech>

It is worth having this discussion and the one we had yesterday.  The Minister has stated that it would not be appropriate to have a discussion on interoperability here today.  I accept it is not the primary topic before us but the issues are linked.  Although the Minister might disagree, it seems to me that part of what this proposal is doing is prepping eu-LISA for the forthcoming interoperability proposal.  I do not think it is inappropriate to ask, if the Minister is willing to answer.  As things stand, in their current form, does the Government favour the interoperability proposals?</p></speech>

The motions this morning are quite specific and we are not going beyond them.  There is no proposal, nor indeed should there be any inference, that Ireland would participate further in any interoperability arrangement.  Should the issue arise in the future it will be subject to debate and that debate will involve an approval by the majority membership of the Oireachtas.  I want to make it clear that it does not arise at this time and nor should that issue be in any way conflated or confused with the motions before us, which are quite clear in import.  There is not any proposal for further engagement in the interoperability framework.</p></speech>

If eu-LISA is going to be one of the key vehicles for the interoperability proposals when they pass into European law, it is of relevance whether Ireland decides to opt in.  Those proposals could change.  Has the Government communicated its view to the European institutions - to the Council or the Commission - in the past year on the interoperability proposals?</p></speech>

Ireland has not exercised its opt-in under Protocol No. 21 nor indeed is there a proposal in that regard.  Were that to occur, it would be subject to our obligations, which would involve a debate here in the national Parliament.</p></speech>

There is an existing regulation that Ireland has opted into.

In terms of ensuring that we assist in police co-operation it is necessary now to engage at this enhanced level.</p></speech>

I do not have a question for the Minister.  I support the motions seeking to enable Ireland to opt in to continue our participation in Eurodac and SIS II.  I am conscious of the fact that the D&aacute;il previously approved our participation in these systems, so in effect what we are doing is supporting these motions in order to continue our participation in them.</p> <p>  I note what Deputy Clare Daly said.  It is correct to state that we should not link migration with terrorism, but we do have an issue in the European Union in respect of crime and terrorism and it has to be dealt with and one of the ways to deal with it is through increased police co-operation.  I think these motions will assist in that co-operation continuing.  When one looks at what is happening in the United Kingdom at present and the chaos they have got themselves into over Brexit, one of the real concerns they have, which has come home to roost, is that if they depart from the European Union without a deal, there will be issues in terms of the safety of that country, and that is the main reason why the Cabinet Secretary has given advice to the Cabinet there that they should not go out with no deal.  </p></speech>

What is the interface of that with PULSE in the Irish context?  Is it a new system?  Is information extracted from PULSE? What is the shared access approach on a practical level?</p></speech>

In the event of a search taking place within this jurisdiction, the same search will also be carried out and take effect on the Schengen information system.  It is a dovetailing of the information here at national level with an integrated system across the European Union.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight the fact that we spent much of the past year discussing data protection and privacy.  Could the Minister put on record that he believes the proposal is fully consistent with the general data protection regulation?  </p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, there is a significant role for our Data Protection Commissioner in the context of the European Data Protection Supervisor.  I believe it is important in all circumstances that fundamental rights are observed and that we would not engage in any activity that might in any way encroach upon what might be regarded as fundamental rights.  That is why the involvement at justice and home affairs level of the European Fundamental Rights Agency is important.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider governance issues, strategies and challenges facing Irish soccer.  In this regard, I welcome Mr. Donal Conway, president of the board of the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, Mr. Eddie Murray, honorary treasurer, Mr. Paraic Treanor, chairman of the legal and corporate affairs committee, Ms Rea Walshe, interim CEO, Mr. John Delaney, executive vice president, Mr. Fran Gavin, competitions director, and Mr. Ruud Dokter, high performance director.</p><p>Before we commence, I will, as is the case for all of our meetings, read the notice relating to privilege and the evidence people may give.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Conway to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Included in my presentation are details of those who are accompanying me.  I will not read them out because the Chairman has already done so.</p> <p>  Originally, we were to appear in respect of governance issues, strategies and challenges facing Irish soccer and related matters.</p><p>While the focus may have changed due to events, we remain in a position to discuss any other matter relating to public funds received by the association and their application.  We need to be mindful of our legal obligations and the remit of the committee and to respect the privacy and data protection rights of our employees and related parties.</p><p> Grant Thornton has been engaged by the board of the FAI to conduct an internal review of the association's books, records and ledgers.  It has been on site at the FAI since yesterday week.  I will reference it further in my statement.</p><p> The committee also asked for the attendance of the person filling the position of corporate affairs and licensing director.  John Delaney has been appointed executive vice president.  This is in order to utilise his skills and connections at UEFA and FIFA levels effectively.  In the view of the board, this will be to the benefit of Irish football.  In his place, Rea Walshe has been appointed interim chief executive officer.  The board thanks her for stepping up to this role at short notice and at a difficult time.  There has been no full-time person appointed to Ms Walshe's former role as yet.  If I recall correctly, the committee had asked for that person to be present, but we have not made the appointment yet.</p><p> I wish to put on the record that no disrespect was intended to the committee or Sport Ireland by the FAI's letter of last week.  Sport Ireland has been and is an important stakeholder for us.  Its financial support and advice to us over 20 years have been unstinting and we were honoured to become the first national governing body to move onto the Abbotstown campus.  We have much to do to rebuild trust and confidence in the association and we are committed to achieving this as a board.</p><p> The association notes the comments made last week by the committee and Sport Ireland and acknowledges their concerns.  The board of the FAI met on Wednesday in a scheduled meeting.  The board regretted that it was not in a position to assist Sport Ireland with answers to its questions before Sport Ireland attended the committee.  We have since met Sport Ireland and continue to engage with it.  We have emphasised to it that we are moving as fast as we can, being mindful of the complexity of the issues involved, including legal issues and the need to ensure that all statements we make are accurate and our internal and external processes are fair and robust.  No disrespect was intended by the lateness of the letter of 2 April to Sport Ireland or its brief contents.  I apologise for this and accept that more information would have assisted Sport Ireland and the committee.</p><p> The board is seeking to address the concerns raised fully and many steps are being taken to do so and to establish the requisite detail for Sport Ireland and the committee.  The association has established a sub-committee from among its board members.  This is working closely with the FAI's external advisers and auditors to address these matters urgently.</p><p> Regarding governance, members will be aware that the FAI has a governance group, which has assisted us in making some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were improved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteers policy and a conflict of interest form.  New Government guidelines on terms for board members apply from 2021.  The association held an EGM this year where it voted to limit board members to eight years' service in line with the Government's governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  On 7 February, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said-----</p></speech>

The next page related to that.  There is the option for the board to appoint an independent person to the sub-committee.  We have spoken to Sport Ireland regarding this.  We have also offered to Sport Ireland the opportunity to meet the sub-committee, our finance department staff and Grant Thornton to go through the relevant accounts to assure it that all Government funding has been properly spent since the last audit.</p> <p>  Global auditing and consulting group Mazars has been commissioned by the sub-committee to conduct an independent and in-depth external review of all matters.  The board has requested that this review be completed as soon as possible.  Pending that review, the association has separately and urgently engaged Grant Thornton to conduct an internal review of its books, records and ledgers.  Grant Thornton has been on site at the FAI in Abbotstown for the past eight days.  Its involvement also allows the queries raised regarding the &euro;100,000 issue from 2017 to be addressed so as to ensure that the response to queries is comprehensive and accurate.  I will now read into the record Grant Thornton's view of the &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

On 25 April 2017, an internal finance meeting was held by members of the finance team and the then chief executive officer.  At the meeting, the cash flow position of the association identified a possible cash flow issue at that time.  Acknowledging that the association's revenues operate in a cyclical fashion, this was an unusual situation and was not repeated in 2018.  The association's position on 25 April 2017 was that if all cheques issued in the week ending 28 April 2017 were cashed or presented to the bank at the same time, there was a likelihood of insufficient funds being available to cover all of them.  This was, however, a short-term issue as there was a legitimate expectation that funds would come to the association in the short term arising from various income streams including ticket sales, sponsorship, grant funding and other sources.  The CEO provided the association with a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 and thereby made funds available to provide some immediate financial relief and for the said funds to be used in a context where such additional funding was required by the association.  On Wednesday, 26 April 2017, a request was received by email from one particular creditor who was entitled to draw down funds from the association for just such a draw down.  The financial director contacted the chief executive officer via email, proposing to lodge the cheque for &euro;100,000 to the association's bank account to honour the draw-down request from the particular creditor.  The request was acknowledged by the chief executive officer and payment was made to the particular creditor.  The board acknowledged that the circumstances of the above &euro;100,000 transaction was exceptional and the repayment was subsequently made by the association on 16 June 2017 to the then chief executive officer.  No contract or agreement was entered into between the association and its then chief executive officer and no interest or charges have been levied or paid by the association in respect of the transaction.</p> <p>  Having been informed of the &euro;100,000 payment, the board acknowledged that disclosure would be made in the necessary financial statements in accordance with the required accounting treatment and the provisions of the Companies Act.  The association has since embarked on a review of its internal control processes and procedures to ensure a situation of this nature cannot arise again.  Mr. Delaney will also address this issue in his opening statement.</p></speech>

The association recognises and shares the desire for these matters to be addressed as soon as possible and with due regard to the different ongoing processes and legal requirements.  The FAI is also engaging with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in dealing with its inquiries.</p> <p>  I turn to governance.  The committee will be aware that the FAI has a governance group which has assisted us to make some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were approved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteering policy and a conflict of interest form.  New governance guidelines on term limits for board members will apply from 2021.  This year, the association held an EGM at which it voted to limit board members to eight years' service which is in line with the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  On 7 February 2019, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, said the Government and Sport Ireland were satisfied with the new term limits for FAI board members.  We have also copied the committee with the report of Jonathan Hall Associates.  The board plans to undertake a root and branch review of the FAI and to strengthen our commitment to reform through the establishment of a new group to review and recommend changes in governance to the association.  We have indicated to Sport Ireland that we will seek its input on the composition of the group.  I am aware the committee wishes to question us on the adoption of the code and will not pre-empt that.  The board has also advised Sport Ireland that recent public comments by the FAI did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000 payment to the association in 2017.  That matter is being considered by the board's subcommittee, which was established in recent weeks.</p> <p>  I turn to address in order the questions posed by the committee to the board in recent correspondence.  The first question was on the process engaged in by the FAI to draw down State funding from Sport Ireland, including the annual certification process.  On an annual basis, the FAI submits a programme of action to Sport Ireland outlining our plans within the grassroots, player development, coach education and football services departments.  This sets out comprehensive programme plans, the key objectives and targets to be achieved and the expected timeline to achieve them.  Our programme of action also includes our annual budget for these programmes along with planned appointments for the year ahead.  The FAI also submits an end-of-year update on the previous year's programme of action which sets out the actual targets achieved and the actual income and expenditure for the previous year.  We also provide the following documentation, namely the terms and conditions of grant approval for the year ahead; an anti-doping compliance report; an update on participation figures; an update on FAInet, which is our registered players' database, and an update on our grassroots strategic pillars.  These reports are provided to Sport Ireland by the end of January each year.  Sport Ireland reviews our submissions and reverts with any queries which are dealt with in a timely manner.  The grant draw-down process is made by way of a letter from our financial director or CEO to the CEO of Sport Ireland.</p><p>Sport Ireland generally approves our field sport grant during the second quarter but it has the ability to release up to 50% of our annual grant before it formally approves the annual funding.  After its internal approval process, it will advance us a further 25%.  The final 25% is held until we provide an interim report on activities and budgets, our signed and approved financial statements, and an update on proceedings from our AGM in July or August.  Any queries, if applicable, are dealt with and once Sport Ireland is satisfied that the FAI has met all required criteria, the final balance of funding is processed.</p><p> The committee's second question was to request the entirety of the terms and conditions of grant approval including the manner in which the Football Association of Ireland ensures compliance with same.  I have brought a full copy of the Sport Ireland terms and conditions for grant approval for the committee.  I do not propose to read this into the record.  I refer to clause 4.3 of the further reporting section of our annual terms and conditions.  It requires the association to notify Sport Ireland in writing in the event of any material deterioration in its financial position.  We acknowledge that certain circumstances arose in April 2017 which were not reported to Sport Ireland.  We will work with Sport Ireland in order to establish a process to ensure the FAI is, in future, fully compliant with clause 4.3.  All other clauses within the terms and conditions are met.  We have also invited Sport Ireland to satisfy itself on this matter by meeting our colleagues.</p><p> The next question was on the process by which the financial statements of the Football Association of Ireland are compiled, including the sign-off mechanism, before production to Sport Ireland in accordance with the financial reporting obligation contained in the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee also asked for an explanation as to why particular credit facilities afforded to the Football Association of Ireland were not disclosed as part of this financial statement for the relevant year:</p><p> The FAI uses Sage 200 financial software to manage its financial transactions.  Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and are reviewed by the finance director.  Actual versus budget reports are sent to all budget owners on a monthly basis for their review and action.  Monthly management accounts are presented to the finance committee and to the board.  On a quarterly basis, a full financial business review takes place between the CEO, the finance team and the relevant budget owners to discuss financial performance to date and any necessary action required.  At the year end, reports are exported from Sage 200 and mapped via Excel into financial statements.  A final review with the CEO takes place before the reports are presented to our auditors for independent review.  Our audit committee convenes at least twice during the auditing process.  Once this audit is completed, the financial statements are presented to the board for its approval and sign-off.  The signed financial statements are submitted to Sport Ireland for their review as per the terms and conditions of our annual grant.  We are currently looking at measures to review processes and to recommend controls to ensure full compliance with company law.</p><p> The committee asked for information on any audits carried out by Sport Ireland of the Football Association of Ireland, including the results of any such audit.  Sport Ireland audits tend to take place every three years.  There is an audit scheduled to take place this year and the last Sport Ireland audit took place in 2016.  </p><p> The committee also asked for information on the historical context to the drawdown of Sport Ireland funding including the timing of the drawdown, any requests for early drawdown and co-operation between Sport Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland in relation to such requests.</p><p> Sport Ireland has always supported the FAI and understands the cyclical nature of our funding.  Generally we would, with the agreement of Sport Ireland, draw down 50% of our annual field sports grant by the end of the first quarter, the next 25% would be released once Sport Ireland reviewed our annual January submissions and approved our annual grant internally, and the final instalment would be released once Sport Ireland satisfied itself that we had met all the required criteria.  This always takes place after our AGM in July or August each year.  Our programmes commence 1 January each year and a significant amount of our Sport Ireland funding contributes towards the cost of development officers and other grassroots administration roles.</p><p> The committee asked about the Football Association of Ireland&rsquo;s progress on the adoption of the code of practice for good governance for voluntary and charitable organisations, noting that the Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies and national sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  A governance committee was established in 2017 to ensure implementation of the code of practice for good governance in community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland and since its establishment has introduced the following: a board induction process, a code of conduct for board members, a conflict of interests form, a schedule of reserved functions for the board, a volunteer policy, and standing orders for board meetings.  In addition, term limits of eight years for all new board members have been introduced and three members of the board have been appointed to the FAI&rsquo;s audit committee.  The association intends to be fully compliant with the code by the end of 2021, within the deadline set out in the national sports policy.</p><p> The committee asked about communication between the Football Association of Ireland and Sport Ireland, including any statutory requests made by Sport Ireland seeking information from the Football Association of Ireland.  Each of our departments liaise with their counterparts in Sport Ireland.  We have developed very good working relationships with Sport Ireland and meet with it on a regular basis.  It seeks our assistance for various initiatives including organisational training, anti-doping measures, risk registers etc.  Statutory requests tend to come through either our legal or business partnerships departments, where they are dealt with as appropriate.  </p><p> We were also asked whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds in respect of certain programmes, and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain these programmes without State assistance.  State funding is of significant importance to FAI in delivering our grassroots programmes, in keeping with our overall policy of &ldquo;Football for All&rdquo;.  This, along with other funding sources through local authorities, has facilitated the growth of our nationwide development officer network.  We have a network of 57 development officers, with a further four in the process of recruitment.  The majority of development officer roles are co-funded.  This allows us to grow participation numbers nationally and to develop new participation programmes targeting our entire population.  The FAI would not have the capacity to maintain these programmes without the assistance of State funding.  Our 2019 programme of action budget shows the apportionment of our Sport Ireland grant relative to the actual cost of running these programmes.  The association matches each &euro;1 invested through Sport Ireland funding with an additional &euro;4, as acknowledged by Sport Ireland.</p><p> The business of sport is very different from others.  The qualification stage process of football is unique.  Financial fluctuations are the norm and cashflow is often irregular.  The disappointment of the failure of the men&rsquo;s senior team to qualify for World Cup 2018 had a major impact on match attendance and, subsequently, cashflow.  I know the committee wishes to question us about whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain programmes without State assistance.  I will not delay now, as I know members wish to raise queries on these issues, except to say we could not do what we do without State assistance.  Similarly, the activities of the FAI help to enable the State to meet some of its policy aims, especially in the areas of health and social inclusion.</p><p> I appreciate that Sport Ireland confirmed to the committee last week that its auditors were satisfied that all moneys granted to the FAI were expended in the manner for which they had been provided.  I want to make clear how seriously we take the issues that have emerged in recent weeks.  The sub-committee of the board has been working every day since its establishment on 26 March to plan a way forward, to ensure transparency, and to promote greater trust in our organisation.</p><p>Much work has been done in recent years to create a more financially sustainable organisation.  Cashflow management is at the forefront of our financial planning.  In time, a process will be put in train to appoint a new CEO, answerable to, but not a member of, the board in line with best governance practices.  We will use an outside independent body to assist in this search.  One of the main requirements for the next CEO will be to build on important relationships that already exist with Sport Ireland, the Oireachtas, this committee and all our stakeholders. <br/><br/>Members may be aware that our association commissioned Jonathan Hall Associates to engage in a review of senior executive roles.  The board had recognised that the workload of the CEO had expanded considerably over recent years and further expansion was likely, having regard to a number of potential strategic international projects under consideration.  Over the next three to four years, considerable demands will arise from the hosting of the Euro 2020 fixtures, the bids being assembled on a North-South basis for the 2023 under-21 men&rsquo;s European Championship finals, and the joint UK-Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup.  It was the board&rsquo;s view that, coupled with the demands of managing a growing organisation, it was neither feasible nor best practice for the responsibility for addressing all these challenges to be placed on a single individual.  It was also the board&rsquo;s view that, in considering how roles might be structured, the association should have regard to models in place in other football associations and the unique influencing power and skills which are vested in the person of the former CEO by reference to his personal position as a member of the UEFA executive committee.  It was the Jonathan Hall Associates review which led to the creation of the position of executive vice-president. <br/><br/>Turning to the good work of the football family, while I acknowledge that members will be interested in questioning us about matters that have featured in the media in recent weeks, it is my duty to put on record the recent achievements of the Irish football family at every level.  These should not be lost in the heat of controversy.  I am sure that if I did not refer to these achievements, I would be criticised in many quarters, especially the football family.  Our national men&rsquo;s team, led by Mick McCarthy, has won its two opening matches in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA European Championship and sits on top of group D with six points.  As many members will be aware, Dublin will host four games at the Euro 2020 finals, with huge financial benefit for the economy.  If Ireland qualifies, we will be guaranteed two home games at the tournament.<br/><br/>Our national women&rsquo;s team, managed by Colin Bell, will begin its UEFA 2021 European Championship qualifying campaign against Montenegro in September, while our under-21 men&rsquo;s team, in Stephen Kenny's first match in charge, beat Luxembourg 3-0 on 24 March.  Tom Mohan&rsquo;s squad recently qualified for this summer&rsquo;s UEFA under-19 finals, as winners of its elite qualifying group.  Unlike other tournament finals, only eight of the 55 nations qualify for the under-19 tournament finals.  Next month, we will host the UEFA under-17 European Championship, with games to be played in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford and Longford, where Colin O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s team will carry Irish hopes.  Our under-19 and under-17 women&rsquo;s teams have recently enjoyed victories over Serbia and Scotland, respectively, in their European Championship qualifiers.  Domestically, attendances have risen by more than 11% in the SSE Airtricity League of Ireland, with average increases of 13.5% and 42.9% in the premier division and first division, respectively.  At SSE Airtricity national league level, under-13 football was launched recently, which will complement the under-19, under-17, under-15 and under-13 levels and constitute part of our work with our high-performance director to design our new elite player pathway.  At grassroots level, the latest Irish Sports Monitor report by Sport Ireland confirms football as the sport with the greatest level of participation in the country.  Our recent implementation of the online FAInet process has registered 213,000 players in more than 86 leagues.  We continue to deliver our FAI strategic plan for 2016 to 2020 and we are in the fourth annual operations plan linked with the strategy, with positive outcomes in 2018 in respect of the targets set.  We are well on target towards full implementation by 2020. <br/><br/>The FAI also continues what I would describe as invaluable work in the following areas.  Our player development plan, under the auspices of high-performance director Ruud Dokter, is in its fourth year, with an emphasis on a player focused model, creating better players for the future.  Our emerging talent programme helps identify and develop talented young players from under-11 upwards throughout the country, with a view to helping them progress on to the international stage.  The regional emerging talent network has ten centres nationwide and ancillary centres in Dublin, with 1,200 players between boys and girls at three separate age groups.  In partnership with education and training boards, ETBs, nationwide, the FAI operates 11 local training initiatives that provide a unique blend of educational and football development for talented young footballers, both male and female.  The FAI-ETB player development programme enables participants to train full time while availing of a sport-themed education course, accredited at Quality and Qualifications Ireland level 5, which enables young players to achieve their academic and sporting potential.  Nine of our SSE Airtricity League of Ireland clubs have links with third level institutions.  The aim of our football for all programme is the delivery of football opportunities to people who may not ordinarily get a chance to play the beautiful game.  The programme comprises players from all groups and sporting bodies that cater for people with a disability who want to play football, and approximately 3,800 players participate.<br/><br/>Furthermore, our football programme for the homeless and our late-night leagues, many of them in disadvantaged areas, continue to grow.  We launched the under-17 women&rsquo;s national league, with 11 clubs participating.  This is a further vital step to develop women&rsquo;s football at underage level.  Last year, we launched the glow football programme, which has the aim of encouraging young girls to become involved in football through a fun concept of playing indoor football to music in the dark under ultraviolet light.  Our FAI Aviva soccer sisters programme, now in its 13th year, will see girls between the ages of six and 14 attending football camps during the Easter holiday, bookings for which are already at record levels.  More than 42% of the 37,200 children taking part in thi<b>s </b>year's Spar primary school 5s programme are female, while 1,693 schools were involved.  More than 20,000 children from 1,038 schools took part in the 2018 primary and post-primary schools futsal programme, while more than 35,000 children participated in our Sports Direct summer soccer schools in a record 400 camps.  There were 2,245 participants in our school-club link programmes in 2018.  The FAI won the diversity and inclusion award at the 2018 Irish Sport Industry Awards organised by the Federation of Irish Sport.  In 2018, we rolled out the integration through football project and the sports welcomes refugees programme, both supported by the Department of Justice and Equality and the European Commission.  Four new development officers began work with the FAI during 2018 in Kilkenny and Dublin.  Two of the roles are solely dedicated to women&rsquo;s football, while one is for inclusion programmes. <br/><br/>These achievements and programmes can happen thanks only to the hard work and dedication of the players, the fans and our staff, and I pay credit to them all today.  I also apologise to them for the FAI currently being the subject of controversy and I hope a stronger and better association will emerge from our present difficulties.  This work could not take place without the vital funding we receive from the State.</p><p>I want to repeat how grateful the FAI is to receive these moneys via Sport Ireland.  They go towards programmes such as those I mentioned.</p><p> We appreciate also that receipt of State funding brings with it a heightened level of public and political scrutiny.  That is as it should be.  Nevertheless, the point should be made at this stage that FAI activities are primarily funded via UEFA and FIFA and through commercial and philanthropic sources, not to mention the various fundraising activities at local level in communities the length and breadth of Ireland.  This is not a one-way street, by which I mean football in Ireland, and our work in the FAI, brings with it not just huge social, health and community benefits, it also brings an economic benefit to the country and its economy.  Sport Ireland noted last week that for every euro it gives the FAI, the association spends four more.  This facilitates participation at grassroots level and enables us to reach out to all across the country who wish to play football and experience some of the excellent personal, health, community and societal benefits involved.</p><p> Despite our success on the pitch, and in communities around Ireland, the past few weeks have undoubtedly been a difficult time for Irish football and the FAI.  We are determined as a board, and I am determined as president, that our sole focus shall once again be to promote football in this country.  I hope the processes that we are putting in place in the short term, and the long-term processes around governance and reform, will help to restore the committee's faith in the FAI.</p></speech>

We have just received them and the committee members are unhappy about this.  I am expressing their collective concern at that.</p> <p>  Given that we have had a number of breaks this morning, I propose, with the consent of the witnesses, that we continue until 1.45 p.m. without a break.

The Grant Thornton exercise is to assist our internal review, to make it more robust and to bring in outside expertise.  The Mazars exercise is fully independent.  We enlisted the support of Grant Thornton to examine the association's books, records and ledgers.  We envisage Grant Thornton conducting an investigation while also providing support to our own staff.  Its involvement represents an extra resource for our own staff.

I want to address the committee on the issue of &euro;100,000 I gave to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, in April 2017, which was repaid to me in June 2017.<br/><br/>First of all I want to say how truly saddened I am that Sport Ireland, which provided annual State funding of &euro;2.9 million to the Football Association of Ireland, has announced that it has temporarily withdrawn the funding to the association pending reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.<br/><br/>I wish to make it clear that I have urged a speedy response to the queries received from Sport Ireland, and I this week I have already met with Grant Thornton and with the FAI on these issues.  I will respond to any request to a meeting as soon as I hear from Mazars.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, 25 April 2017 we had an internal finance meeting at the FAI.  This meeting was attended by our director of finance, Mr. Eamon Breen, our financial controller Ms Yvonne Tsang, and me as the CEO.  At this meeting I was advised that if all cheques and FAI bank transfers issued to third parties at that time were presented for payment that the FAI would exceed its overdraft limit of &euro;1.5 million on its bank accounts, which were held with Bank of Ireland.  I expressed concern and surprise at the meeting as to how the FAI could have arrived at this position.  I recall thinking at the time that if I had been approached even a few days earlier I may have been able to better address the issue.  I asked if any funds were due to the FAI that could resolve the matter and I was informed that there was nothing due imminently that could be confirmed at that stage.<br/><br/>As the matter was pressing and we only had a few hours to resolve the potential issues that would arise if the bank overdraft limit was exceeded, as a precautionary measure and to assist the FAI I wrote a cheque for &euro;100,000 from my personal account to the FAI.  This cheque was made payable to the FAI and I gave it to our director of finance, Eamon Breen, telling him to only lodge the cheque if it became clear that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.<br/><br/>Later that afternoon I travelled to London and the next day I travelled on to Geneva, Switzerland, where I was attending UEFA business on behalf of the FAI.  I recall phoning our honorary secretary, Mr. Michael Cody informing him that I had made a precautionary payment to the FAI by way of a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 to assist in the event that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.  I informed him that I was very concerned and that I had to act quickly to assist the Football Association of Ireland.  I recall also informing the then president Mr. Tony Fitzgerald who was chairman of the board at the time.<br/><br/>The following day while I was in Geneva I received a call from our director of finance, Eamon Breen, informing me that there was a requirement to lodge the cheque by &euro;100,000 and he subsequently confirmed that request to me by email.  I agreed that the cheque should be lodged.  I asked the director of finance when I would be paid back and he said it would be as soon as the funds came in.<br/><br/>I subsequently received a cheque for &euro;100,000 on 16 June 2017 from the Football Association of Ireland, repaying the amount in full and which I lodged to my personal account on 23 June 2017.  I did not receive any interest payment and I would never have expected it.  I was only acting to assist the FAI and for the benefit of Irish football.<br/><br/>I recall asking the director of finance, Eamon Breen, if the FAI had any reporting or disclosure obligations arising out of the &euro;100,000 payment.  There was a board meeting on Monday, 19 June 2017 and the &euro;100,000 payment did not arise.<br/><br/>On Monday, 4 March 2019 I informed the board of the FAI of the precautionary payment I had made, following a media query received from <i>The Sunday Times. </i>On Saturday, 16 March 2019 I initiated court proceedings against <i>The Sunday Times</i>at my own cost in relation to this matter because I believed at the time that this information had emanated from documentation that had been filed in the family courts.  I accept that the overdraft limit issue arose on my watch as the chief executive officer.  I wish that it had not happened but I acted in the best interests of the association.<br/><br/>We have an excellent and committed finance and administration team and body of employees at the FAI, and many voluntary workers and players at all levels throughout the country.  I regret the embarrassment this entire issue has caused to them and the association but I did it in the best interests of football.<br/><br/>I will continue to assist fully the Football Association of Ireland in its engagements with Sport Ireland and Grant Thornton.  When called upon to do so I will do likewise with Mazars and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in their respective inquiries.<br/><br/>On legal advice I am precluded from making any further comments at this hearing in relation to the finances of the association or my former role as CEO, or on the &euro;100,000 payment, either directly or indirectly.In the interests of fair procedures and natural justice I have made this statement to the committee and attended this meeting voluntarily, as I have attended many Oireachtas committees in the past.  I am not in a position to answer any such questions here at this time.  Given that some members of this committee have made highly prejudicial public pronouncements about me personally prior to my attendance here today, and in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Kerins case, I ask that the committee respects this position.<br/><br/>I am happy to answer any other questions in relation to my current role as executive vice president responsible for UEFA and FIFA matters.  As most members will know I am passionate about football and always have been.  In my role as executive vice-president I look forward to welcoming the European under-17 boys championships to Ireland next month.  This will see 16 teams play and provide at least 9,000 bed spaces for tourism for the country.  Next year Dublin is one of 12 European cities to host the Euro 2020.  This will see four matches played at the Aviva Stadium, hopefully including the Republic of Ireland team.  We are currently bidding for the 2023 under-21 men's tournament with the Irish Football Association.  This is a very significant project and demonstrates how the round ball can unify both associations on this island.<br/><br/>I would also like to see a Women's Champions League final being played in Dublin at the Aviva Stadium, perhaps to mark the 50th anniversary of the Women's Football Association in Ireland in 2023.<br/><br/>I, as an executive committee member of UEFA, along with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, am currently working on a feasibility study that we hope will result in the 2030 FIFA World Cup being hosted across these islands.<br/><br/>From a financial perspective UEFA would provide the FAI with somewhere between &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million annually depending on participation in major tournaments.  It is a significant funder of the Football Association of Ireland. </p></speech>

I regret that as well and I regret the fact that we are discussing this matter.</p><p>That was a breach of the terms and conditions in respect of the receipt of public money.  The board did not even have sight of it.  I am absolutely astonished that the FAI conducted its business in this way.  The people who knew about it were the finance director, the honorary secretary, the former president, the chief executive, and the financial controller.  The rest of the board was not apprised of this matter.  It was not reported to the auditors because it was not minuted.  If it is not minuted, it does not get picked up by the auditors in the end of year accounts.

To give a bit of context, what I am trying to move towards in my line of questioning is the claim in Mr. Delaney's statement that the cashflow issues came to light on 25 April.

It is perfectly rational.  Given that, at the time, the FAI may not have been able to honour all cheques issued, is Mr. Conway of the view that the FAI was close to being insolvent under company law?</p></speech>

I draw the Deputy's attention to our annual accounts.  We have had nine consecutive years of profit.  As I have said, cashflow can be a challenge to manage because of the timing of revenue or income streams.  That makes it difficult but it does not lead to a situation in which one would conclude that the business is insolvent or is not a going concern.</p></speech>

It is widely acknowledged that Mr. Delaney has been very accessible on all matters, whether local or national, and that he has frequently engaged with public representatives.  The purpose of today, however, is to deal adequately with outstanding governance issues.  I am aware that our guests are here on a voluntary basis but this is about corporate governance matters.  It is about restoring public confidence in the FAI and seeking answers for patrons of an organisation that each of our guests claims to love.</p> <p>  I accept that the running of a huge organisation with an annual turnover in excess of &euro;50 million is complex from a domestic and international perspective.

Why can our guests not assist the committee today by identifying who would have been left with a payment default if the &euro;100,000 had not been lent?</p></speech>

Mr. Conway, responding to Deputy Catherine Murphy, said that the fact of the matter was that the loan was managed the way it was managed.  The question is why it was managed in that way.  We are still none the wiser as to that.  The FAI representatives also said that the awareness of the loan was confined to a certain number of people.  Are the FAI representatives saying that the three people, or perhaps more, that information was confined to deliberately chose not to inform the rest of the board?  It returns to the board as a corporate body having overall responsibility.  The FAI also declared that it is committed to learn from what has happened.  No sooner did I hear that but I thought back to the Genesis report in 2002.  That report came out of areas of concern, shall we say, that had arisen.  It contained serious recommendations in relation to the code of governance that were never implemented so how can the FAI expect people to have confidence that it will learn from what has happened if it has not corrected all of its errors from the past?</p> <p>  The internal report was mentioned.  When I first read that the FAI was bringing Grant Thornton in to assist but also to investigate the &euro;100,000 loan I wondered why would a board bring in somebody else to investigate something the people in the room here know the answers to?</p><p>The same response was given today that Grant Thornton is investigating.  We also have the statement from John Delaney but the people here know the answers.  It appears that the two fingers are being given to Sport Ireland, this committee, the grassroots of the FAI and sports clubs.  Does Mr. Conway agree?  </p></speech>

Why has an outside company been engaged to investigate something the people in this room know the answers to?  Why does Mr. Conway thank that is not giving the two fingers to everybody?  I am asking that question because it appears the board of the FAI has not been accustomed to public scrutiny of this nature for a long time.</p></speech>

I have sat down with people from that company and worked on an explanation for the loan of &euro;100,000, and brought that to the committee today.  There will be more from Grant Thornton in the sense that we have just recently appointed a new financial officer.

Given all the information has come to light, including Sport Ireland not being informed of the financial difficulties in accordance with the conditions for grant approval; the &euro;100,000 loan was not in the account; the board members who are expected to hold the CEO to account were also not informed, as Mr. Conway stated, does he think it was appropriate to create a new position for the former CEO?  Does he, as president of the FAI, think that is good governance?  Does it send out a good message?  Was it a good decision by the board?  Some people might say it appears that the FAI, as it currently stands, is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

The new role that the FAI created has not been rescinded.  Was that role advertised?  If it was not advertised, is that good governance?  Does Mr. Conway accept that people have the perception that this appears to be the same old, same old from the board of the FAI?  Does he further accept that even by virtue of events today, the opening statements, etc., the FAI is being reflected in a very bad light throughout the State?</p></speech>

The president is quite right that a number of months ago we would have discussed the time constraints and the amount of time I have had to spend doing effectively three roles.  As Deputy Troy stated, every weekend I would go to grassroots functions, visiting over 2,000 clubs in a period.  Second, I was trying to manage a business which has a turnover of almost &euro;50 million and 205 full-time staff.  Third, I was on the board of UEFA and managing specific projects that were outlined by both the president and me.  My role now is as a member of the board of UEFA but also to manage the specific projects we have outlined.  I will be able to use my strengths in those specific roles to, hopefully, bring big tournaments to Ireland, bring more funding back to the FAI for grassroots as well as for the running of the game as well.</p></speech>

I shall follow on from the previous questions that centre around the issue of &euro;100,000.  Would an organisation with the clout and budget of the FAI not finance officers to do a financial budgeting cashflow, forecasting and financial planning for the year ahead?  If it did then it would know what is coming down the road.  The FAI should have seen this coming down the road and that such an extraordinary issue would arise.</p></speech>

We look at the profit and loss at every board meeting.  We look at the outturn to budget and if there is any variance.  In 2017, there would be points in the year when there could be some strain on cashflow.  There would be other points of the year when there would be significant cash balances.  Of course, there is a budget and of course there is scrutiny of how our finances progress during the year.</p></speech>

That means the squad has gone through the initial phase, the elite phase and has now reached the finals.  That success will bring demands for hundreds of thousands of euro to facilitate their playing in the finals.  It is brilliant and a fantastic achievement from a football point of view.  Something may happen in the course of the year which will put extra demands on the association's finances.  We clearly know our revenue streams but a payment from UEFA or FIFA that is due in February may come in June.  This kind of issue can arise.</p></speech>

Maybe the transaction was incorrect.  Is Grant Thornton saying the transaction was legal or illegal?</p> <p>  The FAI is accountable to the UEFA and FIFA in terms of how it is structured.  Is that right?  We are limited in what we can say to the FAI.  More important, we are limited in what the Government can say or do to the FAI.  We will not go back to what happened in Spain in 2017 when there was a threat of Government involvement in the election of the president of the governing body of the football association.  Have FIFA or UEFA knocked on the FAI's door since all of this came out to ask what is going on?</p></speech>

UEFA had a number of personnel here because we launched the draw for the under-17 finals.  There were some reasonably senior people from UEFA there but nobody raised any issues with me.  There has been no communication on these issues from either organisation.</p></speech>

Before the financial officer or whoever turned to the then CEO, and I know there was a short deliberation, was there not enough time to approach the local bank manager and say, "Listen, extend the overdraft from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;1.6 million?"</p><p>In fairness, the CEO was safeguarding the reputation of the bank and the worst thing one can ever do is have a cheque bounce in one's face.  A cheque lodged in a bank takes three days to clear.  What would have happened if the people who were looking for the money had approached the bank in advance?  What was the advantage of the loan, unless the CEO went with &euro;100,000 in cash in a bag to the bank?  The optics are not good.  While it might not be illegal, it does not look good.  That is why the representatives want clearance from the Grant Thornton report.</p><p> Sport Ireland told the committee that it would make no call until we had deliberated as well.  Has Sport Ireland asked the FAI whether it could fast-track its audit of the accounts?  Every three years, Sport Ireland conducts an audit of the various organisations it governs, and this year it is the turn of the FAI.</p></speech>

In fairness, that is some increase and we must call a spade a spade in that regard.  Many clubs throughout the country are very supportive of what the FAI has been doing and I have spoken to some sponsors who believe they have been treated very professionally.</p> <p>  I have some questions about corporate governance, although I do not wish to repeat questions that my colleagues have asked.  I am very disappointed that documents which were not available to the committee in advance were submitted during the meeting.  It is regrettable and we should have had them in advance.  I was one of the members who spoke about that in private session.  Mr. Conway stated earlier that the bottom line is everyone wants a much better and stronger FAI for everybody, that is, for anybody wearing the green jersey or any jersey, be it a club jersey or whatever, in any form of sport.  The FAI is an important and strong organisation.</p> <p>  On corporate governance, would Mr. Conway, as chairman, handle any areas differently in hindsight?  Are there any areas where the FAI should not have acted, or where it did not act but should have done so?  What lessons will he take from what happened?</p></speech>

In response to another member, I indicated that a root-and-branch examination of the organisation is overdue.  I do not say that because I see failures or an unsuccessful organisation, but any organisation should engage at regular intervals, with external help, in some examination of how well it is equipped to implement its strategy, mission and what it is about.  Given the difficulties we have now, let us make of them.  That may sound a little strange but, for example, the Senator referred to corporate governance.  We have a corporate governance group but my colleagues on the board and I believe we need to move that on to something much stronger, with external persons on board.  We had this conversation with Sport Ireland and, indeed, asked them whether they want a role in nominating people for to that group.  My colleague, Ms Walshe, is a member of the group, as are two external people who have previously been involved with the FAI, namely, Miriam Malone, CEO of Paralympics Ireland and Tom Jordan, who worked with some of our senior executives-----</p></speech>

On foot of the Genesis report, we radically changed the board and put key committees in place below it.  The issue has been raised and we have committed to revisiting whether all those committees are fit for purpose and whether we should consider overhauling that aspect of our governance, for example.  In a practical sense, the matter has been under discussion for months, it has been raised with our council, and we are committed to examining it.  That is number one.</p></speech>

A turnover of &euro;50 million is significant.  There is nothing illegal about an employee giving a loan to a company.  It is quite unusual but it can happen.  It is incredibly unusual that the board was not formally aware of it.  It is also incredibly unusual that it was not reported as a note to the accounts.  FRS 102 and the companies legislation require disclosures of related party transactions, which is significant particularly in the light of the clear audit opinion the association received, as I understand.  Questions, therefore, need to be answered.</p> <p>  While I accept the evidence given by Mr. Delaney at face value and I do not seek anything personal or detailed outside of that; I am instead considering the matter overall.  Mr. Conway mentioned that monthly cash flows, projections, variance analyses and so on are reported to the board by the financial controller.  I find it difficult to understand the figure of &euro;100,000 given that the FAI had a turnover of &euro;50 million and &euro;22.3 million in net total assets, with a profit of &euro;2.7 million in the year in question.  Could the FAI not have held off &euro;100,000 worth of creditors for a little while?  As Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, could it not have reverted to the bank to ask for another &euro;100,000 as a short-term facility?  There is a significant disjoint in that regard.  While I will not challenge the former CEO, I will challenge the board on its engagement and corporate governance.  Mr. Conway might comment on that and, in particular, on the fact that the board was not formally aware of the loan for two years.</p></speech>

It was initiated to review operational matters in the preparation and support of the Irish team at the 2002 World Cup; consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of these procedures and arrangements against other similar international operators; examine how the senior team fits into the FAI structures; and recommend a strategy for the FAI to devise suitable policies to achieve greater and consistent success during the next European and World Cup campaigns.</p> <p>  That report made a number of recommendations, many of which were implemented.  At the very end of the report - and just outside of the recommendations - it suggests support for its implementation and states:</p> <p>This should include the appointment of a vice president or chairman from within the sport for a period of four years to work with the president and other directors (including non-executive directors from outside the FAI) ... the executive to design and manage the process of change ... External assistance is also likely to be required in the following areas: facilitation of key discussions, planning and integration, developing the top team and input of specific skills.</p> <p>  I was not at the FAI in 2002 but I understand that there was a major rehaul of processes and the board.  The board went from a 23-man board down to a ten-man board.  It went up to an 11-member board when we brought in the women's football committee chairman but it has now gone back down to ten members.  There was major consultation with all of our stakeholders, which was well documented in the newspapers.  The FAI went around the country to consult stakeholders.  The consultation resulted in the standing committees, as Mr. Conway alluded to, which are currently in place.  Unfortunately, there were no non-executive directors at the time.  That is not unusual in sport.  Sports governance is different from corporate governance.  I understand that not all sporting bodies within Ireland or outside of Ireland have non-executive directors on their boards currently.  However, I believe that during my time on the governance committee in the FAI we have made great changes.  We still have time to implement the governance code but one of the recommendations or considerations is that we would bring an independent member onto the board of directors.</p></speech>

Surely there should be an independent member on the board in the interest of the outcome of the Genesis report and in the interests of fairness.  Is the FAI be open to putting an independent member onto the board who may come from some Government Department, given that so much money is going into the FAI?</p></speech>

We have also spoke with them about installing a much more powerful governance committee.  The recommendations from that could almost invariably take us to having independent directors, and we will engage with Sport Ireland on that.</p></speech>

Any of the major sponsors have not communicated directly with the board.  To be fair, that is not something I would have asked the commercial director, but I can.  The commercial director has not brought anything to our attention about sponsorship being in jeopardy.  Sponsorships come and go, as members will be aware, and we are negotiating with various potential sponsors currently.  We hope to retain the significant sponsorship we have.</p></speech>

Mr. Delaney is the executive vice president of the FAI with responsibility for FIFA and UEFA matters.  FIFA certainly has not been the most open group.  Sepp Blatter was the general secretary since 1981 and president since 1998.  He has been suspended since 2015 for corruption and financial mismanagement and he has been ejected from office for eight years.  How different has the FAI been from FIFA in the past few years?  I would put this question to a lot of the football associations around, not just to the FAI.</p></speech>

The current FIFA president is Gianni Infantino.  FIFA has changed remarkably in his period there.  This is well accepted.  I work closely with the UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, and he has brought UEFA forward incredibly well over the past number of years.  They are two parent bodies of the FAI.  UEFA is a significant funder of the FAI and FIFA's revenues are increasing with the association.  I could not speak higher of how UEFA is run under the stewardship of its current president.  There is no doubt that FIFA has come a remarkable distance.  The recent vote for the World Cup was transparent and open.  When the "United" bid won, it was put up on the screens.  I could not but commend both organisations on how they are run.  There are key funding negotiations to come into the future with regard to our centralised television deals.  I also hope that UEFA will run a television channel on social media for domestic leagues where the League of Ireland could well get a global audience.  This is very important to the association and to me coming from a League of Ireland background.  We work very closely with both bodies the Senator has mentioned.  They are significant funders but they are also a significant resource support to the FAI.  They are two very well run organisations.</p></speech>

I will not go into them in great detail but I would like to get clarity on some of them.  On the issue of John Delaney's appointment to his new role, I do not know Mr. Delaney very well but I know that as an ambassador for Ireland and Irish sports he has done an amazing job and I am sure he will do an amazing job in this regard.  He has worked on anti-racism and integration.  I have been involved in the Oireachtas soccer teams that have taken part in games in this regard.  It is important to highlight issues such as these and sport is a great way of doing so.  Mr. Delaney has taken on board certain initiatives and has been very successful in doing so.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, asked a technical but important question.  Am I correct that the &euro;100,000 cheque was made out to a particular person?  Is that correct?  Was there a concern about a number of cheques?  What is the overall figure of all the cheques?  We have all been in a situation where we have written cheques whereby if they were all lodged in the same week, we would not have had enough money to meet them.  Was it one particular cheque that the FAI thought would be the one to tip it over with regard to what was in its account?  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point.  If I were in that position, I would not write a cheque but do a cash transfer because by the time my cheque arrived in the account, it might not be cleared.  Then the cheque on the other side would be processed and also might not be cleared.  I am concerned about the logistics.  The first thing I would do if the &euro;100,000 would tip me over the edge would be to ask the recipient to hold off until the following Monday as I would be okay by then.  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point on this.  He stated one would not write cheques but would make cash transfers from one bank account to another so it would be immediate.  One would then not be worried about whether a cheque was lodged.  More importantly, in the normal course of events - perhaps this is why it would be helpful to have the report in full - one would just ring up the guys and ask them not to cash the cheque this week and tell them it would be okay for the following week.  I am sure that would not have caused anyone any undue stress.  This is a very technical point.  Other than that, all of my other questions have already been asked.</p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Walsh, the interim chief executive officer, whom I wish the best success.  I suggest that a percentage of the new board be from both genders, whatever that may be.  One of the criticisms I have of the FAI is its treatment of women.  The women's national team and underage structure should receive equal treatment.  That is my point.  They should get the same amount of resources.  Clearly, they do not, the reason being they do not bring in revenue, and we understand that.  However, look at what Croke Park manages to do with regard to ladies' football on the one day of the year it is the biggest sporting event for women.  Equal treatment is required.  In fairness, the GAA has come a long way but it has not come all the way.  We cannot have the national ladies' football team handing over tracksuits in an airport.  I hope that the issue of gender equality on the board will be part of governance, and bear in mind women make up 50% of the population.  They would give a different viewpoint.  Perhaps in some instances, when everybody else is going off and doing something, having more women on the main board and all of the governance committees and making this a policy-----</p></speech>

Deputy Lisa Chambers is doing an excellent job on Brexit.  I am sure if she were in Westminster, she would have sorted it out a long time ago, as would all of the women.</p> <p>  As part of the governance review, the FAI should make sure the women's soccer team and all of the women who will, I hope, account for half of participants in soccer in future are represented.  By the way, the reason this issue will not be raised by Grant Thornton and all of the others is that it is men who will write the reports and they have a bias.  They keep forgetting they should be doing this.  Perhaps out of this the FAI should make a commitment to ensure equal treatment for the ladies' football team and give a commitment to have a substantial percentage of women within its governance structure.  I would say the figure should be 50% because women make up half of the population and half of the funding the FAI receives from the Government is supplied by women because they pay tax too.  They are entitled to have representation across the board of every sporting organisation but as the FAI is here today, I make the request of it.  I wish the interim CEO the best of luck and I hope she will become the permanent CEO at some stage.</p></speech>

I have read out various figures today.  Equality is the issue and it is not the issue in this sense.  In my address, I spoke about the SPAR primary school fives.  Of all of our programmes, it has the highest female participation, as 42% or 43% of the 37,000 participants are female.  Senator Daly rightly stressed the importance of equality.  Our challenge, which is the challenge of every sport, is that at the ages of 13, 14, 17 and 18, in excess of 40% of participants will still be female.  It is fantastic to see it in the primary school fives, which involves fourth, fifth and sixth classes in primary schools throughout the country getting their day out in the Aviva Stadium.  It is a brilliant day when they come up.  It is not graded.  Schools play based on enrolment figures so it is not the case that a big school will get there ahead of a small school.  The competitions are based on enrolment.  I have mentioned the 43% female participation and the challenge for us is to try to keep this percentage the whole way up, including at board level and having female coaches, referees and administrators.</p></speech>

If I go to the AGM and want to ask about the &euro;100,000, I cannot do so.  I cannot ask about governance.  I am getting to the point of accountability.  All of the young people who play the sport have been mentioned and this is fantastic.  Hundreds of thousands of people play the sport every day and every week, their families are dedicated and the children just love it.  We all know this and we love to see them participating.  They will have no money in the next tranche because the FAI has not satisfied Sport Ireland on its governance.</p><p>The children which Mr. Conway rightly talks about are being deprived of the support we want to give them as taxpayers.  What is the FAI going to do about it and what governance changes is it going to bring about?  He spoke about 2020-21 but who would have anything to do with an organisation that the State refuses to fund on governance grounds?</p></speech>

If it was me, I would say it was always a short-term loan.  In his statement of 5 May, he said concerns were expressed that some press releases did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000.  People on the board did not know about it and this is the ethical issue at the core of the problem.  Notwithstanding the finances we have here, I ask whether I would want my children to get involved tomorrow.  People want real change and I cannot overemphasise that.</p> <p>  Would it help to build confidence if the FAI commissioned an independent forensic audit of the organisation?

I referred to Miriam Malone a minute ago who moved on to Paralympics Ireland and we had another number of senior executives, who I can name if the Senator wants, who have moved on.  Sarah O'Shea is with Olympic Federation of Ireland and has a sports consultancy company.  Peter Sherrard is the CEO of the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  Richard Fahey is the CEO of Tennis Ireland.  Stephen Driver is head of advocacy at Ibec.  There are more.  These are people who have worked with us and moved on.  We worked out the average turnover the other day.  We have a staff of approximately 200 and we have an average turnover of just under 10%, which I understand is around the norm.</p></speech>

I go back to the Genesis report because he is quoting me.  The Genesis report arose out of Saipan and the lack of professionalism around team travel arrangements, etc.  If one takes time to read the Genesis report and go through the detail of it, one will see that the professionalisation of the association around team travel and everything associated with it has come on in leaps and bounds.  Former and current players will tell one that.</p></speech>

That is a direct quote from him.  As to the board construction, I remind the Senator that we had 23 people on the board at the time.  To reduce that down to ten required a great deal of travelling around to the grassroots.  I think Mr. Conway accompanied me.  Ultimately, it is a members' association and to reduce the board from 23 to ten, practically overnight as we did, was a well-achieved target.  I am not sure of the date, but perhaps Ms Walshe can check it for a future time.  However, I brought Genesis in subsequently and it gave the association a very strong bill of health as to how it had transformed itself.</p></speech>

I mentioned a football club.  It was reported that the club was not able to access its entire prize funds from being involved in European competitions.  In December 2010, I understand that Sporting Fingal faced the prospect of leaving players unpaid for Christmas because of the FAI's refusal to pass on the UEFA prize money that was due.  My question is for Mr. Murray.  Is it fair to say that withholding prize money is a systematic approach within the FAI meant to relieve cashflow pressures?</p></speech>

The one thing which is of great concern to all of us is the temporary withdrawal of funding to the association pending the three reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.  All I would say about that matters is that any person who has ever been involved in any type of business, regardless of whether it is trading with &euro;50 million or &euro;50,000 a year, has dealt with different problems at various times.  If we looked back on the way that we dealt with those problems maybe we would not have dealt with them in the smartest of ways.  Hindsight is of great benefit to all of us.  I have no doubt that if Mr. Delaney had his time back, perhaps this whole issue would have been dealt with a different way.  However, I am quite confident that the only thing Mr. Delaney could be accused of is being passionately committed to his job and to the survival of what I would call the business and that all he was trying to do was good.  Of course, there has to be proper governance, there have to be proper accountancy practices but I really cannot for the life of me see how the three reports will not be positive in their findings, thereby allowing for the funding to be restored.  The president was questioned about Mr. Delaney's suitability to be the executive vice president of the association.  Mr. Delaney's work ethic over the years will show that he is eminently qualified and most definitely the best-qualified person for this new role that has been created for continuity and for dealing with FIFA and UEFA.</p> <p>  It would be very remiss of me not to mention what I know first hand, particularly as we are hearing a lot of other stuff today.   I want to remember what Mr. Delaney has done for the association throughout the country.  In every club from the grassroots up, locally and nationally - and on the international scene - Mr. Delaney's personal reputation is, in my humble opinion, second to none.  People can look-----</p></speech>

At the end of the month, Mr. Delaney is to come to Castleilsand AFC to open the new George O'Callaghan Park.  People in the area have been waiting for the facility for 45 years.  What I am reliably told is that if it was not for John Delaney and the FAI, the park would not be opening at the end of this month.  Mr. Delaney will be most welcome to Kerry.  He will get what I would call the mother of all welcomes when he comes to Kerry because his reputation and his respectability will precede him.  We will be there to welcome him.</p> <p>  When it comes to accountancy practices, many of us who are in business have to do certain things at certain times.

The responsibility has been taken away from the treasurer and has been extended to the board as a whole.  Why was that rule change made?</p></speech>

It is a significant rule.  It is stated on page 11 of the report that the council may fill any casual vacancy, as well as the offices of president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer and auditors, in accordance with the rules.  It states the council elects the vice-president but does not state it elects the executive vice-president.  It indicates there will be a splitting of the CEO's responsibilities but does not define what they will be.  While there is an outline, it is not defined.  If this organisation is a members' association, as we were told, its members seem to be largely excluded.</p></speech>

To return to my earlier question, in 2015, the association had an overdraft facility of at least &euro;1.9 million.  Although we are not sure of the limit, we know from the accounts that there was a facility of &euro;1.9 million.  Bank of Ireland is listed as the banking partner in those accounts.

This is their opportunity to start that process.  Even if they have no time for members gathered today, they can speak to their patrons who are watching in, with huge interest in what is going on here.  However, since this morning, they have been evasive, vague, non-committal and ambiguous in their replies.  They have chosen to answer what they wish to answer.  For example, there was a question on the severance package which Mr. Conway chose to answer because it suited him to do so.  When I asked about a pension, however, he slapped the question down and stated that he was not in a position to answer because of the contractual arrangement involved.  He was hiding behind the Grant Thornton and the Mazars reports.  Can he be honest and upfront with the general public, who have a right to know about corporate governance in the FAI?</p></speech>

I did not come here with the attitude that I do not care what members of this committee think, and nor did my colleagues.  What we can and cannot answer will be guided by the advice we have been given.  We all know there are areas into which we cannot stray.  If there is a question about contracts, employees, something that is commercially sensitive or an individual creditor, I have no option of answering the question, even if the Deputy calls this being evasive.</p></speech>

Up until last week, five of the 11 board members were also members of the board at that time.  The board should be acutely aware of its responsibilities as board members.  Seven of the current board members have 103 years' service in total.  The perception outside here is that the board is a cartel and that it is closing ranks and is not being honest and open with the public.  On page 14 of his statement, Mr. Conway indicates that the new CEO would not be part of the board, in line with best practice.  If it is best practice for the new CEO not to be a board member, why was it not best practice for the old CEO?</p><p>The Genesis report was published in 2002.  We adopted many of its recommendations and set about speaking to the members of the wider football family in respect of their implementation.  We changed the board from 23 members to ten and we changed our standing committees.  At that stage, we felt that the former CEO had been a key part in moving the Genesis report.  As the former CEO outlined, I was part of the team that went around on a consultation exercise to ensure the implementation of the Genesis report.  At that time, we felt that it served us best to have the CEO as a member of the board.</p></speech>

If the board reports to the CEO, how can it hold the CEO to account, given that the CEO is at the same level as the other members of the board?</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly said, the CEO reports to the board.  That is how it was.</p> <p>  That view of corporate governance is different now and we are heeding that.  The advice we were given was that the acting CEO, the incoming CEO and the executive vice president, who is the former CEO, should not be members of the board.</p></speech>

We were told: "The FAI has a governance group, chaired by a woman and an outside person to look constantly at governance within the organisation."  Does Mr. Conway think that governance was constantly under review, and that best corporate governance has always been practised during both his time as a board member and, more specifically, as chairman of the board?</p></speech>

In respect of corporate governance, we are talking about a sporting organisation that is a members' organisation, as members rightly noted.  Following the Genesis report, we evolved with board members coming through the grassroots.  We have very much a representative model.  Different parts of the game felt they needed representation on each of our key committees.  That was how it evolved.</p> <p>  On how I came to the board, every two years, I had to go for election to the key particular committee of which I was chair.  I had first to be nominated to that committee by my affiliate and thereafter the 12 members of the committee had to agree on me as chairperson, which is what brought me to the board.  That was the model of governance in place.  When we undertake our review, we will examine whether that is appropriate for the FAI going forward.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the governance code is of relatively recent origin.  I do not say corporate governance was invented only two years ago but the new governance code is of relatively recent origin.  We will be fully observant of that code.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Sport Ireland have reacted positively to the changes we made at an extraordinary general meeting in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.905" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019041000002#FFF01800"><p>Most people would acknowledge that the code of corporate governance that Sport Ireland laid down for implementation in 2021 is intended for voluntary organisations, such as a local boxing or athletics club.  The FAI, however, is a professional body.  It employs professional people and has a turnover of &euro;50 million per annum.  It is not a local voluntary organisation.  As a consequence, it has responsibility under company law to carry out corporate governance.  Does Mr. Conway not accept that?</p></speech>

We will comply with that and we have begun taking steps to do so.  By the time we are due to be fully compliant with it, we will be.  By that stage, however, I hope that we may have moved further on the composition of the board and on broader aspects of corporate governance.</p></speech>

Another sporting organisation, the then Olympic Council of Ireland, has previously appeared before this committee.  At that time, Sport Ireland suspended its funding and did not restore it until there was a change of personnel and the configuration of the board.  If that is a requirement, will Mr. Conway and his fellow board members stand down to protect important activities, including in participation in school football and education, that is, what Sport Ireland's funding is spent on?</p></speech>

That is where I have invested 35 or 40 years as a volunteer.  A number of processes are ongoing and we will not disregard their outcomes.</p></speech>

As an observation, I think the former CEO of the FAI, Mr. John Delaney, has behaved disgracefully today.  He came in with a last minute statement.  He knows the procedures for this committee.  He has furnished us with a statement but is refusing to answer any questions on that statement.  He is also refusing to answer questions that are ongoing in respect of his time as CEO.  What has been going on here has been an absolute disgrace and farcical.  The only good thing is that the public have witnessed these events first-hand as well.  I would have thought that anybody would have been glad to be handed the opportunity to put the record straight.  Mr. Delaney, however, has not taken up that opportunity.</p></speech>

There are a number of accounts into which money is lodged which are not the main bank account, which is in respect of this particular &euro;100,000 loan.

There should be no issue in respect of certain creditors having their funds met because there would be money sitting in holding accounts.  For instance, prize money would be sitting in a holding account.  If a club like Cork City, which I would be involved in, asked the FAI for its prize money or the UEFA money from its European runs, that money would be transferred automatically from the European UEFA account into the main account and then transferred on.  There are some creditors in respect whom there would not be concerns if cheques were issued or outstanding to them.  Would that be a fair assessment?</p></speech>

In his opening remarks, Mr. Delaney's stated that at the meeting on 25 April 2017 between himself, Mr. Breen and Ms Tsang, concerns were raised that cheques had been written and that if they were all cashed in before the end of the week, there would be an issue in respect of sufficient funds being in the account to meet them.  I am trying to establish that there are clearly different sets of creditors.  For some creditors, for example, League of Ireland clubs that are owed prize money or UEFA money, that money is already sitting in a different account.  There would not be an issue if, say, Cork City, Dundalk, Derry City or any of those clubs requested their prize money from the FAI.  There would not be an issue because that money is sitting in a separate account.  Is it a fair assessment that there would only be certain types of creditors to whom those cheques would be written who could create a potential cashflow issue?</p></speech>

Obviously, he can choose whether or not to answer them but I find this process quite frustrating because the public certainly would have believed that the person who is most prominent and associated with the FAI would be here today answering some questions about the issues under debate.  Mr. Delaney might want to consider clearing things up.  I will start by asking him whether he thinks this is the most serious situation the FAI has been in with regard to the withdrawal of funding by Sport Ireland.  I will start with that question and follow it up.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Delaney think it is the most serious situation the FAI has been in?  If so, does he acknowledge his role in bringing about that situation?  I know he said that he will not answer questions about his time as CEO but he was the most prominent person in the organisation.  Given the lack of financial viability of the FAI, which is under this committee's remit, looking back, does Mr. Delaney think that his salary, expenses and remuneration may have played any role in that?  We are talking about 2017, which is the year in which this shortfall took place and was not reported and a loan had be acquired.  That is the same year in which the women's team went on strike or threatened to go on strike.  It joined a union.  The team was changing in toilets, sharing tracksuits, etc.  I wondered whether Mr. Delaney might want to comment on that situation.  Then I have some other questions.</p></speech>

I do not think the Chairman should be answering for Mr. Delaney.  He can decide whether he wants to answer the question.  In particular, I was drawing attention to 2017 the year when this happened and, for example, the issues that arose with the national women's team.  I also wanted to ask Mr. Delaney, who does not have to answer, whether he believes his salary, expenses and remuneration have any bearing on the association's financial sustainability or lack thereof.</p></speech>

Earlier, it was stated that when the controversy first broke the board issued a statement that the bridging loan was made in the best interests of the FAI and that "The Board of the FAI has been kept fully informed in relation to this matter at all times."  Today, the FAI told the committee that the board did not even know about this loan until March.  How was that statement issued?  Who wrote it?</p></speech>

It is a little ironic that the code of conduct was produced at a time when board members were running around with knowledge of the financial situation and did not tell the rest of the board.  A conflict of interest form was also developed at the time, according to Mr. Conway's statement.  I wish to ask about conflicts of interest on the FAI board.  What sorts of conflicts of interest do board members have to declare or is the decision left to the members?  What conflicts of interest have been declared since the form was introduced?  Was the loan declared as a conflict of interest?  Has Mr. Delaney declared any other potential conflicts of interest to the board?  This relates to governance which is in the committee's remit.

The former financial director has business dealings in property with Mr. Delaney, for instance.  Does Mr. Conway not see any potential conflicts of interest there?</p></speech>

We have introduced under 13s, under 15s, under 17s, under 19s, and the elite player pathway for the best young players in the country, who are all now playing for the 20 clubs or the four entities outside them such as the Mayo league, the Kerry league, the Cavan-Monaghan league or whatever.  I do not want to give the wrong impression about a player.  I never believed in the old model of exporting them and saying "To hell with the consequences".  The best young players now will move through the ranks of our League of Ireland clubs.  There is a &euro;60 million spend in the pipeline for infrastructure in League of Ireland clubs and this highlights the key role of public funding.  The single biggest part of that is the development at Dalymount Park, which will transform the quarter in which it is located.  There are others and we work with the relevant agencies to effect and promote such projects with local authorities or central Government so that we get a stream of money into the League of Ireland.</p></speech>

I come from a League of Ireland background and that is nothing to do with my role as CEO.  My dad was chairman of Waterford United when they won the cup in 1980, having not won it since 1937.  Every Sunday morning from when I was eight years old and living in Tipperary town, my dad would drive Al Finucane and Richie Hall, who were from Limerick but who played for Waterford, to places like Milltown, Flower Lodge and Kilcohan Park.  I understand the League of Ireland intimately and it is part of my personal DNA, through my father and my own personal involvement as secretary of Waterford United Football Club.  My love for the League of Ireland stands on my record.  Mr. Gavin can talk about the improvements we have made in the League of Ireland.</p></speech>

There was agreement between the clubs and the FAI for the FAI to run it.  I have since that time been the director of the league and director of competitions.  We can clearly see that the league is now in a better place than it was then.  The clubs are stable, up to a point, but as they are individual businesses, they decide who to sign.  Their performances on the field have been particularly good in Europe.  Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers and Cork have shown it and many clubs are doing much better now.  There are healthy attendances, and this season our attendances in the Premier Division have increased by nearly 24% this year.  There are many full-time clubs in the Premier Division.</p> <p>  As our president mentioned, we have introduced underage national leagues.  These are for players under 19, under 17, under 15 and under 13, and they have been very positive not only for the players, as there is an elite player pathway, but the communities the clubs are in.  More people are feeling an affiliation to a club at all levels.  Going to matches, there are visibly more families and children, with bigger attendances and great football being played.  The work done by clubs and people at the coalface in this area is tremendous and they really have come on leaps and bounds over the past few years.  It is really difficult to run a League of Ireland club but the majority of clubs have excelled.  We can see the proof today on a Friday night or a Saturday in Sligo.</p></speech>

They may not make it by the time they get to 18 and at that stage they would not have proper education.  When they return home they are more or less left in a heap.  That could have an effect on their mental health.  Should the FAI not do more for those kinds of people?  We were proud to send them across the channel but when they return, they are forgotten about.  Issues arise as in an academy education may not even be a second or third thought.  These people may end up with no career.</p></speech>

I was lucky enough as we had a family business and I went into it.  I had a career in the League of Ireland.  Now the League of Ireland is a great platform for those kids to reinvent themselves mentally, physically and as players.  Many of our clubs are now linked to third level education and other education pathways so if those kids do not make it in football, they have an opportunity to become much more rounded individuals and make a life outside football.  There are only so many kids who can make it.  The clubs are very focused on education; education and sport is a great mix and clubs are now embracing that.</p></speech>

I can only talk about the past and the delegation's time here.  It is quite frustrating for me and others, I am sure, as so many people are here who had different roles until recently.  We are barred from asking pretty relevant and important questions in that regard.  I made a note when Mr. Conway spoke about restoring confidence and we are collectively responsible in that regard.  A first class FAI board and organisation is so important for our country.</p> <p>  I have another question which requires a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Was there a time when any board member was concerned about the going concern of the business?  I do not know if the witnesses understand what I mean by "going concern".  Going concern is a legal requirement and if there are any issues about going concern, a certain process must take place and it could end up in the winding up of the business.  From the deliberations of the witnesses and others, it seems this &euro;100,000 was vital to keeping the organisation afloat.  If it is down to &euro;100,000, going concern would be a big issue for me.  There is no reference in the 2017 relating to going concern.  An auditor would have to qualify the accounts if there was a concern about going concern.  If the organisation is down to &euro;100,000 with &euro;50 million of a turnover, I would be worried.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  As a general point unrelated to any particular individual, it is a very good thing for Ireland, with a population of 4.5 million, to have a representative on the board of UEFA, regardless of who that person is.  Some countries with populations of 40 million, 50 million or 60 million people do not have a representative on the board of UEFA.</p></speech>

Deputy Rock raised a very specific point about it being signed off by the board and then sent, but there was a delay and there it seems to have been edited.  Mr. Conway made the point that there was a technical edit.  Many documents presented to the committee have undergone significant editing between the draft and final versions.  I ask the association to send the committee the draft and final versions of the governance review.  I have not finished my questioning; I am asking whether the committee will be provided with those documents.</p></speech>

By way of example, the committee previously held meetings in regard to the coastguard.  Under freedom of information, we requested the original draft of a report and compared it with the one presented to a Minister.  Everything that was harmful to the people before the committee had been removed from the latter version.  We are talking about establishing credibility and confidence.  I am concerned by this matter raised by another member.  Is the association prepared to provide the committee with the original draft report by Jonathan Hall Associates?</p> <p>  Did the other 12 available accounts cumulatively contain &euro;100,000?  The FAI seems to have been anticipating a bill of &euro;100,000.  The bill was expected.  For how long did the association know the &euro;100,000 was hanging over it and that it did not have the money to meet the debt?  What was the bill for?  I know the witnesses will not tell us to whom it was payable.  Did it relate to infrastructure?  Was it money due to a club?  Was it to pay staff wages or expenses?  A bill of &euro;100,000 is not an everyday occurrence.  The association knew for a long time that it was coming, but it did not seem to have &euro;100,000 in the other 12 accounts, seek an overdraft or ring anybody to ask that the bill payment be delayed.  It seems to have been an outstanding bill.  For how long was it outstanding?  For how long did the association know it was coming?  How long did it have to pay the bill?</p> <p>  The statement made earlier outlined that Grant Thornton had sight of this.  I am not an accountant, but the phraseology used would not be used by accountants.  It stated that all cheques issued in the week 28 April 2017 were cashed and presented at the time.  It is not just cheques - much of the money dispersed by the FAI would be sent via bank transfer and so on.  I do not understand how Grant Thornton would have signed off on that.  If this matter was coming to the committee this morning and it had sight of it, it would have pointed out that it is not the phraseology it would have used because in the modern world such firms do not say, "We draw down cheques" or "cheques presented".  My concern is that the FAI had a significant amount of money in other accounts but it does not appear to have added up to &euro;100,000 or was earmarked for other commitments.  For how long was the &euro;100,000 owed?  How long did the FAI have to pay it?  For what was the bill?  Was it related to infrastructure or a bill from a contractor or club or money due to a competition?  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien alluded to that issue.  For what was the money owed?</p></speech>

For how long was it legally obliged to pay it?  The cheque was made available by the former CEO and lodged, ready to be used if it came down.

We have asked many technical questions.  Some answers have been given and some cannot be given.  We are unhappy in certain ways.</p> <p>  I will come at this matter from a different angle.  Last week, Mr. John Treacy was asked to answer "Yes" or "No" on the question of whether he had confidence in the FAI board.  He said he would not say "Yes".  It was not a good day last week.  He also said that, over the past decade, the FAI has been audited by Sport Ireland's independent auditors on more occasions than any sporting organisation.  Independent audits of the FAI were completed on Sport Ireland's behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, with all the findings reported to Sport Ireland's audit and risk committee.  I know the FAI is a very large organisation that gets huge money but why has the FAI been audited on more occasions than any other sporting organisations?  Is there a reason for it?</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned that we had audits in 2010, 2014, 2016 and we are due an audit this year.  I really do not know how much that is out of step with other sporting bodies.  We have made it clear today that we seek the first tranche of money early each year.  Programmes are in place.  It is difficult for me to answer the question of why Sport Ireland would do that.  We may have supplied the audits and the outcome of those audits do not trigger any significant concern on the part of Sport Ireland.  We may not be very out of step with other sporting bodies but I do not know.</p></speech>

If the issue with the &euro;100,000 happened again tomorrow, would it be addressed differently or how would the FAI go about that instead of getting an individual loan that has caused much of this confusion?</p></speech>

I went to my first Republic of Ireland game over 40 years ago.  I ran a double-decker bus to Germany in 1988.  I am a member of the soccer fraternity.  I have served as secretary of my local soccer club and I was treasurer of the Roscommon district league 30 years ago.  I welcomed the recommendations of the Genesis report because, at the time, the FAI was not fit for purpose.  The association has made huge inroads in the past number of years, notwithstanding the selling of Glenmalure Park in the 1980s.  I will not get into that now but it caused major damage to the FAI among the general public.  That is another day's work.  We can consider the &euro;100,000 loan and the hasty restructuring of the top level of management in the FAI.  At least it looks hasty.  We can also consider the financial health of the organisation while FAI staff take pay cuts.  Sport Ireland has suspended funding, which is bad news.</p> <p>  When the Republic of Ireland team is going well, everybody asks why we do not have an all-island soccer team and people say it would be great.  If I were involved with the Irish Football Association, IFA, which oversees the Northern Ireland soccer team, I would be asking if it would really want to join forces with the FAI, particularly in view of all the bad news that is coming out.  I am smiling to myself because what happened in 2016 was wonderful.  Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland supporters were together on the streets in Paris and around France.  We have come a long way in the past 20 years.  It may be tongue-in-cheek but we have all-island hockey and rugby teams.  In 1924, there was an all-island soccer team that was headquartered in Belfast.  Maybe after today we should look for the establishment of an all-island soccer team.  Perhaps the FAI should move in with the IFA instead of the other way around.  The all-island soccer team could play in Belfast.  This matter has been very damaging to the idea of having an all-island soccer team.  I hope we can come out of this in a much better way.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work done by Mr. Delaney, his family and everybody here.  I was a teacher like Mr. Conway.  All my life, I knew fantastic kids who worked hard in school and played hard to get on teams.  Dave Colgan, a former teacher and lovely man, devoted his life to the sport.  Every day of his life, he worked for sport, for soccer.</p></speech>

I have their names listed here.  I will say their names because it is important to me.  Nicky Colgan, Gary Kelly and Ian Harte were all reared by Dave and people like him.  Right around the country, all those young people who succeed locally, regionally and nationally are driven by people like Dave.  The point I am making relates to the point I made earlier, that is, that the corporate governance in Mr. Conway's organisation is totally inadequate, and that is why it is not getting the funding.  The regime change I am talking about is what people need.  They need it, and need it now.  If they do not get it, the association will be in a serious crisis.  I am concerned because the sponsors and public are looking at this.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  To ensure certainty, the best thing the board members could do is move on.  If they did so and new people came in, the association could turn around.  Consider how the Olympic Council of Ireland changed.  I am aware that individuals will make sacrifices if they make a decision to move on but it is needed.  That is the impression I am getting from everybody.  We have to talk to the rest of the people.  I appreciate there is not much time left.  The picture in my mind is of all the young people going out to play this evening and on Saturday.  Their parents accompany them, drive them, buy them football boots and go through the tough life of a parent looking after young children.  That is the message I have to give the delegates from the people who talk to me.  I appreciate their listening to me.</p> <p>  There are 15 minutes left.  I want to make another couple of points.  I acknowledge there are others who wish to contribute but I am doing my very best.  We have been here for nine hours and the delegates have been here for eight.  I understand that and I  want to be fair to everybody.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien had a question that was not answered.  It is not that it was not answered purposely.  It was on whether the &euro;100,000 was mentioned in the monthly financial accounts.  Do we have the answer to that?</p></speech>

Concern was expressed over the suspension of Sport Ireland funding.  As the Chairman will be aware, the sports capital grants are currently being processed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am getting calls from some small soccer clubs around Cork asking whether their applications could be jeopardised.</p> <p>  Mr. Delaney was in Cork in December 2016.  A memorandum of understanding was agreed between the FAI and Cork County Council for the development of a centre of excellence, an FAI academy for youth in the greater Munster area, on lands outside Glanmire in Cork city.  The closing date for the large-scale sports infrastructure fund is 17 April.  I am concerned that the dispute between the FAI and Sport Ireland could have an impact on the application.  Is the application ready to go?  The matter is creating plenty of publicity down my way.</p></speech>

It seems very unusual for an accounting practice.</p> <p>  The financial controller is going to send us the terms of credit for the &euro;100,000, including the date by which it was to be paid back.  Given that the witnesses were raising this as part of what we were talking about today and given the very specific references to dates, I am surprised they do not know when they were supposed to have the &euro;100,000 paid back.  They are not willing to tell us what category it fell under, broad and all as it is.  I cannot see an answer as breaching data protection guidelines in any shape or form.  For how long did the witnesses know the &euro;100,000 was coming over the horizon and going to affect cash flow?  As outlined, there are 24 accounts, 11 of which are for specific funding projects and structures.  There are 13 others.  Of these, everything is paid out of one.  The witnesses cannot tell the committee how much money was in the other 12 in the specific month or week in question.</p></speech>

I hope journalists and the general public take note of how toothless the Parliament has become because of legal threats.</p> <p>  The board was fooled or misled by a number of people on it who never told it about these transactions and the shortfall.  Sport Ireland also had information hidden from it by the FAI.  On being asked, it was told all was well in 2017.</p> <p>  The board has moved Mr. Delaney aside.  Owing to his connection to UEFA, it is willing to keep him and has created a role solely for one person.  Nobody else need apply.  It is a position that is still quite well paid.  As I stated, the pay is similar to the prize-money for the entire Irish league.</p></speech>

Are all of the bank accounts audited as part of FAI's financial returns or is it just the main bank account?</p></speech>

Mr. Delaney said in his statement that he issued a personal check.  If so, I presume it was in his name.  We know it did not go into the main bank account because he said it could not.  It went into a different bank account.  Maybe Mr. Delaney can tell us what bank account it went into.  It went into one bank account and the money was transferred to the main bank account and then it was paid to the creditor.  There is obviously a cheque stub somewhere in the name of Mr. Delaney.</p></speech>

I presume that, as part of the auditing process, the cheque stub was handed over to the auditors, who would have been aware that there was a loan from Mr. Delaney.  I presume the money paid back to Mr. Delaney in June came from the main bank account, so there would be a corresponding cheque stub for the payment to Mr. Delaney.  Did the cheque stubs form part of the audits in 2017?  Would that information have been given to the auditors?  Everything is handed over, including receipts.</p></speech>

In making that remark, I do not in any sense underestimate the responsibilities we have as a body that receives public funding.  I ask the committee to be under no illusion about the fact that we take these responsibilities very seriously.  Among the many things that have been said today, the question of how we go about looking at the issue of governance is one that we take very seriously.</p></speech>
