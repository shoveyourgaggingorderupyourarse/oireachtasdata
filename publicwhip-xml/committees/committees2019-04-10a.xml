I gather Dr. Martina Lawless who co-authored the research is, unfortunately, unable to attend the hearing, the purpose of which is to examine the detailed analysis of the impact on Ireland of the different types of Brexit.  The ESRI and the Department of Finance recently published the detailed analysis.  The committee's focus is on the budgetary and fiscal impact of Brexit.  Given ongoing events at Westminster, it is timely that we are discussing this topic, although that could probably have been said on any day in the past few weeks.  I am grateful to the director of the ESRI, Professor Alan Barrett, for facilitating our request for a meeting on this important research.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I thank Dr. Bergin for attending and invite her to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Adele Bergin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041000002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to the ESRI to appear before the select committee.  I am joined by my colleague Dr. Kieran McQuinn who is head of economics at the ESRI.  We have been asked to discuss a recent paper entitled, Ireland and Brexit: Modelling the Impact of Deal and No-Deal Scenarios, which was published in the spring 2019 quarterly economic commentary.  The paper attempts to quantify the macroeconomic impact of Brexit on the economy.  I will start by summarising the range of scenarios considered and then outline some of the key findings for the macroeconomy, trade, the labour market, households and the public finances.</p> <p>  Owing to the current heightened political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, we consider a range of Brexit scenarios.  We also acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding any assessment of the economic impact of Brexit, as there is no precedent for a country leaving a major and closely integrated trading bloc such as the European Union.  The paper considers three scenarios which we describe as deal, no-deal and disorderly no-deal.  To estimate the economic impact of each scenario, we compare them to a counterfactual scenario where the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.  In the deal scenario the United Kingdom makes an orderly agreed exit from the European Union.  This involves a transition period to the end of 2020 and a free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU 27 being in place thereafter.  In the no-deal scenario the United Kingdom exits the European Union without a deal, but there is an orderly period of adjustment for trade.  Ultimately, World Trade Organization tariff arrangements will apply to goods trade, there will be non-tariff measures and the services trade will also be negatively impacted on.  In the disorderly no-deal scenario the United Kingdom exits the European Union without a deal and there is additional disruption to trade in the short run, above that considered in the no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  Our analysis focuses on the best understood channels through which Brexit will affect Ireland, namely, though lower trade, incorporating the impact of tariff and non-tariff measures and the potentially positive impact of foreign direct investment diversion to Ireland.  Our approach is to build estimates for each of these channels from a range of recent Brexit microeconomic studies; therefore, our estimates are anchored in empirical literature.  We use these microestimates to calibrate macroeconomic scenarios.  Specifically, we generate alternative paths for the UK and international economy using the national institute global econometric model, NiGEM, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in the United Kingdom and assess the impact on Ireland using the ESRI's core structural model, COSMO, macroeconometric model.  The impact of each Brexit scenario is considerable and will have negative effects on the macroeconomy and throughout the economy on trade, the labour market, the household sector and the public finances.  I will briefly outline the key impacts for each of them.</p> <p>  The macroeconomic effects of Brexit are significant and negative for the economy.  We find that GDP, the level of output in Ireland, in the longer term could be approximately 2.6% lower in a deal scenario, 4.8% lower in a no-deal scenario and 5% lower in a disorderly no-deal scenario, compared to a situation where the United Kingdom stays in the European Union.  While some of the effects may not appear substantial, it has to be borne in mind that the impacts will cumulate over a long period of time.  In each scenario the level of Irish output is below where it otherwise would be.  The negative impact on Irish output in the long run in the deal scenario is approximately half that in the no-deal scenario.  Although these are substantial relative reductions in the level of output in the long run, the economy will continue to grow but at a slower pace as a consequence of Brexit.  If we assume the economy would grow by an average of 3% per annum in the long run if the United Kingdom were to stay in the European Union, the impact of Brexit is roughly equivalent to a 0.3% reduction in the long-run growth rate in the deal scenario and around 0.6% in the long-run growth rate in the no-deal and disorderly no-deal scenarios.</p> <p>  There is more uncertainty surrounding the short-run impact of Brexit as it depends on how smooth any transition to the future arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union is.  Our results suggest that, by 2020, the level of real output in the economy could be approximately 0.6%, 1.2% and 2.4% lower in the deal, no-deal and disorderly no-deal scenarios, respectively.  These results are compared to a situation where the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.</p><p>On trade, our results also indicate that firms will be negatively affected as a result of Brexit.  The negative trade shock will reduce the demand for Irish exports and Irish firms will be affected by the depreciation in sterling, which will reduce our competitiveness.  Our results indicate that exports, in the long run, will be 4.6% lower in a deal scenario, 8.1% lower in a no-deal scenario and 8.3% lower in a disorderly no-deal scenario, compared with a situation where the UK stays in the EU.</p><p> On the labour market, lower output in the long run, compared with a situation where the UK remains in the EU, will result in lower labour demand, which has knock-on impacts for employment and the unemployment rate.  Our results indicate that employment, in the long run, would be 1.8% lower in a deal scenario, 3.2% lower in a no-deal scenario and 3.4% lower in a disorderly no-deal scenario, compared with a situation where the UK stays in the EU.  This represents around 40,000 fewer jobs created in the long run in a deal scenario and around 80,000 fewer jobs created in the long run in the two no-deal scenarios.  Again, it is important to state that employment will continue to grow in each scenario but at a slower pace than compared with a situation where the UK remains in the EU.  In the long run, the unemployment rate is 1% higher in the deal scenario and roughly 2% higher in the two no-deal scenarios, compared with a situation where the UK stays in the EU. </p><p> For households, the impact of Brexit will be severe.  Our results indicate that real personal disposable income, in the long run, would be 2.2% lower in a deal scenario, 3.9% lower in a no-deal scenario and 4.1% lower in a disorderly no-deal scenario, compared with a situation where the UK stays in the EU.  This is driven by lower employment, lower wages and higher prices.  As a result, consumption will be lower in the long run.  Furthermore, households will face higher prices as a result of the imposition of tariffs or other increases in trading costs that could be passed on as increased prices for Irish consumers.</p><p> On public finances, with both output and employment below where they otherwise would have been in the absence of Brexit, Government revenue from taxes will be lower and the increase in the unemployment rate would lead to higher Government spending on welfare payments.  The net effect is a deterioration in the general government balance, GGB, as a percentage of GDP.  In the long run this could reduce the GGB by around 0.5% in a deal scenario and by around 0.9% in a no-deal and disorderly no-deal scenario.  We have also looked at the short-term forecasts for the public finances from the spring 2019 quarterly economy commentary, QEC, and have examined the implications of Brexit for the public finances in the short run.  The short-term forecasts for the public finances in the recent QEC are done on the basis of a no-Brexit scenario.  They show a deficit on the GGB of 0.3% of GDP in 2019 and a deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2020.  This is equivalent to &euro;900 million in 2019 and &euro;1.5 billion in 2020.  Our results suggest that for 2019, the impact of our deal and no-deal scenario is more limited on the GGB.  However, the deficit on the GGB could be 0.2% higher, which is roughly &euro;700 million in the case of a disorderly no-deal scenario.  In 2020, the deficit on the GGB could be around 0.1% higher in our deal or no-deal scenarios, which is equivalent to &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million, respectively, and 0.3% higher, or &euro;1.1 billion, in the disorderly no-deal scenario.  In each of these scenarios, we assume there is no explicit fiscal policy response to the change in the economic environment.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  My colleague and I would be delighted to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041000002#D00300"><p>I thank Dr. Bergin for her opening statement.  Brexit obviously poses one of the most significant challenges and threats to our economy that I will probably ever see in my lifetime and certainly for many years.  Dr. Bergin speaks about three different scenarios.  Can she explain what she means by a managed no-deal scenario because my understanding is that this is not actually on the table.  It is either a deal or it is no deal and the transition period to 2020 is contingent on a deal being ratified.  Consequently, why did the ESRI choose to explore a scenario that the European Union has ruled out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Adele Bergin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041000002#D00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  Let me try to clarify this.  We know that in the long run, the relationship between the UK and the EU will change and as a result we know that the level of output in the Irish economy will be below where it otherwise would have been.  When we think about a no-deal scenario, there is more uncertainty around the potential short-run impact of Brexit.  We do not know whether the adjustment to this new relationship will be more sudden or more gradual.  We can also imagine a situation where there could be additional disruption in the short run, which is what we have done in our disorderly no-deal scenario.  The fact that we have called it a no-deal scenario where we have suggested that there will be a more orderly period of adjustment for trade is not assigning it to a particular scenario to which the EU or anyone has or has not agreed.  It is more saying that the adjustment to the long run will be more gradual.  What we are also trying to do in terms of having a disorderly no-deal scenario is to allow for the fact that there could be additional disruption in the short run.  We felt that we had to consider a range of different scenarios to try to capture what may actually happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041000002#D00800"><p>That was my point.  I will run through my questions all together, that might be a bit easier.  The Parliamentary Budget Office issued a report not so long ago highlighting the fact that the Government's budget planning was based on the central case, namely, that the UK would remain within the European Union, and it did not really account for the possibility of a no-deal, cliff-edge scenario.  The question that we would have put to the Minister for Finance in this committee on several occasions was whether budget 2019 was sufficient to deal with a no-deal scenario, given that all the projections were based on there being a deal or an orderly exit.  The response from the Minister has always been that the budget that was carried out for 2019 is fine, it is sufficient and there will be no need for a supplementary budget.  Would the ESRI share the view of the Minister on that?</p> <p>  What impact will the Brexit process, whether it is a deal scenario or a no-deal scenario, have on budget 2020?  That is the next budget and we will obviously be considering that post the summer recess.</p> <p>  On the three scenarios that the ESRI has looked at, did it analyse the impact of Brexit on the regions?  My area is the north west, and my concern which is shared by many others in that region, is on the particular impact on tourism and agrifood, which are probably our two biggest economic drivers in that region.</p> <p>  In the ESRI's view, is the Government doing all that it can to prepare for Brexit?  Is the ESRI satisfied that the financial planning being carried out by the Department is sufficient?  Are we prepared as best we can be?</p> <p>  Dr. Bergin touched slightly on the one little positive from Brexit, namely, the potential increase in foreign direct investment, FDI.  What are the ESRI's short-term projections for an increase in FDI?  In the medium to long term, we might be looking at an increase when the UK has fully exited but in the short term, does the ESRI see that as being part of the buffer that might protect the country and offset some of the damage across other sectors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041000002#D00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  They are greatly relevant.  On the 2019 budget, it is interesting that the Deputy would ask that question because we release a commentary just before each budget and we are obviously thinking about the kind of stance that we would suggest and recommend to Government.  If the Deputy recalls, in the autumn of last year there were some calls among commentators, which were perfectly legitimate in many respects, for a contractionary budget.  The feeling was that the economy was overheating and that a lot of pressure was growing in the economy etc.</p><p>Our reflection on that at the time was that it was still optimal for the Government to pursue what we called a neutral policy.  This was basically a policy that would neither stimulate the economy nor be contractionary.  We offered two reasons for that.  One was that we took the view there was a real danger of a no-deal Brexit outcome and that the economy would be hit by a substantial economic shock as a result.  Moreover, we took the view that if we were to implement a contractionary budgetary policy at the same time we would effectively be compounding the adverse shock that would result.  The other reason was that there was still a need to continue investment in key resources, especially in the housing area, for example.  That is what we suggested.</p><p> In broad terms most commentators would probably have taken the view that the 2019 budget was not neutral and that if anything, it was slightly on the stimulatory side.  Overall, the implications for the public finances that Dr. Bergin outlined under an adverse case clearly show a significant potential increase in the deficit.  That is obviously something that one would be slightly concerned about.  In particular, we should be mindful of the fact that the budgetary position last year was somewhat massaged by bumper corporation tax receipts.  As committee members probably know, corporation tax receipts went up by over 20% last year even though the Department of Finance only expected them to increase by 4%.  The headline position or surplus recorded last year was not truly reflective of the underlying position.  That is reflected in our forecast for this year and next year.  We believe there will be a return to the deficit.</p><p> The bottom line is that while there is a deterioration under the adverse case, I still reckon it is within the broad budgetary parameters.  Personally, I do not believe there is a need at this stage for a supplementary budget.  I believe there is a case for the Government to pursue, at the least, a neutral policy.  I would not say it should be explicitly counter-cyclical in terms of increasing expenditure to offset the impact but I would not go to the other extreme either, which would be to suggest that we should have implemented a contractionary policy to offset overheating pressures.  In broad terms, I do not really think we need a supplementary budget, even under these circumstances.  Obviously, we need to keep an eye on the situation.  In particular, we need to keep an eye on the revenue side and what happens to key taxation aggregates like corporation tax, which recorded substantial increases last year.</p><p> Reference was made to the regional aspect.  Dr. Bergin should feel free to come in on this point.  I was not directly involved in the work Dr. Bergin did but it was beneficial in several respects because it used the standard tools we use in the institute, including the big macro model that can feed in many of the outside shocks that will come about due to Brexit.  It also leveraged off the micro work we have been doing in the institute.  My colleague, Dr. Martina Lawless, has done a good deal of micro-level work looking at sectoral issues.  In fact she has published several papers on the issue.  Her analysis has emphasised the regional dimension to the issue.  In particular, she has looked at the sectors that would be most impacted.  As we all know at this stage, agriculture and the related food processing sector, as well as tourism, are the sectors that could be particularly impacted.  Obviously these sectors have a specific regional imprint.  One interesting aspect of her work was that from a regional perspective, we all think of the Border area as being an area that clearly would be particularly impacted.  Her analysis also suggested, however, that certain parts of Munster that are heavily reliant on agricultural income as a main source of income could be particularly impacted as well.  We could have potentially a broad spread in terms of the impact.</p><p> We have done a good deal of work in looking at Brexit and the housing market.  We see a broad regional spread in terms of the implications.  Clearly for areas outside Dublin, and to a lesser extent outside Cork and Limerick, adverse implications arise for the housing market.  In Dublin we can see an increase in demand for housing if we have large numbers of people coming to work.  As I said, we have done a good deal of work looking at the regional aspects.  Certainly, these are things of which we were mindful in the analysis we have conducted.</p></speech>

She asked how prepared we are for Brexit.  To be honest, that is a really tough question to answer.  The Government has released various documents on its planning and there has been a widespread information campaign but we do not really know exactly what is going on behind the scenes.  It is incredibly challenging for firms and for everyone in general to prepare for something when we do not know what kind of Brexit we will have.  As of right now, we cannot even tell people when exactly it will happen.  Even if six months ago we had known it was to be the bad case of a no-deal scenario we could have intensified planning during the subsequent six months.  Really, the only thing that firms, the Government and everyone can do is to plan for the worst but hope for the best.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked about foreign direct investment.  Under our deal scenario, we assume that the positive impact from foreign direct investment would begin at the end of the transition period, which is not until the end of 2020.  In the two no-deal scenarios, we envisage the impact beginning straight away.  Again, it is important to state that the overall negative coming from the trade shock far outweighs any positive on the foreign direct investment side.</p></speech>

In employment terms and in terms of higher prices and so on across the board, households will really struggle.  Does that make the case that we possibly need the support of the European Union and that we should look for more significant social transfers and other supports to try to help families?  Obviously households, especially those where no one is working, will be in the most vulnerable situation.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  Are the ESRI representatives being too sanguine about all of this?  As we seem to get closer to Brexit - we could still be talking about Friday - the forecasts seem to be getting scarier.  Does the ESRI COSMO model include different inputs as we get closer?  For example, we all noted the possibility of the euro and sterling moving to parity and the impact that would have on tourism and our agriculture industry.  Is it the case that as we get closer and begin to realise the profound implications, especially if we do not get the supports we need from the European Union, that things are getting more uncertain?  Is it possible to input those issues into the model the ESRI is using?</p> <p>  The ESRI representatives said there are no comparable models.  If we go back a little further are there not models?  I am unsure whether any research has been done.  It may be more a matter for our historian colleagues rather than the economists.  What about when we left the British Empire?  What about where states have severed, for example, the Czechs and the Slovaks?  Is there anything in the literature about that or about where a state left a trading bloc and what the implications were?</p></speech>

I will refer back to some previous work done by my colleague, Dr. Martina Lawless.  She looked at the impact on household expenditure and household budgets.  She examined the likely increase in prices households would face.  Again, quite detailed work was carried out to look at the impact.  It is significant if we look at the overall impact.  She referenced a range of potentially &euro;900 to &euro;1,400 being added to the typical budget because of higher import prices.  She looked at the various sectors of the economy that were likely to have World Trade Organisation tariffs applied and then at the knock-on impacts on the average household spend domestically as a result.  Those are substantial increases.</p><p>Many of those increases tend to hit families at the lower end of the distribution because of their disproportionate reliance on products that potentially will have tariffs applied to them.  There is no doubt they can be quite significant at a micro level in terms of the household implications.</p><p> On the issue of obtaining additional transfers from Europe, the only point I would make is that we could be victims of our own success if the performance of the Irish economy over the past four to five years is looked at.  The fact is we have had very substantial growth rates, albeit from a low base and after the financial crisis.  From a negotiating point of view one could see a difficulty in convincing European partners that we need to get additional social transfers when our economy has been growing at between three and five times the rate of the average European economy over the period.  That certainly could be an issue.  Obviously, if we reach a situation where we have a very dramatic impact on households, maybe that could be looked at.</p><p> In terms of being sanguine about all of this, there is always a danger with models.  There are limitations to them.  In particular in the context of the present study, it is very difficult to get a handle on a country in a relatively unprecedented situation of removing itself from a trading union, as is the proposed case.  Dr. Bergin can talk about this herself but she and her colleagues have done a lot of stress testing of the model to see, for instance, what kind of trade effect there would need to be to have an impact on headline GDP such as we saw after the financial crisis.  There would need to be a massive trade impact for the economy to collapse pretty much in the way it did in the period of 2008 to 2009 when the credit bubble collapsed.  I take the Deputy's point that there is always a danger we can be a bit sanguine about this, but there has been a fair amount of stress testing and analysis done to underpin the analysis.</p></speech>

In this paper we focus on the main channels through which Brexit will impact on Ireland, such as through lower trade and a small positive from foreign direct investment, FDI.  On some of the other factors, which the Deputy mentioned, such as exchange rates, we do factor in significant depreciation for sterling.  In our disorderly scenario, sterling could be around 95p in the short run in 2019-2020, but that could involve sterling going to parity for a short period.</p> <p>  In the paper, we have looked at the generally accepted channels through which Brexit will impact on Ireland, and there is some consensus around that.  The other thing we did that is quite important is we drew on a lot of other evidence, particularly, as Dr. McQuinn has mentioned, a lot of other microeconomic evidence to try to get a handle on whether it could be higher or lower, to make sure that we were using the best possible evidence, and we used that then to generate our scenarios.  It is our considered view of the most likely impact of Brexit on Ireland.  As both Dr. McQuinn and myself have pointed out, there is a lot of uncertainty around these estimates.  We simply do not have prior good examples.  There have been examples of countries breaking up, but there are no recent example of countries leaving such a deep and closely integrated bloc like the EU that we have been able to draw on.  There is arguably even more uncertainty around the short run estimates.  Again, because we just do not know, there is no consensus on whether any adjustment would be more sudden or gradual in the new relationship between the UK and the EU.  One of the reasons, in addition to all of that uncertainty, some of the short-term forecasts are being revised downwards is because we seem to be in this wait-and-see period.  Firms, potentially, are delaying investment decisions and so on because they are waiting to see what the outcome of this could be.</p></speech>

We have not done enough empirical analysis yet but the decline in consumer sentiment domestically seems very much to be almost directly linked to when there was heightened reference to no deal as far as this issue is concerned.  If consumer sentiment is trending downwards to the extent that it is, that almost inevitably has a knock-on impact on consumption.  Brexit is already impacting on the domestic economy.</p></speech>

Deputy Chambers asked about different regions.  How would different sectors be impacted, negatively or positively?</p> <p>  Without in any way underestimating the difficulties all of this poses, and I imagine that the sectors that have been mentioned, agrifood and tourism, are likely to take a particular hit, if sterling falls, obviously that makes our exports to Britain more expensive and is likely to hit such exports.  To what extent may that be mitigated by cheaper imports of certain things and potential boosts in terms of the costs of production for certain industries that rely heavily on British imports?  Has that been factored in, or the balance of certain things becoming more expensive but other things becoming cheaper, even household goods?  I believe we import around the same amount of food and drink as we export to Britain.  The delegation can probably tell me more about that.  Is that factored in when trying to work out what the impact might be of the costs of things and how that might impact on households, employment and the costs of production for industry?</p></speech>

To give a very brief overview, the way that we have looked at Brexit over recent years is to take initially the large-scale macro model that is very highly aggregated.  Then there have been a series of micro level analyses produced using more micro level data, drilling down into the sectoral issues, the issues the Deputy is talking about, the sectors of the economy that would be most impacted in terms of imports, exports, the potential for World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs being applied to specific sectors in the UK economy, and the resulting impact on imports and exports in an Irish context as a result of that.  The other piece of work that I referred to by my colleague, Ms Martina Lawless, looked at detailed, standard, nationally representative household expenditure levels and the impact of Brexit on that, the impact of tariffs being applied to certain products, and the implications for household budgets as a result of that.  In that, we can do the mean and the average but we can also look at the distributional effects in terms of which households are most impacted by that.  We have had that analysis, and then in the recent analysis we have gone back to the large-scale macro models so we can factor in the trade issues between the UK and Ireland, the UK and Europe and Europe and Ireland, etc., while also aggregating up from some of the micro level work.  That is feeding into the current analysis in a number of different ways  As to the Deputy's question about how granular the analysis is, this analysis has fed off a lot of very granular pieces of work that have been done using firm level data and household level data specifically to address the questions referred to.</p></speech>

At the same time, on imports, we have to take into account that there will be tariff and non-tariff measures taken which may lead to potential disruptions to the supply chain which is likely to outweigh anything on the exchange rate side.  Many of our exporting SMEs are exporting primarily to the UK.  The UK is also a really important source of intermediate goods used in the later stages of production.  Any disruption to that supply chain is likely to mean costs that are much more substantial than the problems caused by currency fluctuation.</p></speech>

To a certain extent that can mitigate the overall impact on GDP.  If the exports come down the GDP will be dragged down, but if imports go down it will keep the GDP reasonably high.  There is an offset there, but it is more within the granular level in terms of sectors of the economy affected.  As Dr. Bergin noted, most exporting SMEs trade with the UK.  The agrifood sector, the food processing sector and the tourism sector will be affected but there are significant regional differences in terms of the reliance of the economy of those sectors.  That is where the real story lies, in many ways.</p></speech>

The ESRI's outlook is more modest compared with some other outlooks such as, for example, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  Can the witnesses explain this to us?  What, in their view, are the mitigating factors explaining the more modest assessment presented by the ESRI?  Is it based solely the foreign direct investment, FDI, diversion, or are there other components that allow them to suggest a more modest outcome?</p></speech>

They are all consistent in that they all find a significant negative impact for Ireland.  Taking the disorderly no-deal scenario, the level of output is estimated to be around 5% lower that what it otherwise would have been in the long run.  A study from the OECD last year has estimated the long-run impact in a disorderly scenario at around 2.5%.  The Central Bank has estimated that output will be 6% lower in the long run.  There are other estimates out there.  We are somewhere within the range of estimates.  I do not have the details of what exactly the Central Bank did, but I imagine it estimated a slightly more negative trade shock, which led to its finding of minus 6% in the long run compared with our estimate of minus 5%.</p> <p>  In terms of differences in the short-term implications for Brexit, Dr. McQuinn heads our short-term forecasting team in the quarterly economic commentary.  Its most recent projections for 2019 to 2020 are, if Brexit does not happen, for a growth rate of 3.8% and 3.2% growth, but that falls to 1.2% and 2.4% in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  The Central Bank's estimate for the two years is probably closer to 1%.  It is quite consistent.  There is more uncertainty around the impact we will feel in the short term, and an element of judgment is built into the forecast.  I cannot speak for the Central Bank, but I suspect that it has forecast additional disruption.  </p></speech>

How likely is it that the markets have already priced this in and that the biggest disruption will be caused by a shock, an unprecedented or unexpected event?  Given that there has been a long lead-in to a possible no-deal Brexit, is it possible that the shock has already been factored in?  Is it a factor in the assessment provided by the witnesses?</p></speech>

They are very attentive to that type of issue, and in fact build in risk in anticipation of events.  In terms of the impacts on the real economy, I refer again to the points I made about things such as the consumer sentiment index and a related index on investment, the savings and investment index.  Both of those indices, particularly the consumer sentiment index, have been trending down quite markedly since the midpoint of last year.  Clearly the heightened references and the growing attention being paid to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and its increased possibility certainly has had a negative and adverse impact already on consumption behaviour in the domestic economy and on investment decisions.  Part of the issue in the case of the Irish economy is that because the economy has been growing so strongly over the past couple of years, we perhaps have not detected the impact Brexit has already had.  I would argue that it is there already, and that its impact can already be felt.</p> <p>  Financial markets would be able to factor in the impact of a no-deal Brexit, so that would mitigate or restrict the possibility of a really sharp financial sector shock.  However, the analysis shows that Brexit clearly will be felt most in the real economy.  </p></speech>

That is not the case.  This has been presented as being as big as the banking crash, but it does not fall into the ha'penny place when compared to what happened when previous Governments drove the economy off the cliff.  I say that to put some context on Brexit as compared with the type of crash we experienced ten years ago.</p> <p>  One of the significant headline figures in the report was the impact this might have on potential job growth and job losses.  It was suggested that there would be 80,000 fewer jobs in the economy if there was a no-deal Brexit.  What factors led the witnesses to revise that figure upwards from 55,000 to 80,000?  The previous estimate was 55,000, I believe. </p> <p>  There was discussion about the sectors, including the agrifood sector among others.  I have not been able to get a copy of Edgar Morgenroth's report but I believe he has done some drilling down on the question of the impact on production and manufacturing jobs in particular regions.  I note my native county of Donegal is already experiencing an impact on jobs as a result of Brexit.  Contracts are being lost in my home parish and lay-offs are taking place.  That is not isolated to one area but is happening across the board.  In Killybegs the quota of fish has been caught and the factories are idle.  People are being laid off because the companies are not sure whether they can catch the quota after Brexit.  It is having a huge impact.  Can the witnesses talk about the regional impact of Brexit in terms of jobs?  </p> <p>  A no-deal scenario is expected to lead to higher prices for export goods, but also a higher cost in terms of production internally.  Do the witnesses foresee a significant impact on inflation as a result of Brexit?</p><p>The ESRI forecasts a potential gain of &euro;26 billion in foreign direct investment, FDI, and almost 8% of that overspill is as a result of Britain.  Will the witnesses walk us through the type of FDI they expect?  Are we seeing the signs of that spillover already flowing into Ireland?  If that is the case, what is the scale of it?</p></speech>

Brexit will affect the trade channel so, in the modelling exercise, we asked what trade shock would be needed to get to a collapse in the economy on the scale we saw after 2008.  The answer is that it would need to be huge.  Both exports and imports would be impacted so there would not be quite the same impact.  If exports fall, GDP falls, but if imports also fall, GDP goes up.  The 2008 crash was completely different because there was a massive credit bubble, and once that burst, there was an overwhelming collapse because the construction sector had seeped into all aspects of the economy.  There was a collapse in GDP and in tax revenues etc.  I do not think it will be like that but the credit collapse was over a relatively short time of between three or four years, while Brexit could impact the economy over a lifetime.  There will be missed opportunities and the accumulated impact could be the same in the long run.  There would be a more persistent loss to the economy over a longer period of time than the short sharp and really bad hit we took after 2008 or 2009.</p> <p>  Edgar Morgenroth and Martina Lawless did some work on regional issues.  I agree that agriculture, agrifood, tourism and related sectors could be impacted, but the research pointed out that agriculture did not just impact the Border regions.  The Munster area is very heavily reliant on agriculture, with a very strong dairy sector, while other parts of the country are very reliant on the beef sector and could also be heavily impacted by Brexit.  There could be significant differences and Dublin may, on aggregate, do okay after Brexit, especially if FDI comes in and there is a lot of disruption to the financial sector in London leading to relocation to Dublin.</p></speech>

The last study we did was right after the UK referendum and, since then, there has been a huge amount of research on Brexit and we have drawn on that.  We now have a better understanding of the way Brexit will impact the economy.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about FDI.  Most of the work done on Brexit has been done in the UK and there is consensus in research circles in the UK that, as a result of Brexit, it will lose around one quarter of its FDI over the long term.  In this paper we have tried to find out in what sectors the UK would be likely to lose investment.  Ireland is already a very attractive destination for FDI, so if the UK experiences losses, it is a plausible assumption that Ireland will get some of it on the basis of its current share of FDI within the EU.  The UK is expected to lose in the areas of computers, electronics, optical products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and these are some of the sectors in which we think Ireland could gain, along with the financial intermediation sector.  The Deputy asked if there was any evidence of this so far.  I am not aware of any but there have been reports that people have made applications in this regard, especially in the financial sector.</p></speech>

Did the ESRI have a look at the likely impact on Northern Ireland?  I know the institute is not responsible for Northern Ireland but interactions among the Border counties, on both sides of the Border, are very intense.  Will the witnesses cast any light on how bad the impact might be?  A lot of business people in the North are very scared, as are the trade unions.</p> <p>  Many small firms appear to be completely at sea.  My background is as an accountant and people are constantly asking me what I think they will have to do.  I explain that, in a small agribusiness firm of between three and five people, there is likely to be an extra set of tax returns or the equivalent.  In that context, I was a bit surprised at an answer I received from the Minister for Finance the week before last to the effect that there are only 210 Revenue staff in the southern Border counties who work as Customs and Excise or compliance people.  We have heard repeatedly about the 400 to 600 people being recruited, but did anybody ask the ESRI to look at what Revenue is saying will happen?  Nobody wants checks on the Border and they could perhaps be done some distance away.  How will we actively get ready for Brexit and advise people what they have to do?  The knowledge gap for small businesses close to the Border, on either side, is very intense.</p> <p>  There has been a very big fall-off in hotel bookings from Britain, particularly along the Border.  Does the ESRI have any way of monitoring that?  People are working very hard to make up for the lack of bookings by using other sources.  Does the ESRI have any information or intelligence on this?</p> <p>  How low is sterling likely to go?</p><p>Newspapers such as the <i>Financial Times </i>have been constantly surprised that, perhaps because people have been stocking up on goods, the UK economy has not fallen that much.  Have the witnesses looked at that and whether it will fall back if the deed actually happens?  Of the alternatives to the withdrawal agreement, what would have the least impact on Ireland, for example, the combination of the Single Market, customs union and other things?  We may have to find language, as has been done in many other agreements, that sets it out in a slightly different format.</p></speech>

I will begin and my colleague, Dr. McQuinn, might comment at various places.  In terms of the best outcome for Ireland, it is that the UK would stay in the EU.  After that, the next best outcome for Ireland is whatever keeps the United Kingdom as closely aligned as possible to the EU.  The current withdrawal agreement does allow for a customs union and a free trade agreement as well.  Whatever language is used, and I know different types of things have been proposed in the United Kingdom in recent weeks, the best one for Ireland is the one that keeps the UK as closely aligned as possible to the EU.</p> <p>  On the question of sterling, we have a figure for a depreciation in sterling of around 7% in the long run in our two no-deal scenarios and around half that rate in the deal scenario.  That puts sterling in the worst case scenario at 95p to the euro, but in the very short run one could imagine that it could go to parity.</p> <p>  Most of the work on Brexit that refers to the UK does not really distinguish between Northern Ireland and so on-----</p></speech>

At least in our case, we were still going to be members of the European Union after all this settled down, whereas Northern Ireland, which has a very heavy reliance on agrifood, as we know, was facing not only all of the uncertainties that we were facing into but also being left in the situation potentially of not being a member of the European Union.  We all know the substantial level of payments that come from the Common Agricultural Policy, and these are very important, particularly in rural areas.  There is great uncertainty about what would happen to those kinds of payments if Northern Ireland, as well as the rest of the UK, were to leave the European Union.  As an economy in its own terms, it would be especially impacted, even compared with ourselves.</p> <p>  Our former colleague, John FitzGerald, has done some work looking at the nature of the all Ireland economy, and I believe he gave a presentation on it before Christmas.  He pointed to the fact that Northern Ireland's performance in general, not just in terms of Brexit and its impact, has not been exactly stellar in the past 20 years.  He pointed out that despite the fact that there have been significant transfers under the Good Friday Agreement etc, there has not been a significant improvement in the underlying performance of the economy there.  That also goes towards another point about the UK and the argument that the UK economy has not fallen that much.  Looking at the underlying situation in the UK, however, it is quite worrying.  They have had a productivity problem in the UK for some years that has predated Brexit, and all the signs are that Brexit, if it does go ahead, would only exacerbate those kinds of issues.  We would be particularly concerned about the outcome of Brexit as far as Northern Ireland's economy is concerned and the knock-on effect on the overall economy of the island of Ireland because of the increasingly integrated nature across the Border.  It is a real concern.</p> <p>  On some of the Deputy's more specific points, some of the most micro level information we have is the sentiment indicators that we talked about: the consumer sentiment indicators and the investment indicators.  We do not have that level of granularity in terms of looking at individual sectors, such as hotel bookings and things like that.  They all inevitably feed in to some of the sentiment indicators.  As I said, certainly on the consumer sentiment but also on the investment sentiment, it is clear that there has been a downward trajectory in those indicators in the past six or seven months.  In particular in the case of consumer sentiment, it is quite a sharp decline.</p></speech>

The Institute of Technology Sligo is a higher education provider which develops and delivers programmes of learning to over 6,500 students at undergraduate, masters, and doctorate level.  It is a leader in online learning, is research active across all areas and has, at its core, a focus on the development of its region and its citizens.  The department of social sciences in IT Sligo is one of the largest departments in the institute.  It caters for the learning needs of over 650 students at undergraduate and postgraduate level.  In 2015, the team and I carried out a review of our regional educational and employment needs.  From this review, we developed and sought validation for a number of awards at undergraduate and postgraduate level, inclusive of a masters in social work.</p><p>The masters of arts in social work award is the first social work award to be delivered in an institute of technology.  The award has been developed in response to student requests for this award within the north-west region, a national shortage of social workers, a number of policy documents which advocate widening access in education, and the need to meet an employment and skills shortage.</p><p> As members will be aware, there are waiting lists for social worker expertise across all service areas, including the areas of children and young people and care of the elderly and the disability sector.  This is even after a sustained recruitment and retention drive across all these sectors.  The reality exists that this is set to continue as the demand for social workers is not being met by the supply of graduates and the retention of social workers within specific posts is acknowledged as challenging.  Consequently, a large number of vacancies remain unfilled across all sectors. </p><p> The Institute of Technology Sligo and the department of social sciences is reflective of the non-traditional higher education space.  Our students are often the first generation to access higher education within their families and many are in receipt of grant funding.  Students who begin their studies in our department work very hard throughout programmes and graduate with qualifications that support them to attain better life opportunities and outcomes for themselves, their families, and the communities in which they work and live.  However, because of the institute's lack of provision within specific learning spaces, we were concerned that we were contributing to inequity of access to in-demand learning opportunities for our student cohort.  In 2016, we made the decision to address this through the introduction of this award.</p><p> The programme team and I began the work in 2016 and, in 2018, we sought and secured, under delegated authority, QQI level 9 validation for a two year full-time award in social work.  In September 2018, the programme commenced with a small cohort of ambitious and excited students.  They are currently on their first professional learning placement.</p><p> As this is a new departure for the institute of technology sector, it raised some questions about whether we should be delivering in this field.  The answer to this question is that social work is a regulated profession under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and, consequently, all programmes must be reviewed by the professional regulator, CORU.  The masters in social work has made an application to CORU and we will be reviewed by our professional regulator in autumn of this year.</p><p> There are a small number of challenges when developing and implementing a social work award.  They are not insurmountable but are worth noting as we try to work collectively to resolve the ongoing issues of social work recruitment and retention.  Among the challenges, educational providers are dependent on the goodwill of services to accept and supervise students for professional placement learning opportunities.  It is a significant challenge to secure even a small number of placements and this is prohibiting increasing our student numbers.  Students on newly developed professional regulated programmes commence without the assurance that the programme will be successful as part of the validation process.  This has a personal and financial risk for potential students and impacts on the numbers applying and the numbers we recruit.  Any changes to the offering of an approved programme, for example a move from a full-time to a part-time delivery model, requires a new validation process.  If one of the offerings is unsuccessful both may be affected by this.  This is because the specific award title, that is, the masters of arts in social work, and the academic institute is recorded on the approved qualifications by-law.  As is normal for all students who wish to return to full-time studies, there are cost implications both in terms of fees and maintenance.  Students who were in employment in the previous year may be above the threshold of grant funding for the first year, hence the financial burden is increased for that year.  The suggestion to introduce funded bursaries would be welcomed, provided it would not impact on a student securing grant funding.</p><p> While recruitment is one part of the social work shortage puzzle, retention is the other.  This was discussed by the Irish Association of Social Workers at a meeting of the joint committee last month.  We support suggestions put forward by our colleagues and reiterate the importance of quality supervision, streamlining of work practices, and manageable caseloads as key factors in any successful retention strategy.  We add that recruitment and retention strategies need to co-exist as one impacts directly on the other.</p><p> In conclusion, we acknowledge that this is a complex, multifactorial problem and that any sustainable resolution will require many different and inter-related strategies.  The team and I had, and have, a responsibility to our potential students and our region to provide appropriate education and learning opportunities, to the required standard, in an area where employment needs exist.  Social work is one of these areas.  We welcome the opportunity to be part of any resolution strategy.</p></speech>

I am director of the masters of social work programme in UCC  I am joined by Professor Michelle Norris, professor of social work and head of the school of social work, social policy, and social justice in UCD, and by Professor Robbie Gilligan, professor of social work and social policy in TCD.  We welcome the opportunity to present to the committee on this important matter.  We have circulated a discussion document, which was the result of a collaboration between all four universities that currently provide accredited social work programmes - UCD, TCD, NUIG and UCC.</p> <p>  In light of the time allocated to us this morning, we have prepared a short statement, which is an abbreviation of the discussion document the committee has received.  Our opening statement focuses primarily on social work education in Ireland and the supply of graduates.  We identify and set out proposals for addressing the main barriers to increasing the numbers of places on our current professional social work programmes.  These are the availability and organisation of student practice fieldwork placements and the funding needs of students.  </p> <p>  Collectively, the four universities provide two undergraduate degrees and four postgraduate degrees in social work.  The two undergraduate programmes are provided by UCC and TCD and a masters degree in social work is provided by each of the four universities represented here  These programmes are all accredited by CORU, the regulatory body for health and social care professionals.  For the information of the committee, social work education involves both academic training in the university and carefully planned intensive fieldwork practice training.  In all, 50% of social work students' time is spent on fieldwork placement with the remaining 50% spent in academic study.  As can be imagined, placements are, therefore, a critical component of all social work education.  </p> <p>  In this presentation we will first address the matter of professional education and the supply of graduates.  Irish universities graduate approximately 210 professionally qualified social workers per annum.  These are highly valued in the profession, as is reflected in their high employability rates nationally and internationally.  The universities acknowledge the current demands on Tusla in the area of the recruitment and retention of social workers.  As university providers of social work education, we would like the committee to know that we are committed to engaging with all social work employers, including Tusla, towards resolving the recruitment and retention challenges represented to this committee.  </p> <p>  However, universities also face significant challenges in addressing the problems experienced in this area.  One of the major challenges we face is undoubtedly access to high-quality social work placements that will accommodate our current student numbers.  These placements form an essential element of social work training and strict standards are set by CORU regarding training requirements for placement supervisors.  While we have been attempting to address the problems of placement provision for some time, more recently all universities have been engaged in collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs towards developing a strategy to address these challenges in supply.  </p> <p>  While we are open to increasing our intake of social work students with a view to creating a sustainable supply of new graduates, any expansion is predicated on an increase in both the supply and availability of high-quality student placements and new applicants to our programmes.  We have a number of suggestions with regard to achieving such an increase in the number of students on our programmes.  As I have said, students are required to undertake at least two extended unpaid work-based placements of 14 weeks' duration in the course of their professional social work training.  To pass and progress to graduation, students must successfully achieve standards of practice that meet the criteria and standards of proficiency prescribed by CORU.  It is important to note that these placements can result in students incurring significant costs in respect of travel, subsistence, and having to relocate to geographical regions in which placements are available.  Because of the substantial practice placement component of social work education, students must factor in these costs, in addition to high fees, before deciding to undertake a programme of study.  The funding issue is significant as many social work students have no access to public funding in the form of Government grants or scholarships.  Even those who qualify for some funding are not reimbursed for many of the additional costs incurred during the course of their training.  </p> <p>  As we have noted, key to any expansion of student numbers and, by implication, of student graduates is an increase in the number of student placements.  This will require employers to address a number of current barriers to placement availability.  These barriers include limited office accommodation, lack of structures or support for placement supervisors, large caseloads, the availability of sufficient numbers of placement supervisors who meet CORU standards, and the development of continuing professional development initiatives that respond to the ongoing training and development needs of qualified social workers, who are the supervisors of our students.  In responding to the placement challenges previously identified, the universities recognise that there is a need for the development of diverse and creative approaches to student placements.  These include the development of high-quality, long-arm supervision across a variety of agencies, the development of practice learning units, the establishment of specialist clinical supervision posts, and the promotion of lead specialist practice learning teams.  Many of these initiatives have been in operation in the past and we are considering their reintroduction.</p><p>We suggest that a commitment to embedding practice placement supervision in social work employment contracts is required of employers, as was originally envisaged with the creation of the senior practitioner role in the HSE and Tusla.  Relationships between the universities and social work employers and placement providers also need to be formalised into memoranda of understanding.  These would include protocols for the sharing of sensitive data on student performance, which are necessary to conform to data protection legislation.</p><p> In addition to considering matters relating to placement expansion, we are also considering diverse approaches to social work education.  As university educators of social workers for more than eight decades, we are committed to exploring new models of social work training that increase the supply of social workers.  Discussions are under way with CORU to explore options that comply with its accreditation requirements.  Because social workers practice in demanding health and social care contexts that require a significant period of education, skills development and professional development, our opinion is that social work education cannot be fast-tracked.  Regardless of the model adopted, it must equate to existing accredited programmes in terms of the time devoted to the professional formation of social workers.</p><p> In summary, we recognise that there may be many innovative ways to deliver social work programmes, which will require forward planning and development with all the parties concerned.  The universities have previously demonstrated a commitment to engaging with employers in developing innovative accredited social work programmes.  For example, UCD modified aspects of its MSW provision to accommodate needs in the Probation Service.  UCC established an undergraduate social work degree, the BSW, for mature student entry, to increase the diversification of applicants for social work education.  Trinity College Dublin and NUIG have also developed their masters degrees in response to the increasing demands of employers. </p><p> We believe that university providers of social work education have a good record of collaborating with employing organisations towards achieving change.  Previously we have collaborated with the Department of Health, which provided resources in the late 1990s that led to the doubling of student numbers on our programmes.  In addition, social work programmes have been proactive in revisiting and expanding their academic and practice curricula in response to changing demands from practice.  These developments have equipped newly qualified social workers to engage more effectively with the social changes faced by service users.  </p><p> Regarding the recruitment and retention of social workers in child protection and welfare, we fully recognise the importance of serving the recruitment needs of Tusla as well as other employers of social workers.  We believe that an important consideration in the recruitment of high-calibre candidates is the need for public education campaigns to promote social work career choices, aimed both at school leavers and more mature applicants who are considering a career change.  The focus of this committee's work has been on child protection and welfare social work and while we appreciate that Tusla is the largest employer of social workers in Ireland, there are other significant employers such as the HSE, the Probation Service, wider disability services and the civil society sector.  These employers all have an important role to play in responding to the needs of vulnerable service users outside of the child protection and welfare sector.  In considering our submission document, therefore, we respectfully request that the committee seeks to avoid any unintended consequences for the wider labour market for social workers and for social work education, which has a responsibility to serve all parts of the profession equally and has served it for many years.  </p><p> While increasing the supply of social work graduates is necessary, we propose that issues of staff retention cannot be addressed solely by increasing supply.  We need to find ways to retain and care for existing child protection and welfare social workers.  We know from what social workers on the ground tell us that their decisions to leave child protection and welfare social work are due to factors such as the incessant and rapid pace of organisational change, excessive workloads and insufficient staff supports and supervision.  While child protection and welfare social work can be rewarding, stimulating and important work it is also challenging, as the committee will know.  There is significant international literature outlining the impact of social work on social workers.  To promote retention, social workers who undertake this work require a high level of staff welfare, early career support measures, structured induction programmes, protected caseloads and professional supervision to mitigate the impact of the work.</p><p> As social work educators we want the committee to know that we are ready and willing to play our part in increasing the supply of qualified CORU-accredited professional social workers.  To progress towards the expansion of student numbers we suggest establishing campaigns to promote social work as a career choice; increasing the supply of placements in conjunction with Tusla and other employers; establishing a bursary scheme, including fees and placement costs, to attract high-calibre candidates to social work degrees; and providing support structures that give due recognition to the particular challenges experienced by child protection and welfare social workers, as previously mentioned.</p><p> We would like to thank the committee for the time given to hearing our submission and we invite any questions its members might have.</p></speech>

I appreciate both opening statements.  They will be very helpful in the completion of our report on this matter, which we hope to produce relatively soon.  Before I invite Senator Freeman to begin her questions I will make a number of points which could offer a little bit of clarity.  I struggled to get to grips with the reasons for difficulties in securing placements.  Both the witnesses referenced certain commitments that need to be made by other bodies.  Could they put some additional information on that on the record?</p> <p>  Are educational facilities at capacity in terms of demand, as opposed to the ability to cater for more students?  Do the facilities have sufficient capacity so that whatever applicants come from leaving certificate level and other age levels can start?</p></speech>

For instance, UCD provides degrees in nursing, medicine and social work.  St. Vincent's University Hospital is part of the university and the placement part of the degree is automatically provided for nursing colleagues.  However many hundreds of placements they require are automatically provided.  They can be guaranteed.  We start from a position of zero placements every year in the social work school.  We have 50 students on our two-year programme each year, 100 students in total.  This year we had to make arrangements with 141 individual social workers to place those 100 students.  We contact individual social workers and conclude agreements with them to take a student on placement.  Placements are not provided to us centrally by the employers.  Tusla has a total of three liaison people who will help us in various parts of the country, but there are no guaranteed placements.</p> <p>  Some of those arrangements break down.  We find that the breakdown rate of arrangements is particularly high in areas such as child protection in Tusla because of the turnover of staff and the degree of pressure.  We then have to secure more placements.  We have a couple of concerns about this.  If we register a student on our social work degree we are contractually obliged to deliver that programme, including the two placements.  Unless we can be sure of placements we have concerns about taking in students.  Our experience in the Dublin region in recent years shows that delivering more placements is very challenging.  We find it particularly difficult for students who need to repeat a placement.  On occasions in recent years we have had to approach more than 100 social workers to place a repeat student.  </p> <p>  Moreover, we do not have a formal relationship with the employer organisation.  This has raised concerns around the general data protection regulation, GDPR, because we may need to share sensitive information about the student that is relevant to their performance on the placement.  That is anomalous within these professions.  The HSE has moved to address this for radiographers.  If this was done in social work, it would have a transformative impact on the sector.</p></speech>

At that meeting colleagues from the HSE raised the issue that this was also a barrier in some of the health professions and that they have moved to try to regularise these arrangements.  We also have concerns about the impact of this on the student experience.  I acknowledge the social workers who take our students on placement and provide a super service and are very committed to what we call practice teaching, in other words, supporting students' learning on placement.  Because the student does not have a formal role in the organisation it can mean there is an uneven experience in terms of having office space etc.  Students are often required to travel for work.  They take on a proportion of a qualified social worker's caseload and are expected to manage that so they are required to use their car.  They are not able to claim expenses for mileage.  Most of our students are young people and for students in full-time education, these issues can be quite significant barriers.  The placement issue is a critical one for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Robbie Gilligan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019041000002#F00200"><p>To add to what my colleagues said, the issue of capacity in the employer system to take on students is a critical part of the whole jigsaw.  When we approach agencies that take our students we find they often say they do not have desk space, they do not have spare capacity and they are short of staff who can take on supervision responsibilities for the students.  I am not saying that as a criticism.  These are the realities with which we are dealing.  We need to view this in quite a systemic way.  There needs to be investment in the infrastructure.  Physical space in many cases is a barrier.  These agencies cannot accommodate additional students because they have been hiring additional staff who have filled any space that was there to be filled in office accommodation.  This may appear to be a small matter but these are the practical barriers of which we want the committee to be aware.  Another issue is the staff time involved.  Student supervision and support and learning requires staff time.   It must be seen as something that must be invested in.  If we are to increase the capacity for training across the system we must invest in the infrastructure in terms of staff support and physical space.  These are practical but crucial issues that make the difference in whether we find placements for our students and where we find them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Breda McTaggart" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019041000002#F00300"><p>I concur with everything my colleagues said.  We have only a small cohort this year.  The reason we cannot increase the number is that we get one placement in every three agencies we contact.  They are enthusiastic.  They have been nothing but supportive in the north west but the reality is that they cannot take the students on placement and it is usually related to the work caseload.  My colleague looks after that activity.  There is a genuine interest and a commitment but they simply do not have the capacity to do it within their teams at this time.  There is clear guidance on what kind of person can look after a student on placement and how long they have to be in post, so it is self-perpetuating, it goes around and around.  I come from the nursing profession.  We never had this problem because there were designated learning and teaching spaces.  Apart from the practice teachers, as Professor Norris rightly said, there is no requirement and it is done on the basis of voluntary capacity.  I can speak about what happens in the north west, and they are doing their best to try to accommodate us but they cannot do so.  I confirm and support what my colleagues said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Carmel Halton" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019041000002#F00400"><p>I would add that the more recent challenge in acquiring placements in Tusla relate to issues around retention and the moving of people around different areas.  A requirement of CORU is that people are in their jobs for at least 12 months.  Therefore, they cannot take on a student until they have been in the job for 12 months.  An important element of practice placement is the child protection and welfare field.  However, when people are moving around and being promoted - as it is a relatively new organisation there is quite a degree of movement - it means people who previously would have taken students, and are committed to it, cannot do so for a time.  Therefore, there are periods when we cannot get placements with people.</p></speech>

They gave us such an enormous amount of information that I am completely and utterly confused, baffled and amazed at all that is going on for them.  I will simplify it for my sake by asking a few questions.  There seem to be two issues.  One relates to the educational social workers.  I do not know if the universities have a problem attracting new careers in social work.  One issue is the educational element and the witnesses spoke about placements.  The Chairman asked a few questions that I intended to ask but I will broaden one of them.  Dr. Halton mentioned the issue of high quality placements.  I would like to know what she means by high quality in that sense.  Dr. McTaggart said that out of every three requests that are made only one placement is secured.  Are the universities scraping the barrel at times because they are not getting any placements?</p> <p>  Who is responsible for this area?  Is it the HSE?  Should the witnesses be talking to people in the HSE in seeking improvement on placements and the provision of expenses for students when they have to travel.  </p> <p>  I and the other members were part of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare.  One of the biggest issues we noted was the recruitment and retention of staff, in particular psychiatric staff.  When we investigated what the problem was with recruitment, we found there was a long and ridiculously complicated process people had to go through to get the job as a psychiatric nurse or doctor.  I would like to know the process involved in this context.  Who is responsible for it?  Those applying to be psychiatric nurses and doctors had to take 42 steps before they could even get to the interview stage.  I would like to know about the high quality placements, the step by step process involved in recruitment and what was the other issue I wished to ask about----- </p></speech>

All supervisors must have training and qualification in supervision.  The Senator will recall what Professor Norris said.  We have always had a tradition in the universities of going directly to practice educators, to supervisors and to social workers and asking them to take our students on placement.  Now we have to make sure they comply with all the regulations - which is a good thing, we are not saying it is a bad thing, that they are registered social workers with CORU, that they have training and education in the supervision of students and that they are in post for at least a year.  That is what we mean by high calibre in that there are regulations associated with the recruitment of people to do this really important work</p></speech>

For example, we do not have national data - none that I can find anyhow - on where social workers are actually employed.  We do not have national data on projected needs of social work for employment.  Those are important planning requirements so we need a one-desk, co-ordinated approach to planning for social work across sectors because social work now spans the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Children and Youth Affairs and other Departments but there is no lead Department on that.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs might be because it is particularly concerned about the justice situation.  The best estimate we have is that Tusla hires approximately 40% of all social workers.  There are 4,500 registered social workers in the State.  We do not know how many of those are currently working.  We are not able to say exactly where they are working.  That is basic information that we need.</p></speech>

Our view is that there needs to be a co-ordinated approach, for example, when other people are paid during field work or at least have their expenses paid.  We have to look at making the pathway into social work as a career more attractive.  There needs to be public education about the value of social work as a career to society and to the individual but at the moment it is not clear who would run such a campaign.</p></speech>

I took over as the head of my school in UCD five years ago.  We had a meeting with Tusla at that stage with a view to establishing a third level liaison group.  There was a series of meetings.  The issue still was not resolved.  Since then it has become more problematic for us within the Dublin region because the availability of placements reflects the availability of social workers in the sector.</p> <p>  I used the analogy of UCD's relationship with St. Vincent's Hospital in UCD earlier so I do understand that the social work profession is more fragmented and diverse but our figures on our placements last year in UCD show that approximately 40% of them came from Tusla and another 25% came from the HSE or HSE-funded organisations.  If we could form relationships with those two major employers that would resolve many of our problems.  CORU, the regulator of qualifications, requires our students to do two placements.  We have a policy of giving them mainstream statutory placement in a major area of social work such as child protection, which many of our graduates would go into, and then perhaps a more specialist placement in an NGO or disability organisation.  If a stock of placements were provided centrally from the two major employers, we have an infrastructure for securing them within our third level institutions which we can work with.  Other organisations would provide us with smaller numbers.  The issue is the lack of certainty year on year.</p></speech>

It might take different forms but effectively a recognised formal committee or group is charged with managing the supply of a sufficient number of competent graduates to meet the workforce needs with different specialisms and so on.  Issues around data, population trends and so on are being monitored and feedback is coming back all the time on how the system is working, the adequacy of field work provision and perhaps the adequacy of the programmes being provided in the universities.  Changing social conditions may require new material to be taught and so on.  All of those conversations are taking place within some kind of a structure.  We hope something like that is emerging but one of the challenges is to make sure that the key players are around the table, that they are fully engaged and that there is a consistent push.  This issue raises its head every so often and then subsides for a while but it needs to be getting consistent and, at this stage, urgent attention.</p></speech>

My reading of it is that that is what is missing.  There is no continuum; there is no permanency.</p><p>I believe it was Dr. Halton who said that the reintroduction of what we had in the late 1990s is required.  Tusla is a new organisation that was formed long after that.  We have to go back to the service level agreement that was in place before the formation of Tusla.  That seems to be the missing piece.  When Tusla was formed certain service level agreements were not followed through on, in particular those concerning placements.  Is that a fair reading of it?  </p></speech>

The Chair asked earlier whether we are providing for the demand.  In the late 1990s, when there was a demand for social workers and we were not able to meet the demand in the educational establishments and universities, a service level agreement was put in place which worked extraordinarily well across all of the universities.</p></speech>

The service level agreement should be reintroduced, but the question of which Department it falls under and where responsibility for it will lie has not been answered yet.  It seems to me that it should fall within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but that may not necessarily be the case.  Perhaps the Department of Health or the Department of Justice and Equality could be involved, given the youth probation services are involved.  We need certainty.  If a course is being delivered everyone has to buy into it so that placements can be provided.  One cannot go from year to year wondering where his or her placements are going to be.  If I was a student I certainly would not be applying for a course if I did not know that I could get my placements from that course, and variety in those placements.</p> <p>  What is the rate of fall-off of students who go on placements?  I imagine that there is a fall-off in numbers.  Affordability is a factor.  Is it an issue?  </p></speech>

However, there is reluctance to enter into a service level agreement because of the fear that they may not be able to stand over that agreement because of staffing deficits.  Staff are moving from one Department to another, and indeed from different services.  The verbal agreements are in place, but I feel that at Government level there has to be some provision that will support us and the service providers in standing over those agreements.</p> <p>  On the finances of students and how they manage, from my point of view we kept our first cohort small because of the placements issue.  All members of the small cohort this year have come to me at some point with concerns around finance, including worries about how they will manage travelling long distances to placements or indeed relocation for placement purposes.  All of the students are very committed, and want to get the best placement opportunities they can, but finances are limiting them in terms of how far they can travel or if they are able to relocate.  It is very difficult for them.  </p></speech>

Students do not fall out of the courses because of the lack of availability of places.  We work, as Professor Norris has said, really hard to provide placements.  Once the student has registered, it is our responsibility to get placements for them.  We hold the worry, risk and uncertainty ourselves.  We employ people in our universities to find placements.  We recruit practitioners and train them <i>pro bono</i>.  We give them all kinds of continuing professional development, CPD, opportunities in response to their commitment to take our students.  We have worked over many years to build relationships with people that are responsive to their needs, as well as responsive to our need to acquire placements.</p></speech>

I did not realise how difficult it is for students to get placements.  A young lady came to me and said that she was having great difficulty in getting a placement, and I automatically said to her that she should look for a placement in Tusla.  She explained to me how difficult it is to get a placement.  We need a strong advocate to ensure that a service level agreement and the element of permanency comes back into the area.  This would not happen in nursing or teaching.  Students of those disciplines always get their placements.  We know there is a shortage in this area for social workers.  There needs to be a constant focus on this because the service is really crying out for staff.  We will not ever address retention if we are not able to secure placements.</p></speech>

The people who leave are often experienced people who would have been very good practice teachers.  Retention is a part of the whole picture, and in a way we have to recognise that there is a hole in the bucket.  People are leaving, and policies have to be put in place that improve conditions for newly qualified people.  It is really crucial that they feel well supported in the early years of their careers and therefore motivated to continue in the career.  It is an excellent career, but it is challenging.  It requires a lot of commitment and ability on the part of the workers to do the job well.  They have to be supported.  Our training provides a launch pad for them, but they also need supports after they start, and that will turn them into good practice teachers who will then take the next generation of students and train them.  This is a really important cycle that we have to look after to ensure that the next generation of trainers are there and that they are taking the next generation of students, who will be the next employees.  This all sits together; we cannot see one piece in isolation from the other pieces.</p></speech>

Is it correct to say that is one of the recommendations to emerge from this meeting?</p> <p>  How can placements be found for these students?  It is a major issue.  I do not know how anyone is able to cope given the situation with expenses.  Some people are already paying for these courses so there are large expenses involved, which does not help in attracting candidates.  On retention, do the witnesses have any ideas for changes in policies they would like to see?  As Professor Gilligan said, there is a hole in the bucket.  We have to look at this approach.  I do not know how we could carry out a public recruitment drive to bring people in unless the problem is fixed.  </p> <p>  Why are we losing social workers?  We have been told many times in this committee, and I have heard it myself outside of the Houses, that the turnover is unbelievable.  That has a knock-on effect on the children, particularly those in child protection.  What are Tusla and other agencies doing wrong?  What do we need to do to retain staff?  Organisations have appeared here and told us that some social workers have 30 cases.  Should we be thinking outside the box and looking at how things are done in other jurisdictions?  </p></speech>

I spent 12 years working in Tusla and some time in the HSE before moving to IT Sligo.</p><p>It is very challenging work, whether one works within children or adult services.  Social work is a very challenging role that requires substantial commitment and dedication from individuals.  The work has an emotional and psychological impact on individuals.  There is not enough support for that.  We have supervision in practice but it is case supervision.  From speaking to colleagues in my previous department, I know we need outside supervision.  This would be support from outside the service that we can access every six to eight weeks.  That would be a session with a psychotherapist or counsellor who understands the role of a social worker.  That is very important.</p></speech>

There is also the point about whether we can learn from good practices in other jurisdictions.  The answer is clearly "yes" and we need to do some work on that.  If there was a national forum, one of its tasks would be to identify good practice models from elsewhere in terms of early career support for new social workers.  I am aware from examples of our students or colleagues abroad that there are very well-protected caseloads in the early or first years of work with very high-quality and dedicated case supervision.  I know there are other types of supervision as well, but good quality case supervision is very important.  I discussed with a fellow professor in England the other day the very good practices in her local area, with the local equivalent of Tusla having developed a new model of close supervision of practice by social workers that has revolutionised retention rates.  It is not like things cannot make a difference.  They can but there needs to be co-ordinated and consistent effort to move in that direction across different employers.</p></speech>

Supervision is being provided.  If she goes to the employers or providers of social workers, they will say supervision is provided but the nature of the supervision is primarily in the area of management and administration, as our colleague has said.  The other aspects of the work, which are the emotional demands and complexity of the work, along with the support and additional education required to sustain oneself in a profession as complex as child protection and welfare, requires a real commitment on behalf of employers to provide the necessary and ongoing continuing professional development of, very often, young graduates.  It is also important for us to recognise the vast majority of our students who have had placements in Tusla become employed by agencies, having got the experience and seen what they are capable of doing.  We have high-quality graduates coming from our programmes.</p> <p>  From the perspective of service users, we need to deliver high-quality child protection and welfare services to vulnerable service users by sustaining a highly committed, educated, capable and competent workforce.  As our colleagues have said, structures must be put in place, including protected caseloads and a very clear induction policy.  There must be supervision that is fit for purpose and which responds to the demands and challenges of the work, attending to the emotional needs and challenges that our social workers experience on the ground.  They get it in other jurisdictions and our graduates are moving to other jurisdictions to get this.  We have many examples of where our graduates have moved and come back, telling us there is no comparison between what is on offer in other jurisdictions and here.</p></speech>

They are also going to the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.  They are internationally recognised as very highly competent graduates.  Bodies from the United Kingdom have and continue to come here to try to recruit our graduates, so they are of high standing internationally and not just nationally.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that if there is any deficit at all during the learning experience in terms of good quality supervision, it makes it more difficult to get people into very complex roles.  Anecdotally, it seems this is compounded by the fact there are many acting posts.  Sometimes it is difficult for people to commit to giving us placements because people are in acting roles and they do not want to commit in case they are not appointed to the role.  We try to get people into settings to work, and teams may not fully gel because people are a little unsure.  In our experience in the north west, there are a couple of people more than willing to assist us but they are in acting positions.  I do know how long the process normally takes, but those acting positions act as a slight barrier for the people taking students on placement.  If people are moving around, as has happened in my career, it can become very difficult to stabilise the team.  I do not know if there are any statistics on that, but I am sure there are.  In the north west we are hearing, anecdotally, about people in acting posts having an impact both on students going on placement and, I am sure, on the teams themselves.  That comes from posts not being confirmed or the wait for recruitment drives.  It is our experience in the north west.</p></speech>

Our graduates can look around the world and think they have a choice to work in Ireland or in other countries.  Australia is certainly a big recruiter, along with the United Kingdom, Scotland and other countries.  It is a reality.  If we want to retain people in Ireland, we must offer conditions that are at least comparable with what they can expect in other jurisdictions.  These people are highly networked, so they all know people a year or two older working in other systems who can tell them, chapter and verse, the reality of those systems.  This can be very influential in people's career choices.</p></speech>

Would students be given caseloads?  Who would look after a student's well-being?  Some cases may be pretty horrific for somebody on a placement.  What supports are such people getting on placements?</p></speech>

There is much work done between visiting tutors, who are qualified social workers from the institution, in terms of what is an appropriate caseload for a student at year one or year two and so on.  There is certainly negotiation around that.  Students are required in our case to attend an interview with the agency so it can be sure it is happy with the student and feels it will meet the learning needs within the setting.  Once the placement is confirmed after the interview, the student will get a start date and begin placement.  Within the first couple of weeks, the student will have a visit from the visiting tutor to ensure an induction has taken place, the student is settling well and the learning agreement has begun or been completed.  The learning agreement is a contract between the student and practice teacher, with a number of learning objectives being identified that they want to achieve throughout the placement and those learning objectives being in line with CORU standards of proficiency for practice.  The visiting tutor would revise and review this to ensure it is all in line with the expectations of CORU.  The student then needs to identify a plan with the practice teacher as to how he or she will meet those learning objectives.  That is the main piece of paperwork that will guide the student through placement.  The practice teacher would identify a caseload appropriate for the student at the stage of learning he or she is at and build on that throughout placement.</p> <p>  Students get two more visits after that, which are a mid-placement meeting and an end-placement meeting from the visiting tutor.  This is a review and monitoring process.  They are completing quite a substantial placement portfolio while out on placement as well, so they have the opportunity to discuss that with the visiting tutor and get advice on that also.</p></speech>

On entry to the programme, all the universities employ placement co-ordinators whose job is to seek suitable placements for our students.  Students are then invited to express their needs.  Although we may not always be able to respond to their needs, those needs may be around location because many of our students have family commitments.  They may come from other regions and establish themselves in Cork.  We cannot really require them to dislocate their children and family again to go to another placement in another region.  They tell us what their requirements are and we attempt to respond as best we can to their needs, such as financial or location needs.  We try to allocate one of the two placements within a statutory agency because that makes them more employable when they go into the workforce.  The other placement will be with a voluntary agency.</p> <p>  They are interviewed for the placement.  They engage with the practice educators.  We then take responsibility for contracting with the supervisor and developing learning contracts with the students.  As tutors, we ensure the students&rsquo; needs are protected on placement and that they are known to their supervisors.  We are educating the practice teachers, as well as ensuring the students&rsquo; interests are served as well.  They are not actually replacing staff on site but are there to learn.  Accordingly, they must be protected there.</p></speech>

From early in their placement, they are meeting real people with real issues and providing services to them.  They are obviously closely supervised in doing that.  They are learning through doing.  It is a fundamental and important principle of social work training like in many other disciplines.  They are making a contribution in the organisations in which they are studying.</p></speech>

Some students are placed within an hour&rsquo;s distance of their base while other students have to travel further and have to consider relocating.  It can be different for each student.  From our point of view this year, students have incurred travel expenses to placements where they are travelling between 30 minutes to an hour each day to avail of their placement.</p></speech>

This can impact on their studies as well.</p> <p>  In terms of time, my memories of my masters degree are similar to the feedback we get from our students.  It requires a significant commitment in terms of time.  It is not just about the learning in the classroom environment.  It is about the independent learning that needs to happen outside of that.</p> <p>  The preparation for placement is quite significant.  While students are on placement, they are also completing academic work, along with carrying out real work with real people.  They have case notes and reports to write on placement.  It is a significant challenge for them in terms of time management.</p></speech>

Some students estimated that where they were required to use their car for their job to visit clients etc, they spent between &euro;120 and &euro;260 on petrol.  For a person reliant on a third level grant, that is a substantial amount.  They do 35 hours a week on placement and then there is a study component allowed during the working week to complete the assignments required for university.  As it is a full-time course, it is difficult for our students to take part-time employment.</p> <p>  University College Dublin is accredited to run a part-time professional masters in social work degree.  We find that the demand for the part-time programme is affected by the fact that part-time students are not eligible for third level grants.  That is another practical suggestion.</p></speech>

We have had one deferral and no drop-outs.  The problem is that we are making it difficult for them to achieve it.</p> <p>  One is means tested for grant funding.  If one was in employment the previous year, one will not get the grant.  The notion of bursaries was mentioned.  However, there is a problem with getting a bursary and a grant at the same time because it does not allow for both.  I support the idea of good quality bursaries that are comparable to what one would earn from employment.  This is because one is asking so much with the academic workload and so forth.  It is one of the tougher masters, with a level 9 workload while meeting the requirements of the professional regulator and QQI, Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  Any way it can be supported would be welcome.  There is a cohort interested in the course.  More in our region would be interested if there were more financial supports for them.</p></speech>

We are also committed to trying to facilitate larger numbers of black and ethnic minority students as Ireland is diversifying and also as the client group in social work is diversifying.  That is a concern for us.</p> <p>  We interview our students for entry into the programme and we have a very rigorous interview programme, including interview by a member of faculty and a social work practitioner.  We have a written application form and further testing on the day when they come for interview so the students we get through that programme are very committed and of a very high quality.  We have a very small drop-out rate.  Out of 100, I would say we probably have one a year and we have a very small failure rate of one to two per year out of 100.  Where there is a fail, it is generally on the placement component.  The management of that is obviously very challenging, which is another reason to try to formalise arrangements.</p></speech>

We have a very low drop-out rate because of the commitment of staff, the commitment of practitioners and the commitment of students.  They have to go through a very rigorous process and if they achieve success within that process of selection then they are absolutely committed to sustaining themselves on the programme.  It is really important to reiterate what we have all said, that the master of social work programme and the bachelor of social work programme are both really rigorous programmes and they are very demanding of our students.</p> <p>  On the diversity, there are two bachelor of social work programmes, one in Trinity College Dublin and one in UCC.  The one in UCC is for mature entry and we have certainly improved the diversity of people who are entering the profession through that pathway and I would support any endeavours to increase that diversity, whether it is ethnic minority diversity or gender diversity.</p></speech>

Trinity College Dublin pioneered this approach in higher education going way back but it is certainly a strong part of the social work education tradition in Trinity College Dublin.  It is important to think of age as well as another variable in diversity.  People entering social work later in life may bring some extra experience and insights but it is also important to have people from different social backgrounds.  Our access programmes provide a pathway that opens up to people from different social backgrounds for social work courses, as for other courses, and we do see more ethnic minority or immigrant background students appearing in our classrooms, which we are very pleased to see.</p> <p>  Those issues are an important element of the whole workforce planning, the aim of which is that we have a workforce that reflects the people who are using the services.</p></speech>

In a market where there is a lack of supply, high real-time flexibility is needed.  That is what happens in the private sector and in the private sector headhunting is carried out.  Companies do not even rely on reactive advertising or recruiting because it does not work and they are in such a tight market.  That is something that the Government as a whole needs to look at and I have been calling for it for quite a while.  The problem is that obviously we are dealing with big Departments that we are trying to move and I understand that because I have also recruited internally in the private sector for multinationals.  As they are able to get it right to react to the markets, there is no reason why the public service should not be able to react to it.  That will take some sort of forthright leadership and sitting down with unions to try to gain that flexibility because on the flip side, when the markets turn the other way, obviously there may be oversupply and then the criteria to recruit change.  That is not taking away from the fact that the best qualified person is wanted for the job or the person best qualified to do the job is wanted, but flexibility is key to recruitment.</p> <p>  As the witnesses have said, it is a global market and Ireland needs to react to that.  We are not acting enough on it.  During the recession, I went to Australia as a recruiter and I hired people from Ireland.  It was quite easy as there was a flow of graduates from Ireland because there was no work here.  Ireland needs to look at trying to bring those people back.  There is a need for a study, perhaps through the universities, on what point in time an emigrant looks at coming back or at making that critical decision.  A lot of times people will go, not because of the job, but because of a desire to experience the world and that is fair enough.  We live on a small island and it is a big world out there.  There are points in time, maybe three and four years away when these people look at settling, they ask themselves if they will settle in this foreign country and they think about coming back.  They will make that critical decision and once they settle in that country it is very difficult to bring them back if they get married or have kids or whatever.  It is at that point where they make their decision and we need to do more, possibly through the universities, to ascertain where that point happens and to target that point to bring those people back.</p> <p>  On multiculturalism, because we are in a global market, Ireland needs to start grappling with this.  The witnesses have welcomed the fact that there are people from different backgrounds applying for these positions.  We need to do more on that and we need to start competing on that.  The likes of Australia has more resources to pay people.  That is a fact of life.  It has more natural resources, it is a bigger country and its continent is the size of Europe.  We have to deal with that.  I know there are issues around remuneration and conditions.  We can work on the conditions.</p> <p>  Have studies been done on my point about when people make those critical decisions?  Have graduate surveys been done on what way people are thinking?  If it is a case that we will start paying for experience through the graduate programme, what are the witnesses' thoughts on compelling graduates to work for perhaps two to three years or whatever after their graduation in order to facilitate that?  Is it a runner or is it a non-runner?  Will it turn people off?  It would be interesting to get the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p></speech>

Probably three or four on our masters programme go every single year.</p> <p>  On those graduates who I know who go abroad, and from what I know about what they say about the reasons for choosing to go abroad, which is anecdotal rather than systematic research, some of them want to do as the Deputy says, to travel the world and it is great that we have graduates who have a licence to travel the world with the credentials that we give them.

If there were some sort of a graduate programme set up where graduates could access outside supervision and some sort of mentoring from experienced, professionally qualified social workers, that would help them to better maintain and sustain the roles that they are in.  That would make a huge difference.  That is just speaking from my own experience.</p></speech>

Would there be an avenue for that, or an appetite for it?  They would not be working full time.  They may be in a mentoring role or a support-type role, which could be ten or 20 hours a week.  This goes back to one of the other issues I have been working on, namely, older people trying to look for work in the workforce and being covertly discriminated against.  I am not saying it is happening in Tusla, but it is happening covertly across the board as a culture.  We are seeing people retiring at 66 and walking out the door with a huge amount of skills.  If they want to retire and finish with that, that is fine, and they should be allowed do that because they have worked all their lives.  However, there is another cohort who are walking out the door with an abundance of specific skills, there are younger people who do not have the life experience who need that support, and there is no synergy between the two groups. This is exactly what Ms Feeney is speaking about, that there is probably a cohort who have retired, who would work maybe ten or 15 hours a week just to keep in touch from a mentoring point of view, but who would not have the pressures or the added weight that are part of the full-time role.</p> <p>  Facilitating the likes of that is something that could be looked at as part of this committee's report.  We are at 5.4% unemployment, and I think there are a huge amount of skills.  Working with people who have retired is something the witnesses might want to brainstorm themselves when doing their own studies.  I am sure there are some people because I see them working in community organisations and giving back in that way.  They are going from 100 miles an hour to zero, and this is a way for them to taper off for three or four years.  The amount of knowledge and support they could give back is phenomenal.</p></speech>

One of the issues I hope the committee might give consideration to mentioning is a systematic and structured approach to continuing professional development.  This would include opportunities like structured approaches to mentoring and so on.  To make social work an attractive option in career terms, employers should be offering a clear and structured pathway of professional development so that people, by staying in the system, gain access to various opportunities which would enhance their careers, their promotion opportunities, and their capacity to do the job in a satisfying way.  Maybe those are the kinds of things they hear about on offer in other countries and that may draw some of them away.  If we can reduce to some extent the numbers of people who feel motivated to leave by better conditions abroad, that would have an impact.  If we can also attract back some of those people by offering them good opportunities similar to the ones that attracted them away in the first place, that would have an impact.  Making the hole in the bucket smaller is very important, and it is done by a series of incremental measures, but continuing professional development is a very important piece in the jigsaw that we should not lose sight of.  It makes for a more stable, committed, and effective workforce.</p></speech>

We would have examples of it in the south and it is a very good suggestion.  On the other issue around supervision, it is a requirement to have supervision as part of being a registered professional with CORU.  It is required as part of continued registration with the profession to have supervision.  It is our belief that that supervision should be provided within the establishments where people are employed.  There may be a place for external supervision as well, but it is necessary that people who are employed by organisations are provided with appropriate supervision to respond appropriately to the demands of the job.</p></speech>

Supervision is based around the provision of administrative and management supervision, educative supervision, and support.  Any supervision arrangement should be contracted with the inclusion of all three elements of a supervision agreement.  What our workers on the ground, not just in Tusla, are telling us is that supervision is often dedicated to the management and administration of the work, and aspects of the emotional and supportive side of the work are not attended to.  We also know from the retention research that has been done that those aspects become the variables which influence people in making their decision either to stay or leave.</p></speech>

Practitioners are setting up their own reflective peer support groups throughout the country in recognition of the need for this quality of support and engagement.  They are doing it themselves, and that is a good and positive step forward, because we have proactive professionals working on their own behalf to address issues.  We do not have a workforce which is waiting for people to deliver services.  Practitioners are actively attempting to address serious concerns that they have about their own needs for support, and we would like to support them in that.  We would be happy to support anything that can be done to progress these kinds of developments.</p></speech>

There was a backlog then where the panels were there, but the people on them did not necessarily want the jobs that became available because they might already be in that department or service.  There were a number of times when we had to recruit from agencies such as TTM or CPL, and the people we brought in told us that they did not make the national panels because they were so competitive and there were a lot more experienced practitioners coming high up on those panels.  We felt at that point that if we had been able to run a local campaign for recruitment, we would have been able to recruit far more quickly.</p></speech>

Of course, it is entirely appropriate where bursaries are provided, and in the 1990s, as Dr. Halton mentioned, when we increased our output of students very radically, there was a practice of providing bursaries and students working for a number of years, which worked very well.  The other point I want to make is that in UCD we run a two year professional master of social work programme, and our students are largely self-funding.  They are not entirely self-funding, but all the universities are less than 50% State-funded, and I think in UCD we are in the high 30% range.  Most of that money is for the so-called free fees for undergraduates, and we get a proportionate block grant to run the university.  The students for a masters programme are paying the vast bulk of the cost of their student fees, which are between &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 a year.  They are the fees to cover the programme.  I can understand why it would ostensibly seem attractive, and there is certainly an argument that it is entirely reasonable to request that when people are being funded by the Government.  For our students I have an issue about it, as well as around attracting people into these professions with these requirements.  That is my view.</p></speech>

I would not really agree with a graduate programme, but I certainly would agree with a bursary programme.  There is a slight difference within them.  We have had a lot of people working in posts within Tusla who would have liked to come on the programme, but they could not afford it financially, so this would have been an opportunity for them.  Tusla approached us about trying to find funded bursaries when were doing the programme originally, because people intended to stay with it anyhow.  However, there were difficulties with the systems of both grants and bursaries.  When I worked in the health services, I got partially funded for a programme, and I had to stay there for a year and a half.  I had to commit to that, but I did not find it a barrier because I intended to stay there.  That is a definite option for people who are in Tusla particularly, who want to transition or develop their careers in another direction, because we had quite a number who were interested in that but could not afford it.  I would definitely be supportive of it within that kind of frame.</p></speech>

The other issue was that there were a number of people accepting posts in a certain geographical area, which was not necessarily the geographical area that they wanted to settle in.  They would accept that post and be gone again within a year because they got a post in a geographical area that suited them better.  That was causing a lot of movement in departments as well, which was not ideal for service users, as they would have a social worker for six to 12 months, and then that would change when they had only just begun to build a relationship.  These were the issues that my colleagues and I would have noticed at the time, and had we been able to recruit locally or run local campaigns, it would have alleviated a lot of that.</p></speech>

Maybe that is where we need to get to, and then build in some kind of requirement that people stay on afterwards.</p></speech>

From what I am gathering, the witnesses' qualification is structured slightly differently.  The placement arrives and the award arrives thereafter.  Is that right?</p></speech>

This is my perspective as a complete outsider, making an observation of the observation made that individuals in most work placements are paid, albeit a small amount.  That would go a long way, particularly in relation to Ms Feeney's point, which I think is quite stark, that even though they may have zero income and very small savings, individuals are not going to get a grant under any circumstances because the chances are they were working in the previous year.  I can think of plenty of other industries, including one I am involved in through marriage, that is horrible in that sense.  It is not just about the education, but is also about the practice afterwards.  It takes years before one breaks even, and then one has to figure out how to pay back the debts from the preceding ten years.  That is from experience.</p></speech>

Students are finishing college on a Friday and they are doing night duty on Friday, Saturday, and possibly Sunday night, to try to sustain this.  They are effectively working a full-time job over the weekend.  We are in the north west, so obviously it is a different socioeconomic place, but everybody has experienced this.  Everybody has students who fall into these categories.  When I was a nursing student, I got paid.  It was not very much, but I got paid to do my training, and it is a training to be professional in one's practice.  I can come up with any figure, but it would need to be evidence-informed and it definitely needs to be comparable to what would be earned in a job because the addition of working the whole weekend is compromising their learning.  They are tired, without a doubt, when they come in on Monday morning, so if we can mitigate against that, we will have better results and better professionally qualified social workers.</p></speech>

Do the delegates believe the pay levels of new entrants are sufficient?  Some 90% of social workers are female and there is a gender pay gap in Ireland.  Traditionally, female dominated professions are low paid.  Do the delegates have any comment to make on that fact?  Is it a factor where pay levels for new entrants are low?  I note the comment to the effect that some time ago a man might have got more than a female colleague.</p></speech>

General social work salaries need to be reviewed because the pay scale for a basic rate social worker stops after seven years' experience.  If they are not interested in management, there is no incentive for social workers to continue in what is a highly challenging job.  The senior practitioner role has been reintroduced, but the pay rates do not reflect what is required of somebody in that role.</p></speech>

Child protection and welfare social workers in other jurisdictions are paid higher salaries for the particular work than colleagues in other areas.  Whether this approach would be attractive is being debated with unions.  The levels of complexity of the work are very high, as are the demands made.  I agree that a reconsideration of pay levels would help to attract people into the profession.  When one asks people why they come into the area of social work, they say that, while the salary is important and they could be on a similar salary in other, less onerous, areas, they would still choose social work.  It is primarily a female profession which used to be considered to be a vocation.  The people who come into the profession have a vocational attraction to the work and are very committed and dedicated in responding to the complex challenges facing and needs of service users.</p></speech>

My students say the issue is salary levels are uniform across the profession.  Some areas of social work are particularly stressful and demanding such as child protection, but pay levels are uniform and people tend to move out of specialist child protection social work into other areas that, although challenging and valuable, are less stressful.  That is a concern.  The other issue is progression.  I was very pleased when at the last meeting of the committee Tusla representatives spoke about the systems they were putting in place to develop a better career structure for social workers.  We need more graduates at entry level, but the issue is retaining them.  Part of the solution is providing a career structure.</p></speech>

The profession is essential, but the actions of both Houses of the Oireachtas and several Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, are exerting more and more pressure on it every year.  There has to be recognition of that fact.  I would not wish anybody to think the committee does not acknowledge the critical work done, while we would also not want to devalue other professions by having long service increments or such things.  They are provided for in other professions, but there is no uniform approach to public service pay, which is one of the biggest issues we have.  Judging by the looks I have just got, I am assuming everybody is in agreement with me.</p></speech>

The committee wishes to consider the Revised Estimate on a programme by programme basis but, as the Chairman will be well aware, the health Vote, unlike other Votes, is not configured along programme lines.  My Department continues to work towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the health Vote to reflect this.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the committee wishes to focus in particular on the financial allocations for implementation of the provisions of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and capital allocations for hospitals.  In that context, 2019 has the highest investment ever in our services.  It is also the first year that the Health Service Executive's national service plan is framed through the lens of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  The strategy provides the framework within which a system-wide reform programme for the health system will be advanced and focuses on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health services are delivered.  It is a matter of considering what more can be done in the community.  The idea of everything having to be channelled through the hospital structure no longer applies.</p> <p>  The national service plan sets out further details on how the totality of health service resources, including the significant additional provision being made available by the Government, will be used to advance Sl&aacute;intecare objectives in 2019.  In addition, the welcome increases in the health capital budget over the period to 2021 will allow progress on key developments such as the new national children's hospital, which I am sure we will discuss, the national forensic mental hospital and continued improvements in radiation oncology infrastructure in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  This becomes all the more pressing in light of the National Cancer Registry of Ireland's report of this week.  The programme of development of new and refurbished primary care units and community nursing units throughout the country will continue to be rolled out.  Additional funding over the period will be utilised to deliver additional acute and residential care beds and progress work on key Sl&aacute;intecare projects.</p> <p>  The gross provision for the health Vote in 2018 was &euro;15.977 billion, comprising &euro;15.464 billion in current expenditure and &euro;513 million in capital expenditure.  This represents the gross funding position for both the Department of Health and the HSE and includes additional finding of &euro;645 million granted by means of a Supplementary Estimate.  The additional gross funding requirement comprises &euro;20 million towards capital works and &euro;625 million towards current over-expenditure, which we have discussed before.  </p> <p>  In framing the 2019 budget, the Oireachtas allocated significant further additional Exchequer funding for the health sector.  In 2019, gross health funding is &euro;17.032 billion, comprising &euro;16.365 billion in current expenditure and &euro;667 million in capital.  This represents an increase of &euro;901 million on the 2018 current expenditure budget and &euro;154 million on capital expenditure and recognises our commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people.  It is no surprise to any member of this committee or anybody in the country that the issue of health funding is a major policy challenge, not just in Ireland but also internationally.  Despite welcome increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through doing things better, reforming our health service and improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and ageing populations &ndash; an increase in life expectancy is good - are major challenges to health funding internationally.  The additional funding secured over recent years provides a substantial basis for the health service to maximise the level and quality of service delivery while also implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare programme. </p> <p>  I now wish to address a number of issues that I understand the committee, in its letter to me, identified as being of specific interest.  On the new children's hospital, members will be aware that the independent comprehensive review of the escalation in cost of the hospital, the contributory factors and associated responsibilities has been completed, was discussed by the Government yesterday and has now been published.  I very clearly welcome the report's finding that the Government decision in December 2018 to continue with this project, based on the advice available at the time, was the correct decision.  It states that any alternative course of action would have resulted in significant delay, further increased costs and the possibility that the hospital would not be built.  I received much advice and was subject to many political charges from around these Houses after the cost escalation became clear and I was told I should retender the project, pause it or move it.  The report by PwC, an independent financial auditor, indicates the appropriate decision was to proceed with the project.</p><p>The report addresses in detail the flow of information on the cost escalation and confirms the information already in the public domain regarding communications with my Department.  It is important that all the documentation that PwC had access to aligns with the published documents that I made available to the committee previously. </p><p> The report points out significant areas of weakness that need to be addressed and strengthened to support the project to successful completion, as well as significant lessons for capital projects in general.  Now we are back in an era of investing in capital projects there will be many big projects, not only in the area of health.  While it is important that we retain the experience and expertise gained over the last number of years by those involved in progressing the new children&rsquo;s hospital project to this stage, based on the report findings we also need to strengthen the capability and capacity of this resource, where necessary, to further support the planning and execution of this phase of the project.  This process has commenced with the appointment of a new chair of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, Mr. Fred Barry, a man with a great deal of experience in delivering capital projects.  In line with yesterday&rsquo;s Government decision, I intend to consider the report findings and recommendations in detail with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, our respective Departments, the HSE and Mr. Barry and will revert to the Government next month setting out a considered response to the report and an implementation plan.  The recommendations provide a firm basis to improve the management of project delivery.  We will comprehensively address the recommendations of the PwC report and, in doing so, successfully meet the needs of the children of Ireland for many years to come.  I do not intend to give the committee a knee-jerk response today.  There is a reason the Government decided that it would take four weeks to come back with an implementation plan but I have no doubt that there is a role for the committee, to be determined by the Chairman, in setting out a comprehensive implementation plan.  I look forward to working with the Chairman in that regard.  We must take very seriously some of the clear indications in the report in relation to the professional information given to the national development board.  Page 4 of the report is very clear on material errors and a peculiar way of doing business in terms of arriving at some figures.  It will be significant cause for reflection.  I intend to meet the new chair of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in the coming days to ask for his response and that of his board to those findings.  </p><p> I reiterate a point I have made many times previously, namely, the children and young people of Ireland have been waiting far too long for a modern healthcare facility and a new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Some will say that everyone says that, but there are many people who thought we should pause the project, retender it or move the location at this late stage.  We will not do that.  </p><p> The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital is scheduled to open this summer.  I will meet Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland this afternoon.  The Connolly part of this hospital project will be handed over to the State this month and will start delivering real service improvements for children this year.</p><p> There is no doubt that the children&rsquo;s hospital overrun has implications.  An additional &euro;99 million is required for the project in 2019.  The Government decided that &euro;24 million of this additional funding will be provided from within the &euro;667 million allocation, with the balance of &euro;75 million to be met by rescheduling capital allocations in other Departments.</p><p> The Chairman&rsquo;s letter asked that I deal with the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  The strategy was published in August 2018.  I accept that it has taken some time to get to this point but we now have a very clear implementation strategy.  Budget 2019 included &euro;206 million for specific new initiatives associated with the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, including negotiating a new GP contract, which the Chairman and I discuss regularly.  I am pleased to say that we have achieved significant progress, which has been welcomed by both the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, in terms of investment in general practice.  While there is more to do, and I am sure the committee will have views on that, we will have in place, for the first time, a large-scale structured chronic disease management programme to ensure patients with diabetes, asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease can be treated in their community.  We will roll out that programme over the next four years starting in 2020.  It will ultimately benefit 400,000 patients who today attend our hospitals and outpatient clinics.</p><p> We are extending free GP care to children under 12 years but on a phased and careful basis, having learned lessons from the extension of free GP care to children under six years.  I propose that we extend free GP care to children under eight years next year.  We need to negotiate a fee through the Irish Medical Organisation.  In recent years, a bugbear of GPs, which I have heard them raise very clearly, has been their legitimate view that general practice is no longer sustainable and has been left in a difficult position as a result cuts introduced under the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and &euro;120 million taken out of the service by successive Governments &ndash; that is forgotten.  We have now worked out a way of moving beyond that and restoring the equivalent level of funding and more.  In return, our GPs are helpfully offering to reform, modernise and work with us on important initiatives such as ehealth, medicines management, accurate waiting lists and virtual clinics.  We have a fair and balanced deal which, crucially, will also help deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p> We have also had the further roll-out of national strategies in maternity trauma, cancer and drugs and a &euro;20 million Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  We are inviting the health service, voluntary organisations and individuals to pitch ideas as to how they can help deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  I launched the integration fund on 22 March and it will be allocated in May.  I expect to be back before the committee for a detailed discussion on geoalignment.  I am determined to follow the recommendations, which the Chairman co-authored, on how to reform the structures of the health service.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report gave me clear advice on what are known as regional integrated care organisations, RICOs.  I do not like the name but I know their purpose.  The idea is to merge community health organisations and hospital groups over time, divide the country based on a population health approach rather than any other approach, reduce bureaucracy and establish regional oversight structures.  I intend to move on that this summer.  I will return to discuss it further with the committee at an appropriate time.</p><p> A significant increase in funding for the health services has been achieved in recent years.  We are continuing to deal with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements and increased demand for new and existing drugs.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a new roadmap to support the delivery of high-quality care to our citizens.  This year is the first year in which the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan has been developed based on the new Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.</p></speech>

I would like to discuss many issues, including the national children's hospital and the provision made for it, Sl&aacute;intecare and the urgent issues of recruitment and retention.  CervicalCheck is another large and pressing issue.  When we received the further Revised Estimate, I searched it for allocations for CervicalCheck.  There are 80,000 women waiting up to eight months for test results and there is an indefinite delay in HPV tests.  I expected to see an additional provision or a figure carried forward from last year to account for the additional cytology required to move through this urgent backlog and provide additional colposcopy capacity when the backlog moves through cytology because obviously there will be increased referrals to consultants.  I will begin with the genesis of the backlog and the need to make financial provision to address it this year.  The HSE says that two thirds of the backlog and delay to the HPV test are due to the blanket offer of the free out-of-cycle smear test for any woman who wanted one.  Responding to a parliamentary question, the Minister informed me that neither he nor his officials received any advice against such a decision before the announcement was made.  In the past two weeks, the committee received evidence from Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly that such an offer would fundamentally undermine the programme.</p></speech>

This suggests that the Minister's response to my parliamentary question was not true.  The Minister stated that any advice he received was significantly after the decision.  However, evidence from Mr. Tony O'Brien that he asked the Minister to walk the decision back the following day suggests that the Minister's statement in that regard was not true either.  The Minister also stated that the chief medical officer supported his decision.  Evidence referred to by Susan Mitchell in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>just three days ago that the chief medical officer supported a much more targeted approach suggests that statement was not true.</p><p>The committee has mounting evidence from multiple sources that the steps the Minister announced were advised against before the announcement, at least to a principal officer in the Department.  Moreover, advice against this was received by email from the national screening service and from the director general of the HSE immediately after the announcement.  Such advice was also given repeatedly in the months after the announcement.  The evidence suggests that the Minister ignored all of that advice, and this has led to the delays in testing and in the introduction of the human papillomavirus, HPV, test.  </p><p> We need to provision for this and there do not appear to be any provisions in these Estimates.  As such, would the Minister like to correct the D&aacute;il record?  Given the evidence that the committee has received, it is difficult not to conclude that the committee and the D&aacute;il have been repeatedly misled on the decision to offer a free out-of-cycle test.  We now need to provision for that this year.  Would the Minister like to take the opportunity to correct the D&aacute;il record on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#D00200"><p>I would like to take the opportunity to correct Deputy Donnelly, because I have been listening to these false political charges for quite some time.  I have also listened to the patient representatives, including Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. Stephen Teap and Ms Lorraine Walsh, asking this committee to focus on the more important issues of the present for now and stop focusing on the past and playing politics with the issue.  I have also been listening to people who are regularly quoted in this committee as experts on general practice, like the president of the National Association of General Practitioners.  As recently as 8 April, he said that while he would be the first to criticise me - which is true - he believed I made this decision in the belief that it was the right thing to do given the situation at the time.  I was in CervicalCheck headquarters as the phones were hopping with patients looking for repeat smears.  At that stage women had only two options; they could pay for a private smear, which at about &euro;120 is something a Deputy could afford, or they could do nothing.  Many women were paying for a private service and a two-tier system was developing.  GPs were put in an impossible position as women requested repeat smears.  No woman was refused a smear.  If a woman was refused a smear, confidence in CervicalCheck would have dwindled further.</p><p>I would like a little bit of time on this, if the Chair does not mind.  The committee obviously held an entire meeting on it last week at which political charges were levelled.  I was not present or invited to attend on that occasion.  I made the decision and I stand over it.  I made the decision consistent with the advice of my chief medical officer and no evidence has been produced to suggest that I did not.  In fact, a letter to was sent to the Ceann Comhairle in February in response to the assertions of Deputy Donnelly's party leader, not from me but from my Department.  It said that my decision and announcement on 28 April was consistent with the advice I received from my officials.  Moreover, the letter said that the advice I received from the chief medical officer was reflected in the press statement on the issue on 28 April.  </p><p>I wish to deal with that issue and the issue of the CervicalCheck screening service advice.  I worked hand in glove with the chief medical officer, who showed extraordinary leadership at a time when many clinicians walked off the pitch.  Dr. Tony Holohan worked night and day on this.  Members have even seen my text messages in the newspaper, released under the Freedom of Information Act, which show how much contact we had.  Dr. Tony Holohan's advice to me has been confirmed by my Department in a letter to the Ceann Comhairle and by me in answers to parliamentary questions asked by Deputy Donnelly and his leader in February and March.  The advice was that this was an appropriate thing to do.  It was absolutely an appropriate thing to do where a GP believed it ought to be done.  There was no difference on that.  We can reduce this to tweets and quote my tweets and those of others if we want.  My tweet said that details would follow.  My Department also tweeted that - these days Departments tweet too.  About 20 minutes later a press statement from my Department followed.  There was no difference in opinion between my chief medical officer, my senior officials or myself.  We all believed at the time of a major public health crisis that this was the appropriate thing to do.  We were hearing directly from GPs and from women.  I am sure Deputy Donnelly was too.  My inbox was full of constituents who wanted to know if they could have a repeat smear.  Doctors wanted to know as well. </p><p>It is fair to say that at that stage I could not have known how long that period of uncertainty would last.  Nor could Deputy Donnelly or anyone else.  In fairness, I acknowledge that we all worked together on the terms of reference for the Scally report.  We expected that report to be published in June.  This decision was made at the end of April.  When the Scally report was released it provided significant reassurance, but because of its comprehensive nature it did not actually issue until September.  There is no doubt that the window of worry and concern was longer than any of us would have liked.</p><p>As for CervicalCheck management and what advice its members offered, in reply to a parliamentary question as long ago as 12 March 2019, I told Deputy Donnelly &quot;Neither I nor my officials received advice that recommended against these tests in advance of the decision&quot;.  However, in that reply to a parliamentary question I also stated:</p><blockquote>Subsequent to the decision, on foot of telephone contact by the Department, the National Screening Service raised a number of concerns verbally.  Following the announcement, the Screening Service set out concerns in an email to my Department, which related to uncertainty about costs, volume, impact on turnaround times, impact on perceptions of the programme's accuracy, challenges with processing GP payments, and the potential difficulty in ceasing the arrangements in due course. </blockquote> <p>The Taoiseach said the same on the record of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>I was delighted to give the committee the email this morning.  I have no issue whatsoever with doing so.  The email came in at 5.59 p.m., after the decision had been made.  </p><p>The email notes that the national screening service takes direction from the Department.  I make policy decisions.  I own this decision.  I believe it was the right thing to do and I have 110,000 reasons to believe as much because 110,000 women saw their GP in seeking reassurance.  Only 57,000 of them actually opted for the repeat smear, which shows that GPs did their job.  I do not believe that any woman needed direction from me on the appropriate thing to do for her healthcare.  However, what women needed from me was not to be insulted by being forced to put their hands in their pockets because of this situation.  </p><p>The advice was not received by my Department in advance of the decision.  The chronology is very straightforward.  We make the decision as a Department.  I made this decision and I own it.  I will stand over the decision.  While one would not do this in normal times, these were exceptional times.  That decision was then conveyed to the screening service and what we would do was outlined.  The screening service outlined some of the risks after the decision was made.  Of course there were some risks but they were all readily identifiable.  One risk concerned how GPs would be paid.  We sorted that out.  I thought the risk that it could potentially undermine further confidence in the programme was somewhat ironic.  The way in which CervicalCheck had been managed, the audit had been handled and Vicky Phelan had been treated had already undermined the confidence in the programme.  </p><p>The national screening service did refer to the additional impact this would have on lab turnaround times.  This was inevitable.  I have spoken to so many women, as I am sure Deputy Donnelly has.  They were going for repeat smears anyway.  People, including women we all know in our own lives and communities, sought that assurance.  Until the State could say that its screening service was safe they would seek that assurance.  I did not mislead the D&aacute;il.  I took this decision for good reasons after hearing from GPs and women.  It was consistent with the advice of my chief medical officer and my senior departmental officials, as the Department confirmed in writing to the Ceann Comhairle of this House as long ago as February.  I have never hidden from the fact that concerns were expressed after the decision was made.  I have outlined the content of those concerns in answers to parliamentary questions.  I am happy to give the members physical copies of the email.  I have them here and can circulate them.</p><p>I have said I made mistakes around CervicalCheck.  There is no doubt about it.  Fortunately, others have not.  Dr. Scally talked about the frenzied political and media environment.  I am possibly the only person involved who has suggested that I made some mistakes and would like to do some things differently.  However, this was not one of those things.  This was far from ideal.  It has absolutely resulted in a very significant increase in smears.  It has resulted in a backlog.  As the Deputy acknowledged, that is not exclusively made up of new women entering the programme, but I accept they do constitute about two thirds.  That is a statement of fact.  I want to focus on reducing that backlog.  </p><p>Women were going to seek the repeat smear regardless of whether the test was free.  For me the issue was to support GPs who wanted to know what to do if such women turned up.  No matter how many times I am asked this question, my view on this will never change.  I lived the CervicalCheck debacle 24-7, working intensively with my officials, who worked so hard and showed real leadership.  This was seen as an appropriate thing to do.  It absolutely would not be appropriate in normal circumstances but we were not in normal circumstances.  We are now looking back from higher terrain, with the benefit of hindsight and different views.  Some Opposition spokespeople have said that if they were Minister, they would have done exactly the same thing.  Others welcomed it at the time and now say I should not have done it.  Others criticised CervicalCheck management at the time and are now quoting it as the font of all wisdom.  People can do what they want in that regard.  I stand by the decision.  I own the decision and I am responsible for the decision.  </p></speech>

The Minister continued with the test through the year, and today we have 80,000 women waiting, an indefinite delay to the introduction of the HPV test, and we need to provision for that, which is what this meeting is about.

The Deputy may be asking me whether I wish I had made a different decision.  I do not believe it was possible to have made a different decision.  Women and GPs were seeking this.  The Deputy keeps saying expert clinical advice was given.  My expert medical advice is given to me by the chief medical officer, a man who showed extraordinary leadership in this situation, after the failure of others, the mistreatment of Vicky Phelan and the appalling decisions made, namely, that if a woman dies, just stick a note on her file and do not tell her husband.  These decisions were made by people carrying out a botched audit.  Dr. Tony Holohan stood up to the plate.  He is the person from whom I was taking my advice.</p></speech>

Given that the Minister accepts responsibility, will he apologise to all those women who are now waiting because of the decision he made against all of this advice?</p></speech>

I made a decision to do the appropriate thing that I was requested to do by GPs and by women at the height of a crisis, and that decision, I believe to this day, was the appropriate decision in a crisis.  I regret extremely that there are women waiting a long time.  That is why we have been working night and day with the HSE to source additional capacity.  This committee heard very clearly last week from Damien McCallion, another person who has worked tirelessly through this time, about the efforts of the HSE to identify additional capacity, and it has done so.  This week, as we are speaking, quality assurance and negotiations are going on regarding bringing that extra capacity on stream.  If - I can only say "if" at this moment because I need hear back from the HSE - we can get this capacity on stream, I expect the backlog to be significantly and overwhelmingly reduced during the summer months.  That is what my focus has to be on.  The Deputy is not suggesting this, in fairness, but obviously we have different turnaround times in different laboratories.  Some of our laboratories are turning around these tests in three to four weeks, some in six to seven weeks, and in the case of one laboratory, there is a very long wait.  Of that there is no doubt.</p> <p>  The clinical risk, because it is important for women watching these proceedings outside the politics of all this, we are told by people like Dr. Peter McKenna is negligible and very low, but that does not mean it is not stressful for people waiting.  I fully accept that.  We will work night and day to resolve this situation.  However, I believe, and I think many women believe, that in a crisis they did not need any politician to tweet or to make any decision.  They were going to seek reassurance themselves with their doctor.  The question was whether I made them pay for it.  I felt, after the significant disrespect that had been shown to women in terms of how the audit had been carried out, that the appropriate thing for the State to do was to fund this.  What I will do and what I have asked the HSE to do is to keep this committee very closely apprised, and I would welcome the members' co-operation in terms of working as we try to bring this extra capacity on stream.  I know that is what we all want and I am hopeful that we can see progress in that in a very short period.</p></speech>

This is my opinion.  I  believe what people, GPs and women were looking for was a repeat smear test.  I do not believe that was the issue.  That was not the failing.  The failing was doing what the Minister felt was appropriate but not knowing whether we had the resources to fulfil that commitment.  Perhaps that is where the failing was - not so much in the decision but the fact that the decision was made.  I am not questioning the decision.  It was the right decision, but were there any discussions around whether we had the resources to commit to what we were providing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#E02000"><p>I thank the Deputy for the honesty of his assessment that he, his party and many people felt that this was the right decision to make based on what women wanted and needed at the time.  I accept that.  I also accept fully that the challenge has been the fact of the impact this has had on capacity.  Being very truthful - I believe my officials have said this previously, as has the HSE - and it is the absolute truth, it was impossible to estimate how many women would seek this, and there were two reasons for that.  First, this was a very personal decision a woman needed to make with her doctor.  We saw that 110,000 women went to their doctors under this provision and 57,000 decided to go for a repeat smear test.  Second, and I am being very honest, one of the reasons we have found a particular difficulty is that the period went on for longer than I would have liked.  That is not a criticism of Dr. Gabriel Scally.  He has done an incredible job.  Because he was doing such an incredible job, we had hoped as an Oireachtas to get his report in June, but he asked if he could carry on until September.  There was a longer period of time before I was able to turn off or pause the decision, so to speak.</p> <p>  In October, I received a submission from my Department indicating we had Dr. Scally's report, that it provided good reassurance for the women of Ireland that the screening service was safe in terms of the laboratories we use, notwithstanding the shortcomings, and that I should communicate to the HSE my intention to end the free repeat smear test, and we did that.  I accepted my officials' advice in full.  We communicated that to the HSE which operated it, and it said that while the decision was accepted, because smear tests and the likes were booked in, it believed it should operationalise that decision at the end of December.  It is important to point out, and I believe the Deputy has acknowledged it, that these were decisions being taken in real time.  The worry was real, live and present.  Women were going to their doctors wanting to know what they could do.  The phone line was up and running, women were ringing the phone line asking if they could have a repeat smear test.  GPs were asking how they could tell a patient she had her smear a year ago and that she had to wait another two years.  We were putting immediate steps in place to make arrangements with smear takers.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, negotiated the fee as a GP representative organisation.  The president of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, welcomed it as being the right decision. We did not have the opportunity to do that level of screening.  I accept that as a criticism but I cannot see how it could have been done differently considering the crisis we were in.</p></speech>

I have a few question on it.  I recognise the Minister has asked that the Government would be given a number of weeks to assess the report, examine the recommendations and decide how to proceed.</p><p>I would like to discuss a number of recommendations with the Minister, however.  I would first of all like to go back over some old ground and set it in context.  The PwC report was very clear that the establishment of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, put all of the eggs in one basket.  If there were successes, than there was one success but if there were failures then there was one point of failure.  That was the reason that the two additional monitoring groups were set up, the steering group and the programme group.  We know the terms of reference but who made the decision to appoint individuals to those monitoring groups?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#F00200"><p>Those decisions were made by the Government as part of the decision to proceed with the large part of the project.  There would have been consultation with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then a decision was made by Government.</p></speech>

The Government approved the structures.  I know Deputy Jonathan O'Brien does not mean it like this, but the people on those groups were officials in the Department and not political appointments.  The Government did make the decision regarding the composition of the working groups.</p></speech>

The report states that the groups did not have the ability or the experience to question some of the decisions being taken.  The groups could only monitor the information provided to them.  If that is the case, does the Minister think that was a failing when the legislation was being developed and the terms of reference for those monitoring groups were drafted?</p></speech>

I know the Minister is happy to respond but as Chair I need to state we are here to discuss the Estimates.  There is of course a reference in the Estimates to the revision of the capital allocation to health.  It is fine if the Minister is willing to answer those questions.  I just wanted to establish that.</p></speech>

I am more than happy to answer the questions, however, and I would not like to leave the elephant in the room regarding the national children's hospital.  It is a large amount of public expenditure.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's question, a decision was made in 2007 to set up a National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I cannot speak for my predecessors, but it was a decision I re-endorsed so I can speak to the rationale.  It was that this was such a large project, on a mega-scale, that no Department in the public service would necessarily have the capacity to deliver it.  The sensible thing to do then was to bring in the experts and appoint a competency-based board.  That was done.</p> <p>  As we neared the bigger stages of the project, the major construction stage, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien is quite correct that the Government decided that there was more involved than just building a hospital.  We were constructing a building but also integrating three hospitals, setting up an entirely new entity and putting in a new IT system.  There were many different moving parts in the project and there needed to be a structure to oversee what was happening.  The Government approved that structure.  I am not going to give a definitive answer on this issue today, other than to say there is no doubt that the governance structures will need to change and will need to be strengthened.  The report does not find, however, that there should be a clear-out of the board.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has not suggested that it does.  In fact-----</p></speech>

It specifically recommends against that course of action.  I am paraphrasing but in auditor-speak it states that if we were to do that, we would lose so much corporate memory that we could jeopardise the project.  The report does, however, state that I need to strengthen the board.  Auditors are not brought in if everything is thought to be going great and if the recommendations are not going to be accepted.  I will be working on the key areas.</p></speech>

The report states the Minister should not have a complete clear-out of the board because it would lose that corporate memory.  It also states, however, that the Minister needs to strengthen the board by adding expertise and competency to the board.  How does the Minister propose to do that given there is only one vacancy on the board at the moment?  People will have to be moved aside in order to bring that expertise onto the board.  Is the Minister willing to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#F01100"><p>I am willing to do whatever I believe it takes but that is not my initial thought.  My initial thoughts are that the statutory instrument gives me the power to alter the size of the board and to add people.  While I have not made these decisions less than 24 hours after the publication of a report, I can state with certainty that I will be strengthening the board, particularly in the areas the PwC report has identified should be strengthened.  The whole area of health construction is one that has been highlighted and that I need to respond to.  I will be strengthening the board and I expect that will definitely mean additional members.  My understanding, from advice, is that I have the legal ability to do that through the statutory instrument.  I also have, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien rightly states, a vacancy on the board at the moment.  It is important to state that the chair of the board, as the Deputy knows, is brand new to the role as well.  There also will be a new project director because that individual has also announced, previous to this report, that he is intending to step down.</p> <p>  My short answer is I will be strengthening the board.  I also expect we will be changing the governance arrangements.  I, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and our Departments need to do some work on that aspect.  The Government has, however, accepted all 11 recommendations.  Let there be no ambiguity about that.  We have to operationalise them now and come up with a detailed implementation plan.  I welcome input from this committee in that regard and I also propose to meet the authors of the report.  It is possible to read a report - and I have read this report several times - but also very useful to have the authors talk me through it and scrutinise some of the lines and what was behind them in respect of what the authors think I should do next.  I will also meet Mr. Fred Barry in the coming days, as chair of the board, to get his sense of what further skill sets can help the project.</p></speech>

I published all of those documents in advance.  The good news is that the PwC timeline tallies with that.  There are two interesting points in the report regarding the governance issue.  One is that while it states the governance structure was complex, it also states that it did not impede information flow.   The report does not seem to be suggesting to me that that caused that problem.</p> <p>  Crucially, however, there is a line in the report that is very important about the role of my Department and the HSE.  I suppose it concerns the Government as well, although it does not name the Government.  The report states that the Department of Health and HSE were "impaired", that is the word used, from doing their job because of some of the mistakes or errors made in arriving at accurate figures.  A person in government, a Secretary General or someone in the HSE, whomsoever it might be, depends on accurate information from professional firms.

I do not want to name them here.  Even though we have privilege, I am conscious the board will have to consider all of these matters.  We depend on professional expertise to give accurate, factual information.  We hire such firms because we do not have the expertise ourselves.  We can then scrutinise them and bring in other people and other experts to look at that information again.  It was clear in respect of the national children's hospital project that the business case was not just flung on my desk and I brought it to Government the next week.  It went through a very deliberative and intense process.</p> <p>  It now appears, however, that some of the information we were given appears to have been fundamentally wrong.  When this issue was at its height, I heard the Taoiseach ask if this was a case of taxpayers' money being wasted or was it that the project was always going to cost more and we were given the wrong figures.  The PwC report has largely come down on the latter view.  It found that there was not a massive waste of taxpayers' money.  There was, however, a significant error in calculating an accurate cost.  That is astonishing when we depend on such experts.</p></speech>

I will explain why.  If I was coming in here today and the project was ahead of schedule and &euro;200 million under budget I would be taking credit for that, and so would the Deputy if he was the Minister.  The good has to be taken with the bad in government.  We put experts in place and so did my predecessors.  They were good, decent hard-working people with expertise.  Something clearly went wrong.  The PwC report has given us an indication of where that might lie.  The board needs to reflect very seriously on that, including on the contracts it may have had.</p></speech>

They became aware in April that there was an issue with a potential cost overrun.  Ms Tracey Conroy asked for a memo to be sent to the Minister in, I believe, May.  That memo did not reach the Minister until August, yet the board was reappointed in June.  I do not know if Mr. Breslin or Mr. Desmond want to answer this question, but one of the questions I have is why those issues were not brought to the Minister's attention knowing that the board was being reappointed in June and that there were issues that had not crystallised but which we knew would arise in regard to cost overruns.  There was a request by an official in the Minister's Department that a memo be sent to him prior to the reappointment of the board.  That memo was not sent.  The Minister went away and reappointed the entire board.  He did not ask any questions of the board because he clarified that in a reply to a parliamentary question.  A request was submitted and he decided that he would reappoint the board members.  There were no questions asked and progress reports were not requested, yet Mr. Desmond and Mr. Breslin were both aware of the position.  I accept they would not have been aware of the extent of the overrun at that point but they would have been aware that issues were coming down the line.  Why did Mr. Breslin and Mr. Desmond not convey that to the Minister given that one of their colleagues had asked for a memo to be sent to him?</p></speech>

I am accountable to the Oireachtas and my officials are accountable to me.  I am satisfied that my officials behaved entirely appropriately during this and the reason I am satisfied is because the PwC report does not find anything to the contrary and actually finds that their work, and this is my clear interpretation of what it found, was impeded and impaired as a result of some of the failures that happened - let us call it - further down the line.</p> <p>  Regarding the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, and in fairness the Deputy raised this a number of times before the PwC report so he has a consistent record on this, which I acknowledge, the PwC report finds that a changing of the board could have caused a bigger problem, so the right decision was to reappoint the board.  The question I am asking, and I am asking it now as opposed to answering it but I will be asking it of Mr. Barry and considering it with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I will be reporting to Government in due course on an implementation plan, is about the information the development board received when it hired quantity surveyors who hired other people to cost the project.  On page 4 of this report PwC finds that there were - I have to be careful with my words - very peculiar ways of going about some of the business there that did cause difficulty.  There is quite a detailed chapter that shows that as well.</p></speech>

Nowhere in the report does it suggest that there was a difficulty with information flow.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#G01700"><p>Despite all of that, and this is my final comment, we had an official from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sitting on that particular board.  That raises even more concerns for me given the position he held within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and what this report states in terms of the information that was coming forward to the steering group and the ability of the steering group and the programme group to act on that information.  The difficulty is that we have a board which, in my opinion, this report questions in terms of its capability.  That is my reading of the report.  We have a situation where we need additional members and additional expertise brought in and the difficulty is that people do not have confidence in the current board.  I certainly do not have confidence in the current board given what I have read in the report.  The report also states that we can have a widespread clear-out, but the question is how that is managed and how we regain that credibility in the development board without having a complete clear-out and leaving in place some of the individuals who were directly responsible, in my opinion, for some of the failings and the fiascos we face.</p></speech>

The report is clear, and I agree with the Deputy on this point, that the governance structures need to be strengthened.  The board will need to be strengthened and I will act on that as well.</p> <p>  There is also an interesting and important recommendation in the report - I believe it is recommendation No. 11 - about the need for Government as a whole or the public service to get a challenge function for future projects.  We are building a children's hospital.  I want to build a new national maternity hospital.  I want to start that later this year.  The Government will want to do the metro project and, I hope, broadband provision.  There will be other major projects, and what the report is suggesting, and the good thing about bringing in orders is that they are meant to show us how to improve processes, is that we need to create a more proactive, challenging structure and that we need to have the expertise.</p> <p>  I will give the Deputy an initial view.  Since the establishment of the HSE, my Department does not have a building unit.  I have a chief medical officer - we have been talking about him - a chief nursing officer and a chief dentist.  I am sure I have a chief of other things as well in the Department of Health.  I do not have somebody who is a chief construction officer or who can give me an expert view on quantity surveying, QS, and the likes.  Perhaps having those functions available would help provide a further layer of scrutiny and challenge.  We need to reflect on that.  There is a need to strengthen the skill set further in my Department and in other Departments.  That is not to be disrespectful to anyone in the Department.</p> <p>  I and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will take the four weeks.  We would welcome the committee's input and we will be back to Government, ultimately, to publish an implementation plan-----</p></speech>

I point out that we need to examine the rest of the agenda as well because it is a very important and expensive budget and one that has required further attention as the year goes by.</p> <p>  To dispense with the other two subjects first, when we have the benefit of hindsight, we generally are correct in everything.  It is a case of 20-20 vision afterwards.  However, we should remember one thing about the cervical smear tests.  It was not the greatest day in the delivery of services to the women who tried to avail of those services when it transpired that some of them were not told the outcome.  At one stage somebody said there should be a pause and their health suffered.  A considerable number of women still have not had their issues resolved.  We tend to dismiss the seriousness of that with the passage of time.  I have no doubt that the obvious thing to do was err on the side of safety and take whatever steps had to be taken to ensure that reassurance was given to all the women who wanted it - the counselling and the GP service - and on the basis of that advice either to have another test, which many of them did not have, or not have one.  That was the right decision and milling around with it afterwards is playacting.  We can spend the next 12 months doing that but it will not change the reality of the issue, namely, that there were serious problems, some of which still exist in regard to the speed with which tests are carried out and in regard to the various laboratories.  This was an appalling thing to happen and it should have not happened, but we must remember that that system was not put in place last month or last year but several years ago.</p><p>Some of us did not think it was very wise at the time, but it was there and it did serve its purpose in the sense that it did save the lives of many women.  That has already been illustrated again and again.  It is a bit like the Minister taking responsibility for the bad news and the good news.  We in the House, in general, have to do the same thing.  It did address the issues in so far as many women were concerned in general.  We know that it was not an accurate diagnostic procedure.  Notwithstanding disclosure decisions, full disclosure still does not seem to take place.  I cannot understand why that is but that is a matter for another day.  Ultimately, in the courts evidence emerged to the effect that there was a considerable neglect of the procedures that should have taken place in the interests of health and safety and of women who were the subject of particular tests.  It would be totally unacceptable if anything other than moving everything that could be done to ensure that those women who still have a question mark in their minds over their health should be reassured because the panic causes other problems as well for women.  I am weary of listening to the same story over and over again.  We need to improve the quality and veracity of the tests and the speed with which the results are obtained but going back over what happened in the past 20 years will not solve that problem.  We all should recognise that the extent to which women were traumatised and women's health and lives were put in jeopardy was totally unacceptable.</p><p> I do not wish to continue for as long as my colleagues, which is not to suggest for a moment that they should curtail their outbursts in future.  I will, however, try to deal with the children's hospital insofar as I can.  One of the issues I raised in the committee at the very outset is that there was a number of boards sitting in parallel, as it were.  I was not satisfied that the degree of discussion between those boards was adequate, and I am still not satisfied that is the case.  The fact is that in a project of that size when one has a number of bodies all dealing with the same project and all, hopefully, going in the same direction, there needs to be a common membership, which is not the case.  That is my opinion; it is not an expert opinion.  With common membership then the various parts of the jigsaw, as it were, are all alert to what is happening all of the time.</p><p> There has been misleading information throughout the entire debate.  I have not seen the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report at all and I have not read any part of it.  Unfortunately, I had other things to do as well in recent days, as I am sure everybody else did.  I believe the original estimate of the cost was wrong.  It did not take into account the magnitude of the project and therein lies a flaw in the system.  When any other projects are being undertaken we need to know the cost at the very beginning.  There are prime cost, PC, sums added in all construction projects that would enable the committee, the Minister, the HSE or whatever the case may be, to come to a conclusion if something is going in the right direction or something is going wrong.  It would appear from what I have heard of the PwC report that issues arose that should and could have been nobbled at a much earlier stage.  What would happen as a result of that is another thing.  It might well have brought a halt to the entire project, and I am not so sure that would be a good idea.</p><p> This is the second or third attempt at providing a children's hospital, site-wise, and in every other way.  An attempt was made previously to superimpose it on the Mater Hospital but that did not work.  There was much debate about it at the time but An Bord Plean&aacute;la made the decision in the end.  A lot of money was wasted.  A lot of money was spent on that particular endeavour.  I asked questions at the time about whether the initial expenditure could be of benefit in the subsequent sites with a view to using whatever information we had gleaned from the first episode but it did not happen other than to a small extent.</p><p> We must make another decision as well.  An attempt was made by the board and the HSE to curtail what looked like an overrun in comparison to the original estimates but at that stage it was probably too late.  It would have caused a major hiccup and the project to be abandoned.  That would not be in the interests of anybody, certainly not the interests of children or value for money, which is something with which this committee does not deal and nor should it, as we have a policy role.  I cannot understand how it transpired, if a quantity surveyor's report was available at the very beginning, that the estimate for the original costing emerged, based on the information that was available at the time.  Perhaps we could get more information on that.</p></speech>

I reiterate that that was the basis on which I made the decision for the repeat smear test, namely, to endeavour to provide reassurance women were already seeking.  Whether I issued a press release or did it or not, they were going to seek reassurance because women make their own decisions about their own healthcare.  I thought that was a place we had moved to in this country and it was a good place in which to be.</p> <p>  I am pleased Deputy Durkan mentioned open disclosure because it is something on which we can all agree.  At the heart of the CervicalCheck debacle was the failure to openly disclose.  It was about non-disclosure.  We are now legislating through the patient safety Bill, which the committee has considered at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  The Bill is on the Government priority list and will legislate for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable incidents.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made some valid points about governance.  As I said to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, there will clearly be a need to strengthen the governance.  Of that there is no doubt and the report is very specific in that regard.  It also talks about the need for closer alignment, as we move closer to the opening of the project, between the Children's Health Ireland board, which is the group within the health service that will run the hospital and the build board, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  That becomes all the more important when we consider that the Connolly part of the hospital will open this year.  We are still having a debate in the Oireachtas about whether it is the right site and other such matters when the Connolly part is opening and the St. James's part is well under way.  There are approximately 400 people working on the site and more than &euro;200 million has been spent.  How I square that circle in terms of recognising that they both have separate functions and roles with the view of PwC that there needs to be closer alignment between them is something I will reflect on in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Reference was made to cost reduction.  I acknowledge that Deputy Donnelly asked that it would be included in the terms of reference and it was specifically included at his request.  The report is clear that the opportunities are limited.  On page 6 it states that the cost reduction opportunities are limited because 85% of the budget is already contractually committed, which suggests that the focus of the board should now be on reducing further the risk for additional costs at this stage.  That is where I hope its focus will be.  It does say that there is a technical possibility of reducing some costs but they would need to be offset against any risks.  When I meet Mr. Barry I will ask that the board formally consider that and give me its view in relation to that.</p></speech>

I know the Minister referred to governance.  I believe the linkage between the people with responsibilities was inadequate.  How they were brought together and how often they meet are questions about which I automatically have concerns.  I put that question to them previously and some of those present as well.  The answer was to the effect that they were kept up to date but it sounded like it happened on a monthly basis, which is not nearly enough for a project like this.  These things shift very rapidly and things can change suddenly.  Waiting for a monthly meeting at which one updates one's colleagues about something is not the way to do it.  In some cases, it could be more than a month.  It could be two months depending on the time the meetings took place.  I am not sure if the Minister wants to address that as well.</p> <p>  Regarding future overruns, if we are dealing with a quantity surveyor's picture, we should know fairly well where we are going early on.  The extent to which future overruns can take place must be minimised for a range of reasons.  If there is some mystery about what the future holds for us in this scenario, it is dangerous.  Notwithstanding the PwC report and its benefits, which we all accept, unless we have found a way to ensure that the contract prices we are now looking at are stable, will remain stable or will escalate, we will all be at fault because it could be alleged at some later stage that we discussed this and something happened afterwards.  I ask that this question be addressed in particular.  I assume we did not get an accurate estimate of the quantities involved in the beginning.  They were not available or we proceeded before we should have.  We need to be far more accurate from now on when it comes to all the quantities involved and any changes that might take place.  If changes take place, we need to know about that and for what purpose.  Otherwise we could face another problem.</p></speech>

I will start with the national children's hospital.  I have not read the entire report yet but something in it under governance neatly sums it all up.  The report stated that:</p><blockquote>The level of trust that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) placed on the National Paediatric Hospital (NPH) executive and design team gave rise to insufficient scepticism and challenge.  The structures above the NPHDB became reactive, limited by their terms of reference.  </blockquote> <p>I have read the executive summary and the recommendations.  The price is now reflective of the quality of the project and what is being put forward as to what is going to be above the ground.  The Taoiseach said the report made for grim reading and I am sure the Minister did not find the report overly pleasant.  The board was in place to be accountable to the taxpayers of Ireland.  When we see fancy designs, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, and when we see big glass curvy buildings, that is just an architect's dream.  That is when people with a specific remit, which is design, go down that route.  Usually, in a project, there are quantity surveyors on both sides.  A group of quantity surveyors acts for the client while another group acts for the builder and some other contractor.  Somewhere along the line, it is decided to how much money will be spent on a metre of cable or whatever the basic product is.  My interpretation of this is that it was almost free rein, there was no challenge to the design and, therefore, by the time the design was done and set in stone, it was too late to pull back.  I believe the Minister made the correct decision.  I know Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said he probably had no choice but to make that decision but, as Deputy Durkan said, this project was first mentioned in 1962.  For so long, we have said that we are desperately in need of a children's hospital.  The Minister made the right decision and it was the only decision to make.  If he had made a different decision at the end of last year, this hospital would never be built.  It definitely would not be built in my lifetime or his.  Despite the political challenges, historic and current, and despite the hospital and medical politics and every other form of politics, delivering this will, hopefully, be key to what the Minister has done along with the rest of his achievements to date.  </p><p>That does not take from the fact that for taxpayers and all of us, when there is a large sum and the report basically says that the people representing us on the board did not challenge, it is annoying.  It is frustrating because it seems obvious that if we were talking about a big fancy curvy glass building, a quantity surveyor on our or the taxpayers' side would say, &quot;Hold on now a second, is there a need for that many curves or that much glass or is there need for that much aluminium?&quot;  That is normally what happens.  That is what people find so frustrating in light of some of the overruns in the past.  They find it frustrating that it does not appear that the people we were paying - the quantity surveyors acting on behalf of the HSE, the board or the taxpayer who are, ultimately, supposed to represent good value for money - did this for us.  What recourse exists when the State pays fees to a professional body to act on its behalf in an expert role and that body does not do its job right?  </p><p>We have discussed CervicalCheck and the capacity issue for so long but, again, like the national children's hospital, it is worth remembering where CervicalCheck has come from.  I imagine that the Chairman is very much aware of the pushback 15 years ago when cervical screening and HPV vaccination became possible.  I remember a particular bishop in the south of Ireland suggesting that HPV vaccination or cervical screening would not be needed if women led pure and chaste lives so we have come a significant distance from that sort of rhetoric to where we are now.  I think I am correct that as a result of cervical screening, 65,000 women have had issues picked up which required minor intervention up to and including invasive treatment.  I think I heard the Minister say that in the Chamber.  If the Minister who brought that in had not been brave enough to have done that back in the day, some of those 65,000 women would be dead while some of them would be incapable of having children or would have varying degrees of complexities as a result of no intervention.  </p><p>There was commentary last week about suspending the system.  There was a lot of discussion regarding other countries that ramped up capacity in cervical screening before they brought in HPV screening.  I am not here to advise the Minister as there seems to be so many people who advise him, but given the amount that has been invested in cervical screening and the amount of personal capital invested by progressive Ministers for Health over the years, it would be the wrong decision to pull back in any way on a system that has had a positive impact on 65,000 women and the others who did not have a negative result.</p><p>I mentioned it here last week.  We were operating in an information vacuum when it broke.  We did not know who owned the slides and, in the immediate instance, whether they were in the custody of a laboratory.  We did not know if it was a standards issue in the laboratory and what the reason was for the emerging cases.  That caused huge fear, about which I have spoken and there is no need for me to repeat what I said.  How does the Minister for Health reassure women and their families in some cases, given that there was destructive commentary from many sections, with people talking about a misdiagnosis and using terms that were not reflective of the situation?  What is the best way to reassure them?  Is it by sending them a note?  Is it by putting an advertisement on television?  Is it by running a radio advertisement on Newstalk?  In the following week or two weeks, would it have been of any benefit to me or any other woman of my age to listen to an advertisement on Newstalk: "Don't worry women of Ireland.  You are in safe hands.  Cool off.  There is no need to go to the doctor"?  It is my personal view that neither the public health nurse nor the community pharmacist was skilled to deliver this reassurance.  The only person who was capable of delivering it - with no offence to the Minister - was the GP.  The Minister and I are not medical doctors.  The level of reassurance required had to be given because we were in an information vacuum, something which seems to have been forgotten.  Reassurance is sometimes very personal.  If somebody had a history, including a family history, she might have needed a level of reassurance that was greater than that for somebody else.  The Minister might speak to the reassurance issue. </p><p> On vaccines, what are we going to do about the massive drop in measles vaccination rates?  We have been very successful with the HPV, with the help of Laura Brennan, the Department and various others, which has meant we have got the rate back up to over 70%.  However, it is a little late when there are wards and isolation units full of children infected by measles, at which stage, it is out of control.  We can have problems with Brexit and the national children's hospital, but if there is a measles outbreak where the patches and pockets join up across Ireland, we will have something far bigger than Brexit, the national children's hospital or whatever other issue with which we are dealing.  Babies and those who are immuno-compromised will actually die, while children will be left with life-limiting conditions as a result of infections.  We can spend all of the money we want on health services, but if the basic fundamentals of protecting population health are not maintained, there will have been a huge waste of money since vaccines were invented.  I know that the Minister has a commentary in the newspaper today, although I have not yet read the article.  He might speak to that issue in terms of how we protect the population and get value for the money we have invested.  There would obviously be a massive cost if there was to be a massive outbreak of measles.</p></speech>

On the issue of cervical cancer, it is something on which we are all united.  We can effectively eradicate it.  There are many diseases about which we cannot say this, but it is one we can eradicate.  I used to refer to the huge progress made in Australia and New Zealand, but now I need only refer to Scotland, a much nearer neighbour.  I was only reading last week about the huge progress it was making.  We know how to do it.  The one good thing to come out of all of this - we always want something good to come out it - is that it is now our national aim to eradicate cervical cancer within a generation.  We know how to do it, namely, through HPV testing and vaccination and continuing to invest in screening.  That is a very important point to make.  I am very pleased that the Deputy acknowledged the progressive moves made by some of my predecessors in that regard.  We were in opposition at the time and, with the benefit of hindsight, I think Mary Harney was given an awfully hard time, although perhaps that is just the way it goes when one is Minister for Health.  However, if we actually look at some of the decisions she took, we owe her a huge debt of gratitude for the work she did in cancer care in the Governments of which she was a part.  The decision she took on the cervical screening programme is one that has saved lives.  When one is Minister for Health, one often takes a decision today and will only begins to see the positive impact in the following years.  I hope some of the decisions we have taken collectively, be it in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, on women's reproductive rights, the things we are going to do in the assisted human reproduction Bill or the extension of the HPV vaccine to boys, will, in time, when there will be a different Minister for Health sitting here, have had similar public health benefits.  I wanted to acknowledge her contribution.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell again hit the nail on the head in saying there was an information vacuum in the CervicalCheck crisis.  Understandably, women were worried.  They were not worried irrationally.  Nobody could have said, hand on heart, that the screening programme was safe.  What do we do to try to provide that reassurance?  We brought in a brilliant expert in Dr. Gabriel Scally who did a superb job.  However, what do we do in the interim?  What we do is support women in making decisions that they want to make for themselves on their personal health.  They, not me, were making the decision to go to their GP because that is what anyone does when he or she is concerned about his or her health, as the Chairman knows as he is a GP.  The question is, when a woman is sitting looking at her doctor, what can he or she do?  He or she can do what he or she is meant to do, that is, provide factual information and try to reassure.  In the case of many of the 110,000 women - pretty much the majority but at least 50% - this satisfied their concern and they decided they did not need a repeat smear test.  In 57,000 cases the woman decided this in consultation with her GP and who the hell are we to second-guess that decision?  How offensive is it to "mansplain" what went on in those consultations, or endeavour to suggest, as I heard someone say on the floor of the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday, that it was unnecessary?  The woman had had a consultation with her doctor and decided, in the round, that having a repeat smear test was the appropriate thing to do.  My only job was to fund it, which was the least we could do.</p> <p>  There is a point to be made about learning when there is a public health crisis.  I have put up my hands in that regard and conceded that I made mistakes.  Sadly, I am in a lonely place in that regard because many others have not done the same, despite Dr. Scally's findings about the frenzied political and media environment at the time.  What do we do when there is a public health crisis in providing reassurance?  The Chief Medical Officer showed what we should do.  He showed huge leadership, went on national television and brought clinicians together.  However, in my words - not his - it was a somewhat lonely place to be in.  We need to look at what we will do the next time and there will be a next time when there will be another crisis in the public health service.</p> <p>  On the issue of vaccination, I am unapologetically pro-vaccine.  Like the Deputy, I have very little time for misinformation and the nonsense spread about vaccination.  It saves lives.  Unfortunately, the misinformation on vaccines is not just an irritant, it is also costing lives.  As the Deputy rightly said, it is costing the health of many children.  Nonetheless, I need to set the matter in context.  It is worth saying there is still a very good uptake rate under the child immunisation programme.  We have a target of 95% this year.  I think it was 92.5% last year.  Therefore, the overwhelming majority of parents are deciding that they should vaccinate their kids.  I was asked in recent weeks to look at what was being done in other countries in Europe and some parts of the United States where enrolment in school was being linked with vaccination.  I have not definitively said that is what we must do, but Ireland should be part of that debate.  There is a discussion happening across the European Union about what should be done in dealing with the issue of vaccination.  If parents decide not to vaccinate their child, they will sending him or her unvaccinated to a school or creche where potentially he or she will spread illness.  I intend to look at what other European countries are doing in that regard.  I know that Italy and the state of New York made some changes recently.  While the health committee has a very busy agenda, in due course it might like to hold hearings on how we can proactively use all levers, as a public service, to promote vaccination.  As parents, there is a responsibility on us that is greater than our responsibility to our kids.  There is also a responsibility to the children of others.  Sending a child to school unvaccinated is extraordinarily irresponsible and dangerous.  As I said, Ireland needs to be part of the debate that is happening across the European Union.</p></speech>

In Crumlin hospital there are kids going around wearing masks.</p><p>There seems to be a level of unawareness of how serious measles can be.</p><p> There was an outbreak of mumps in some of our universities recently.  The Minister briefly mentioned the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill and it is important to point out that there is a knock-on effect on the fertility for young men affected by mumps in university.  People may avoid being fertile in college to some extent but, in the future, they may look to have children when they  settle down.  There has to be pushback for the patient or child who was not vaccinated to gain knowledge of the effects that can have on one's life in the future.  Are there plans to make young men realise that, if they were not vaccinated as a child, there could be a serious problem in their future, which could have massive knock-on effects on their lives and hopes?</p></speech>

The HSE, in fairness to it, is a good organisation that gets much criticism for many issues.  It has stepped up in promoting vaccination and the national immunisation office has done a good job with powerful patient advocates on the issue of cervical cancer and we think particularly of the late Ms Laura Brennan who did so much.</p> <p>  We often hear accusations that we are a nanny state and all this sort of nonsense.  This is life and death, health and public good.  We have vaccinations which have effectively eradicated diseases so that people of my generation think we should only read about in history books.  Diseases are beginning to come back due to the misinformation being spread, often through social media, although not exclusively, and we need to be on that pitch and pushing back.  We all need to work together on it.  The HPV alliance was a good example of politicians, clinicians and patient advocates coming together and we need to look at other examples of that.  We should not rule out any measure.  We need to say we will explore every and any measure to ensure vaccination is the norm.  We all need to realise it is not just a personal decision an individual is making for his or her child because it has an impact on other people's children.  Vaccinations only work when there is herd immunity and enough people are vaccinated.   </p> <p>  I welcome any guidance from the committee on this.  I intend to speak to my EU counterparts about what is being done in other countries to consider how we approach schools, cr&egrave;ches and places where our children go on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has contracts for professional services with professional bodies on our behalf, effectively, as taxpayers.  My initial reading of this report from PwC, which was brought in as a financial auditor, raises questions about the accuracy of some of the information that was given which then had a complete knock-on effect in the cost estimation.  The PwC report does not find that there was a waste of taxpayers' money but it does find that this project was always going to cost more than we thought.</p> <p>  Page 4 of the report suggests that some of the information given had material errors in it.  There are significant questions for some professional companies to answer and I do not intend to go further than that today but I intend to meet with the chair of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to get his view on that and I presume the board will seek advice on this and I hope they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#L00500"><p>I come back to the Estimates, the topic for today.  The briefing document states that funding has been provided for CervicalCheck and the introduction of HPV testing as a primary screening test.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on that and how close are we to moving towards HPV testing, which will revolutionise the screening programme and reduce the burden on cytology which is the reason there is such a large backlog.</p> <p>  There is a new subhead within the Estimates relating to Sl&aacute;intecare.  Some &euro;206 million has been allocated to Sl&aacute;intecare, much of which is money that was announced and relates to mental health, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the GP contract, etc.  There is no reference in the Estimates to a transitional fund, which was a recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is an integration fund but no reference to transitional funding which is so important to getting Sl&aacute;intecare off the ground.  The Minister might comment on that.</p> <p>  There is an allocation of &euro;24 million in the Department of Health's capital spending to comprise part of the &euro;99 million that will be required this year to fund the national children's hospital.  What re-profiling will take place within the Department of Health and its capital plan?  The national service plan, in its commentary, states the HSE will have difficulty maintaining existing services this year and will have very little money, perhaps &euro;198 million, for new developments in the health service.  The plan highlights that there may be difficulties in meeting its budget target this year.  The Minister might comment on that.</p> <p>  The development of the individual health identifier and electronic health record are catalysts for change and implementing Sl&aacute;intecare.  According to the briefing document, an additional &euro;25 million has been allocated to ICT for this year, bringing its allocation up to &euro;85 million.  When does the Minister think the individual health identifier and electronic health record will be rolled out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#L00600"><p>I will try and take those questions in sequence.  The Chairman is correct that there is not a specific transition fund in this year's Estimate and that is a fact.  There are a number of areas where significant resources are being spent on Sl&aacute;intecare measures, which I believe passionately in.  The culture change that needs to happen, and is happening, in the HSE and the Department means that everything we need to do is in the direction of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I will come back to the transition fund shortly.  The decisions to reduce the drugs payment scheme cap and prescription charges were taken directly from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The money for the GP contract, of which &euro;27 million will be spent this year, is funding that was held in my Department that is in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  The measures that GPs are agreeing to in return in integrating with primary care, medicines management, waiting list validation, e-health and, from January, chronic disease management, are Sl&aacute;intecare in action.</p> <p>  The Chairman referenced this but there is some degree of transition funding for the e-health and ICT areas and I will come back with a timeframe for those in a moment.  That is, no doubt, classified as Sl&aacute;intecare and is transition funding.  I have an integration fund this year.  I expect that, now that has been created as a discrete area of expenditure, we can look to increase it significantly next year.  That is my aim.  There is &euro;20 million in it this year but it would be unfair to suggest that we are only spending that on Sl&aacute;intecare because other elements are also clearly delivering Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  Much work has been done.  Sl&aacute;intecare has begun to come alive in the past number of weeks.  There is a briefing for members of the committee today with the director of the Sl&aacute;intecare office.  It is now up and running and 2019 is the first year of it in action.</p> <p>  We are preparing the HSE capital plan by engaging with both the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform now.  I expect to publish the report shortly after Easter.  Being blunt and honest, I am trying to arrive at a point where I publish more than just the 2019 capital plan for obvious reasons.  The published 2019 capital plan will give a piece of the picture but people in every constituency will want to know if the many projects that will start in 2019 will be built in 2020.  Sending projects out to design or tender is one thing but people will want to know if the Government has the money to build them in 2020 or 2021.  I am endeavouring to publish a plan for two or three years hence and it is complex.  If we take the Chairman's part of the country as an example, we want to show not just the modular build for University Hospital Limerick but the profiling for that funding for the next couple of years.  I expect that the committee will invite me back in May to discuss the capital plan that I expect to have published by then.  There is intense work going on to achieve that at the moment.</p><p> With regard to the reprofiling, the Department of Health was asked to make a &euro;24 million contribution this year.  That has come out of the minor works fund in the HSE, which replaces a piece of equipment or the like as it is required to be replaced.  There is still more in that fund this year than there was last year, and we have been able to ensure that all projects that are contracted and under way are continuing.  I have not had to delay a project or say something will not happen because of the national children's hospital.  That is thanks to the collective work of Cabinet colleagues and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, in that regard.</p><p> Can I get you a note on the individual health identifier and the e-health record?  My Secretary General is writing an updated note for me as we speak.  It will be rolled out in phases but I can send you a detailed note on that.</p><p> Did I miss a question?</p></speech>

Yes, there is funding this year for HPV testing.  It was allocated in budget 2019.  Mr. McCallion and Dr. Doherty will have told the committee last week that they are working to come up with a definitive timeline.  We are working towards the fourth quarter of 2019, which will be challenging.  There are a couple of moving parts involved, the big one being the tender.  We have the funding and I am working for it to be delivered this year.  The HSE is very clear that this is the policy direction and would have confirmed that to the committee last week.  It is important to point out that we will be among the first countries in the world to make this transition, although not the first.  A number of countries have done it, including the Netherlands and Australia.  There are a number of stages and I expect to receive a definitive timeline on it from the HSE in the next couple of weeks.  Everyone is working as hard as they can to bring it in by the end of the year.</p></speech>

We have not been able to discuss this previously because we have been in negotiations with GPs.  We had considerable success in securing a large investment pot for general practice.  GPs will rightly say that some of it is giving back the money they lost during the difficult years, and there is no doubt about that, but it is still a good deal above that at &euro;210 million.  That was one of the big requests I have been working on with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and of the Taoiseach.  Now that we have it secured and in place, the issue of a transition fund will be a priority for me in the next budget.</p></speech>

The Government has not taken a decision in that regard so it would be imprudent of me to speculate, but I expect that the Government will adopt a common-sense approach like we tried to adopt this year.  However, these are decisions for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and he will make them in due course.  I am endeavouring, working with his Department, to see if we can publish a two or three-year iteration for the capital budget in health.  That would be very important because it would allow us to get a number of projects under way.  There are many projects we want to get under way in health where the expenditure at the start is quite small, such as for tendering, design and planning, but it must be done when getting ready to build the project, whether that is an extension to a hospital or a new primary care centre.  I will be better able to answer some of those questions in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The briefing document outlines four different streams.  Perhaps you could expand on those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#M01700"><p>I can.  These four streams are all areas where Sl&aacute;intecare is pivoted.  Basically, we are asking, rather than telling from the top down, what people should be doing in the local health organisation.  We are asking hospitals, community health organisations and voluntary organisations to tell us what they believe they can do.  People tell me as we go around the country all the time: "I have a really good project down here and I could take some people off the waiting list" or "I could work better with the local hospital if I was able to get this technology".  We have set out the streams - right care, right place, right time and what more one can do.  These are the objectives of the scheme.  There is the scaling of current successful integration projects, patient-centred improvement projects, cross-agency collaboration and changing the model of care.</p> <p>  You are right that there are four funding streams linked to each of those actions.  The first is scaling and sharing existing examples of best practice and process for chronic disease management and care for older people.  For example, an organisation or part of the health service might be doing something very good in its community looking after older people with diabetes and it might believe that with extra investment it could scale it up or it could be replicated in a different part of the country.</p> <p>  Funding stream two is supporting scaling and sharing of existing examples of best practice approaches to reduce waiting time for consultation and treatment.  For example, and I am not pre-empting these but just giving illustrative examples, we all talk about the Sligo eye model, which did a really good job of taking a number of eye procedures and eye outpatient appointments out of the hospital and into the community.  Could that be scaled up?  We know it worked in that part of the country so why does it not work in another part of the country?</p> <p>  The third one is supporting digital innovation including patient access to health information.  Again, does one have a way of using technology to improve the delivery of health services?  The new addendum to the GP contract, for example, suggests that virtual clinics could be held.  We have one in the country at present in cardiology and it commits to another four.  It is where consultants and GPs interact about individual patients.  Is there a digital solution to help implement Sl&aacute;intecare?</p> <p>  The last is supporting new approaches in the community, industry and voluntary sectors.  We should not believe that the public health service has all the answers because many of our health services are being delivered by voluntary operators.  People are being invited to pitch their ideas.  They have until 18 April to send in the ideas and I expect we will allocate the funding in May.</p></speech>

On the last occasion the Minister appeared before the committee, I asked a question about the decision to offer the free out-of-cycle smear tests and who gave the Minister that advice.  After pressing him for a while the Minister said it was his idea but that it was supported and agreed by the chief medical officer.  There was no caveat attached to that.  The question asked at the time was about a free blanket offer to any woman who wanted one.  The Minister told the committee that the chief medical officer supported what was essentially the Minister's idea and decision, that nobody else advised him to do that and that he had come up with the idea himself.  However, new evidence has come to light that the chief medical officer did not support a blanket offer of free smear tests to everybody.</p></speech>

I am just framing my next question.  Does the Minister still stand over the evidence he gave to the committee that day, that his decision was supported by the chief medical officer, in light of Dr. Flannelly's evidence?  In addition, what advice did Mr. Tony O'Brien give the Minister on Sunday, 29 April?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#M02400"><p>I answered some of the question previously but I welcome the chance to answer it again.  I am somewhat uneasy with other people speaking or suggesting that they are speaking for my chief medical officer.  The chief medical officer in the Department and I are <i>ad idem</i>on this, as are my officials.  Deputy Chambers does not have to take my word for it.  My Department at official level, not me, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle in response to the Deputy's party leader's parliamentary questions.  I believe the letter was sent on 12 February but it was certainly sent in February.  As I said to Deputy Donnelly earlier, the letter says that the Minister's decision and announcement on 28 April were consistent with the advice received from his officials, and the advice of the chief medical officer to the Minister was reflected in the press statement that issued on 28 April.</p><p>I will move on the question about Dr. Flannelly and Mr. O'Brien, but I wish to be clear that the chief medical officer supported the decision I made.</p><p>As I said earlier, our text messages were even subject to freedom of information requests and published in a newspaper.  We were in very regular contact on this.  He, I and my Department believed it was the appropriate thing to do, not in a normal time but in these exceptional times.  The Deputy used the word "evidence."  There was never evidence that I intended to provide a blanket offer.  I do not even know what the phrase "blanket offer" means.  I do not need to explain to any woman that smear tests are carried out by healthcare professionals.  Women go to see healthcare professionals.  There was only ever one decision implemented.  There has been a lot of focus on my tweet.  My Department tweeted as well moments later and also outlined how the process would work.  A press statement was issued from my Department that night.  A fee was agreed with GPs.  Some 110,000 women went to their GP and only 57,000 of them decided to get the repeat smear after that engagement.  The Deputy has not said so today but others have said it in recent days; it would be wrong to suggest that a repeat smear was unnecessary when a woman and her GP decided together that it was the appropriate course of action, which was the case for 57,000 women but not for the other approximately 50%.</p><p> The Deputy asked me about Mr. O'Brien.  I do not recall Mr. O'Brien saying that to me.  That is not to say he did not do so; he may well have.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the interview on the Marian Finucane show.  I think Mr. O'Brien said that he believed he told me that we should walk it back. I do not recall that conversation.  Perhaps he did.  At the time, the Deputy's party was planning on backing a motion of no confidence to remove him from his job.  That was how Fianna F&aacute;il viewed him and his position at that time.  </p></speech>

I do not recall Mr. O'Brien having a conversation with me.  That is not to say that he did not.  We had many conversations.  The reality of the situation is that I take my medical advice from the chief medical officer, who is a doctor.  I had lost confidence in the management of CervicalCheck.  I do not wish to speak for Deputy Lisa Chambers but I presume she had, too; certainly most women in the country and most politicians had.  I had expressed no confidence in it and was taking my advice from my Department officials, who stepped up to the plate and were doing a superb job in the middle of a major public health crisis of confidence.  That is where I took my advice from.  I have heard this put forward, too.  The moment I received advice from my officials was in October.  I accepted their advice on that day and we communicated our decision to the HSE on that day in writing.  The HSE said it wanted to continue it until the end of December for operational reasons, which was logical because people had booked their tests.  When my officials advised me to stop the test, which was after the publication of Dr. Scally's report, we conveyed our decision to stop it immediately.</p></speech>

On the last occasion I asked the Minister whether, prior to taking that decision, anybody advised him against it or warned of any potential problems.  The Minister answered, "not to my recollection".  I said, "not one voice" and the Minister said, "not to my recollection".  That is becoming less credible as time moves on.  It does appear there were communications to the Department from CervicalCheck.  Tony O'Brien's evidence and his word are that he asked the Minister to walk it back or pull back from that decision.  It is not just that there was one instance of advice that this could go wrong or could have negative consequences for the programme; there were multiple voices.  I believe the Minister heard those voices before the Cabinet memo of 1 May.  That still does not answer the question as to why, after making that decision, the Minister consulted with CervicalCheck basically directing it that this was his decision, without looking at the capacity or the resources.  It is pretty obvious even for an ordinary citizen who is not the Minister for Health that making an offer of this nature is going to increase demand.  That is pretty obvious.</p></speech>

Regrettably, it is now looking as though it could be 2020 or 2021 before that comes into being.  When I pushed on why it was not being made available sooner, the answer I was given was that decisions of this nature must be based on clinical evidence and they must be safe.  The Minister's decision was to offer what I consider to be a blanket, free out-of-cycle smear regardless.  That is what the Minister's tweet did say.  My view on Twitter is that if the Minister chooses to use it to communicate a message, he is responsible for how it is taken up.  Perhaps it is not the best way for a Cabinet Minister to conduct his affairs.  That is a matter for the Minister, however.</p></speech>

That is my view.  What I find completely incredible is that the Minister did not review that decision until October.  May, June, July, August and September make five months.  On the last occasion the Minister was before this committee, he said he was engaging with CervicalCheck almost on a fortnightly basis.  He said himself that he would have been aware of the backlog when it arose.  That backlog was quite evident from at least August onwards.  The Minister decided to do nothing.  I know he is going to refer to the Scally report.  I do not really care about the Scally report right now.  The report does not stop the Minister from doing his job.  He is not bound by the Scally report, nor can he hide behind it.  If that backlog was evident to the Minister at least in August - we will give him that much - how did he leave it until October to make the call to end the free out-of-cycle smears?  He only made that call because CervicalCheck wrote to him on 21 October to ask him to stop because he was crashing the system.</p> <p>  Even when he made the decision, it was not implemented until December.  Not only did he make a bad decision initially for the wrong reasons, because he was under political pressure, he made it without the proper advice.  He did not consult the actual organisation that was going to carry out his promise.  I cannot understand that.  Even if the Minister had no confidence in them, the free smears he was giving out were being sent to CervicalCheck anyway.  That makes no sense.  If the Minister is saying he did not have confidence and did not want to consult them but he had no problem directing another 100,000 women to their doors, it does not add up.  He went a full five months without reviewing the decision, knowing the backlog was building; I do not know how the Minister can stand behind such inaction.  That inaction allowed the backlog to build and build, and the Minister still has not sorted out capacity.  Can the Minister outline to me how he can justify waiting until October to make that decision, whatever about not implementing it until December because people had booked in?  The Minister could have dealt with those who were already booked rather than taking new bookings so I do not buy that either, frankly.  Why did the Minister wait so long?  If he answers with "Scally report" as he did on the last occasion, I ask him to keep it brief.</p></speech>

The president of the National Association of General Practitioners, someone the Deputy and her party cite quite regularly as having an expert view on primary care, stated again this week that he believed it was the right decision because many women were sitting in front of GPs looking for reassurance.  I will not take the committee's time repeating what I already read into the record earlier.  General practitioners were put in an impossible position and if I had not taken that decision, confidence in the screening programme would have dwindled further.  The Deputy and I have different views on this and I reckon we are always going to have them.  I am reassured that my decision was appropriate considering the exceptional times we are in, based on what I hear from GPs and on what I hear from women who availed of this.  I appreciate that the Deputy has a different view.  There does seem to be a premise to the Deputy's question that had I not offered this, women were not going to seek it anyway.</p></speech>

Women were already going to their GPs.  Women were turning up at their GP looking for reassurance, 110,000 of them.  I made the decision not just about the repeat smear but also a free GP visit, which is different from the normal screening service protocol.  I decided to offer a free consultation with the GP and, if the GP believed it to be necessary, a repeat smear.  Some 110,000 women took that up.  They did not do so because they listen to every word I say.  They did so because they wanted to talk to their GP.  I genuinely believe that was the right thing to do.  I believe women would have gone otherwise and that women who could afford to go were going anyway.  I have heard from many women who went private anyway.  This was a case of who was going to pay and whether we were going to allow women who could afford to pay to have it and deny others who could not.  Many in opposition and in the Deputy's own party called on me to do just this.  Many Opposition spokespeople on health called on me to do so and they maintain the position that, while they criticise me for many things, this was still the right decision.  Others take a different view.</p> <p>  I do not hide behind the Scally report, to be clear.</p><p>We arrived at a point where we could provide the much-needed reassurance in our screening service when Dr. Scally's report came out.  That is why, following consultation with my officials, I suggested that we would then stop the thing.  I will take the criticism from Deputy Chambers on the period from October to December because I think there could be some validity in that.  I would need to reflect further on why the HSE decided to go to December.  Could it have been handled better?  I have an open mind on that and the Deputy may have a degree of legitimate criticism of me on that issue.  However, I will genuinely never believe that this was the wrong decision.  I reckon we will never agree on this.  I believe it was the right decision taken at a difficult time for good reasons and was based on listening to women and general practitioners.  It has absolutely caused a capacity problem.  There is no doubt about that, and I have discussed it with the Deputy's party colleague.  Our priority has to be finding the capacity.  The HSE officials signalled good progress on this last week when they were before the joint committee.  They have identified potential extra capacity.  I use the word "potential" because until it is over the line, that is what it is.  Deputy Chambers and women will want to know about more than potential.  I take that point too.  I expect the HSE officials to be back shortly, certainly by the end of the month, with an update on where we are in that regard.  If we can bring that on board, and I am hopeful that we can, then we will clear the backlog quickly.</p></speech>

He is saying he was waiting until the Scally report was finalised and that was the point at which he had reassurance from the laboratories.  However, the Minister was still sending women to the same laboratories and to the same service.  To me that does not add up, but I realise that we will not get further on that issue today.</p></speech>

We are one year on since the promise was given and the offer made.  There is no extra capacity.  The Minister made a point about women going to private operators and paying privately.  A strong point was made by Deputy Donnelly on the previous occasion.  He said that shows there is capacity somewhere if people pay for it.  The question still applies.  Why can the HSE not buy it?  If private individuals can source it, why can the HSE not source it?  The delay in sourcing this extra capacity leaves a great deal to be desired.  I was going to ask when the backlog would be cleared.  I think we could be looking at the next year or two because it is such an utter mess.</p> <p>  I have a more specific question around MedLab Pathology.  Is MedLab terminating its agreement with the HSE?  When is that happening?  What is happening to the smears or slides that have gone to MedLab?  What is happening to the workload the company has?</p> <p>  In recent days the Minister has referred to triage being used.  Will he explain what he means by that?  Does he mean it applies to anyone who presented for a repeat reassurance smear who has a history?  What does a history constitute?  Where does that put a woman in terms of one, two or three?  Will the Minister explain the triage element?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#O00900"><p>Deputy Chambers asked about the issue of capacity.  What I meant by positivity was that the HSE officials, and I can single out Damien McCallion in particular, who were before this committee last week have worked night and day to try to identify additional capacity.  They have assured me that it is not an issue of funding but of a shortage of cytology around the globe.  For the first time last week the HSE officials said publicly at the joint committee and to me in meetings that they have identified extra capacity.  This week there are intensive engagements under way to try to bring that capacity on board.  I cannot go any further than that because I do not want to jeopardise it but I am hopeful.  I will be clear to them, not that I need to be, because they get this, that any extra capacity needs to comply with Scally in terms of quality assurance.  A conversation is ongoing to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers made a fair point on the issue of MedLab, and I hope it is one on which we can agree.  It shows that some laboratories have capacity available.  The issue is that they do not want to do business with the Irish public health service.  I am not speaking for MedLab, but I think that is something we need to reflect on in the aftermath of the CervicalCheck debacle.  Some laboratories made the decision that they are out of Ireland and no longer want to do business with Ireland.  I cannot speak for them on why that is but it does perhaps go back to some of the comments in the Scally report on the debacle.  I will confirm this in writing to the Deputy to be sure, but my understanding is that MedLab has a legal responsibility in respect of what it has processed, as does any laboratory in respect of any slide taken.  I am reluctant to go further because there are ongoing discussions and I have no wish to jeopardise them.  I know Deputy Chambers takes the same view.  I am confident that if the HSE officials can get their discussions or negotiations over the line, there will be additional capacity in the programme above and beyond any decision that any individual laboratory may make.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers is right about triage.  It is a phrase I have used to try to provide reassurance.  This is because there was an understandable view that if a woman had an additional risk, she would nevertheless be sitting in a queue along with everyone else.  I have been informed that it operates in the laboratories where there is a backlog.  In the particular laboratory where there is a backlog, they are now triaging people on the basis of medical history.  I would be more comfortable if I could get the Deputy a note that I could share with the committee.  I will get that for the Deputy today or tomorrow and outline exactly how that process works so that I do not articulate it incorrectly.  I would like a clinician to write the letter, but that is my understanding.  I gather those responsible triage people on the basis of medical history.</p></speech>

MedLab is servicing rural parts of the country.  If a woman is living in County Mayo, where I live, she is waiting for eight or nine months.  That is far longer than anyone else.  It is of particular concern to women living in that region because the laboratory with the biggest backlog is now looking to pull out.  We need reassurance from the Minister on how that will work, especially for those women in the system.</p> <p>  The reason I asked the Minister about triage is that I am not convinced it is happening, if I am to be honest.  I will ask the Minister to look into that.  I appreciate he may not have the answer now, but will he clarify what constitutes a history that might send a red flag that a woman would need to get her results back?  I am questioning whether that is happening.  I say as much because I have certain information that I do not wish to disclose at the meeting.  I am asking the Minister to check that.</p></speech>

I will check it and come back to the Deputy in writing.  I fully accept the bona fides of the reasons the Deputy is raising these issues.  It is a particular challenge in the part of the country where Deputy Chambers comes from.  I fully accept that for the reasons outlined by her.</p> <p>  My clear understanding is that there is a legal responsibility on the laboratory that has the test to complete the test.  My point to Deputy Chambers and those she represents in Mayo and that part of the country is that I am conscious of the fact that we have three laboratories or organisations that we are using.  The Coombe does not seem to have a backlog and is processing within approximately three weeks.  From memory, at Quest the period is between seven and nine weeks while there is a significant wait in MedLab.</p></speech>

The issue that arose last April with CervicalCheck surrounded non-disclosure of the audit.  The audit was the icing on the cake for screening programmes.  The programme looked back on people who had been identified as having cancer to see if their previous smear had been accurate.  It was the non-disclosure of the audit results to those women which led to the controversy that raged at the end of April last year.  The Minister expressed a lack of confidence in CervicalCheck management, but really he was, I assume, expressing lack of confidence in that element of the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#O01500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

That is what led to the demand for an out-of-cycle smear.  The issue was non-disclosure of the audit as opposed to the working of the programme.  It has been, is and will be a successful programme.  As Deputy O'Connell mentioned, 65,000 women are walking around today, having had early changes identified and having been treated successfully.  It was the expression of no confidence in CervicalCheck that led to the controversy.  Is that one of the errors that the Minister has admitted to making?  Was that one of the critical errors he made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#O01700"><p>No, I will answer the question a different way.  I have spoken about the error I think I made before.  I am not sure it would have worked if I had tried this but, however long I am in politics and however long after politics, I will always regret that I did not request a bit of time.  We were operating.  I have to take the findings of the Scally report on board too.  I respectfully suggest they are more broadly applicable in this House than simply to me, but I am willing to accept my part.  What needed to happen was that I needed to urge people to take a few days to think on it.</p><p>This is not a go at anyone as it is the way this place works.  On the idea that I was handed new information as I walked into the D&aacute;il Chamber and then presented with this dilemma, if I told the D&aacute;il, I would have caused worry and if I did not, then it would be claimed I misled it.  This is a frenzied environment.  I am the Minister and should have tried to call a halt to all of it.  I remain to be convinced it would have worked but I should have tried to.</p><p> I do not wish to talk about people who are not here.  However, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly has done much good work for screening and tackling cervical cancer.  That should never be taken from her or the people who worked in the management of the programme.  On this I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  These people helped build our screening programme with my predecessors and saved lives.</p><p> I could not, however, have confidence &ndash; it did not matter whether I did because women did not &ndash;because an audit was overseen that was botched.  Will the Chairman understand my position on those days when I was asking basic questions but not getting the answers?  How many other people are in Vicky Phelan&rsquo;s situation?  The inability of that organisation to give me that information fed into the general worry, which is one of the issues which Deputy Lisa Chambers and I have discussed at some length.</p><p> I continue to reflect regularly about CervicalCheck and what could have been done better by me, by my Department, by the HSE and by this institution, as well as by media and public commentary.  There are lessons for all of us.  I accept my part in it for definite.  I also clearly hear the words of the patient advocates pointing out that this is all grand but can we ensure something good comes out of this to try to eradicate this awful disease.</p><p> One of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s key recommendations was that the audit should be paused.  I believe that was entirely appropriate.  Audit is a good process but this one was not executed in any way that was appropriate.  Dr. Scally did call for it to be paused.  I recently read a report on the front page of a newspaper in which a medical negligence lawyer suggested the programme had been paused to stop future litigation.  The audit has been paused for no reason other than to implement Dr. Scally&rsquo;s report and address the concerns expressed by women.  We now have established an expert group, which is meeting to work out how one properly designs an audit which works for women and the programme.  That work is under way and the audit will be recommenced then in a way in which women, as well as patients in general, can have confidence.</p></speech>

This is a comment more for Mr. Breslin than the Minister.  The Parliamentary Budget Office did some excellent work to prepare the committee to look at the Estimates.  One of its main findings is that it is impossible to conduct decent scrutiny because the numbers are not comparable.  It states that there are a number of challenges in undertaking effective scrutiny of this money.  It is a &euro;17 billion pot.  I have looked at what the Parliamentary Budget Office said and I agree with it.  It said that we are meant to be able to compare the figures from today to the figures from December but that it is essentially impossible to do so because the headings are not like for like.  It talks about &euro;400 million on pensions being pulled out of many areas and dropped into others, as well as other issues.  I am aware this is not a small amount of work but I ask the Department to read the Parliamentary Budget Office's report and to then come back to report to the committee, taking these issues on board, in order that we can properly scrutinise the Estimates, since that is what we are here for today.</p></speech>

I just want to reflect on CervicalCheck.  I heard the Minister say to Deputy Lisa Chambers that he believes, knowing what he knows now, that it was the right decision to make.  The Minister's Department was told at a principal officer level that his decision would crash the system.  The Minister was repeatedly told throughout the year that his decision was crashing the system.  We are now dealing with the results of the system having been crashed.  Some 80,000 women have been waiting for up to eight months, with hundreds of thousands of women waiting for a HPV test.  To state now that the decision was right is extraordinary and, in my opinion, is an insult to all of those women.  We do not need to get back into it.  We have had a good go at it.  If the Minister wants to respond, that is fine, but we then want to move on to the children's hospital.</p></speech>

I will provide the email to the Deputy, having already given him the content of it.  The email states that the named individual, having spoken to Jerome and Gr&aacute;inne, felt it was important to make me aware of the key risks arising from such an open access policy.  It then lists the risks, all of which were readily identifiable to my Department.  It stated that we would have to work out how to pay the general practitioners and that it would of course result in additional smears being taken.  It also goes on to state that it is understood that they take direction from the Department.  The phrase "crashing the system" is one that I have only heard Deputy Donnelly use and I do not mean that disrespectfully.</p></speech>

The overriding point I make is that with the unique circumstances that we were facing, this was going to arise and women were going to seek repeat smear tests.

It clearly states that there is a narrative, the Minister's narrative to which he is entitled, that it was going to happen anyway so it was made free.  There are two conflicting narratives.  One came directly from the HSE to this committee to state that that is not true.  It directly attributes two thirds of the backlog to the Minister's offer.  It does not state that it was going to happen anyway.  No one was disagreeing with it being made free where appropriate.  The significant error appears to have been in this open offer.  The Department quickly added a caveat and stated that it was in consultation with GPs.  The Minister did not.</p></speech>

Of course the Minister believed it was the right decision at the time.  He made the decision and that is fine.  I find it extraordinary that he would state that it is correct now.  There are 80,000 women around the country waiting for eight or nine months, with hundreds of thousands waiting for the HPV test, which he said would be in place last September but which we are now told may not even be this calendar year.  The Minister's decision is directly linked to that.  We also had evidence last week that there was no medical benefit.  It was about reassuring people.  It is extraordinary that knowing everything we know, with the evidence to the committee that the Minister was repeatedly asked to stop because it was causing these delays and fundamentally undermining the system, that he would still say it was the right decision today.</p></speech>

This is a procedural point, but it is nonetheless important.  Several weeks ago the D&aacute;il passed a motion, accepted by the Minister and his Government, by an overwhelming majority, to include in the PwC report an analysis of the implications for cost and timing of moving the site.  I wrote to the Minister directly after that motion was passed and asked that that be done.  It was not included in the PwC report.  Did the Minister instruct PwC, further to the D&aacute;il vote on same, to include the cost and timing implications of potentially moving the site?</p></speech>

I did not have any direct conversations with it.  I accepted the D&aacute;il motion as I believed it was an honest attempt by the Deputy to ensure that we had robust terms of reference, and I accepted a number of his changes to and suggestions on the terms of reference.  I have been listening to the Deputy commenting on this a bit in the last day or so, and I do not accept that we can presume that PwC did not look at this.  It says on page 8 of the report that to take any other decision would have cost more.  I am not sure that we can presume that PwC did not consider the effect of moving to a different site.  I will be meeting with the authors of the report in the coming days to tease that out further, and I will come back to the Deputy with an answer.</p></speech>

The direct call made by the D&aacute;il was that the Government instruct PwC to include an analysis of the effect of such a move now, because a number of paediatricians, parents of sick children and concerned citizens around the country believe it is still the right thing to do.  I will be surprised if the analysis comes back and backs that up, but out of respect for those people and their very strongly held views - and they may not be wrong - the D&aacute;il called for that analysis to be included in the PwC report.</p></speech>

I will make the point that PwC was acting as a financial auditor, and the decision to locate the site was not entirely a financial decision.  Nobody has ever suggested otherwise.  There are different views, and I accept that.  People watching this will have different views from the Government.  However, the decision was taken for a number of reasons, including clinical and medical reasons.  The D&aacute;il voted in 2012 to endorse the St. James's Hospital site.  I am not making a presumption about the way the Deputy voted, but I certainly voted to endorse that decision in 2012 as a backbench TD.  I also voted on a private members motion in 2017 to re-endorse that decision.  We voted twice on this issue.  I will revert to the Deputy on his question.</p></speech>

This committee was told repeatedly, not by the Minister but by the development board and the Department of Health that the great advantage of this two-stage process was that the State now had a guaranteed maximum price and that any future cost overruns would now be borne by the contractor.  That was the single biggest defence given to this committee for this ill-fated two-stage process.  The PwC report blows that completely out of the water, saying that it is complete nonsense.  In fact, nine of the 11 recommendations speak about controlling further cost escalation that it clearly says will be borne by the State.  Can the Minister explain why, on this huge issue, which might require hundreds of millions in additional required expenditure, there is such a massive discrepancy between what the Department and the development board believe or believed, which was that the guaranteed maximum price was as it appeared, and PwC saying that it is complete nonsense and that the State is potentially on the hook for hundreds of millions of euro in additional spend?</p></speech>

On page 4 of the report PwC comments on the two-stage process.  Many people raised questions and asked whether it was the right process to use.  It is one of the things PwC looked at.  It said: "The two-stage procurement process used to award the contract for the construction of the children's hospital is a widely used approach and can deliver significant benefit in relation to accelerating project timelines."  It did not say that it was the wrong approach.  Many of us thought that it might, but it did not say that it was the wrong approach to procurement.  It went on to say, however: "The necessary controls required to mitigate the risks and consequences of this approach were not put in place."  The PwC report only landed 24 hours ago, but my view is that it has said that there are benefits to using the two-stage approach to procurement but that the execution was appalling.</p></speech>

The important point is that we were told that any future cost escalations were going to be the responsibility of the contractor.  PwC said that was complete nonsense, and that the future cost escalations will be borne by the Irish people.

The Deputy asked us to ask it if there was a way of reducing the cost of the project.  It came back and said that there may be technical ways of doing that, but that the board should be putting its effort into reducing the risk of further cost rises arising from this.  That is where the focus needs to be.</p> <p>  People have been asking what the final cost of this project will be, which is a perfectly valid and reasonable question.  If we used a traditional procurement model we would not have been able to determine the final cost until the project was completed and the claims were submitted.  It is normal in any project for claims to come in at the end.  This was the case during the building of the Luas.  It would be difficult to find an auditor anywhere in the world who will say absolutely and definitively that there is no further risk of cost rises.    </p></speech>

This was one of the biggest disappointments of the report for me.  In 128 pages only two pages were given over to that issue, and one of those pages was mainly a pie chart.  I do not accept PwC's findings on this.  It is strong in some areas but it is very weak here.  It is essentially saying that 85% of the total cost is already contracted and therefore nothing can be done about that.  As anyone who has ever built a wall, an extension, a house or a large building will know, as costs escalate he or she can sit down with the developer, builder, project manager, architect or someone else and say that the costs are getting out of control, and that despite there being a contract in place to build a particular item it has to be reigned back in.  PwC has said, in the project involving the biggest capital spend in the history of the State, that this cannot be done.  BAM stated that it would walk away.  I understand that it is more than open to looking at the contract with a view to pulling costs out of this value engineering project.  The shape of the building makes it as expensive to build as one could possibly imagine.  It is shaped like a big glass donut, and there is a reason why none of us lives in glass donut-shaped houses; they are extraordinarily expensive and do not represent a very good use of space.  Does the Minister accept the assertion that because 85% of the cost has been contracted-  critically, the money has not spent and could be reversed from an engineering perspective - that we therefore have to let all of these potential cost savings slide?</p></speech>

The report does say that it is technically possible to reduce costs, in both the summary and on page 75.  However, there is a caveat that if that was done other difficulties might arise for the project.  It says that a value engineering report could be carried out, but it might create planning difficulties.</p><p>We could end up delaying the project further, which could cause other costs.  When I met Mr. Fred Barry, the new chair of the board, before the PwC report, I asked him to cast a fresh pair of eyes over what cost reduction measures could be put in place.  I do not want to mislead the taxpayer and I do not want to suggest I have a report that states there is significant room for savings because that is not the case.  However, I want to talk to Fred Barry and I want him to prepare a report on the possibility of savings.  I would also like him and his board to engage with this committee.  It was said that it would be better to expend the energy and expertise of the board on making sure there are no further cost rises.  We have to balance that but I do not concede the point yet.</p></speech>

In a recent response to a parliamentary question, the Minister stated that no serious work was yet under way on the maternity hospital and that the design phase had not started.  One of the most important parts of this hospital is its co-location with the maternity hospital.  Is there any provision in the Estimates to seriously ramp up the design phase, along with procurement and all the other professional services?  A lot of money has to be spent on getting this maternity hospital moving.  What provision is there in the Estimates for this?</p> <p>  Last year the overrun on the HSE budget was approximately &euro;600 million.  How is it doing at this moment regarding what we signed up to last December?  What is its run rate and the level of spending in the context of what the D&aacute;il has sanctioned?</p></speech>

There are funding priorities and we have had discussions about capital.  I would not want to mislead the committee by suggesting we have the funding to do it.  We need to have another look at it as the year progresses.  There are many sceptics out there, though I know the Deputy is not one, but there is no doubt that we are going to build the hospital on the site and that there will be tri-location.  It would be a good confidence-building measure to show a bit of progress on it.  I have spoken to the master of the Coombe Hospital about this.  In the context of meeting the risks of our current maternity services, this year we have decided to prioritise the works at the Coombe theatres.</p> <p>  On the financial situation of the HSE, we will shortly put in place a new board and that will be a key governance control which we have been lacking for a number of years.  A new director general-CEO will take office next month and I look forward to this committee having an opportunity to talk to him.  I will be clear with him on his budgetary responsibilities because we cannot have a repeat of last year.  It is something we can deal with in one year but not over two years.  I understand that the HSE is technically on profile in terms of its costs but I will not mislead the committee by suggesting there are no emerging pressures, on which the Deputy has commented in recent days.  There is a need for the HSE to put a pay and numbers strategy in place so that we can have realistic recruitment plans that match the budget, and where individual hospital managers or CEOs do not make their own recruitment decisions.  There has to be a centralised approach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I will keep a close eye on this.  We are awaiting the final outturn from 2018 which will be audited shortly and it will be important to see what that amounts to.</p></speech>

They were going to go to their GPs for that reassurance but their GP would have not been able to provide clarity on what might happen.  A two-tier system was emerging in which women who could afford it could have it.  There was a risk of further undermining confidence in the programme by telling women we were not sure what was happening and were waiting for a report to come out first while not being able, in the meantime, to give them a repeat smear.  The helpline was beginning to receive lots of phone calls from worried women seeking reassurance and not doing it would have added to the chaos of the time.  I am sure that Members of the D&aacute;il would have demanded that I do it and some have been honest enough to have admitted that.  General practitioners showed significant leadership during this situation but they would have found it even more confusing and more difficult to get guidance and clarity, though Dr. Peter McKenna stepped up to the plate by providing clinical guidance to GPs at the time.  I think many people would have sought free repeat smears anyway and that would have caused a capacity issue but the smears would not have been done in a way that was uniform.  It would not have been fair either as it would have been a two-tier system.</p> <p>  I introduced a fee to pay the GP to see a woman and it was up to the GP and the woman, together in consultation, to decide whether a repeat smear was required.  That worked to a certain extent and a significant number, some 50%, of those consultations did not result in a repeat smear.  There was enough reassurance for those women from the conversations they had with their doctors to enable them to decide they did not need another smear.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Chairman can answer that question.</p></speech>

This was a reassurance mechanism but, as Minister for Health, I cannot put myself in that consultation room.  I trusted women and their doctors, together, to make what they believed to be the appropriate decision.  I did not want a situation where some women could access a repeat smear and others could not or where a doctor believed it was appropriate but had no access to one.  This was far from ideal, of course, and I would not want anybody to misunderstand the position of me or my Department in this regard.  This is something we would never wish to do.  It is meant to be a population health programme that is done on a scheduled basis every number of years or in accordance with risk.  This was different, however.  People have said we could have undermined confidence in the screening programme but that had happened with the failure to disclose.  Chatting about it a year after the debacle does not capture the situation we were in at the time.</p></speech>

The advice was given on the basis of the woman's history and her risk profile.  Some women are at higher risk than others and some will have had several smears in the past that assured one of the accuracy of their latest smears.  They were difficult consultations and if a woman was very uncertain or worried, she would have been given the smear.</p><p>However, many women just required reassurance that the cervical screening programme was a very effective programme, that it was working properly, and that the issue was around audit and non-disclosure rather than any deficiency in the system, but many women did not understand that it was a screening test rather than a diagnostic test.  They expected that the screening test would be definitive, but no screening test is definitive.  It is a population programme, so it benefits the population.  When it comes to the individual, there will be some individuals who will not be picked up by screening.  That is the issue in all screening.  It was a very complex consultation, and in my experience, if the woman was very worried, she proceeded to a smear test, but if she was reassured within the consultation that the programme was working effectively, she did not proceed to a smear test.</p></speech>

We now know that 50% did not get a smear test.  This is a personal opinion but if the Minister had not done what he did at that time in real time, given where we were in terms of confidence in the screening programme, I probably would have been calling for his head.  I do not have an issue with the decision taken.  There were consequences subsequently in terms of the capacity of the system to facilitate that.</p></speech>

I also accept that when that decision was made, it had to be made in real time.  I want to give the Minister the opportunity now to explain how we will address that because he said earlier that that is where the conversation needs to be focused.  We are in a situation now again where we need to provide confidence to the 80,000 women who are waiting for those results.  We need to speak to them directly.  We have provided them with the smear test to reassure them.  We now have a backlog.  How can we reassure them in that regard?  What will be the next steps?</p></speech>

The first thing it is worth saying is that I accept that two thirds of the backlog is made up of out-of-cycle smears where women decided, as we went through the process, in consultation with their GP for reassurance, to seek another smear test.  One third, or one in three, of those is made up of new women entering the screening programme.  I say that as it is a positive development.  We talked about the way our screening programme can save lives.  The fact that one in three of the backlog are new women who, after all this discussion about screening, decided to get screened and, for the first time ever, had a smear test is welcome.  We see that in other countries too.  They saw it in the UK at the time of Jade Goody's passing when there was a lot of discussion about it.  It is worth remembering that many new women came forward and, it is hoped, some good will come of that.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right.  What are we going to do now?  We have to find extra capacity.  That is not something we have been saying today or yesterday.  It is something on which the HSE has been working tirelessly, and I singled out Damien McCallion for leading that effort.  Until very recently, the HSE had not been able to say it had identified potential extra capacity.  That changed last week when it was able to tell this committee and me that it has identified potential extra capacity.  That does not mean we are over the line, and I do not wish to suggest that.  This week, it is engaging with that potential extra capacity looking at quality assurance and all the other negotiations it has to do.  If we can get that over the line, and I can only say "if" today, my understanding from talking to the HSE is that we will see a significant reduction in the backlog over the summer months.  I would hope that if the extra capacity comes on stream, by the time we get to the end of the summer months, the end of August or so, the backlog will largely have been dealt with.  I will be back to this committee when I have more news on that, or the HSE will be back to it, but I expect we will know one way or the other the direction of travel in that regard in the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

If we cannot secure that extra capacity, are we still looking at trying to get it elsewhere or is it the case that we have this potential capacity which we are now exploring and we are not looking outside of that?</p></speech>

The other issue that will come into play, and a clinician will explain it much better than I will, is the benefit that the introduction of HPV testing will have in reducing the demand on cytology.  There is an interplay in that regard between the introduction of HPV testing and the positive benefit that can have on capacity.  There are other ways of looking at this but, to be blunt, the most straightforward way is to secure the extra capacity.  As I said, those talks are ongoing this week.</p></speech>

There is no way of avoiding the fact that when a person lives very near a large construction project, that causes upheaval for local residents and a great deal of difficulty for the local community.  I know we all understand that.  My understanding is that there is a structure set up for engagement between the local community, the contractors, etc.  I have been advised by some of the local residents that they believe that needs to be refined and approved and that there must be better and more senior attendance from both the contractor and the health service at those meetings.  I have given a commitment that I will ask that that happens at the next meeting, which I believe is scheduled for either this week or next week.</p></speech>

In terms of inclusion health, I refer to the issue of drug misuse and the number of referrals for addiction services.  It is welcome that we are meeting our targets.  The target last year in terms of the percentage of substance misusers under the age of 18 for whom treatment has commenced within one week following an assessment was at 99%, which is effectively everyone.  My concern is about the waiting times to be assessed.  There are two different issues in that regard.  Once somebody gets assessed, he or she is getting the treatment within a very short time.  We are meeting all of our targets in that regard.  I do not see any information, and the Minister might be able to provide it by way of a note to the committee later if he does not have it now, on the number of people seeking assessments and the period of time they are waiting.</p> <p>  I have a particular concern based on my personal knowledge of individuals, particularly around opiate addictions, for instance, heroin.  We are meeting the targets from the time someone is assessed to when treatment starts, which I understand is four days.  That is the target for next year.  The target was five days last year and we did it in four, so we have a new target for this year.  My concern is the waiting times to be assessed, especially with regard to heroin use.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that if somebody is addicted to an opiate such as heroin and for whatever reason that person has an awakening on a particular day that he or she wants to kick the habit, that person cannot wait around three or four weeks for an assessment because within three or four days the chances are that person is no longer in that frame of mind and the opportunity is lost.  Will the Minister give us some indication of what we are doing to try to improve the waiting times to be assessed rather than the waiting times from assessment into treatment, which are excellent?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#U00900"><p>I am very pleased to do that.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF,  has a budget of &euro;75 million for 2019, which is an increase on last year again.  We managed to reduce the overall number of people waiting for inpatient day cases, hospital operation or hospital procedure to just below 70,000 in 2018.  The aim is to reduce the figure to just below 60,000 in 2019.  This year, we should continue to see reductions in the number of patients waiting overall.  What is probably more important, which we never really get to discuss, is the length of time somebody is waiting.  We are projecting that, currently, at the start of this year there were 40,200 people waiting for more than three months for operations, and the Sl&aacute;intecare target is three months.  We will reduce the figure to 31,000 people by the end of the year.  We will reduce the number of patients longer than nine months for an operation from 14,900 to 10,000.  This year, the NTPF funding will pay for 25,000 additional inpatient day case treatments and 5,000 scopes.</p> <p>  We are trying a relatively new initiative this year.  For the first time in quite a while the NTPF will be used to fund first appointments for outpatients.  The NTPF will carry out 40,000 outpatient first appointments this year.  By the end of the year we should see the outpatient list lower than it was at the beginning of the year but an awful lot of work remains to be done.  We are getting to a much better place for inpatient day cases.  The number of patients now being seen in under three months or less for hospital operations is improving all of the time.  The number of people waiting on the list overall is improving all of the time.</p> <p>  Outpatients, being very honest, are the big bulk or overwhelming amount of our waiting lists.  This is where the Sl&aacute;intecare stuff starts coming in.  I am not suggesting there is a panacea here; there is not.  If we are starting to fund GPs over the next four years to do more in chronic disease management that, potentially, removes people from our outpatient waiting lists.  If we are looking at, through the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund, new and innovative ways of treating things like ophthalmology, one may be able to take some of that out of the hospitals.  There is a lot of work.  Last week or the week before, I chaired a meeting for a couple of hours and discussed how do we get on top of outpatient figures.  We keep talking about a global figure but we need to look at the specialties of which ophthalmology is a big part.  In a lot of ophthalmology cases if one can see someone at the outpatient clinic one can nearly do a see and treat, and be done, rather than putting somebody on an outpatient list, getting them seen eventually but then having to go somewhere else for the inpatient or day case procedure.  We have a lot more work to do with outpatient figures.</p> <p>  To directly answer the question, the NTPF has a budget of &euro;75 million.  It will see the inpatient day case waiting list overall reduced to under 60,000 people by the end of the year, and it will see the reductions and times that I have outlined.  </p></speech>

I get a fortnightly report on this matter and I am due a fortnightly report any day now.  From my recollection, the last figures that I saw showed that more than 300 GPs had signed up, which is quite a significant increase from where we started.  There are some counties that do not still have a GP signed up.  I will confirm those counties to the committee and the Deputy.</p><p>I am relatively satisfied, as we approach 100 days since we introduced abortion into Ireland - abortion was always here but as we legalised and recognised as a country that it was a reality - I am satisfied that access is in place and that the helpline is working very well.  The website called <i><i>myoptions.ie</i></i>is working well.  The Coombe was the last major maternity hospital to come on stream but it did some work and is providing the service now as well.  The general feedback that I am getting from the HSE is that the system is operating as expected.  There have not been any particular issues flagged with me in that regard.  </p><p>I am mandated under the law to lay information before the House after a year of the legislation.  That will be the first opportunity for all of us to have a conversation.  We also put in the law a mandatory statutory review of the legislation.  We heard a lot of people say that there would not be enough GPs or hospitals.  The general sense is, thanks to great clinical leadership by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and others, and from hospital doctors, that the services are working well and women are accessing the services.  A small number of counties do not yet have a GP signed up. </p></speech>

What percentage of the reduction in the waiting lists for outpatient and inpatient procedures is related to validation, as opposed to the provision of treatments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#U01800"><p>The Chairman has asked a good question.  The central waiting list validation, according to my note, was established in June 2018.  Let us remember that these are estimates because obviously it is to be a legitimate exercise where one has to decide one does not need an appointment.  The general estimate is that about 30,000 outpatient appointments will be validated during the course of the year so the focus this year is largely on outpatients.  There is a sense that when one has such a large figure, inaccurate data and lack of systems, there can be duplication or people can be treated in other hospitals and the like.  I acknowledge we had a disparate way of carrying out validation and some GPs expressed the view that there was an unfairness or lack of uniformity about it,  we did centralise things in the NTPF.  My feedback is that the scheme is working quite well.  Largely speaking, GPs think it is a fairer system and GP organisations and the like have been briefed on it.  I am happy to supply the Chairman a detailed note on the matter.  I understand that they reckon about 30,000 from the outpatient list is the number that will be validated.  Let us remember that is 30,000 outpatients out of 516,000 outpatients.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to shed some light on the full extent of staffing levels in the public health sector and the extent to which an embargo, which has been suggested, is likely to affect staffing levels.</p><p>Which areas are likely to be most affected, if any?  What are the exact numbers of the increase in staffing levels over the past two to three years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#V00200"><p>I very much welcome the question.  Let me be crystal clear that the aim is not to have to apply a restriction.  The HSE is meant to publish a pay and numbers strategy each year on how many people will be taken on in the health service that year.  I am pleased to say, as the Deputy hinted, that thankfully in recent years we are back in an area of growth.  We are hiring more nurses, doctors and therapists and we have a job of work to do in that regard.  Imagine if the Minister for Education and Skills got his budget on day one and it said that the Department would hire a certain number more teachers this year and then individual schools throughout the country started asking for more teachers.  Then the Department of Education and Skills would not live within its budget.  It has to be the same in the health service even though it is a larger organisation.  The same principle has to apply.  The Oireachtas votes through a budget.  The budget says that this year the Department will hire a certain number of thousand more staff, and it is roughly 2,000 additional approved and funded development posts by the end of this year.  Last year, we saw the health service increase by more than 3,000, and to give the Deputy a flavour of that, we saw 867 new nurses last year, 175 new therapists and 125 new consultants.  To be very clear, we are growing the size of the health service this year.  There will be more nurses, doctors and therapists at the end of the year than at the start of the year, and that is right and proper because that is what members voted for when they passed the budget.</p> <p>  That is different from saying it is OK for the HSE at a local level to employ whoever it wants willy-nilly.  It has to align with what we want it to do.  Otherwise members will be back in here asking me why the HSE is over budget or they will be asking me how the hell we appointed all these people in different roles, be they roles to which members might not attach the same degree of priority.  While I have not seen the letter, nor should I because I do not see every individual letter that is issued by the HSE, what the executive seems to have done in preparation for the pay and numbers strategy is to say to its system that if there is a plan in place, then recruitment can be continued with in accordance with that plan once it is credible, but if a credible plan has not been put in place and there is no intention to put one in place, then recruitment will have to be paused until one is put in place.  I have spoken to the HSE about this over the weekend because I immediately saw it being portrayed as a moratorium and a ban on recruitment etc., and the HSE has emphasised to me very clearly, and I to it, that the aim is not to apply the restrictions to any hospital group or any community healthcare organisation that has a plan and is living within that plan.  There cannot be a situation where managers carry out their own plans ignorant of the budget that we voted through.  That is where we are at on that.</p></speech>

For instance, my colleague, Senator Colm Burke, has raised this issue on a number of occasions, which would seem to suggest that administration comes first and the front line services come afterwards.  He says, and I agree, that it should be the other way around.  The question that arises from that is who decides on the category of staff and who decides on where they are deployed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#V00400"><p>Achieving exactly what the Deputy is suggesting is the purpose of a pay and numbers strategy because if there is not one in place, the question of who decides becomes very opaque and individual, localised decisions are made.  Of course we want to give people individual flexibility but we have to make sure that the areas in which recruitment is focused are the areas which the Oireachtas and the Government have prioritised and want to prioritise.  I believe they are.  I quoted the number of extra nurses we have seen in the system last year, namely, 867, along with 175 therapists and 125 consultants.  We still have a way to go, particularly with consultants.  This is a document we publish every year called Health in Ireland: Key Trends, and if we look at the medical dental category, which has been going up since 2010, there were 8,817 people in that category in 2014 and that is now at 10,400 as of last year.  If we take the nursing category, in 2014 there were 34,509 nurses and there are now 37,220.  As for health and social care professionals, there were 13,640 in 2014 and there are 16,193 as of last year.  The numbers are growing right away.</p> <p>  There is often a misrepresentation of management and administration grades because it is often an easy thing to do, and I am not suggesting the Deputy is doing it because he did not, but a somewhat populist view can be put forward that administrators are not playing these key roles and they often are.  The person who is booking the appointments in the hospital or the person who is working with the consultant is making sure that a patient gets seen.  It might be classified as administrative work but if we have the doctors and the nurses answering the telephone instead of somebody else, that is a waste of their skill as a healthcare professional.  The Deputy is partial to an odd parliamentary question, and I say that in good humour, but they all need to be answered by people who might fall into that grade as well.  Having said all of that, my honest view is that we need to slim down the management of the HSE and we do that through the Sl&aacute;intecare programme which is put in place through geo-alignment, where instead of having dual management structures, one for a hospital group and one for a community healthcare organisation, we end up with one.  The pay and numbers strategy is about exactly that.  It is about making sure there is a clear understanding from all of us on what we as taxpayers are getting in extra recruitment for the extra investment we put into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#V00500"><p>The Minister did not answer the question on the areas that have shown the most stress over recent years, but he might come back to it again.  Incidentally, waiting lists are not a new phenomenon in this country.  I have been around for a few years, and I was involved in the health services as well in a previous incarnation, and I can remember the same questions coming up year after year.  I can remember the same constituents coming in to talk to me while waiting two, three, four and five years for hip operations and various other operations, notwithstanding the pain those patients were suffering and so on.  It is not true to say that this is a new phenomenon.  It is not.  Neither are the expenditure overruns a new phenomenon.  They have been going on for as long as I have been around.  They have been happening every year to a greater or lesser extent depending on certain circumstances at the time, but it is not true to say that these issues have not arisen before.  It most certainly is not.</p> <p>  The point I would emphasise is that in raising the question, I was trying to find out who deploys the staff to deal with the sensitive and overloaded areas.  For example, I talk to many medical professionals and they all have their own opinions.  I have my opinion about the HSE itself and it is fairly well known at this stage, so while I will not go into that particular rant at the moment, I have no doubt that there will be another day for that as time goes on.  The point that is being brought to my attention by medical professionals is that there are specific areas where severe stress arises regularly from a shortage of staff to deal with the day-to-day running of the health services, and those areas not seem to get the same attention as they would like.  Are they right or wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#V00600"><p>This is a challenge in general.  What we are trying to do and what I am doing more and more is that as we allocate the budget each year, we identify the development posts.  We do not just give the health service &euro;16 billion or &euro;17 billion for the year and ask it to come back with a plan.  We are trying to be collaborative and not adversarial in working with it to agree the priority areas.  For example, one of the areas we have decided on this year is that there is a real pressure point with therapists, especially in therapies for children.  This year, therefore, we have taken a decision to hire 100 additional therapists into the system.  That then goes out as an understanding that it must be included in the service plan before I can approve the plan.  When dealing with an organisation as large as the HSE in terms of staff, I am not, nor should my Department be, deciding the individual nursing numbers in each hospital, and the Deputy is not suggesting that I should be either.  We are trying to identify those pinch points across the system that the Deputy rightly identifies and incrementally address them, budget on budget.  We have had some success in some areas while work remains to be done in other areas.</p></speech>

That is a view I expressed when I came to the committee and why I have worked hard to put a board in place.  One could argue that the HSE has had a board before now.  That is factually correct, but it was a different type of board in terms of skill sets.  I do not mean that in a disparaging way towards former boards, but having the right skill sets is essential.  The committee has a view that I have not got the skill sets fully right and wants me to put clinicians on the board.  We are working our way through to have a robust, competence based board which I expect to take office at the start of June.  We have to get the governance structures correct, but we also, through the accountability structures, have to ensure that when the money leaves the Department of Health or the HSE, it is spent appropriately locally.  One cannot have a situation where one hospital group works really hard to try to come in on budget and another that blows its budget and the hospital that is performing well is expected to compensate.  One must reward good behaviour.  The regional board structure will provide for a greater layer of oversight in order that every question will not have to be referred to the Minister of the day or the Oireachtas.  There is a need for greater scrutiny.  I know that the Deputy is a strong advocate of the health board structure.  I suggest the new model we are proposing under Sl&aacute;intecare offers the best of both worlds, such that one would have a strong slimmed down national centre, with more functions devolved to the regions, with better regional oversight, in order that, as the Deputy said, one would not hear in September that the HSE had overshot its budget by X hundred million euro, that there were early warning signs and about the ways to work through the budget both at individual hospital level and national level.</p></speech>

Action taken earlier would have the effect of avoiding the glitch at a sensitive time and there would be more scope to rearrange funds, for want of a better description, to meet oncoming challenges.</p></speech>

Even if the taxpayer can find the money needed from buoyant tax receipts, as we could this year, it is money that could be spent somewhere else.  The first area should not always be the politically sensitive or patient sensitive area.  I am not involved in politics as long as the Deputy and do not have the same experience, but I share his viewpoint in taking a healthy scepticism to what is often presented as the appropriate course of action.</p></speech>

I know that we have the best intentions, but that is not way things happen.  Within reason, can we reassure women that everything has been put in place, that everything that can humanely be done has been done to address the issues that have caused serious concern, including death, as a result of a failure to identify a condition on time?  We know that cases have ended up in court which have made decisions.  This should not be happening.  I have come to the conclusion that a great deal of time and energy and, more particularly, expenditure, will now be put into addressing the legal issues involved, but that does not address the health issues involved.  In actual fact, addressing the health issues involved does not require litigation.  The question is what will be the level of expenditure in defending cases.  I know that there will always be a certain amount spent on legal fees, but if we reach a situation where an inordinate is being spent on legal fees, we will have to question the service we are providing.  We are in the business of providing a health service, not legal services.</p></speech>

We all know - Dr. Scally talks about this issue passionately, with conviction and from experience - that often an early admission that a mistake was made, a genuine apology and learning are what we want as citizens, but all too often we have found someone has to go down the adversarial route to get answers.</p></speech>

The figure was &euro;320 million in 2018.  </p> <p>  We have introduced periodic payments through the Department of Justice and Equality.  When people go to court, they often do not want to receive a massive lump sum, but they need to know that they will be able to care in an orderly manner for themselves or their loved ones affected by an adverse incident.</p> <p>  The third element is a big body of work, on which the Department of Justice and Equality is leading, but we are contributing to it.  An expert group chaired by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan will examine the reform of tort law in this area in general and the reasons medical negligence cases need to be so adversarial to see if there are better ways to deal with cases.  We have seen an element of this in the piece of work done on CervicalCheck and the tribunal legislation we will bring forward, but there is a broader piece of work to be done.  I do not disagree with the point made by the Deputy.</p> <p>  On how we can reassure women that lessons have been learned from what went wrong in non-disclosure following an audit in CervicalCheck, I think the Deputy made the point which I will reiterate.  Obviously, screening is not a diagnostic tool; there are always false positives and false negatives in any screening service.  At the very heart of this debacle there is the issue of non-disclosure.  Disclosure was meant to happen.  It is not a question of whether disclosure is good or bad.  It was agreed that disclosure would happen, but clearly something then went very wrong.  I say to the women of Ireland and their families that we have key recommendations in the Scally report that will fulfil what I believe was Vicki Phelan's ambition when she first spoke to me to say she wanted some good to come out of this.  We will eradicate cervical cancer within a generation and I am determined that we will do so, as is my Department.  Doctors are determined that we will do so and we will do it through vaccination and a really robust screening programme.  We can eradicate this awful disease.  The Scally report is so detailed in its recommendations and people are working very hard on them.  I asked Dr. Scally to stay to oversee progress and he has just produced his first progress report in which he note very good progress has been made.  Encouragingly, he has praised the Department of Health and the HSE for the seriousness with which they have taken the recommendations made in his report.</p></speech>

It relates to whether the oval shape design of the national children's hospital is the most expensive structure to build.  That is not necessarily the case, as it depends on the curvature of the building.  If it is a tight curve, it will costs quite a lot more, but the larger the building, the less likely it is extra costs will be incurred for the simple reason that the curvature will be more gradual.  I hate to impart knowledge, as I usually ask questions, but for the benefit of the multitudes, all of whom have gone home and are issuing press statements, I throw in that fact just to alert them that some of us are watching that matter too.</p></speech>

The actual figure will probably be somewhere in between.  Obviously, there is unmet need in the system, as evidenced by the trolley count which is a crude measure, but nevertheless it indicates the lack of bed capacity to meet the needs of those on waiting lists.</p><p>When will we see new build beds being provided in the next ten years?  Sl&aacute;intecare suggested we should have elective surgery-only hospitals.  My understanding from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and plan is that the choice of location and the design of hospitals will not be available until 2021, but perhaps that is not accurate.  The Minister can clarify the matter.  When will we see the expansion of bed capacity to meet unmet need?  There are approximately 450 consultant vacancies in the system, which is undoubtedly leading to a delay in service provision and meeting unmet need.  Pay disparity between consultants appointed pre and post 2012 is a factor, as are working conditions.  It is a huge problem in service delivery.</p><p> It is very welcome that the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have come to an agreement on the restoration of funding for general practice, but it leaves the issue of many communities being left without a GP when one resigns.  The issue is most acute in rural areas, but it also arises in urban areas and towns.  Will the Minister speak about guaranteeing a community will have a primary care service independent of market forces which often dictate whether a GP will be replaced when someone retires or resigns?  There is a proposal which I presented to him last year for a fellowship programme which the University of Limerick, in particular, is proposing.  When a practice becomes available but cannot attract a candidate, the graduates from the GP training scheme would rotate through the practice, perhaps sharing their work commitments to hospital medicine and research in order that young GPs could supply a service to a community that cannot attract a GP.  They could maintain their university connections and continue to carry out research.  There is a proposal that, as part of a fellowship programme between the university and the HSE, services be provided for a community that cannot attract a GP.  </p><p> The Minister might comment on the three items to which I have referred.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked when new builds or extensions would open.  There are 40 beds due to be opened this year in Clonmel.  I think there are approximately 50 due to be opened in Drogheda, while 60 are under way in University Hospital Limerick.  When we publish the capital plan shortly, it will show how we will endeavour to roll out further beds in the coming two to three years.</p> <p>  On elective surgery-only hospitals, I bow to the Chairman's knowledge, but I would not be satisfied with not selecting sites until then.  My understanding was sites would be selected this year, but I will check and come back to the Chairman on the matter.  As the Department keeps explaining, there is a bigger body of work to be done, as opposed to just picking a site, in deciding what will be provided in the elective surgery-only hospital.  It varies from country to country.  When I visited Scotland recently, I saw what had been done there.  There is even an intensive care unit.  The services to be provided will have a bearing on the site chosen.  I know that the committee will receive a comprehensive briefing on Sl&aacute;intecare this afternoon.</p> <p>  The Chairman made a fair point about consultant vacancies.  We have seen the number of consultants in the system rise, but there are many vacant consultant posts, which is a cause of concern to me.  I have recently met several consultants.  I have met the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the IMO and discussed the issue with individual consultants.  The Public Service Pay Commission states there should be a process in place to deal with the issue of consultant pay.  I will be working my way through it with colleagues to see how best the Government should respond.</p> <p>  The Chairman welcomed the restoration of funding for general practice.  I will consider the fellowship programme again.  The Department and I will respond to the Chairman's suggestion, for which we thank him.  With the IMO we have agreed to increase the rural allowance by 10% from next year and, for the first time ever, establish an urban deprivation fund, something about which the Chairman had spoken to me.  The Deep End group had made a point about the inverse relationship between the availability of health services and meeting the health needs of a community.  There is a fund of &euro;2 million available this year and will be every other year.  We need to work out how best to utilise it.  I will come back to the Chairman on the idea of a fellowship programme.</p></speech>

It was one of the things for which Fianna F&aacute;il had pushed hard in the budget negotiations.  There is also the huge issue of a pay discrepancy for new entrant consultants where consultants have the same qualifications and it so happens one of them worked abroad for a few years but is paid &euro;70,000 less.  It has been identified as one of the big reasons we are finding it so hard to attract back consultants trained in this country or in attracting foreign consultants.  We have the lowest number of consultations in Europe per head of population, which is a major issue.  Within the Estimates are we seeing any provision or is there any thinking to include a provision to unwind or begin to unwind the pay discrepancy for new entrants in order that we can begin to hire the consultants we so badly need?</p></speech>

Being very blunt, there is an issue with consultants' pay.  How we resolve it requires the Government's collective thinking.  Quoting from memory, the Public Service Pay Commission was clear that there should be a process in place to consider the issue.  The decision is not mine alone, but I intend to engage with the Government more broadly on it in the coming weeks to see how we can respond.  As I said to the Chairman, I have had some meetings recently with the IHCA, the IMO and individual consultants.  I cannot go further than that today as there is no agreement.  It would be a new pay agreement.</p></speech>

The issue of new entrants' pay could be dealt with centrally.  We have dealt with GPs' issues, or at least I hope we have dealt with them.  It is a matter for them to decide.  We have made good progress in dealing with the issue of restoration issue, among others.  I accept that consultants' pay is the next big issue from a human resources perspective, with the staffing of the health service.  It will have my full focus in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

From memory, the Sl&aacute;intecare report estimates that the requirement in year one will be around &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  The requirement for activity specifically related to Sl&aacute;intecare as opposed to things that were happening is about &euro;20 million.  Do the Minister and the Department broadly accept the Sl&aacute;intecare figure of several billion euro for the transition fund, or has the Department made its own analysis and has its own profile?  Does the Minister accept the figure &euro;20 million for this year, regardless of the Department&rsquo;s figure which is way below what is needed to launch Sl&aacute;intecare properly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-10a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019041000002#Y00100"><p>There are two parts to that question.  I think the Deputy knows I do not accept there is &euro;20 million for Sl&aacute;intecare this year; there is &euro;20 million in the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  I will not rerun my view from my opening statement.  Even the &euro;27 million for the GP contract this year is clearly Sl&aacute;intecare.  The DPS and prescription charges are directly from Sl&aacute;intecare in the budget.  We have the figure of over &euro;200 million this year for Sl&aacute;intecare.  I know there will be a briefing later at which the Deputy can scrutinise that, but that is the figure we have.</p> <p>  I accept the Sl&aacute;intecare plan; however, I do not accept and have never accepted the sequencing of it.  While I do not speak for the Deputy, I doubt if he would either.  I am not sure if the Chairman would accept it either.  If I accepted the Sl&aacute;intecare plan sequencing, I would have introduced free GP care for another 500,000 people this year, which obviously would have come at a considerable cost, but would have collapsed general practice, without dealing with how to fund general practice.  Through the work of Laura Magahy, we have tried to sequence the aim of Sl&aacute;intecare in a better way.</p></speech>

To be clear on this, I accept the overall cost estimate of the Sl&aacute;intecare report over a ten-year period, but I do not accept its sequencing.  Even the ramping-up period was not, in my view, taken into consideration.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is an excellent report and I fully accept where it wants to get us.  It was not an operational or implementation plan.  We did considerable work to detail it.  We published our response to it last year and now we have published year 1 of the implementation plan this year, so we do have costings.</p> <p>  While I think the Deputy will understand I can brief Deputies and talk to them about some of the costings, we cannot crystallise them publicly.  There are some big things.  For example, one of the big recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare, which I support even though not everyone does, is taking private practice out of public hospitals.  I commissioned a report from Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, which I now have, and once I have deliberated on it, I will bring it to Cabinet in due course.  The cost of that, for example, is likely to result in significant negotiations.  It is hard to crystallise all the costs but broadly speaking, I do not disagree with the costs of Sl&aacute;intecare; I just disagree with the sequencing of it.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to provide the overall spend per year required to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare in order that we can look at that, relative to what is outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p></speech>

While I do not have a note on it, I understand the company has now submitted a revised offer to the HSE that is being considered.  I hope we will have news on that shortly.

I thank the Minister for providing the email with the advice from CervicalCheck to the Department on the offer of free out-of-cycle tests.  It makes for very interesting reading.

It was not passed on to me because all my officials believed all the risks outlined in that were risks that were readily identifiable to them.  There was nothing in this that was new to them.  They knew the risks associated with this and still believed it was the appropriate action to take.  The email pointed out that it was a matter for my Department to make the decision.

I believe it is somewhat irrelevant as to whether they were because I believe the decision was right, based on the advice I had from my officials and the time we were in.  All of the risks in this are similar to risks the Deputy has been outlining in recent weeks.  Indeed, I believe I outlined the content of this email to him as far back as March.  I am satisfied that my officials' explanation that there was nothing in this that they had not already identified was appropriate.  These were readily identifiable risks.</p></speech>

One of the foundation recommendations in the report is to expand universal primary care to the entire population.  The report outlines that the expansion of services cannot take place until we have adequate GP manpower on the ground to deliver it.  While it recommended a roll-out of 500,000 a year, this was only to happen once capacity was available within general practice.  We are talking about whole-time equivalents.  We know the number of GPs on the Medical Council register and who have a GMS contract.  They may not all be whole-time equivalents and the capacity issue relates to the number of whole-time equivalent GPs delivering a service in the system.</p> <p>  As the Minister is aware, a significant number of practices are not taking on any new patients because they cannot deliver the service.  For safety reasons they have closed their lists.  The Minister has come to an agreement with the IMO on restoration of funding, but that may not necessarily deal with the manpower issue.  In order to deliver free GP care to different cohorts of people, such as those aged up to eight, ten or 12, we need the capacity to deliver it.  While the Sl&aacute;intecare report proposed delivering 500,000 new patients to free GP care each year, it was only provided the capacity was there.  There has been no move to increase GP capacity. </p></speech>

I just make the point that in that sense, if one were to be negative, it is somewhat contradictory because it is saying that this must be done in year 1, but later on it states that it can only be done when something is in place.  I thought we needed to make it more programmatic and that is the work Laura Magahy has been doing.</p> <p>  I accept we have more to do on this.  I hope the measures we have agreed with GPs will help to fix the capacity and manpower issue.  We are significantly restoring fees; it is for the IMO and the NAGP to outline that.  We are also going beyond that by increasing the rural allowance, putting urban deprivation in place and providing funding for, I believe, 247 whole-time equivalent practice nurses.  I hope this will make general practice a more attractive career choice in the future.</p></speech>

I want to welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials.  I have already cautioned members and I ask the Minister and his colleagues to please make sure their mobile phones are on silent.  Members should, under the salient rulings of the Chair, not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am pleased to be here.  I thank the committee for taking this matter this morning.  I am joined by officials, Mr. Patrick McCabe and Mr. John Dunphy.</p> <p>The purpose of the motions is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for Ireland to opt-in to Regulation 2018/1726 which relates to the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, or eu-LISA for short.  Ireland already participates in the eu-LISA agency on the basis of our opt-in to eu-LISA establishing Regulation EU/1077/2011 which is repealed by this regulation.   It is therefore necessary for Ireland to opt in to the new regulation which strengthens the mandate of eu-LISA.</p> <p>As a European Union agency, eu-LISA has effectively contributed to the establishment of a co-ordinated, effective and coherent IT environment for the management of large-scale freedom, security and justice IT systems.  euLisa has enabled the pooling of expertise, the harnessing of synergies and allowed a more flexible framework than was possible when the systems were developed and managed by the commission, with certain tasks entrusted to public sector bodies in two member states.  The new regulation will benefit member states and agencies who are end users of the relevant large scale IT systems by enhancing the role of eu-LISA with regard to future developments in IT systems and providing support to member states when required.  Ireland has representatives who attend the advisory groups in respect of the IT systems in which we participate which are the SIS II and Eurodac.  Representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also participate in the management board of eu-LISA which, among other tasks, appoints and oversees the work of the agency&rsquo;s executive director.</p> <p>The support of eu-LISA and our other partner member states has been invaluable to Ireland in the development of our own solutions for these large scale IT systems.  The participation of euLISA is of particular importance for the Garda&rsquo;s project to connect to the Schengen information system, SIS II.  Technical experts from eu-LISA have been involved both on the ground in Dublin and through web attendance at workshops on topics such as data migration.  euLisa, working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to build and test the systems necessary to ensure that Ireland is in a position to go live on SIS II early next year.</p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in eu-LISA has also been important for our connection to the update of Ireland&rsquo;s national Eurodac systems, as required by our participation in the Eurodac regulation.  The Oireachtas approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in both SIS II and Eurodac and we are now bound by our obligations under those regulations.  The support of eu-LISA is vital in meeting these obligations.  </p> <p>This regulation expanding eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate will ensure that the agency is adapted to meet current challenges at EU level in the area of migration and security, and provide a proper legal basis for euLISA&rsquo;s operation and management of the planned new IT systems.  Before going into some detail about the new eu-LISA regulation, I merely wish to emphasise that participation in the eu-LISA agency does not mean that Ireland will be opting into any additional regulations in respect of any EU large-scale IT system.   Continued participation in eu-LISA would not oblige Ireland to participate in the new systems under its expanded mandate.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in such systems is a matter for the individual legal bases governing such IT systems.</p> <p>In particular, I want to acknowledge concerns of Deputies which were raised last night in the D&aacute;il on the proposed interoperability of EU large-scale IT systems.  It is true that eu-LISA will have a mandate to develop any technical features of interoperability which may arise as a result of proposals in this area.  However, I want to be very clear that it is not the case that Ireland will participate in measures relating to the interoperability of large-scale EU IT systems in the justice and home affairs area as a result of our opt-in to this eu-LISA regulation.  Ireland has the option under Article 4 of Protocol 21 to participate in the forthcoming interoperability regulations following their adoption.  These proposals have not yet been agreed at Union level so the decision to exercise our opt-in would require the consent of the Oireachtas under the justice and home affairs protocol.  There would be a debate on the merits of interoperability regulation at that point.  Therefore, I would ask that Deputies not by any manner of means conflate interoperability with this eu-LISA regulation which Ireland will participate in only in so far as it relates to the systems in which we already participate.  It would not be appropriate to have a debate on the interoperability proposals which have not yet been agreed at this time because no decision has been made as to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in it.  Ireland does not yet participate in all of the systems that is proposed to make interoperable, for example the ECRIS-TCN system.  For this reason I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General and I decided not to propose to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in under Article 3 of Protocol 21 when the interoperability proposals were published.  These proposals are somewhat complex and would require a dedicated discussion as to their merits but that is not the topic before us this morning.  The number of EU large-scale IT systems has grown and it is therefore important to place eu-LISA&rsquo;s responsibility for their operational management on a statutory footing.  In this regard this regulation achieves this goal in respect of the entry-exit system and the EU travel information and authorisation system.  Additionally, eu-LISA will now be enabled to provide more support and advice to member states.  The regulation places additional responsibility on eu-LISA for improving the quality of the data, establishing common data quality indicators and developing an anonymised central repository for reporting and statistics.  The regulation extends eu-LISA&rsquo;s mandate concerning research in particular, giving eu-LISA the task of implementing the parts of the framework programme for research and innovation which relate to IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  </p> <p>It is proposed that more pilot projects may be entrusted to eu-LISA.  The new mandate of eu-LISA offers the possibility of support to the Commission and to member states in periods of exceptional need.  I believe, therefore, that it is essential that Ireland is an active partner in Europe&rsquo;s fight against terrorism in the effort to ensure effective management of our borders.  eu-Lisa is an essential agency that has demonstrated significant added value and whose expanded mandate effectively addresses gaps in the current systems.  We look forward to continuing to play an active role in the agency, bearing in mind our limited participation which focuses on the field of police cooperation.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s opt in to the regulation and continue what has been a beneficial relationship within eu-LISA.    Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Because we are not in Schengen most of it does not apply to us anyway.  I do accept that, including the most controversial aspects that we discussed last night, but that does not mean that we have not got an obligation to be critical of those or make points about them.  I do want to put them on the record because the interoperability proposals that this committee yellow-carded last October are at the back of this.  We sent a reasoned opinion to the Commission on its proposals for the interoperable border and security systems, which is nearly like an EU Stasi at this stage, whereby Big Brother is most definitely watching if one was not born inside the EU.  I will not repeat the points but the European Data Protection Commissioner has huge problems with it.  What we are doing today is extending the competencies of an existing body.  I get that.  We are extending it in such a way that it can implement the controversial interoperability proposals that we were unhappy about in October.  The concerns about linking migration and terrorism, which is at the heart of this, remain.  We need to have a serious discussion on that, why it is happening and how we should respond to it.  In the opinion on the interoperability proposals last autumn the European Data Protection Supervisor signalled his concerns about the implications and called for a wider debate.  That is the reason we asked for it to be discussed in the House, because there has not been any debate at all on this in the EU or in Ireland.  It is creating a mega interoperable database, which is a serious problem that I do not think the citizens of Europe have been consulted on, so we need to have these conversations.  I make no apologies that we demanded a discussion on it last night because nothing good can come of this linking of migration and terrorism.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to be clear in his response.  Are we effectively only opting in to the police co-operation aspects of SIS 2?  Is that it?  If we agree to these motions, are we signing up to any of the other aspects such as VIS, the border aspects of SIS II, EES and ETIAS or do we remain entirely outside of those?  They are my two questions.</p></speech>

It is important that data protection be upheld in respect of any further development of these systems.  Members will be aware that SIS II is supervised by the European Data Protection Supervisor.  The supervision is allocated to the data protection authorities in each member state, so any concerns that people might have about any perceived transgressions in respect of data protection can be can allayed on the basis that when Ireland connects to SIS II the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be obliged to investigate any complaints that might be received.</p> <p>  I add to that the fact that we have already undergone Schengen evaluation in the area of data protection, so any concerns that Deputies might have can be addressed by assurances on the part of the Office of the Data Protection Commission here.  Ireland will not be participating in ETIAS or VIS and EES on the border aspects of SIS II.  The legal solution that we have agreed explicitly provides that we can participate in the regulation without having to opt in to the underlying Schengen acquis.  Ireland is not a party to either the visa aspects or the border aspects of the Schengen framework and that position will not in any way be affected or impacted upon by this regulation.</p></speech>

It is worth having this discussion and the one we had yesterday.  The Minister has stated that it would not be appropriate to have a discussion on interoperability here today.  I accept it is not the primary topic before us but the issues are linked.  Although the Minister might disagree, it seems to me that part of what this proposal is doing is prepping eu-LISA for the forthcoming interoperability proposal.  I do not think it is inappropriate to ask, if the Minister is willing to answer.  As things stand, in their current form, does the Government favour the interoperability proposals?</p></speech>

The motions this morning are quite specific and we are not going beyond them.  There is no proposal, nor indeed should there be any inference, that Ireland would participate further in any interoperability arrangement.  Should the issue arise in the future it will be subject to debate and that debate will involve an approval by the majority membership of the Oireachtas.  I want to make it clear that it does not arise at this time and nor should that issue be in any way conflated or confused with the motions before us, which are quite clear in import.  There is not any proposal for further engagement in the interoperability framework.</p></speech>

If eu-LISA is going to be one of the key vehicles for the interoperability proposals when they pass into European law, it is of relevance whether Ireland decides to opt in.  Those proposals could change.  Has the Government communicated its view to the European institutions - to the Council or the Commission - in the past year on the interoperability proposals?</p></speech>

Ireland has not exercised its opt-in under Protocol No. 21 nor indeed is there a proposal in that regard.  Were that to occur, it would be subject to our obligations, which would involve a debate here in the national Parliament.</p></speech>

I do not have a question for the Minister.  I support the motions seeking to enable Ireland to opt in to continue our participation in Eurodac and SIS II.  I am conscious of the fact that the D&aacute;il previously approved our participation in these systems, so in effect what we are doing is supporting these motions in order to continue our participation in them.</p> <p>  I note what Deputy Clare Daly said.  It is correct to state that we should not link migration with terrorism, but we do have an issue in the European Union in respect of crime and terrorism and it has to be dealt with and one of the ways to deal with it is through increased police co-operation.  I think these motions will assist in that co-operation continuing.  When one looks at what is happening in the United Kingdom at present and the chaos they have got themselves into over Brexit, one of the real concerns they have, which has come home to roost, is that if they depart from the European Union without a deal, there will be issues in terms of the safety of that country, and that is the main reason why the Cabinet Secretary has given advice to the Cabinet there that they should not go out with no deal.  </p></speech>

In the event of a search taking place within this jurisdiction, the same search will also be carried out and take effect on the Schengen information system.  It is a dovetailing of the information here at national level with an integrated system across the European Union.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight the fact that we spent much of the past year discussing data protection and privacy.  Could the Minister put on record that he believes the proposal is fully consistent with the general data protection regulation?  </p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, there is a significant role for our Data Protection Commissioner in the context of the European Data Protection Supervisor.  I believe it is important in all circumstances that fundamental rights are observed and that we would not engage in any activity that might in any way encroach upon what might be regarded as fundamental rights.  That is why the involvement at justice and home affairs level of the European Fundamental Rights Agency is important.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider governance issues, strategies and challenges facing Irish soccer.  In this regard, I welcome Mr. Donal Conway, president of the board of the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, Mr. Eddie Murray, honorary treasurer, Mr. Paraic Treanor, chairman of the legal and corporate affairs committee, Ms Rea Walshe, interim CEO, Mr. John Delaney, executive vice president, Mr. Fran Gavin, competitions director, and Mr. Ruud Dokter, high performance director.</p><p>Before we commence, I will, as is the case for all of our meetings, read the notice relating to privilege and the evidence people may give.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Conway to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Included in my presentation are details of those who are accompanying me.  I will not read them out because the Chairman has already done so.</p> <p>  Originally, we were to appear in respect of governance issues, strategies and challenges facing Irish soccer and related matters.</p><p>While the focus may have changed due to events, we remain in a position to discuss any other matter relating to public funds received by the association and their application.  We need to be mindful of our legal obligations and the remit of the committee and to respect the privacy and data protection rights of our employees and related parties.</p><p> Grant Thornton has been engaged by the board of the FAI to conduct an internal review of the association's books, records and ledgers.  It has been on site at the FAI since yesterday week.  I will reference it further in my statement.</p><p> The committee also asked for the attendance of the person filling the position of corporate affairs and licensing director.  John Delaney has been appointed executive vice president.  This is in order to utilise his skills and connections at UEFA and FIFA levels effectively.  In the view of the board, this will be to the benefit of Irish football.  In his place, Rea Walshe has been appointed interim chief executive officer.  The board thanks her for stepping up to this role at short notice and at a difficult time.  There has been no full-time person appointed to Ms Walshe's former role as yet.  If I recall correctly, the committee had asked for that person to be present, but we have not made the appointment yet.</p><p> I wish to put on the record that no disrespect was intended to the committee or Sport Ireland by the FAI's letter of last week.  Sport Ireland has been and is an important stakeholder for us.  Its financial support and advice to us over 20 years have been unstinting and we were honoured to become the first national governing body to move onto the Abbotstown campus.  We have much to do to rebuild trust and confidence in the association and we are committed to achieving this as a board.</p><p> The association notes the comments made last week by the committee and Sport Ireland and acknowledges their concerns.  The board of the FAI met on Wednesday in a scheduled meeting.  The board regretted that it was not in a position to assist Sport Ireland with answers to its questions before Sport Ireland attended the committee.  We have since met Sport Ireland and continue to engage with it.  We have emphasised to it that we are moving as fast as we can, being mindful of the complexity of the issues involved, including legal issues and the need to ensure that all statements we make are accurate and our internal and external processes are fair and robust.  No disrespect was intended by the lateness of the letter of 2 April to Sport Ireland or its brief contents.  I apologise for this and accept that more information would have assisted Sport Ireland and the committee.</p><p> The board is seeking to address the concerns raised fully and many steps are being taken to do so and to establish the requisite detail for Sport Ireland and the committee.  The association has established a sub-committee from among its board members.  This is working closely with the FAI's external advisers and auditors to address these matters urgently.</p><p> Regarding governance, members will be aware that the FAI has a governance group, which has assisted us in making some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were improved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteers policy and a conflict of interest form.  New Government guidelines on terms for board members apply from 2021.  The association held an EGM this year where it voted to limit board members to eight years' service in line with the Government's governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  On 7 February, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said-----</p></speech>

The next page related to that.  There is the option for the board to appoint an independent person to the sub-committee.  We have spoken to Sport Ireland regarding this.  We have also offered to Sport Ireland the opportunity to meet the sub-committee, our finance department staff and Grant Thornton to go through the relevant accounts to assure it that all Government funding has been properly spent since the last audit.</p> <p>  Global auditing and consulting group Mazars has been commissioned by the sub-committee to conduct an independent and in-depth external review of all matters.  The board has requested that this review be completed as soon as possible.  Pending that review, the association has separately and urgently engaged Grant Thornton to conduct an internal review of its books, records and ledgers.  Grant Thornton has been on site at the FAI in Abbotstown for the past eight days.  Its involvement also allows the queries raised regarding the &euro;100,000 issue from 2017 to be addressed so as to ensure that the response to queries is comprehensive and accurate.  I will now read into the record Grant Thornton's view of the &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

On 25 April 2017, an internal finance meeting was held by members of the finance team and the then chief executive officer.  At the meeting, the cash flow position of the association identified a possible cash flow issue at that time.  Acknowledging that the association's revenues operate in a cyclical fashion, this was an unusual situation and was not repeated in 2018.  The association's position on 25 April 2017 was that if all cheques issued in the week ending 28 April 2017 were cashed or presented to the bank at the same time, there was a likelihood of insufficient funds being available to cover all of them.  This was, however, a short-term issue as there was a legitimate expectation that funds would come to the association in the short term arising from various income streams including ticket sales, sponsorship, grant funding and other sources.  The CEO provided the association with a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 and thereby made funds available to provide some immediate financial relief and for the said funds to be used in a context where such additional funding was required by the association.  On Wednesday, 26 April 2017, a request was received by email from one particular creditor who was entitled to draw down funds from the association for just such a draw down.  The financial director contacted the chief executive officer via email, proposing to lodge the cheque for &euro;100,000 to the association's bank account to honour the draw-down request from the particular creditor.  The request was acknowledged by the chief executive officer and payment was made to the particular creditor.  The board acknowledged that the circumstances of the above &euro;100,000 transaction was exceptional and the repayment was subsequently made by the association on 16 June 2017 to the then chief executive officer.  No contract or agreement was entered into between the association and its then chief executive officer and no interest or charges have been levied or paid by the association in respect of the transaction.</p> <p>  Having been informed of the &euro;100,000 payment, the board acknowledged that disclosure would be made in the necessary financial statements in accordance with the required accounting treatment and the provisions of the Companies Act.  The association has since embarked on a review of its internal control processes and procedures to ensure a situation of this nature cannot arise again.  Mr. Delaney will also address this issue in his opening statement.</p></speech>

The association recognises and shares the desire for these matters to be addressed as soon as possible and with due regard to the different ongoing processes and legal requirements.  The FAI is also engaging with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in dealing with its inquiries.</p> <p>  I turn to governance.  The committee will be aware that the FAI has a governance group which has assisted us to make some changes in compliance with the governance code.  A number of policies and procedures were approved in 2018, including a code of conduct for board members, a schedule of reserved functions, a volunteering policy and a conflict of interest form.  New governance guidelines on term limits for board members will apply from 2021.  This year, the association held an EGM at which it voted to limit board members to eight years' service which is in line with the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  On 7 February 2019, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, said the Government and Sport Ireland were satisfied with the new term limits for FAI board members.  We have also copied the committee with the report of Jonathan Hall Associates.  The board plans to undertake a root and branch review of the FAI and to strengthen our commitment to reform through the establishment of a new group to review and recommend changes in governance to the association.  We have indicated to Sport Ireland that we will seek its input on the composition of the group.  I am aware the committee wishes to question us on the adoption of the code and will not pre-empt that.  The board has also advised Sport Ireland that recent public comments by the FAI did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000 payment to the association in 2017.  That matter is being considered by the board's subcommittee, which was established in recent weeks.</p> <p>  I turn to address in order the questions posed by the committee to the board in recent correspondence.  The first question was on the process engaged in by the FAI to draw down State funding from Sport Ireland, including the annual certification process.  On an annual basis, the FAI submits a programme of action to Sport Ireland outlining our plans within the grassroots, player development, coach education and football services departments.  This sets out comprehensive programme plans, the key objectives and targets to be achieved and the expected timeline to achieve them.  Our programme of action also includes our annual budget for these programmes along with planned appointments for the year ahead.  The FAI also submits an end-of-year update on the previous year's programme of action which sets out the actual targets achieved and the actual income and expenditure for the previous year.  We also provide the following documentation, namely the terms and conditions of grant approval for the year ahead; an anti-doping compliance report; an update on participation figures; an update on FAInet, which is our registered players' database, and an update on our grassroots strategic pillars.  These reports are provided to Sport Ireland by the end of January each year.  Sport Ireland reviews our submissions and reverts with any queries which are dealt with in a timely manner.  The grant draw-down process is made by way of a letter from our financial director or CEO to the CEO of Sport Ireland.</p><p>Sport Ireland generally approves our field sport grant during the second quarter but it has the ability to release up to 50% of our annual grant before it formally approves the annual funding.  After its internal approval process, it will advance us a further 25%.  The final 25% is held until we provide an interim report on activities and budgets, our signed and approved financial statements, and an update on proceedings from our AGM in July or August.  Any queries, if applicable, are dealt with and once Sport Ireland is satisfied that the FAI has met all required criteria, the final balance of funding is processed.</p><p> The committee's second question was to request the entirety of the terms and conditions of grant approval including the manner in which the Football Association of Ireland ensures compliance with same.  I have brought a full copy of the Sport Ireland terms and conditions for grant approval for the committee.  I do not propose to read this into the record.  I refer to clause 4.3 of the further reporting section of our annual terms and conditions.  It requires the association to notify Sport Ireland in writing in the event of any material deterioration in its financial position.  We acknowledge that certain circumstances arose in April 2017 which were not reported to Sport Ireland.  We will work with Sport Ireland in order to establish a process to ensure the FAI is, in future, fully compliant with clause 4.3.  All other clauses within the terms and conditions are met.  We have also invited Sport Ireland to satisfy itself on this matter by meeting our colleagues.</p><p> The next question was on the process by which the financial statements of the Football Association of Ireland are compiled, including the sign-off mechanism, before production to Sport Ireland in accordance with the financial reporting obligation contained in the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee also asked for an explanation as to why particular credit facilities afforded to the Football Association of Ireland were not disclosed as part of this financial statement for the relevant year:</p><p> The FAI uses Sage 200 financial software to manage its financial transactions.  Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and are reviewed by the finance director.  Actual versus budget reports are sent to all budget owners on a monthly basis for their review and action.  Monthly management accounts are presented to the finance committee and to the board.  On a quarterly basis, a full financial business review takes place between the CEO, the finance team and the relevant budget owners to discuss financial performance to date and any necessary action required.  At the year end, reports are exported from Sage 200 and mapped via Excel into financial statements.  A final review with the CEO takes place before the reports are presented to our auditors for independent review.  Our audit committee convenes at least twice during the auditing process.  Once this audit is completed, the financial statements are presented to the board for its approval and sign-off.  The signed financial statements are submitted to Sport Ireland for their review as per the terms and conditions of our annual grant.  We are currently looking at measures to review processes and to recommend controls to ensure full compliance with company law.</p><p> The committee asked for information on any audits carried out by Sport Ireland of the Football Association of Ireland, including the results of any such audit.  Sport Ireland audits tend to take place every three years.  There is an audit scheduled to take place this year and the last Sport Ireland audit took place in 2016.  </p><p> The committee also asked for information on the historical context to the drawdown of Sport Ireland funding including the timing of the drawdown, any requests for early drawdown and co-operation between Sport Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland in relation to such requests.</p><p> Sport Ireland has always supported the FAI and understands the cyclical nature of our funding.  Generally we would, with the agreement of Sport Ireland, draw down 50% of our annual field sports grant by the end of the first quarter, the next 25% would be released once Sport Ireland reviewed our annual January submissions and approved our annual grant internally, and the final instalment would be released once Sport Ireland satisfied itself that we had met all the required criteria.  This always takes place after our AGM in July or August each year.  Our programmes commence 1 January each year and a significant amount of our Sport Ireland funding contributes towards the cost of development officers and other grassroots administration roles.</p><p> The committee asked about the Football Association of Ireland&rsquo;s progress on the adoption of the code of practice for good governance for voluntary and charitable organisations, noting that the Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies and national sports partnerships adopt the code by the end of 2021.  A governance committee was established in 2017 to ensure implementation of the code of practice for good governance in community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland and since its establishment has introduced the following: a board induction process, a code of conduct for board members, a conflict of interests form, a schedule of reserved functions for the board, a volunteer policy, and standing orders for board meetings.  In addition, term limits of eight years for all new board members have been introduced and three members of the board have been appointed to the FAI&rsquo;s audit committee.  The association intends to be fully compliant with the code by the end of 2021, within the deadline set out in the national sports policy.</p><p> The committee asked about communication between the Football Association of Ireland and Sport Ireland, including any statutory requests made by Sport Ireland seeking information from the Football Association of Ireland.  Each of our departments liaise with their counterparts in Sport Ireland.  We have developed very good working relationships with Sport Ireland and meet with it on a regular basis.  It seeks our assistance for various initiatives including organisational training, anti-doping measures, risk registers etc.  Statutory requests tend to come through either our legal or business partnerships departments, where they are dealt with as appropriate.  </p><p> We were also asked whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds in respect of certain programmes, and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain these programmes without State assistance.  State funding is of significant importance to FAI in delivering our grassroots programmes, in keeping with our overall policy of &ldquo;Football for All&rdquo;.  This, along with other funding sources through local authorities, has facilitated the growth of our nationwide development officer network.  We have a network of 57 development officers, with a further four in the process of recruitment.  The majority of development officer roles are co-funded.  This allows us to grow participation numbers nationally and to develop new participation programmes targeting our entire population.  The FAI would not have the capacity to maintain these programmes without the assistance of State funding.  Our 2019 programme of action budget shows the apportionment of our Sport Ireland grant relative to the actual cost of running these programmes.  The association matches each &euro;1 invested through Sport Ireland funding with an additional &euro;4, as acknowledged by Sport Ireland.</p><p> The business of sport is very different from others.  The qualification stage process of football is unique.  Financial fluctuations are the norm and cashflow is often irregular.  The disappointment of the failure of the men&rsquo;s senior team to qualify for World Cup 2018 had a major impact on match attendance and, subsequently, cashflow.  I know the committee wishes to question us about whether the presence of State funding is displacing the use of FAI funds and whether the FAI has the capacity to sustain programmes without State assistance.  I will not delay now, as I know members wish to raise queries on these issues, except to say we could not do what we do without State assistance.  Similarly, the activities of the FAI help to enable the State to meet some of its policy aims, especially in the areas of health and social inclusion.</p><p> I appreciate that Sport Ireland confirmed to the committee last week that its auditors were satisfied that all moneys granted to the FAI were expended in the manner for which they had been provided.  I want to make clear how seriously we take the issues that have emerged in recent weeks.  The sub-committee of the board has been working every day since its establishment on 26 March to plan a way forward, to ensure transparency, and to promote greater trust in our organisation.</p><p>Much work has been done in recent years to create a more financially sustainable organisation.  Cashflow management is at the forefront of our financial planning.  In time, a process will be put in train to appoint a new CEO, answerable to, but not a member of, the board in line with best governance practices.  We will use an outside independent body to assist in this search.  One of the main requirements for the next CEO will be to build on important relationships that already exist with Sport Ireland, the Oireachtas, this committee and all our stakeholders. <br/><br/>Members may be aware that our association commissioned Jonathan Hall Associates to engage in a review of senior executive roles.  The board had recognised that the workload of the CEO had expanded considerably over recent years and further expansion was likely, having regard to a number of potential strategic international projects under consideration.  Over the next three to four years, considerable demands will arise from the hosting of the Euro 2020 fixtures, the bids being assembled on a North-South basis for the 2023 under-21 men&rsquo;s European Championship finals, and the joint UK-Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup.  It was the board&rsquo;s view that, coupled with the demands of managing a growing organisation, it was neither feasible nor best practice for the responsibility for addressing all these challenges to be placed on a single individual.  It was also the board&rsquo;s view that, in considering how roles might be structured, the association should have regard to models in place in other football associations and the unique influencing power and skills which are vested in the person of the former CEO by reference to his personal position as a member of the UEFA executive committee.  It was the Jonathan Hall Associates review which led to the creation of the position of executive vice-president. <br/><br/>Turning to the good work of the football family, while I acknowledge that members will be interested in questioning us about matters that have featured in the media in recent weeks, it is my duty to put on record the recent achievements of the Irish football family at every level.  These should not be lost in the heat of controversy.  I am sure that if I did not refer to these achievements, I would be criticised in many quarters, especially the football family.  Our national men&rsquo;s team, led by Mick McCarthy, has won its two opening matches in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA European Championship and sits on top of group D with six points.  As many members will be aware, Dublin will host four games at the Euro 2020 finals, with huge financial benefit for the economy.  If Ireland qualifies, we will be guaranteed two home games at the tournament.<br/><br/>Our national women&rsquo;s team, managed by Colin Bell, will begin its UEFA 2021 European Championship qualifying campaign against Montenegro in September, while our under-21 men&rsquo;s team, in Stephen Kenny's first match in charge, beat Luxembourg 3-0 on 24 March.  Tom Mohan&rsquo;s squad recently qualified for this summer&rsquo;s UEFA under-19 finals, as winners of its elite qualifying group.  Unlike other tournament finals, only eight of the 55 nations qualify for the under-19 tournament finals.  Next month, we will host the UEFA under-17 European Championship, with games to be played in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford and Longford, where Colin O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s team will carry Irish hopes.  Our under-19 and under-17 women&rsquo;s teams have recently enjoyed victories over Serbia and Scotland, respectively, in their European Championship qualifiers.  Domestically, attendances have risen by more than 11% in the SSE Airtricity League of Ireland, with average increases of 13.5% and 42.9% in the premier division and first division, respectively.  At SSE Airtricity national league level, under-13 football was launched recently, which will complement the under-19, under-17, under-15 and under-13 levels and constitute part of our work with our high-performance director to design our new elite player pathway.  At grassroots level, the latest Irish Sports Monitor report by Sport Ireland confirms football as the sport with the greatest level of participation in the country.  Our recent implementation of the online FAInet process has registered 213,000 players in more than 86 leagues.  We continue to deliver our FAI strategic plan for 2016 to 2020 and we are in the fourth annual operations plan linked with the strategy, with positive outcomes in 2018 in respect of the targets set.  We are well on target towards full implementation by 2020. <br/><br/>The FAI also continues what I would describe as invaluable work in the following areas.  Our player development plan, under the auspices of high-performance director Ruud Dokter, is in its fourth year, with an emphasis on a player focused model, creating better players for the future.  Our emerging talent programme helps identify and develop talented young players from under-11 upwards throughout the country, with a view to helping them progress on to the international stage.  The regional emerging talent network has ten centres nationwide and ancillary centres in Dublin, with 1,200 players between boys and girls at three separate age groups.  In partnership with education and training boards, ETBs, nationwide, the FAI operates 11 local training initiatives that provide a unique blend of educational and football development for talented young footballers, both male and female.  The FAI-ETB player development programme enables participants to train full time while availing of a sport-themed education course, accredited at Quality and Qualifications Ireland level 5, which enables young players to achieve their academic and sporting potential.  Nine of our SSE Airtricity League of Ireland clubs have links with third level institutions.  The aim of our football for all programme is the delivery of football opportunities to people who may not ordinarily get a chance to play the beautiful game.  The programme comprises players from all groups and sporting bodies that cater for people with a disability who want to play football, and approximately 3,800 players participate.<br/><br/>Furthermore, our football programme for the homeless and our late-night leagues, many of them in disadvantaged areas, continue to grow.  We launched the under-17 women&rsquo;s national league, with 11 clubs participating.  This is a further vital step to develop women&rsquo;s football at underage level.  Last year, we launched the glow football programme, which has the aim of encouraging young girls to become involved in football through a fun concept of playing indoor football to music in the dark under ultraviolet light.  Our FAI Aviva soccer sisters programme, now in its 13th year, will see girls between the ages of six and 14 attending football camps during the Easter holiday, bookings for which are already at record levels.  More than 42% of the 37,200 children taking part in thi<b>s </b>year's Spar primary school 5s programme are female, while 1,693 schools were involved.  More than 20,000 children from 1,038 schools took part in the 2018 primary and post-primary schools futsal programme, while more than 35,000 children participated in our Sports Direct summer soccer schools in a record 400 camps.  There were 2,245 participants in our school-club link programmes in 2018.  The FAI won the diversity and inclusion award at the 2018 Irish Sport Industry Awards organised by the Federation of Irish Sport.  In 2018, we rolled out the integration through football project and the sports welcomes refugees programme, both supported by the Department of Justice and Equality and the European Commission.  Four new development officers began work with the FAI during 2018 in Kilkenny and Dublin.  Two of the roles are solely dedicated to women&rsquo;s football, while one is for inclusion programmes. <br/><br/>These achievements and programmes can happen thanks only to the hard work and dedication of the players, the fans and our staff, and I pay credit to them all today.  I also apologise to them for the FAI currently being the subject of controversy and I hope a stronger and better association will emerge from our present difficulties.  This work could not take place without the vital funding we receive from the State.</p><p>I want to repeat how grateful the FAI is to receive these moneys via Sport Ireland.  They go towards programmes such as those I mentioned.</p><p> We appreciate also that receipt of State funding brings with it a heightened level of public and political scrutiny.  That is as it should be.  Nevertheless, the point should be made at this stage that FAI activities are primarily funded via UEFA and FIFA and through commercial and philanthropic sources, not to mention the various fundraising activities at local level in communities the length and breadth of Ireland.  This is not a one-way street, by which I mean football in Ireland, and our work in the FAI, brings with it not just huge social, health and community benefits, it also brings an economic benefit to the country and its economy.  Sport Ireland noted last week that for every euro it gives the FAI, the association spends four more.  This facilitates participation at grassroots level and enables us to reach out to all across the country who wish to play football and experience some of the excellent personal, health, community and societal benefits involved.</p><p> Despite our success on the pitch, and in communities around Ireland, the past few weeks have undoubtedly been a difficult time for Irish football and the FAI.  We are determined as a board, and I am determined as president, that our sole focus shall once again be to promote football in this country.  I hope the processes that we are putting in place in the short term, and the long-term processes around governance and reform, will help to restore the committee's faith in the FAI.</p></speech>

The Grant Thornton exercise is to assist our internal review, to make it more robust and to bring in outside expertise.  The Mazars exercise is fully independent.  We enlisted the support of Grant Thornton to examine the association's books, records and ledgers.  We envisage Grant Thornton conducting an investigation while also providing support to our own staff.  Its involvement represents an extra resource for our own staff.  It is very important to stress, from a board perspective, that at no stage were we trying to delay answering the committee's questions.</p> <p>  The additional page provided to the committee today was only completed yesterday by Grant Thornton.</p></speech>

I want to address the committee on the issue of &euro;100,000 I gave to the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, in April 2017, which was repaid to me in June 2017.<br/><br/>First of all I want to say how truly saddened I am that Sport Ireland, which provided annual State funding of &euro;2.9 million to the Football Association of Ireland, has announced that it has temporarily withdrawn the funding to the association pending reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.<br/><br/>I wish to make it clear that I have urged a speedy response to the queries received from Sport Ireland, and I this week I have already met with Grant Thornton and with the FAI on these issues.  I will respond to any request to a meeting as soon as I hear from Mazars.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, 25 April 2017 we had an internal finance meeting at the FAI.  This meeting was attended by our director of finance, Mr. Eamon Breen, our financial controller Ms Yvonne Tsang, and me as the CEO.  At this meeting I was advised that if all cheques and FAI bank transfers issued to third parties at that time were presented for payment that the FAI would exceed its overdraft limit of &euro;1.5 million on its bank accounts, which were held with Bank of Ireland.  I expressed concern and surprise at the meeting as to how the FAI could have arrived at this position.  I recall thinking at the time that if I had been approached even a few days earlier I may have been able to better address the issue.  I asked if any funds were due to the FAI that could resolve the matter and I was informed that there was nothing due imminently that could be confirmed at that stage.<br/><br/>As the matter was pressing and we only had a few hours to resolve the potential issues that would arise if the bank overdraft limit was exceeded, as a precautionary measure and to assist the FAI I wrote a cheque for &euro;100,000 from my personal account to the FAI.  This cheque was made payable to the FAI and I gave it to our director of finance, Eamon Breen, telling him to only lodge the cheque if it became clear that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.<br/><br/>Later that afternoon I travelled to London and the next day I travelled on to Geneva, Switzerland, where I was attending UEFA business on behalf of the FAI.  I recall phoning our honorary secretary, Mr. Michael Cody informing him that I had made a precautionary payment to the FAI by way of a personal cheque for &euro;100,000 to assist in the event that the bank overdraft was going to be exceeded.  I informed him that I was very concerned and that I had to act quickly to assist the Football Association of Ireland.  I recall also informing the then president Mr. Tony Fitzgerald who was chairman of the board at the time.<br/><br/>The following day while I was in Geneva I received a call from our director of finance, Eamon Breen, informing me that there was a requirement to lodge the cheque by &euro;100,000 and he subsequently confirmed that request to me by email.  I agreed that the cheque should be lodged.  I asked the director of finance when I would be paid back and he said it would be as soon as the funds came in.<br/><br/>I subsequently received a cheque for &euro;100,000 on 16 June 2017 from the Football Association of Ireland, repaying the amount in full and which I lodged to my personal account on 23 June 2017.  I did not receive any interest payment and I would never have expected it.  I was only acting to assist the FAI and for the benefit of Irish football.<br/><br/>I recall asking the director of finance, Eamon Breen, if the FAI had any reporting or disclosure obligations arising out of the &euro;100,000 payment.  There was a board meeting on Monday, 19 June 2017 and the &euro;100,000 payment did not arise.<br/><br/>On Monday, 4 March 2019 I informed the board of the FAI of the precautionary payment I had made, following a media query received from <i>The Sunday Times. </i>On Saturday, 16 March 2019 I initiated court proceedings against <i>The Sunday Times</i>at my own cost in relation to this matter because I believed at the time that this information had emanated from documentation that had been filed in the family courts.  I accept that the overdraft limit issue arose on my watch as the chief executive officer.  I wish that it had not happened but I acted in the best interests of the association.<br/><br/>We have an excellent and committed finance and administration team and body of employees at the FAI, and many voluntary workers and players at all levels throughout the country.  I regret the embarrassment this entire issue has caused to them and the association but I did it in the best interests of football.<br/><br/>I will continue to assist fully the Football Association of Ireland in its engagements with Sport Ireland and Grant Thornton.  When called upon to do so I will do likewise with Mazars and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in their respective inquiries.<br/><br/>On legal advice I am precluded from making any further comments at this hearing in relation to the finances of the association or my former role as CEO, or on the &euro;100,000 payment, either directly or indirectly.In the interests of fair procedures and natural justice I have made this statement to the committee and attended this meeting voluntarily, as I have attended many Oireachtas committees in the past.  I am not in a position to answer any such questions here at this time.  Given that some members of this committee have made highly prejudicial public pronouncements about me personally prior to my attendance here today, and in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Kerins case, I ask that the committee respects this position.<br/><br/>I am happy to answer any other questions in relation to my current role as executive vice president responsible for UEFA and FIFA matters.  As most members will know I am passionate about football and always have been.  In my role as executive vice-president I look forward to welcoming the European under-17 boys championships to Ireland next month.  This will see 16 teams play and provide at least 9,000 bed spaces for tourism for the country.  Next year Dublin is one of 12 European cities to host the Euro 2020.  This will see four matches played at the Aviva Stadium, hopefully including the Republic of Ireland team.  We are currently bidding for the 2023 under-21 men's tournament with the Irish Football Association.  This is a very significant project and demonstrates how the round ball can unify both associations on this island.<br/><br/>I would also like to see a Women's Champions League final being played in Dublin at the Aviva Stadium, perhaps to mark the 50th anniversary of the Women's Football Association in Ireland in 2023.<br/><br/>I, as an executive committee member of UEFA, along with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, am currently working on a feasibility study that we hope will result in the 2030 FIFA World Cup being hosted across these islands.<br/><br/>From a financial perspective UEFA would provide the FAI with somewhere between &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million annually depending on participation in major tournaments.

Deputy Catherine Murphy is going first because she is the member of the committee who raised this issue with us, going back to December before any of the these controversies arose.  I acknowledge her pursuit of many matters but particularly this issue.  She will be followed by Deputies Rock, Troy, Munster and Coppinger, Senator O'Mahony, Deputy O'Keeffe and Senators &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Feighan.  Non-members will be after that.  Senator Mark Daly will speak when Senator Feighan has concluded.</p></speech>

To give a bit of context, what I am trying to move towards in my line of questioning is the claim in Mr. Delaney's statement that the cashflow issues came to light on 25 April.  It seems that if requests were deferred or delayed before that date, there may have been pre-existing cashflow issues.  Would that not be the case?</p></speech>

It is perfectly rational.  Given that, at the time, the FAI may not have been able to honour all cheques issued, is Mr. Conway of the view that the FAI was close to being insolvent under company law?</p></speech>

I draw the Deputy's attention to our annual accounts.  We have had nine consecutive years of profit.  As I have said, cashflow can be a challenge to manage because of the timing of revenue or income streams.  That makes it difficult but it does not lead to a situation in which one would conclude that the business is insolvent or is not a going concern.</p></speech>

We felt that the structure which existed before the recent appointments was not serving the association to best effect.  We had a number of what we might term international projects in play.  I will not repeat what they are because they were mentioned earlier.  These international projects were in play and we still have considerable demands in running the domestic game.  We looked at what happens in other countries.  Many other UEFA member associations have a chief executive officer and a general secretary, or a paid president or vice president, in addition to the chief executive officer.</p></speech>

It is widely acknowledged that Mr. Delaney has been very accessible on all matters, whether local or national, and that he has frequently engaged with public representatives.  The purpose of today, however, is to deal adequately with outstanding governance issues.  I am aware that our guests are here on a voluntary basis but this is about corporate governance matters.  It is about restoring public confidence in the FAI and seeking answers for patrons of an organisation that each of our guests claims to love.</p> <p>  I accept that the running of a huge organisation with an annual turnover in excess of &euro;50 million is complex from a domestic and international perspective.  Would the board members or Mr. Delaney, in his former role as chief executive officer, accept the same governance issues and challenges that obtained in the FAI in 2017 from a League of Ireland club?</p></speech>

Mr. Conway, responding to Deputy Catherine Murphy, said that the fact of the matter was that the loan was managed the way it was managed.  The question is why it was managed in that way.  We are still none the wiser as to that.  The FAI representatives also said that the awareness of the loan was confined to a certain number of people.  Are the FAI representatives saying that the three people, or perhaps more, that information was confined to deliberately chose not to inform the rest of the board?  It returns to the board as a corporate body having overall responsibility.  The FAI also declared that it is committed to learn from what has happened.  No sooner did I hear that but I thought back to the Genesis report in 2002.  That report came out of areas of concern, shall we say, that had arisen.  It contained serious recommendations in relation to the code of governance that were never implemented so how can the FAI expect people to have confidence that it will learn from what has happened if it has not corrected all of its errors from the past?</p> <p>  The internal report was mentioned.  When I first read that the FAI was bringing Grant Thornton in to assist but also to investigate the &euro;100,000 loan I wondered why would a board bring in somebody else to investigate something the people in the room here know the answers to?</p><p>The same response was given today that Grant Thornton is investigating.  We also have the statement from John Delaney but the people here know the answers.  It appears that the two fingers are being given to Sport Ireland, this committee, the grassroots of the FAI and sports clubs.  Does Mr. Conway agree?  </p></speech>

Why has an outside company been engaged to investigate something the people in this room know the answers to?  Why does Mr. Conway thank that is not giving the two fingers to everybody?  I am asking that question because it appears the board of the FAI has not been accustomed to public scrutiny of this nature for a long time.</p></speech>

Given all the information has come to light, including Sport Ireland not being informed of the financial difficulties in accordance with the conditions for grant approval; the &euro;100,000 loan was not in the account; the board members who are expected to hold the CEO to account were also not informed, as Mr. Conway stated, does he think it was appropriate to create a new position for the former CEO?  Does he, as president of the FAI, think that is good governance?  Does it send out a good message?  Was it a good decision by the board?  Some people might say it appears that the FAI, as it currently stands, is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

The new role that the FAI created has not been rescinded.  Was that role advertised?  If it was not advertised, is that good governance?  Does Mr. Conway accept that people have the perception that this appears to be the same old, same old from the board of the FAI?  Does he further accept that even by virtue of events today, the opening statements, etc., the FAI is being reflected in a very bad light throughout the State?</p></speech>

The president is quite right that a number of months ago we would have discussed the time constraints and the amount of time I have had to spend doing effectively three roles.  As Deputy Troy stated, every weekend I would go to grassroots functions, visiting over 2,000 clubs in a period.  Second, I was trying to manage a business which has a turnover of almost &euro;50 million and 205 full-time staff.  Third, I was on the board of UEFA and managing specific projects that were outlined by both the president and me.  My role now is as a member of the board of UEFA but also to manage the specific projects we have outlined.  I will be able to use my strengths in those specific roles to, hopefully, bring big tournaments to Ireland, bring more funding back to the FAI for grassroots as well as for the running of the game as well.</p></speech>

We look at the profit and loss at every board meeting.  We look at the outturn to budget and if there is any variance.  In 2017, there would be points in the year when there could be some strain on cashflow.  There would be other points of the year when there would be significant cash balances.  Of course, there is a budget and of course there is scrutiny of how our finances progress during the year.</p></speech>

That means the squad has gone through the initial phase, the elite phase and has now reached the finals.  That success will bring demands for hundreds of thousands of euro to facilitate their playing in the finals.  It is brilliant and a fantastic achievement from a football point of view.  Something may happen in the course of the year which will put extra demands on the association's finances.  We clearly know our revenue streams but a payment from UEFA or FIFA that is due in February may come in June.  This kind of issue can arise.</p></speech>

We will not go back to what happened in Spain in 2017 when there was a threat of Government involvement in the election of the president of the governing body of the football association.

Before the financial officer or whoever turned to the then CEO, and I know there was a short deliberation, was there not enough time to approach the local bank manager and say, "Listen, extend the overdraft from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;1.6 million?"</p><p>In fairness, the CEO was safeguarding the reputation of the bank and the worst thing one can ever do is have a cheque bounce in one's face.  A cheque lodged in a bank takes three days to clear.  What would have happened if the people who were looking for the money had approached the bank in advance?  What was the advantage of the loan, unless the CEO went with &euro;100,000 in cash in a bag to the bank?  The optics are not good.  While it might not be illegal, it does not look good.  That is why the representatives want clearance from the Grant Thornton report.</p><p> Sport Ireland told the committee that it would make no call until we had deliberated as well.  Has Sport Ireland asked the FAI whether it could fast-track its audit of the accounts?  Every three years, Sport Ireland conducts an audit of the various organisations it governs, and this year it is the turn of the FAI.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed that documents which were not available to the committee in advance were submitted during the meeting.  It is regrettable and we should have had them in advance.  I was one of the members who spoke about that in private session.  Mr. Conway stated earlier that the bottom line is everyone wants a much better and stronger FAI for everybody, that is, for anybody wearing the green jersey or any jersey, be it a club jersey or whatever, in any form of sport.  The FAI is an important and strong organisation.</p> <p>  On corporate governance, would Mr. Conway, as chairman, handle any areas differently in hindsight?  Are there any areas where the FAI should not have acted, or where it did not act but should have done so?  What lessons will he take from what happened?</p></speech>

In response to another member, I indicated that a root-and-branch examination of the organisation is overdue.  I do not say that because I see failures or an unsuccessful organisation, but any organisation should engage at regular intervals, with external help, in some examination of how well it is equipped to implement its strategy, mission and what it is about.  Given the difficulties we have now, let us make of them.  That may sound a little strange but, for example, the Senator referred to corporate governance.  We have a corporate governance group but my colleagues on the board and I believe we need to move that on to something much stronger, with external persons on board.  We had this conversation with Sport Ireland and, indeed, asked them whether they want a role in nominating people for to that group.  My colleague, Ms Walshe, is a member of the group, as are two external people who have previously been involved with the FAI, namely, Miriam Malone, CEO of Paralympics Ireland and Tom Jordan, who worked with some of our senior executives-----</p></speech>

On foot of the Genesis report, we radically changed the board and put key committees in place below it.  The issue has been raised and we have committed to revisiting whether all those committees are fit for purpose and whether we should consider overhauling that aspect of our governance, for example.  In a practical sense, the matter has been under discussion for months, it has been raised with our council, and we are committed to examining it.  That is number one.</p></speech>

A turnover of &euro;50 million is significant.  There is nothing illegal about an employee giving a loan to a company.  It is quite unusual but it can happen.  It is incredibly unusual that the board was not formally aware of it.  It is also incredibly unusual that it was not reported as a note to the accounts.  FRS 102 and the companies legislation require disclosures of related party transactions, which is significant particularly in the light of the clear audit opinion the association received, as I understand.  Questions, therefore, need to be answered.</p> <p>  While I accept the evidence given by Mr. Delaney at face value and I do not seek anything personal or detailed outside of that; I am instead considering the matter overall.  Mr. Conway mentioned that monthly cash flows, projections, variance analyses and so on are reported to the board by the financial controller.  I find it difficult to understand the figure of &euro;100,000 given that the FAI had a turnover of &euro;50 million and &euro;22.3 million in net total assets, with a profit of &euro;2.7 million in the year in question.  Could the FAI not have held off &euro;100,000 worth of creditors for a little while?  As Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, could it not have reverted to the bank to ask for another &euro;100,000 as a short-term facility?  There is a significant disjoint in that regard.  While I will not challenge the former CEO, I will challenge the board on its engagement and corporate governance.  Mr. Conway might comment on that and, in particular, on the fact that the board was not formally aware of the loan for two years.</p></speech>

It was initiated to review operational matters in the preparation and support of the Irish team at the 2002 World Cup; consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of these procedures and arrangements against other similar international operators; examine how the senior team fits into the FAI structures; and recommend a strategy for the FAI to devise suitable policies to achieve greater and consistent success during the next European and World Cup campaigns.</p> <p>  That report made a number of recommendations, many of which were implemented.  At the very end of the report - and just outside of the recommendations - it suggests support for its implementation and states:</p> <p>This should include the appointment of a vice president or chairman from within the sport for a period of four years to work with the president and other directors (including non-executive directors from outside the FAI) ... the executive to design and manage the process of change ... External assistance is also likely to be required in the following areas: facilitation of key discussions, planning and integration, developing the top team and input of specific skills.</p> <p>  I was not at the FAI in 2002 but I understand that there was a major rehaul of processes and the board.  The board went from a 23-man board down to a ten-man board.  It went up to an 11-member board when we brought in the women's football committee chairman but it has now gone back down to ten members.  There was major consultation with all of our stakeholders, which was well documented in the newspapers.  The FAI went around the country to consult stakeholders.  The consultation resulted in the standing committees, as Mr. Conway alluded to, which are currently in place.  Unfortunately, there were no non-executive directors at the time.  That is not unusual in sport.  Sports governance is different from corporate governance.  I understand that not all sporting bodies within Ireland or outside of Ireland have non-executive directors on their boards currently.  However, I believe that during my time on the governance committee in the FAI we have made great changes.  We still have time to implement the governance code but one of the recommendations or considerations is that we would bring an independent member onto the board of directors.</p></speech>

I say this is a difficulty on behalf of the Government.  Surely there should be an independent member on the board in the interest of the outcome of the Genesis report and in the interests of fairness.  Is the FAI be open to putting an independent member onto the board who may come from some Government Department, given that so much money is going into the FAI?</p></speech>

The recommendations from that could almost invariably take us to having independent directors, and we will engage with Sport Ireland on that.</p></speech>

Mr. Delaney is the executive vice president of the FAI with responsibility for FIFA and UEFA matters.  FIFA certainly has not been the most open group.  Sepp Blatter was the general secretary since 1981 and president since 1998.  He has been suspended since 2015 for corruption and financial mismanagement and he has been ejected from office for eight years.  How different has the FAI been from FIFA in the past few years?  I would put this question to a lot of the football associations around, not just to the FAI.</p></speech>

The current FIFA president is Gianni Infantino.  FIFA has changed remarkably in his period there.  This is well accepted.  I work closely with the UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, and he has brought UEFA forward incredibly well over the past number of years.  They are two parent bodies of the FAI.  UEFA is a significant funder of the FAI and FIFA's revenues are increasing with the association.  I could not speak higher of how UEFA is run under the stewardship of its current president.  There is no doubt that FIFA has come a remarkable distance.  The recent vote for the World Cup was transparent and open.  When the "United" bid won, it was put up on the screens.  I could not but commend both organisations on how they are run.  There are key funding negotiations to come into the future with regard to our centralised television deals.  I also hope that UEFA will run a television channel on social media for domestic leagues where the League of Ireland could well get a global audience.  This is very important to the association and to me coming from a League of Ireland background.  We work very closely with both bodies the Senator has mentioned.  They are significant funders but they are also a significant resource support to the FAI.  They are two very well run organisations.</p></speech>

I will not go into them in great detail but I would like to get clarity on some of them.  On the issue of John Delaney's appointment to his new role, I do not know Mr. Delaney very well but I know that as an ambassador for Ireland and Irish sports he has done an amazing job and I am sure he will do an amazing job in this regard.  He has worked on anti-racism and integration.  I have been involved in the Oireachtas soccer teams that have taken part in games in this regard.  It is important to highlight issues such as these and sport is a great way of doing so.  Mr. Delaney has taken on board certain initiatives and has been very successful in doing so.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, asked a technical but important question.  Am I correct that the &euro;100,000 cheque was made out to a particular person?  Is that correct?  Was there a concern about a number of cheques?  What is the overall figure of all the cheques?  We have all been in a situation where we have written cheques whereby if they were all lodged in the same week, we would not have had enough money to meet them.  Was it one particular cheque that the FAI thought would be the one to tip it over with regard to what was in its account?  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point.  If I were in that position, I would not write a cheque but do a cash transfer because by the time my cheque arrived in the account, it might not be cleared.  Then the cheque on the other side would be processed and also might not be cleared.  I am concerned about the logistics.  The first thing I would do if the &euro;100,000 would tip me over the edge would be to ask the recipient to hold off until the following Monday as I would be okay by then.  Deputy O'Keeffe made a very interesting point on this.  He stated one would not write cheques but would make cash transfers from one bank account to another so it would be immediate.  One would then not be worried about whether a cheque was lodged.  More importantly, in the normal course of events - perhaps this is why it would be helpful to have the report in full - one would just ring up the guys and ask them not to cash the cheque this week and tell them it would be okay for the following week.  I am sure that would not have caused anyone any undue stress.  This is a very technical point.  Other than that, all of my other questions have already been asked.</p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Walsh, the interim chief executive officer, whom I wish the best success.  I suggest that a percentage of the new board be from both genders, whatever that may be.  One of the criticisms I have of the FAI is its treatment of women.  The women's national team and underage structure should receive equal treatment.  That is my point.  They should get the same amount of resources.  Clearly, they do not, the reason being they do not bring in revenue, and we understand that.  However, look at what Croke Park manages to do with regard to ladies' football on the one day of the year it is the biggest sporting event for women.  Equal treatment is required.  In fairness, the GAA has come a long way but it has not come all the way.  We cannot have the national ladies' football team handing over tracksuits in an airport.  I hope that the issue of gender equality on the board will be part of governance, and bear in mind women make up 50% of the population.  They would give a different viewpoint.  Perhaps in some instances, when everybody else is going off and doing something, having more women on the main board and all of the governance committees and making this a policy-----</p></speech>

Deputy Lisa Chambers is doing an excellent job on Brexit.  I am sure if she were in Westminster, she would have sorted it out a long time ago, as would all of the women.</p> <p>  As part of the governance review, the FAI should make sure the women's soccer team and all of the women who will, I hope, account for half of participants in soccer in future are represented.  By the way, the reason this issue will not be raised by Grant Thornton and all of the others is that it is men who will write the reports and they have a bias.  They keep forgetting they should be doing this.  Perhaps out of this the FAI should make a commitment to ensure equal treatment for the ladies' football team and give a commitment to have a substantial percentage of women within its governance structure.  I would say the figure should be 50% because women make up half of the population and half of the funding the FAI receives from the Government is supplied by women because they pay tax too.  They are entitled to have representation across the board of every sporting organisation but as the FAI is here today, I make the request of it.  I wish the interim CEO the best of luck and I hope she will become the permanent CEO at some stage.</p></speech>

I have read out various figures today.  Equality is the issue and it is not the issue in this sense.  In my address, I spoke about the SPAR primary school fives.  Of all of our programmes, it has the highest female participation, as 42% or 43% of the 37,000 participants are female.  Senator Daly rightly stressed the importance of equality.  Our challenge, which is the challenge of every sport, is that at the ages of 13, 14, 17 and 18, in excess of 40% of participants will still be female.  It is fantastic to see it in the primary school fives, which involves fourth, fifth and sixth classes in primary schools throughout the country getting their day out in the Aviva Stadium.  It is a brilliant day when they come up.  It is not graded.  Schools play based on enrolment figures so it is not the case that a big school will get there ahead of a small school.  The competitions are based on enrolment.  I have mentioned the 43% female participation and the challenge for us is to try to keep this percentage the whole way up, including at board level and having female coaches, referees and administrators.</p></speech>

If it was me, I would say it was always a short-term loan.  In his statement of 5 May, he said concerns were expressed that some press releases did not accurately reflect the board's level of awareness of the existence of the &euro;100,000.  People on the board did not know about it and this is the ethical issue at the core of the problem.  Notwithstanding the finances we have here, I ask whether I would want my children to get involved tomorrow.  People want real change and I cannot overemphasise that.</p> <p>  Would it help to build confidence if the FAI commissioned an independent forensic audit of the organisation?  Would Mr. Conway commit to such a thing? </p></speech>

Why did the FAI not go to Sport Ireland to look for the money?  The FAI could have said there was a short-term problem and that it needed &euro;100,000 that week.

Mr. Delaney can correct me if I am wrong about this but it appears that, 17 years later, it has not happened.  What are the witnesses' comments on that?  Am I correctly reporting what Mr. Delaney said?  No independent people were put on any of the three committees to which I have referred so the record of governance has not been anywhere near where it should have been.</p> <p>  The financial director at the time was mentioned.

On average, they stay for four or five years.  We have had senior executives.  I referred to Miriam Malone a minute ago who moved on to Paralympics Ireland and we had another number of senior executives, who I can name if the Senator wants, who have moved on.  Sarah O'Shea is with Olympic Federation of Ireland and has a sports consultancy company.  Peter Sherrard is the CEO of the Olympic Federation of Ireland.  Richard Fahey is the CEO of Tennis Ireland.  Stephen Driver is head of advocacy at Ibec.  There are more.  These are people who have worked with us and moved on.  We worked out the average turnover the other day.  We have a staff of approximately 200 and we have an average turnover of just under 10%, which I understand is around the norm.</p></speech>

I go back to the Genesis report because he is quoting me.  The Genesis report arose out of Saipan and the lack of professionalism around team travel arrangements, etc.  If one takes time to read the Genesis report and go through the detail of it, one will see that the professionalisation of the association around team travel and everything associated with it has come on in leaps and bounds.

That is a direct quote from him.  As to the board construction, I remind the Senator that we had 23 people on the board at the time.  To reduce that down to ten required a great deal of travelling around to the grassroots.  I think Mr. Conway accompanied me.  Ultimately, it is a members' association and to reduce the board from 23 to ten, practically overnight as we did, was a well-achieved target.  I am not sure of the date, but perhaps Ms Walshe can check it for a future time.  However, I brought Genesis in subsequently and it gave the association a very strong bill of health as to how it had transformed itself.</p></speech>

The one thing which is of great concern to all of us is the temporary withdrawal of funding to the association pending the three reports from the FAI, Grant Thornton and Mazars.  All I would say about that matters is that any person who has ever been involved in any type of business, regardless of whether it is trading with &euro;50 million or &euro;50,000 a year, has dealt with different problems at various times.  If we looked back on the way that we dealt with those problems maybe we would not have dealt with them in the smartest of ways.  Hindsight is of great benefit to all of us.  I have no doubt that if Mr. Delaney had his time back, perhaps this whole issue would have been dealt with a different way.  However, I am quite confident that the only thing Mr. Delaney could be accused of is being passionately committed to his job and to the survival of what I would call the business and that all he was trying to do was good.  Of course, there has to be proper governance, there have to be proper accountancy practices but I really cannot for the life of me see how the three reports will not be positive in their findings, thereby allowing for the funding to be restored.  The president was questioned about Mr. Delaney's suitability to be the executive vice president of the association.  Mr. Delaney's work ethic over the years will show that he is eminently qualified and most definitely the best-qualified person for this new role that has been created for continuity and for dealing with FIFA and UEFA.</p> <p>  It would be very remiss of me not to mention what I know first hand, particularly as we are hearing a lot of other stuff today.   I want to remember what Mr. Delaney has done for the association throughout the country.  In every club from the grassroots up, locally and nationally - and on the international scene - Mr. Delaney's personal reputation is, in my humble opinion, second to none.  People can look-----</p></speech>

At the end of the month, Mr. Delaney is to come to Castleilsand AFC to open the new George O'Callaghan Park.  People in the area have been waiting for the facility for 45 years.  What I am reliably told is that if it was not for John Delaney and the FAI, the park would not be opening at the end of this month.  Mr. Delaney will be most welcome to Kerry.  He will get what I would call the mother of all welcomes when he comes to Kerry because his reputation and his respectability will precede him.  We will be there to welcome him.</p> <p>  When it comes to accountancy practices, many of us who are in business have to do certain things at certain times.

The loan, therefore, was a small sum relative to the annual or even monthly turnover, given that there is a turnover of approximately &euro;4.5 million per month.  The figure of &euro;100,000 would not stick out from that, as long as the figures were balanced against the budgeted figures.  That is what we factor into our consideration.</p></speech>

It is a significant rule.  It is stated on page 11 of the report that the council may fill any casual vacancy, as well as the offices of president, vice-president, honorary secretary, honorary treasurer and auditors, in accordance with the rules.  It states the council elects the vice-president but does not state it elects the executive vice-president.  It indicates there will be a splitting of the CEO's responsibilities but does not define what they will be.  While there is an outline, it is not defined.  If this organisation is a members' association, as we were told, its members seem to be largely excluded.</p></speech>

To return to my earlier question, in 2015, the association had an overdraft facility of at least &euro;1.9 million.  Although we are not sure of the limit, we know from the accounts that there was a facility of &euro;1.9 million.  Bank of Ireland is listed as the banking partner in those accounts.  In the subsequent years, namely, 2016 to 2018, inclusive, the College Green branch of Bank of Ireland remains listed as the banking partner.  How does Mr. O'Connell account for that?</p></speech>

This is their opportunity to start that process.  Even if they have no time for members gathered today, they can speak to their patrons who are watching in, with huge interest in what is going on here.  However, since this morning, they have been evasive, vague, non-committal and ambiguous in their replies.  They have chosen to answer what they wish to answer.  For example, there was a question on the severance package which Mr. Conway chose to answer because it suited him to do so.  When I asked about a pension, however, he slapped the question down and stated that he was not in a position to answer because of the contractual arrangement involved.  He was hiding behind the Grant Thornton and the Mazars reports.  Can he be honest and upfront with the general public, who have a right to know about corporate governance in the FAI?</p></speech>

I did not come here with the attitude that I do not care what members of this committee think, and nor did my colleagues.  What we can and cannot answer will be guided by the advice we have been given.  We all know there are areas into which we cannot stray.  If there is a question about contracts, employees, something that is commercially sensitive or an individual creditor, I have no option of answering the question, even if the Deputy calls this being evasive.</p></speech>

Up until last week, five of the 11 board members were also members of the board at that time.  The board should be acutely aware of its responsibilities as board members.  Seven of the current board members have 103 years' service in total.  The perception outside here is that the board is a cartel and that it is closing ranks and is not being honest and open with the public.  On page 14 of his statement, Mr. Conway indicates that the new CEO would not be part of the board, in line with best practice.  If it is best practice for the new CEO not to be a board member, why was it not best practice for the old CEO?</p><p>The Genesis report was published in 2002.  We adopted many of its recommendations and set about speaking to the members of the wider football family in respect of their implementation.  We changed the board from 23 members to ten and we changed our standing committees.  At that stage, we felt that the former CEO had been a key part in moving the Genesis report.  As the former CEO outlined, I was part of the team that went around on a consultation exercise to ensure the implementation of the Genesis report.  At that time, we felt that it served us best to have the CEO as a member of the board.</p></speech>

If the board reports to the CEO, how can it hold the CEO to account, given that the CEO is at the same level as the other members of the board?</p></speech>

As the Deputy rightly said, the CEO reports to the board.  That is how it was.</p> <p>  That view of corporate governance is different now and we are heeding that.

We were told: "The FAI has a governance group, chaired by a woman and an outside person to look constantly at governance within the organisation."  Does Mr. Conway think that governance was constantly under review, and that best corporate governance has always been practised during both his time as a board member and, more specifically, as chairman of the board?</p></speech>

In respect of corporate governance, we are talking about a sporting organisation that is a members' organisation, as members rightly noted.  Following the Genesis report, we evolved with board members coming through the grassroots.  We have very much a representative model.  Different parts of the game felt they needed representation on each of our key committees.  That was how it evolved.</p> <p>  On how I came to the board, every two years, I had to go for election to the key particular committee of which I was chair.  I had first to be nominated to that committee by my affiliate and thereafter the 12 members of the committee had to agree on me as chairperson, which is what brought me to the board.  That was the model of governance in place.  When we undertake our review, we will examine whether that is appropriate for the FAI going forward.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the governance code is of relatively recent origin.  I do not say corporate governance was invented only two years ago but the new governance code is of relatively recent origin.  We will be fully observant of that code.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Sport Ireland have reacted positively to the changes we made at an extraordinary general meeting in 2018.</p></speech>

The FAI, however, is a professional body.  It employs professional people and has a turnover of &euro;50 million per annum.  It is not a local voluntary organisation.  As a consequence, it has responsibility under company law to carry out corporate governance.  Does Mr. Conway not accept that?</p></speech>

We will comply with that and we have begun taking steps to do so.  By the time we are due to be fully compliant with it, we will be.

Another sporting organisation, the then Olympic Council of Ireland, has previously appeared before this committee.  At that time, Sport Ireland suspended its funding and did not restore it until there was a change of personnel and the configuration of the board.  If that is a requirement, will Mr. Conway and his fellow board members stand down to protect important activities, including in participation in school football and education, that is, what Sport Ireland's funding is spent on?</p></speech>

As an observation, I think the former CEO of the FAI, Mr. John Delaney, has behaved disgracefully today.  He came in with a last minute statement.  He knows the procedures for this committee.  He has furnished us with a statement but is refusing to answer any questions on that statement.  He is also refusing to answer questions that are ongoing in respect of his time as CEO.  What has been going on here has been an absolute disgrace and farcical.  The only good thing is that the public have witnessed these events first-hand as well.  I would have thought that anybody would have been glad to be handed the opportunity to put the record straight.  Mr. Delaney, however, has not taken up that opportunity.</p></speech>

There are a number of accounts into which money is lodged which are not the main bank account, which is in respect of this particular &euro;100,000 loan.  That money is paid out of the main account, so I presume money is transferred from the accounts that are paid into, for instance.  Chair, I am not trying to step outside the remit.</p></speech>

There should be no issue in respect of certain creditors having their funds met because there would be money sitting in holding accounts.  For instance, prize money would be sitting in a holding account.  If a club like Cork City, which I would be involved in, asked the FAI for its prize money or the UEFA money from its European runs, that money would be transferred automatically from the European UEFA account into the main account and then transferred on.  There are some creditors in respect whom there would not be concerns if cheques were issued or outstanding to them.  Would that be a fair assessment?</p></speech>

In his opening remarks, Mr. Delaney's stated that at the meeting on 25 April 2017 between himself, Mr. Breen and Ms Tsang, concerns were raised that cheques had been written and that if they were all cashed in before the end of the week, there would be an issue in respect of sufficient funds being in the account to meet them.  I am trying to establish that there are clearly different sets of creditors.  For some creditors, for example, League of Ireland clubs that are owed prize money or UEFA money, that money is already sitting in a different account.  There would not be an issue if, say, Cork City, Dundalk, Derry City or any of those clubs requested their prize money from the FAI.  There would not be an issue because that money is sitting in a separate account.  Is it a fair assessment that there would only be certain types of creditors to whom those cheques would be written who could create a potential cashflow issue?</p></speech>

My apologies, I do not remember whose question it was.  The question related to the related party transactions in the 2016 accounts in note 20.

Obviously, he can choose whether or not to answer them but I find this process quite frustrating because the public certainly would have believed that the person who is most prominent and associated with the FAI would be here today answering some questions about the issues under debate.  Mr. Delaney might want to consider clearing things up.  I will start by asking him whether he thinks this is the most serious situation the FAI has been in with regard to the withdrawal of funding by Sport Ireland.  I will start with that question and follow it up.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Delaney think it is the most serious situation the FAI has been in?  If so, does he acknowledge his role in bringing about that situation?  I know he said that he will not answer questions about his time as CEO but he was the most prominent person in the organisation.  Given the lack of financial viability of the FAI, which is under this committee's remit, looking back, does Mr. Delaney think that his salary, expenses and remuneration may have played any role in that?  We are talking about 2017, which is the year in which this shortfall took place and was not reported and a loan had be acquired.  That is the same year in which the women's team went on strike or threatened to go on strike.  It joined a union.  The team was changing in toilets, sharing tracksuits, etc.  I wondered whether Mr. Delaney might want to comment on that situation.  Then I have some other questions.</p></speech>

I do not think the Chairman should be answering for Mr. Delaney.  He can decide whether he wants to answer the question.  In particular, I was drawing attention to 2017 the year when this happened and, for example, the issues that arose with the national women's team.  I also wanted to ask Mr. Delaney, who does not have to answer, whether he believes his salary, expenses and remuneration have any bearing on the association's financial sustainability or lack thereof.</p></speech>

I said I was truly saddened and expressed serious concern when this matter was brought to my attention.  I also made the point that the act of putting the money in, which I did, was in the best interest of football.  I was embarrassed by it, obviously.  That is all in my statement.  That is how seriously I saw what happened two years ago.</p> <p>  On my salary, I am an employee of the FAI.  It has paid my salary during my journey.  I now hold a different position.  I am no longer CEO.  I would like to think that during my term as CEO, much additional sponsorship, turnover and revenue was generated, as Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh noted.</p></speech>

For example, regarding the development officers on the ground who deal with young people, clubs and so on, I have been sent information to the effect that people had pay cuts amounting to between &euro;2,100 and &euro;6,000.  Their mileage allowances were also reduced.  Does Mr. Delaney feel any responsibility for that?</p></speech>

There was an outstanding dispute but those cuts, in large measure, have been restored.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, there are 57 development officers.  They are crucial in the work they do in having our footprint on the ground.  In their work for the association, they are often its unheralded foot soldiers.</p></speech>

Earlier, it was stated that when the controversy first broke the board issued a statement that the bridging loan was made in the best interests of the FAI and that "The Board of the FAI has been kept fully informed in relation to this matter at all times."  Today, the FAI told the committee that the board did not even know about this loan until March.  How was that statement issued?  Who wrote it?</p></speech>

It is a little ironic that the code of conduct was produced at a time when board members were running around with knowledge of the financial situation and did not tell the rest of the board.  A conflict of interest form was also developed at the time, according to Mr. Conway's statement.  I wish to ask about conflicts of interest on the FAI board.  What sorts of conflicts of interest do board members have to declare or is the decision left to the members?  What conflicts of interest have been declared since the form was introduced?  Was the loan declared as a conflict of interest?  Has Mr. Delaney declared any other potential conflicts of interest to the board?  This relates to governance which is in the committee's remit.  For instance, it appears that board members have business dealings with each other.  That seems strange.  The former financial director has business dealings in property with Mr. Delaney, for instance.  Does Mr. Conway not see any potential conflicts of interest there?</p></speech>

We have introduced under 13s, under 15s, under 17s, under 19s, and the elite player pathway for the best young players in the country, who are all now playing for the 20 clubs or the four entities outside them such as the Mayo league, the Kerry league, the Cavan-Monaghan league or whatever.  I do not want to give the wrong impression about a player.  I never believed in the old model of exporting them and saying "To hell with the consequences".  The best young players now will move through the ranks of our League of Ireland clubs.  There is a &euro;60 million spend in the pipeline for infrastructure in League of Ireland clubs and this highlights the key role of public funding.  The single biggest part of that is the development at Dalymount Park, which will transform the quarter in which it is located.  There are others and we work with the relevant agencies to effect and promote such projects with local authorities or central Government so that we get a stream of money into the League of Ireland.</p></speech>

Now that it has suspended funding, will that have an effect on cashflow?  It is only 5% of the overall turnover but could it have an impact?  How long can the organisation survive with a suspension of funding?  It will have a major impact on grassroots development and the payment of development officers.  Is it important to get this issue resolved in weeks or could it take months before the grassroots start crying and calling for heads?</p></speech>

If we restore the confidence of Sport Ireland in the FAI, by late autumn the next tranche of money, which is some &euro;670,000, will come through as normal and that is our urgent aim.  The programmes on which the money is spent are key grassroots programmes for clubs, schools, girls' football, etc.  These are all very important for us and I do not want any of it to be harmed, nor do I envisage it being harmed.</p></speech>

I accept that I am very well paid.  Most members around this table have an interest in sport and I have met most of them at grassroots football events, including Deputy O'Keeffe in Cork where we gave out &euro;1 million in grants to 43 clubs last summer.  It is impossible to do that every weekend while also being in Europe and having some family time and time with one's kids, because it is a business of &euro;50 million and 205 staff.

He has grassroots support but somebody in Dublin is out for his neck and is gunning for him, as are people in some parts of the media.  One of the major criticisms aimed at him down the years is that he does not give enough attention to the League of Ireland, at either senior or youth level.  People are of the view that development should progress more quickly.  What would he say to that?</p></speech>

I come from a League of Ireland background and that is nothing to do with my role as CEO.  My dad was chairman of Waterford United when they won the cup in 1980, having not won it since 1937.  Every Sunday morning from when I was eight years old and living in Tipperary town, my dad would drive Al Finucane and Richie Hall, who were from Limerick but who played for Waterford, to places like Milltown, Flower Lodge and Kilcohan Park.  I understand the League of Ireland intimately and it is part of my personal DNA, through my father and my own personal involvement as secretary of Waterford United Football Club.  My love for the League of Ireland stands on my record.  Mr. Gavin can talk about the improvements we have made in the League of Ireland.</p></speech>

There was agreement between the clubs and the FAI for the FAI to run it.  I have since that time been the director of the league and director of competitions.  We can clearly see that the league is now in a better place than it was then.  The clubs are stable, up to a point, but as they are individual businesses, they decide who to sign.  Their performances on the field have been particularly good in Europe.  Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers and Cork have shown it and many clubs are doing much better now.  There are healthy attendances, and this season our attendances in the Premier Division have increased by nearly 24% this year.  There are many full-time clubs in the Premier Division.</p> <p>  As our president mentioned, we have introduced underage national leagues.  These are for players under 19, under 17, under 15 and under 13, and they have been very positive not only for the players, as there is an elite player pathway, but the communities the clubs are in.  More people are feeling an affiliation to a club at all levels.  Going to matches, there are visibly more families and children, with bigger attendances and great football being played.  The work done by clubs and people at the coalface in this area is tremendous and they really have come on leaps and bounds over the past few years.  It is really difficult to run a League of Ireland club but the majority of clubs have excelled.  We can see the proof today on a Friday night or a Saturday in Sligo.</p></speech>

Some of our youths go across the channel to academies, whether they are in Liverpool, Ipswich or Millwall.  They may not make it by the time they get to 18 and at that stage they would not have proper education.  When they return home they are more or less left in a heap.  That could have an effect on their mental health.  Should the FAI not do more for those kinds of people?  We were proud to send them across the channel but when they return, they are forgotten about.  Issues arise as in an academy education may not even be a second or third thought.  These people may end up with no career.</p></speech>

I was lucky enough as we had a family business and I went into it.  I had a career in the League of Ireland.  Now the League of Ireland is a great platform for those kids to reinvent themselves mentally, physically and as players.  Many of our clubs are now linked to third level education and other education pathways so if those kids do not make it in football, they have an opportunity to become much more rounded individuals and make a life outside football.  There are only so many kids who can make it.  The clubs are very focused on education; education and sport is a great mix and clubs are now embracing that.</p></speech>

I can only talk about the past and the delegation's time here.  It is quite frustrating for me and others, I am sure, as so many people are here who had different roles until recently.  We are barred from asking pretty relevant and important questions in that regard.  I made a note when Mr. Conway spoke about restoring confidence and we are collectively responsible in that regard.  A first class FAI board and organisation is so important for our country.</p> <p>  I have another question which requires a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Was there a time when any board member was concerned about the going concern of the business?  I do not know if the witnesses understand what I mean by "going concern".  Going concern is a legal requirement and if there are any issues about going concern, a certain process must take place and it could end up in the winding up of the business.  From the deliberations of the witnesses and others, it seems this &euro;100,000 was vital to keeping the organisation afloat.  If it is down to &euro;100,000, going concern would be a big issue for me.  There is no reference in the 2017 relating to going concern.  An auditor would have to qualify the accounts if there was a concern about going concern.  If the organisation is down to &euro;100,000 with &euro;50 million of a turnover, I would be worried.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell has not had sight of or brought information on how much money was in the remaining 12 accounts in that week.</p></speech>

Deputy Rock raised a very specific point about it being signed off by the board and then sent, but there was a delay and there it seems to have been edited.  Mr. Conway made the point that there was a technical edit.  Many documents presented to the committee have undergone significant editing between the draft and final versions.  I ask the association to send the committee the draft and final versions of the governance review.  I have not finished my questioning; I am asking whether the committee will be provided with those documents.</p></speech>

By way of example, the committee previously held meetings in regard to the coastguard.  Under freedom of information, we requested the original draft of a report and compared it with the one presented to a Minister.  Everything that was harmful to the people before the committee had been removed from the latter version.  We are talking about establishing credibility and confidence.  I am concerned by this matter raised by another member.  Is the association prepared to provide the committee with the original draft report by Jonathan Hall Associates?</p> <p>  Did the other 12 available accounts cumulatively contain &euro;100,000?  The FAI seems to have been anticipating a bill of &euro;100,000.  The bill was expected.  For how long did the association know the &euro;100,000 was hanging over it and that it did not have the money to meet the debt?  What was the bill for?  I know the witnesses will not tell us to whom it was payable.  Did it relate to infrastructure?  Was it money due to a club?  Was it to pay staff wages or expenses?  A bill of &euro;100,000 is not an everyday occurrence.  The association knew for a long time that it was coming, but it did not seem to have &euro;100,000 in the other 12 accounts, seek an overdraft or ring anybody to ask that the bill payment be delayed.  It seems to have been an outstanding bill.  For how long was it outstanding?  For how long did the association know it was coming?  How long did it have to pay the bill?</p> <p>  The statement made earlier outlined that Grant Thornton had sight of this.  I am not an accountant, but the phraseology used would not be used by accountants.  It stated that all cheques issued in the week 28 April 2017 were cashed and presented at the time.  It is not just cheques - much of the money dispersed by the FAI would be sent via bank transfer and so on.  I do not understand how Grant Thornton would have signed off on that.  If this matter was coming to the committee this morning and it had sight of it, it would have pointed out that it is not the phraseology it would have used because in the modern world such firms do not say, "We draw down cheques" or "cheques presented".  My concern is that the FAI had a significant amount of money in other accounts but it does not appear to have added up to &euro;100,000 or was earmarked for other commitments.  For how long was the &euro;100,000 owed?  How long did the FAI have to pay it?  For what was the bill?  Was it related to infrastructure or a bill from a contractor or club or money due to a competition?  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien alluded to that issue.  For what was the money owed?</p></speech>

For how long was it legally obliged to pay it?  The cheque was made available by the former CEO and lodged, ready to be used if it came down.  Did it have to be paid by that Friday or the following week or was there a month to pay it?  What were the terms of credit for the  &euro;100,000 that was owing?

We have asked many technical questions.  Some answers have been given and some cannot be given.  We are unhappy in certain ways.</p> <p>  I will come at this matter from a different angle.  Last week, Mr. John Treacy was asked to answer "Yes" or "No" on the question of whether he had confidence in the FAI board.  He said he would not say "Yes".  It was not a good day last week.  He also said that, over the past decade, the FAI has been audited by Sport Ireland's independent auditors on more occasions than any sporting organisation.  Independent audits of the FAI were completed on Sport Ireland's behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, with all the findings reported to Sport Ireland's audit and risk committee.  I know the FAI is a very large organisation that gets huge money but why has the FAI been audited on more occasions than any other sporting organisations?  Is there a reason for it?</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned that we had audits in 2010, 2014, 2016 and we are due an audit this year.  I really do not know how much that is out of step with other sporting bodies.  We have made it clear today that we seek the first tranche of money early each year.  Programmes are in place.  It is difficult for me to answer the question of why Sport Ireland would do that.  We may have supplied the audits and the outcome of those audits do not trigger any significant concern on the part of Sport Ireland.  We may not be very out of step with other sporting bodies but I do not know.</p></speech>

If the issue with the &euro;100,000 happened again tomorrow, would it be addressed differently or how would the FAI go about that instead of getting an individual loan that has caused much of this confusion?</p></speech>

Through the work we are doing now with the likes of Grant Thornton, for example, we will ensure that our processes are sufficiently robust so we will not arrive at such circumstances again.</p></speech>

I went to my first Republic of Ireland game over 40 years ago.  I ran a double-decker bus to Germany in 1988.  I am a member of the soccer fraternity.  I have served as secretary of my local soccer club and I was treasurer of the Roscommon district league 30 years ago.  I welcomed the recommendations of the Genesis report because, at the time, the FAI was not fit for purpose.  The association has made huge inroads in the past number of years, notwithstanding the selling of Glenmalure Park in the 1980s.  I will not get into that now but it caused major damage to the FAI among the general public.  That is another day's work.  We can consider the &euro;100,000 loan and the hasty restructuring of the top level of management in the FAI.  At least it looks hasty.  We can also consider the financial health of the organisation while FAI staff take pay cuts.  Sport Ireland has suspended funding, which is bad news.</p> <p>  When the Republic of Ireland team is going well, everybody asks why we do not have an all-island soccer team and people say it would be great.  If I were involved with the Irish Football Association, IFA, which oversees the Northern Ireland soccer team, I would be asking if it would really want to join forces with the FAI, particularly in view of all the bad news that is coming out.  I am smiling to myself because what happened in 2016 was wonderful.  Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland supporters were together on the streets in Paris and around France.  We have come a long way in the past 20 years.  It may be tongue-in-cheek but we have all-island hockey and rugby teams.  In 1924, there was an all-island soccer team that was headquartered in Belfast.  Maybe after today we should look for the establishment of an all-island soccer team.  Perhaps the FAI should move in with the IFA instead of the other way around.  The all-island soccer team could play in Belfast.  This matter has been very damaging to the idea of having an all-island soccer team.  I hope we can come out of this in a much better way.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work done by Mr. Delaney, his family and everybody here.  I was a teacher like Mr. Conway.  All my life, I knew fantastic kids who worked hard in school and played hard to get on teams.  Dave Colgan, a former teacher and lovely man, devoted his life to the sport.  Every day of his life, he worked for sport, for soccer.</p></speech>

I have their names listed here.  I will say their names because it is important to me.  Nicky Colgan, Gary Kelly and Ian Harte were all reared by Dave and people like him.  Right around the country, all those young people who succeed locally, regionally and nationally are driven by people like Dave.  The point I am making relates to the point I made earlier, that is, that the corporate governance in Mr. Conway's organisation is totally inadequate, and that is why it is not getting the funding.  The regime change I am talking about is what people need.  They need it, and need it now.  If they do not get it, the association will be in a serious crisis.  I am concerned because the sponsors and public are looking at this.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  To ensure certainty, the best thing the board members could do is move on.  If they did so and new people came in, the association could turn around.  Consider how the Olympic Council of Ireland changed.  I am aware that individuals will make sacrifices if they make a decision to move on but it is needed.  That is the impression I am getting from everybody.  We have to talk to the rest of the people.  I appreciate there is not much time left.  The picture in my mind is of all the young people going out to play this evening and on Saturday.  Their parents accompany them, drive them, buy them football boots and go through the tough life of a parent looking after young children.  That is the message I have to give the delegates from the people who talk to me.  I appreciate their listening to me.</p> <p>  There are 15 minutes left.  I want to make another couple of points.  I acknowledge there are others who wish to contribute but I am doing my very best.  We have been here for nine hours and the delegates have been here for eight.  I understand that and I  want to be fair to everybody.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien had a question that was not answered.  It is not that it was not answered purposely.  It was on whether the &euro;100,000 was mentioned in the monthly financial accounts.  Do we have the answer to that?</p></speech>

Concern was expressed over the suspension of Sport Ireland funding.  As the Chairman will be aware, the sports capital grants are currently being processed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am getting calls from some small soccer clubs around Cork asking whether their applications could be jeopardised.</p> <p>  Mr. Delaney was in Cork in December 2016.  A memorandum of understanding was agreed between the FAI and Cork County Council for the development of a centre of excellence, an FAI academy for youth in the greater Munster area, on lands outside Glanmire in Cork city.  The closing date for the large-scale sports infrastructure fund is 17 April.  I am concerned that the dispute between the FAI and Sport Ireland could have an impact on the application.  Is the application ready to go?  The matter is creating plenty of publicity down my way.</p></speech>

Mr. Conway acknowledged he was aware of what we are talking about.  I was not aware that we had the director of communications here with us today.  If Mr. Conway is not able to answer as to who signed off on the statement, maybe the director of communications is.</p></speech>

The first is directed at Mr. Murray, as honorary treasurer.  It has been said that Mr. Delaney kindly donated his UEFA salary back to the FAI in 2017.  As someone who would have been aware of the funding coming into the accounts, can Mr. Murray state whether the year in question was the only one in which the salary was donated?  Has it been donated since?</p></speech>

It seems very unusual for an accounting practice.</p> <p>  The financial controller is going to send us the terms of credit for the &euro;100,000, including the date by which it was to be paid back.  Given that the witnesses were raising this as part of what we were talking about today and given the very specific references to dates, I am surprised they do not know when they were supposed to have the &euro;100,000 paid back.  They are not willing to tell us what category it fell under, broad and all as it is.  I cannot see an answer as breaching data protection guidelines in any shape or form.  For how long did the witnesses know the &euro;100,000 was coming over the horizon and going to affect cash flow?  As outlined, there are 24 accounts, 11 of which are for specific funding projects and structures.  There are 13 others.  Of these, everything is paid out of one.  The witnesses cannot tell the committee how much money was in the other 12 in the specific month or week in question.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland also had information hidden from it by the FAI.  On being asked, it was told all was well in 2017.</p> <p>  The board has moved Mr. Delaney aside.  Owing to his connection to UEFA, it is willing to keep him and has created a role solely for one person.  Nobody else need apply.  It is a position that is still quite well paid.  As I stated, the pay is similar to the prize-money for the entire Irish league.</p></speech>

Mr. Delaney said in his statement that he issued a personal check.  If so, I presume it was in his name.  We know it did not go into the main bank account because he said it could not.  It went into a different bank account.  Maybe Mr. Delaney can tell us what bank account it went into.  It went into one bank account and the money was transferred to the main bank account and then it was paid to the creditor.  There is obviously a cheque stub somewhere in the name of Mr. Delaney.</p></speech>

I presume that, as part of the auditing process, the cheque stub was handed over to the auditors, who would have been aware that there was a loan from Mr. Delaney.  I presume the money paid back to Mr. Delaney in June came from the main bank account, so there would be a corresponding cheque stub for the payment to Mr. Delaney.  Did the cheque stubs form part of the audits in 2017?  Would that information have been given to the auditors?  Everything is handed over, including receipts.</p></speech>

Among the many things that have been said today, the question of how we go about looking at the issue of governance is one that we take very seriously.</p></speech>
