    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#A00200"><p>Before we begin, members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely, or switched to aeroplane safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members to just put their phones on silent mode as it may interfere with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The agenda is challenges facing the forestry sector.  This is probably our last meeting in this series of meetings on the forestry sector.  Our first witnesses are from Coillte, and I welcome Ms Imelda Hurley, chief executive officer, and Mr. Mark Carlin, managing director.  I thank them for taking the time to prepare for today's meeting, including taking test calls from the secretariat.  We have received their opening statements, which have already been circulated to members.  To allow time for questions and answers, and given we are tight on time due to Covid restrictions, I ask the witnesses to keep their opening statements brief.</p> <p>  Witnesses are asked that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or to the entity's good name.  I advise the witnesses who are giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence to be given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a matter, they must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the representatives from Coillte to make their submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#A00300"><p>I am mindful of the request on time so I will identify the key areas of my statement.  I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with the committee.  With me today is Mark Carlin, managing director of Coillte Forest.  Coillte currently manages an estate of 7% of the land area of Ireland, comprising of over 1 million acres, of which 90% is forested.  Today, we are the largest forester and timber producer in Ireland and the largest provider of outdoor recreation in the country.  We facilitate and develop renewable energy projects and we carry out nature conservation and biodiversity enhancement projects.  We understand the importance of forests for wood, climate, nature and people.  The criticality of our industry is evident in that we were deemed an essential service during the very tight Covid-19 related lockdown of last April and May.  Over the last 30 years, Coillte has continually evolved, embraced change and brought new thinking to the management of Ireland&rsquo;s forestry estate.  We will continue to do this as we look ahead and recalibrate in order to ensure that we have the right balance as we manage our forests for the future.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the appointment of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and we look forward to working with them in evolving a vision for forestry that responds to the challenges we face in the century ahead.  While the current forestry programme will continue until the end of 2021, Coillte will be a proactive participant in the stakeholder group that is being established to help develop its successor.  It is imperative that any new programme focuses on providing a balanced approach to the multiple benefits of forestry and to a regulatory approach that works for all stakeholders.</p> <p>  Having outlined the criticality of our sector, I must point out that the current licensing crisis is of extreme concern to everyone in the forestry sector, and it is a crisis.  The Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 is an important step in putting in place a forestry appeals process that is fit for purpose, and that allows the forestry appeals committee, FAC, to sit in multiple divisions and to be in a position to determine appeals swiftly and efficiently.  Coillte welcomes the implementation of this legislation and thanks the members of the Oireachtas for its speedy passage.  However, while the new legislation is important, it is only one of a number of key steps required to resolve this crisis, which has seriously challenged the sector throughout this year.</p> <p>  Right now, timber supply is at critically low levels, so low that jobs have already been lost, with many more still under threat.  Coillte normally sells our annual timber harvest through a combination of an annual contract with each customer and a series of timber auctions.  Our annual contract transacts half the timber that we supply to sawmills each year.  This event takes place every October and is of fundamental importance to Coillte&rsquo;s customers because it provides them with security of supply for the year ahead.  Due to a lack of licensed material, we have had to cancel this October&rsquo;s annual contract event.  Alongside this, we are also unable to schedule any timber auctions, which are critical to our customers to procure the remainder of their timber supply requirements.</p> <p>  The reality for Coillte today is that we are doing everything we can to keep the timber supply chain across Ireland functioning, and to ensure the Department has all required information to process our licence applications, while at all times remaining in constant contact with our customers on what is now a case of managing emergency supplies.  Right now, we are doing this with very significant difficulty and are operating on a very short-term basis.</p> <p>  This issue has arisen because the rates at which new licences are being issued, roads permitted and appeals heard are currently all below what is required to meet both our and our customers&rsquo; requirements.  For the forestry sector and timber market to function effectively, Coillte&rsquo;s annual harvest programme for 2021 must be fully licensed by the end of 2020.  Currently, Coillte only has 16% of its timber licensed and available for next year, with a further 2.3 million cu. m of additional material needing to be licensed by the Department before the end of this year.  In order to achieve this, the current licensing rate needs to almost triple.  Additionally, approximately one quarter of our 2021 harvest programme is dependent on road permits being issued by the Department.  The current rate of issue of these permits is inadequate and is, already in many instances, preventing us from accessing licensed timber.</p> <p>  Our timber supply challenge is further compounded by the fact that approximately 700,000 cu. m of Coillte&rsquo;s forestry licences are currently under appeal to the FAC.  The hearing rate for our appeals, while recently increased, is still currently not sufficient to clear the backlog of Coillte appeals within what we consider to be the required timeframe for our industry to function normally.</p> <p>  All in all, the new legislation was only one of a number of steps required to address this crisis.  In order to make a further significant positive impact, the FAC needs to be resourced such that all our appeals are determined by the end of January and to ensure that, going forward, all appeals are determined within a two-month turnaround timeframe.  Additionally, the Department needs more resources to meet the required tripling of our current forestry licensing rate.  Without these resources, we will remain in crisis throughout 2021.</p> <p>  I now turn to ash dieback.  Along with the entirety of the forestry industry, Coillte is determined to manage this disease effectively and to do whatever we can to restore ash to our forests and hedgerows.  At all times, the goal is not only to see the species survive, but to implement measures to allow it to thrive.  This has led Coillte to be part of the search for provenances of ash that are resistant to the disease.  We form part of the Ash Society of Ireland, which was set up by the Department to find ways to save ash.  We have identified 200 provenances of ash from throughout Europe that had strains that are resistant to dieback.</p><p>The fight against ash dieback is a long one but we believe we are starting to make some good progress.</p><p> Before concluding, I will comment on the Brexit challenge.  People in our sector are increasingly concerned about the prospect of a hard Brexit.  Approximately 60% of Irish forestry products are exported to the UK and any disruption to supply chains would likely have a severe employment impact.  This is particularly so for the panel products sector, which would face tariffs of 6%, thereby significantly undermining its competitiveness against domestic UK supplies.</p><p> Finally, as the licensing crisis has highlighted, Ireland needs a regulatory framework that supports the continued development of the entire forest sector.  The current system imposes serious constraints on afforestation efforts, as well as on the efficient operation of the forest and timber sector.  It is timely for the Department, in full consultation with the forest products sector, to complete a root and branch review of forest regulation in order to ensure that procedures and processes are fit for purpose going forward and that the right balance can be achieved.</p><p> As an immediate priority, it is critical that building blocks be put in place to restore confidence in Irish forestry.  The Department has a critical and positive role in achieving this by processing the current forestry licences at pace and by the forestry appeals committee clearing the appeals backlog as a matter of urgency.  I look forward to discussing these matters further with members.</p></speech>

There has been a series of meetings and I note one part of the opening statement, which is that Coillte only has 16% of its timber licensed and available for next year, with a further &euro;2.3 cu. m of additional material needed to be licensed by the Department before the end of this year.  In order to achieve this, the current licensing system rate needs to be almost trebled.  I underlined those points when the witness was speaking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#B00300"><p>I thank our guests from Coillte for being here.  I have a number of questions and I will try to be as brief as possible.  As the Chairman mentioned, Ms Hurley mentioned the licensing backlogs and in speaking about the solutions, seemed to have a heavy focus on resources within the Department and the forestry appeals committee.  Are resources the only deficiency or is there a need for further legislation?</p> <p>  Ms Hurley spoke about the Brexit challenge and issued a stark warning, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  She did not list any specific proposals or propositions to try to mitigate the challenges of Brexit so does she have any proposals in that regard?</p> <p>  I welcome her commentary on the protection of the ash species and the measures put in place.  If possible, could she indicate if there has been any scientific appraisal of whether those measures are working, the effect they are having and the long-term implications of those measures?  At a previous meeting when we discussed ash dieback specifically, reference was made to the elm species and the fact that it was almost wiped out.  Will Ms Hurley indicate if Coillte has been involved with any preservation measures for the species?</p> <p>  Today I read lengthy debate that occurred before the Covid-19 pandemic, when lengthy debates were possible, on the farm forestry partnership scheme.  The witness is aware there is quite an amount of concern that the arbitration process has not been resolved.  From reading the transcript, the inference of the committee was that the matters raised could be resolved.  I received a response from Coillte further to a parliamentary question I had submitted that essentially indicates the matter has entered the legal realm and, therefore, no information would be provided to elected representatives.  This is extremely worrying.  Does the witness accept, in the first instance, that the very fact that this is caught in legal wrangling represents a failure but also that it represents a great threat to encouraging farmers to engage with Coillte and other statutory bodies on forestry matters?</p> <p>  It would be remiss of us not to mention a question that has arisen in recent days.  I have been engaging with local communities on wind farms and the important role they can play in creating energy.  In many areas, however, prior to a wind farm being developed, communities would often cite concerns, and this is particularly the case with Coillte-owned sites.  I understand Coillte is the owner of the location of the Meenbog wind farm and it was involved in that project.  Could we get clarification on Coillte's initial role?</p> <p>  The images certainly stopped me in my tracks when Mr. Mark Rooney posted a video on Twitter and other social media showing peat slippage and trees moving through the area adjacent to the Meenbog wind farm.  Does Coillte accept the concerns raised by residents in advance of the development of that wind farm were legitimate?  Does it accept that this incident raises serious concerns about future developments?  Concerns are often dismissed out of hand and ridiculed in some instances but they were clearly legitimate in this case.</p> <p>  I have a copy of a letter from the energy company involved and it speaks of a lack of understanding or appreciation of the feelings of people involved.  The letter is dated 12 November and somebody received it today from the energy company.  It enclosed a leaflet and some general information on wind energy, while also outlining the proposed additional development at Meenbog.  Does the witness accept that this is completely inappropriate and that her organisation has a role to play in this regard?</p></speech>

Will the witness confirm that this is all for commercial heavy cutting or are some for thinning?  How many cubic metres of forestry is tied up in the appeals process?</p> <p>  I will be brief as many speakers wish to contribute.  There are partnerships in which people are seeking to cut timber and it is disappointing that Coillte, instead of going the legal route, has not sat down with the people involved.  It will end up that lawyers and barristers will get more from the process than anybody else.  Why has Coillte not looked to resolve the matter?  I believe applications must have a Natura impact statement but is this now being disputed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#C00100"><p>I thank Ms Hurley for her statement.  There is one issue she did not refer to in her statement about which this committee would like to hear, namely Coillte's plans with respect to Coillte Nature.  The company has exciting and ambitious plans in that regard so I ask her, for the benefit of the committee, to elaborate on them.  If we are to meet the ambition of the State in respect of forestry and tree planting in the next few decades, we must get going and I see Coillte Nature as having a very significant role to play in that.  I would appreciate it if Ms Hurley would elaborate on that.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that she truncated her statement because of time constraints but one area that she skipped over quickly was the three strains that Coillte has taken clones of and perhaps she could elaborate on the company's plans in that regard as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#C00200"><p>I will take the broad questions relating to licensing and Mr. Carlin will answer the questions on ash, elm and the farm partnerships as well as anything else, in the round.  In overall terms, we have 16% of the timber that we need licensed for next year.  We need 2.3 million cu. m licensed by the end of the year to carry on our operations in what we would consider a normal way.  That requires a tripling of the licenses that are being issued by the Department, and resources are a critical part of achieving this.  As to whether further legislation is required, we are in a very acute stage of this crisis.  We have very little timber remaining for this year.  Having been through the legislative change and having followed the passage of the recent Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, frankly we do not have time for legislation now.  What we need is licensed timber.  We must focus on the current process to achieve that.  I can only comment from the outside but based on the volume of licences that we are getting, resources are needed if we are to triple the number being issued.  In time, and to have a vibrant forestry sector going forward, a regulatory review is necessary and that may result in the need for legislative change.</p> <p>  I will comment on the dashboard and the licences.  The licences that we have had in the past number of weeks are for commercial timber.  They now need to work through the 28-day period before they are available, as such, and they can, of course, be appealed.  Regarding the number of appeals, we have 700,00 cu. m  of timber tied up at the moment in the forestry appeals committee, FAC.  That is why I made reference in my opening statement to the importance of the FAC hearing appeals at the pace that is needed.  From Coillte's point of view, we must be realistic at this stage.  We have 54 appeals listed for the month of November and 24 for the month of December.  We have 223 appeals overall that need to work through the system at the moment.  Ideally we need those appeals to be heard in this quarter to enable us to maintain volumes for our customers and work for our contractors but we have to be realistic now in terms of where we are.  We need the backlog of appeals to be heard to free up that 700,000 cu. m of timber.  That needs to be done by the end of January, which will require a very significant uplift, almost tripling what we are currently experiencing.  Long term, the industry needs a turnaround timeframe of some certainty.  Coillte suggests that a two-month timeframe is reasonable and one around which we could all plan.  </p> <p>  Coillte Nature is an important not-for-profit vehicle that is very focused on projects to restore and rehabilitate parts of our estate as well as to create new forests.  Coillte Nature is only one part of that work.  Coillte recognises the ambitions of the State in terms of the much-needed 8,000 ha of forest as a response to climate change and wants to play its part, not just through Coillte Nature but across the broader Coillte business.  I will hand over to Mr. Carlin now who will answer the other questions posed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Carlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#C00300"><p>I might start on the questions about ash and will take them in the round.  A question was asked about the scientific appraisal and I will provide some background information on what we are trying to do to restore ash.  We have identified two hundred clones from around Europe and three of those provenances are from Ireland.  They have been planted out in Castlemorris, County Kilkenny.  In total, there are 600 clones planted there now.  They were planted in April this year.  We chose that site because it is a hotspot, unfortunately, for ash dieback so it is a very good testing ground for these provenances.  Early indications are very positive.  It still early but ash dieback usually has an impact on juvenile trees so thus far, the situation is very positive.  We will continue to increase this clonal bank with a view to planting many more of those clones.  We will then try to develop seed orchards from this and get back into planting ash broadly in our forests again.  The news is positive.  Ash is an extremely important species not only for Coillte but for society, particularly from a hurley ash point of view.  It is extremely important from a biodiversity and social point of view that we get back to planting ash again and that is what we are striving towards.</p> <p>  The scheme itself is not relevant to Coillte but I am aware of it.  It is more relevant to our farm partners than it is to our own estate.  In terms of our estate, approximately 60% of our ash is impacted.  We have cleared out the worst impacted sites and we are carrying out heavy thinning on the less impacted sites.  Ash responds well to heavy thinning and it seems to slow down the rate of spread of the disease.  My understanding of the scheme is that it is better than the one that preceded it.  It looks at the extent of damage and tries to apply the right mitigation, depending on the level of damage.  That is the right approach to take, rather than just clearing everything out.  It is more nuanced now and I hope the scheme will be more relevant to what we need to try to do.  </p> <p>  There were a number of questions about our farm partners, one of which was about seeking resolution and the other was about arbitration.  On the issue of resolution, we have tried very hard to resolve disputes before they get into arbitration.  While I cannot speak about specific legal cases, it is worth bearing in mind, from the point of view of numbers, that nine partners have sought arbitration.  Two cases are advanced and seven less so and we are doing everything we can to get them resolved as quickly as possible.  I am sure members will understand that they are in a legal process over which we do not have control.  We are meeting all of the deadlines that we have to meet and providing all of the information required.  We want to get this straightened out as much as our partners do.  Clearly, we would rather not be in this position with these nine partners and we are working with all of our partners to try to improve on issues that were identified a couple of years ago, mainly around communications and commercial statements.  We have tried very hard recently to improve our communications with all of our partners in an effort to avoid unnecessary arbitration in which neither party wants to get involved.  </p> <p>  There was one other question on felling licences and Natura impact statements, NIS, from Deputy Fitzmaurice.  All of our applications for felling and road permits and for afforestation are screened for appropriate assessment.</p><p>For those that have been screened, we are preparing a detailed ecology report and an NIS to support each of those applications.  They are being submitted to the Department along with the application.  We hope this will help to speed up the process.  I think I have answered all of the outstanding questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#D00300"><p>I understand the time constraints so I will be as brief as possible.  I thank Ms Hurley and Mr. Carlin for the presentation.  Following on from the point made by the Chairman regarding just 16% of the timber needed for 2021 being currently licensed, I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that point with regard to afforestation licensing.  What percentage of planting is required for next year and what percentage of licensing in that regard is currently available?  How many licences are outstanding and what is the delay in this regard?  How do the witnesses believe this is affecting Coillte's role in achieving the target of 8,000 ha per annum set out in the programme for Government?</p> <p>  The witnesses made a brief presentation this morning, but their written submission refers to the Mackinnon report.  I would like their opinion on how this could or would solve some of the issues, the timeline for its implementation and its effectiveness in solving some of the problems they have highlighted.  On ash dieback, when does a native Irish species stop being a native Irish species if we are cloning with seedlings from other countries?  What potential difficulties could arise with imported species of a same brand in the Irish climate going forward?  There may be issues similar to ash dieback which may affect a tree being grown in Ireland but being cloned from what is not its natural environment.</p></speech>

I would like the witnesses to elaborate on the level of confidence in the industry with regard to planting.  We have seen a huge issue with regard to seedlings or plants being destroyed, particularly this year, because of a lack of actual planting in the industry.  The knock-on effect of this over the next few years will be horrendous.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on where they think the programme is going, what needs to happen, what steps need to be taken to build confidence in the sector and the hectares that have been planted.  My understanding is roughly 2,000 ha have been planted, which is a fraction of where we need to be.  What steps need to be taken to make sure we reach the target in respect of which we are already 90% off?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#D00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for being here.  Ms Hurley referred in her opening statement to a "crisis in the sector".  I presume she has used that phrase in her engagement with the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  What was the Department's response in that regard?  Has it acknowledged there is a crisis or has it sought to defend its own position?  Does Ms Hurley believe the Mackinnon report will address some of the crises she mentioned?</p> <p>  Ms Hurley also spoke about the sawmills being under pressure to have native Irish timber at their disposal.  Some sawmills are importing timber from as far away as Russia.  Does Coillte understand and acknowledge that people have lost confidence in this sector?  Does Ms Hurley believe the forestry sector has a future under the current leadership in the Department?  I refer in that regard to officials in the Department and not the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who is only recently appointed to that role.  I think she has inherited a huge problem.  Questions need to be asked of the officials who have overseen this crisis over the last ten years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#D00600"><p>On the overall question of confidence in the sector, confidence in terms of planting and related matters, when I stand back from this I look at it in terms of where we are today.  This is a sector that is incredibly important to Ireland in terms of planting trees.  It is a sector that is important to local, rural economies and a sector that is so critical it was deemed an essential service during the Covid-19 lockdown in April and May.  In my view, for people to have confidence to plant trees and for us to have a high level of afforestation we need people to be able to see that the system works.  It has been very challenging over the course of this year because not enough licences have come through the system to allow us to keep the volumes that we need to keep in front of our customers to meet their demands.  For us to move forward, it is important that the licences flow, that the appeals are heard and that Coillte has confidence that the Department will do the right thing and ensure that the resources come forward because with the resources will come licences.  With the resources, I expect a higher level of appeals will be heard.  From our point of view this will build confidence because we can then get back to what we as an industry do best, namely, manage forests and the produce timber needed for the roofs and floors of homes, etc.  For now, that is the first piece.</p> <p>  I foresee a further important building block in terms of the regulatory framework that is in use today.  As the forestry model and the policy for the future is developed, it is important a review of forestry regulation should be undertaken with all stakeholders.  It should look at best practice across Europe and elsewhere in the world, examine what will work efficiently and identify a balanced model for forestry.  That balanced model for forestry will provide the opportunity for people to have the confidence to plant trees going forward.  I will pass to Mr. Carlin to respond to the remaining questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Carlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#D00700"><p>Senator Daly asked about the 16% of licences that are available.  To be clear, what we have right now for 2021, licensed and available, is 16%.  In terms of the various sources of volume, there are 700,000 cu. m in FAC under appeal, which is approximately 25% of our normal supply.   There is a further 25% that is licensed, but just 16% is available.  Some material is licensed but unavailable for various reasons.  It could need a road permit or there could be other restrictions on it.  It is important that our entire annual basket of timber is licensed at the end of the year so that we can bring a full supply to our customers and the sawmills and restore equilibrium to the market.  The remaining 50% is to be licensed by the end of the year so members will note the challenge ahead.</p> <p>  The major operations for which we need afforestation licences are felling, thinning and road construction.  There are some, but not many, afforestation licences held up in the system.  Our reforestation programme is essentially wrapped up in the felling licence and the licence for harvesting.</p> <p>  The question on ash dieback is certainly an interesting one with regard to clones.  We would rather use native Irish stock and we are trying to do that.</p><p>We have identified three provenances here in Ireland with which we are working and will continue to do so.  Our options are limited because ash dieback has been so devastating to our ash here in Ireland and we are, of course, also looking across Europe.  The most important aspect of this is to get ash provenances that are resilient to ash dieback.  We will then have to bring in a good variety of provenances to see which respond to Irish conditions and grow best.  We need to keep our options open.  The number one target has to be to deal with the ash dieback situation.</p><p> Turning to the Mackinnon report, I spent a lot of with Mr. Jim Mackinnon when he was in Ireland and reviewing afforestation here.  He is an extremely knowledgeable person.  He spoke to the stakeholders of the entire industry and the report is good and comprehensive.  I know we are tight on time but I will draw out a couple of recommendations  I think are key.  The first is about land and land availability.  We have to tackle that problem and have a good land use strategy for the country for what we should be doing with our land.  Second, we need a strategy for forestry, going forward.  We must look forward in terms of the balance and what we want to do with land for forests and what we want from our forests.  Allied to that strategy is a good forestry policy for the next programme which needs to be enshrined in effective regulation.  That is certainly one of the things that is impacting on confidence at the moment.  It is hard to say that one is going to invest in forestry over 30 or 40 years while not being entirely sure what one is going to get at the other end.  Bringing greater confidence through smart regulation would be a big benefit.</p><p> I think I have dealt with the majority of the questions.  I will respond to the question about the Department and what it is saying to us about the crisis.  We are engaged on a daily and weekly basis with the senior officials in the Department.  They are clear on the numbers.  We have a clear dashboard in terms of what we need from licences and roads and what the current supply shortages are with our customers and sawmills.  The Department is certainly getting full communication from us on exactly what supply we have and what we need.</p></speech>

Ms Hurley said that Coillte's annual harvest programme must be fully licensed by the end of this year but that only 16% of its timber is licensed and available for next year and 2.3 million cu. m of additional material need to be licensed.  Does she honestly believe that is going to happen before the end of the year?  If the licensing system continues for the rest of the year at its present pace, what will be the impact on the sector and how many jobs will be lost?  Is there a difference between how the Natura impact statements are prepared for Coillte applications and for private applications?</p> <p>  Our guests have also spoken about trials of ash strains that are resistant to dieback.  From what we have heard here over the past couple of weeks, resistant schemes may be realised in the future but the presentation today gave the impression that we are further along to line towards getting those strains.  Where are we with the ash dieback resistant strains?  Will our guests also tell me what other measures are being taken to ensure the continuing existence of our native ash species or are we at the end of native ash?</p> <p>  There is a backlog of 2,056 tree-felling licences at the minute, which equates to 7.1 million tonnes of timber.  Many of the problems would be solved if people in the Department got their fingers out and started looking after the backlog of licences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#E00400"><p>I will be brief because I have other questions for later in the session.  Coillte, because it is so big, is probably being more adversely affected by Covid-19 than our ordinary rank and file farmers, investors and people who just want to grow trees, get on and get them processed.  At the moment, there are 20 million plants available in one nursery, as our guests know, and another 10 million, which amounts to 30 million plants available for use in Ireland right now.  The Department is not engaging with the suppliers of those plants at all.  Scotland is in contact with our nurseries and is looking to take those 30 million plants.  It is great to have an airing, such as this, to debate the whole matter in an honest and straightforward fashion.  What does Coillte think of that type of a situation?   Our guests, in the positions that they hold, certainly have much to say about the way the whole system is being run into the ground.  That is what is happening at present.  Our forestry sector is being run into the ground.  It is not the fault of our guests but by their attendance today, we are looking on them as allies to support us in saying this has to stop and change.  Scotland is looking to buy 30 million plants because it knows they are there and our people, who are charged with the issuing of licences and the people in the Department, are not being proactive or workpersonlike enough to deal with the problems that we have.  What would be the view of our guests?  I have many questions to ask later on and I would like to come back in, but I wanted to ask that one question to get an overview of Coillte's feelings on that aspect of where we are going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#E00500"><p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  I have had a long connection with Coillte, first in the sawmilling business and subsequently with rural recreation.  I have to say that Coillte has, basically, done a good job on both sides.  My questions are specific.  How many applications has Coillte in with the Department at present, by number and volume?  In other words, is Coillte ready and the hold-up is in the Department in the first place?  Perhaps our guests could give us some idea of the percentage of timber being milled at present in the country that is coming from outside the island of Ireland?  If they can give me the percentage that is coming from within the island, we can subtract that from 100.  Can they also confirm that Coillte is held up for over 500,000 m worth of road licences?  In other words, not only is Coillte waiting for felling licences but is also waiting for road licences.</p> <p>  Is it of concern to our guests that of the amount of timber that has exited that something like 20% has been appealed in recent times before the end of the cooling-off period?  If that rate of attrition were to continue, what effect would it have?  There are longer-term issues but the house is on fire and burning down.  People in this important industry are going to be let go on the felling and milling sides.  The most urgent thing we have to do is to make sure that the mills stay open and the industry survives.  Would I be right in thinking that the market for sawn timber, finished product, is very strong and Covid has helped because the DIY business has taken off strongly, particularly in our neighbouring island?  At the moment, despite all the worries about Brexit, selling is not the problem for that part of the industry.  Their number one concern is getting timber.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#E00600"><p>Mr. Carlin will pick up the questions about ash, Natura impact statements, the specific detail on the volumes and numbers of applications that we have outstanding and anything else, in the round, that he chooses to pick up on.</p> <p>  In overall terms, it is absolutely correct to say that the market for timber is very strong just now.  We have worked very hard on that and will continue to do so.</p><p>We are doing everything we can to keep the timber supply chain across Ireland open.  We normally supply 75% of the timber, so when we are short of licences, it has a serious impact.  It is really difficult when we do not have enough timber to supply our customers.  It is really difficult when we have contractors and we know of contractors who do not have work because their machines are parked so it is a very difficult situation.  </p><p> In respect of the question on increasing the volume of licences to get us licensed by the end of the year - the 2.3 million cu. m, the importance of this is that it would allow us to have a form of normal operations - not a perfect but a form of normal operations - going into 2021.  It would allow us to have an annual contract event with our customers, which is a normal event we have every October to contract volume, and to plan for some normal timber auctions over the course of next year.  The challenge if the volumes did not increase would be around the fact that we would continue as we are in the current crisis through 2021 because the volumes have become so low.  The level of volume that is coming through means that it would be more about continuing to operate on a very short-term basis, which brings real challenges in terms of an industry having confidence and, ultimately, our customers being comfortable that they can contract with their customers.  </p><p> In terms of the millions of plants that may not be destined for Scotland, we recognise that the level of afforestation that will be achieved this year will be nowhere near what it needs to be.  The situation is really difficult where this level of plants have been grown and are ready but there is no place they can ultimately go.  Coillte sees this as an industry issue.  Yes, we have a very large challenge because we are such a large operator but this is an industry challenge and it is important there is confidence across the industry.  I have been in the business for a year.  I have spent a year working really hard on this.  Many things have evolved and developed over the year.  Now there is clarity about what needs to be done to make an application, what needs to be submitted, a Natura impact statement, NIS, etc.  This is where I go back to putting the resources in place to ensure the volume of licences comes through, the licences are felling, road and afforestation licences and appeals are heard.</p><p> There have been a varying level of appeals over the year.  The number has been higher in some months.  In respect of assuming a rate of 20% continues, we have a system that allows people to appeal.  What we need is a forestry appeals committee that turns appeals around within a two-month timeframe.  Our job in Coillte and the job of the broader industry is to plan for enough time for licensing so we need to know how long it takes and have enough time for appeals to go through.  We need to make applications as early as is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Carlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#F00200"><p>The number of felling licence applications is around 750, which accounts for 2.3 million cu. m of timber.  We have 311 road permit applications, which account for 760,000 cu. m of timber.  We have more than 200 appeals, which is 700,000 cu. m of timber.  There is plenty of supply in the system and we will continue to bring that supply through as quickly as we can.  On whether we can get this licensed fully by the end of the year, to do this, we need to triple the current rate.  It is possible because we are providing good-quality NIS information that should be capable of being processed very quickly but there is a need to significantly improve the run rate.</p> <p>  I would say four things about the impact.  The first is that supply is very tight.  It is critical.  We are on a week-to-week basis at the moment.  This is affecting our ability to sell timber.  We have had to cancel our annual contract event and are unable to confirm when our next timber auction will be.  This means the sawmills are in a very difficult position in terms of their own productivity and are looking at how they can balance supply and potentially take a reduction in some of their shifts.  Again, I am aware that some harvesting contractors are parked because of work availability.  The markets in the UK and Europe are very buoyant.  This, unfortunately, is having an impact on the confidence in Irish supply.  We could be taking more market share in the UK because the demand is so high.</p></speech>

How much are we importing from Scotland and Russia?</p></speech>

One could say that this is in and around 10% to 15%.  It will be impossible to increase that much more because the demand in Europe and the UK is very high so it is very difficult to import from Scotland.  We will not be able to import our way out of this problem.  There is a little bit more.  Unfortunately, we have to look at importing in terms of some pulp wood for our medium density fibreboard, MDF, and SmartPly oriented strand board, OSB, plants but it is a very hot market out there for us and our customers for the sawmills to be able to import so it will be very difficult to do that.</p></speech>

Coillte is a very reputable company and has carried out its work to the highest standards over the years.  I know that because I worked and still work for it.  I wish to declare that.</p> <p>  This is a very serious matter.  This country does not have gold, diamonds or oil but we have a product - timber - that we cannot access and we cannot get licences.  On my list today is one man in my constituency who applied for a licence seven years ago.  He reared a large family and is looking for a licence to cut his timber.  He has been waiting for seven years.  There were several others going back to 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Serious questions need to be asked of senior management in the Department.  </p></speech>

Roads for timber that has already been licensed constitute another issue.  How much of that timber is licensed and waiting for road permits?</p><p>Are some of the licences for the 16% waiting for roads as well?  Does that mean we are waiting for that timber as well, and will be waiting?  This is practically the end of November and 2021 is less than four working weeks away.  It will not have all those licences - 84% of them.  Not to mind all the independent farmers, I would like to ask Coillte what is the thinking on that.  We do not have the figures but we know the number of people who are writing to us and phoning us asking us to help them to get licences.  Coillte is here.  Surely it is the biggest operator in the timber industry, but there are many private companies with large tracts of land and farmers and individual property owners waiting for licences.  Does Coillte honestly think it will get the other 84% licensed in the next four weeks?</p></speech>

I appreciate him facilitating me and I will be brief.  The rate of afforestation in the county of Cork has gone from a high of 14% per annum down to somewhere around 4%.  I would like to hear from Coillte, perhaps not now but in writing, how it will address that massive decline.  Munster is seeing a collapse in planting, relative to other parts of the country.  I would be grateful to receive correspondence in respect of the corporate strategy to address that issue.</p> <p>  On a similar vein, we are now seeing the increased use by citizens of Coillte estates for leisure purposes.  Covid has highlighted the importance of forestry.  To be fair to Coillte, it has done a tremendous job in terms of opening up its estates and making them as user-friendly as possible.  If we are talking about afforestation and moving away from sitka spruce, it would be greatly welcome if there was a strategy and policy for areas, such as those in my own area in north Cork, including Rahan, the Ballyhouras, the Nagles and the Knockarowra mountain outside of Mallow, where we were seeing piecemeal improvements in terms of road infrastructure, pathways infrastructure and mixed-use forestry, so that families can benefit and submerse themselves more in forestry from a leisure point of view.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for letting me in.  I realise he is under pressure of time.  I would be delighted if somebody from Coillte could engage with me, maybe offline, on these issues.</p></speech>

Before I ask a question, I remind members of the committee about their face coverings and that visors are not exactly appropriate for the health and safety of those of us who are here and the employees.</p> <p>  Why does Coillte appear to be so optimistic about the processing of licences by the forestry appeals committee given that the experience of recent weeks has shown that the issue seems to be with the quality of the decisions that are being made by the Department?  If one looks at the week of 6 November, five out of five of the appeals decided had to be remitted back to the Department.  In the week of the 30 October, nine out of ten appeals were sent back.  In the week of the 23 October, four out of nine of the appeals had to be remitted.  Surely the issue is with the quality of the decision being taken at the Department.  Why would Coillte be optimist that the backlog can be dealt with?  Also, does Coillte apply the same standards of diversity as those in the private sector, such has having 15% broadleaf in each individual plantation, given that Coillte should be the standard bearer on biodiversity when it comes to forestry?</p></speech>

This is my first appearance before it as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry and I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee and answer whatever questions its members may have.  It is clear that they have a keen interest in the forestry sector, which is not surprising.  I share their interest, which is reflected in the programme for Government.  As they will know, the programme is ambitious for the future of forestry.</p> <p>  Forestry is an integral part of the rural economy, and the majority of the 23,000 private forest owners are farmers.  As a farmer and forest owner myself, I fully understand how well forestry can sit alongside a productive farming enterprise.  Payments and grants received through the forestry programme have allowed countless farmers to diversify their farm incomes.  This has had a positive effective on the rural economy.  Since 1990, the State has invested some &euro;3 billion in forestry and continues to offer generous payments to those who sign up to planting.  Taken with the thousands of jobs created right across the forestry supply chain, the wider impact on the rural economy is formidable.  I intend to continue with strong State supports for forestry during the lifetime of this Government.</p> <p>  While forestry benefits the rural economy, it also delivers other benefits to society.  As committee members know better than most, tree planting is increasingly recognised as an efficient way of reducing net emissions and responding to the climate emergency.  It makes a critical contribution to the agriculture and land use sectors' response to climate breakdown.  Forests are not only a carbon sink but also help in preventing the erosion of soils and reducing flood risks, and they provide us with fantastic recreational spaces.  These spaces have proven more valuable than ever in the current circumstances.  As we all know, time spent in nature surrounded by the sounds and scents of trees can restore our mood and refresh and rejuvenate us.</p> <p>  Our forests are contributing to our biodiversity goals.  The forest estate in Ireland is diverse, with 29% of forest cover made up of broadleaves and native woodlands.  We hit a milestone this year, with the highest recorded planting of native woodlands at 450 ha.  This totals more than 1.4 million individual native trees, half of which were planted by farmers.  The creation and restoration of these woodlands is an important part of the forestry programme, given their historical and cultural significance.</p> <p>  However, forestry as a land use has become has become divisive.  This is often characterised by some misunderstandings, and a priority for all of us with an interest in the sector is to ensure that any strategy is informed by facts and science.  It is also essential that all stakeholders communicate directly and constructively.  It is for this reason that I have established a new stakeholder forestry policy group, which will meet for the first time this Thursday.  The group will help to provide input from a broad range of stakeholders on the big forestry questions as well as on short-term and longer term issues such as the development of the next forestry programme.  For now, though, the focus is on the immediate priorities, in particular licensing issues.</p> <p>  The committee has asked me to address the ash dieback scheme, which I will turn to now.  The ash tree is of historical and cultural significance to Ireland and the unfortunate effects of ash dieback have been felt in ash plantations throughout the country.  As the eradication of the disease is no longer possible, we have now moved into a phase of disease management.  This is the approach being followed under the new ash dieback scheme known as the reconstitution and underplanting scheme.  The revised approach set out in the new scheme categorises plantations into three groups based on plantation age and tree size.  Different support options are available depending on the category.  The scheme aims to promote the vigorous growth of ash through thinning to realise as much of the potential value of the crop as possible.  Since its launch, almost 200 applications have been submitted and we are moving to deal with them so that forest owners will have certainty in how to manage their individual situations.</p> <p>  This is a valuable reconstitution scheme, one that recognises the difficulties faced by the landowners concerned and is a responsive and well-considered measure.  It is important that we move to process the many applications and allow the applicants to get on with managing their plantations.  Committee members may have questions about the scheme.  I will be happy to answer any that arise.</p> <p>  The majority of trees planted in Irish forests are home grown.  We are generally self-sufficient and a net exporter of forestry trees.  When there is an occasional shortage of specific tree species at the end of the planting season, forestry plants are imported by forestry companies.  The ash trees that were imported and were later the first trees to test positive for ash dieback disease were not inspected by the Department on arrival, as there are no input controls at member states' borders within the EU.  The EU is a single market and all goods, including plants, are not generally checked on arrival into Ireland from other member states.  Under European plant health legislation, there are legally based rules around the movement of plants and plant products within the EU.  For example, conifer logs from the Continent are free to travel between most countries on the Continent but are not permitted to land in Ireland because we are free of most of the bark beetles that are present in those logs.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that there are major difficulties in the forestry sector relating to licensing.  I have been engaging intensively with all relevant stakeholders on this issue and know what is happening.  I am aware that the current delays in issuing licences have led to serious difficulties for people involved in the forestry industry.  Everyone in this room knows that the licensing and appeals system has come under significant pressure in the past two years.  This is not a situation that can be resolved immediately or through a single action.  It requires many different solutions and I would like to outline to the committee the many steps that we are taking to help resolve matters.</p> <p>  We reached a point during the summer where close to 100% of certain licences were being appealed and the appeals system was overwhelmed.  This was an unsustainable situation and why I moved quickly to introduce the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020.  I acknowledge the contribution made to the Act's passage by Members of both Houses and the staff in my Department, who worked hard on it.  It was concluded on 7 October and the implementing regulations were introduced immediately afterwards.</p> <p>  These initiatives are already having an impact.  We now have four forestry appeals committees in place, up from one less than six weeks ago.  The Act allows for other improvements in the appeals process in line with other planning systems, such as enabling the forestry appeals committee, FAC, to determine appeals without an oral hearing where appropriate and the introduction of reasonable fees, which I have done.  Importantly, I should emphasise that the FAC is completely independent of my Department.  I am confident that these changes will make the system significantly more efficient and fairer for applicants and appellants.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, my Department is the sole licensing authority for all afforestation, forest road and felling applications.  All licences must be issued in compliance with EU and national environmental legislation, including the 1992 EU habitats directive.</p><p>It is essential, therefore, that all licences are issued in full compliance with the relevant regulations and that the integrity of the licensing process is fully upheld.  Due to changes in the interpretation of environmental law, we have had to overhaul completely our appropriate assessment procedures in the past 18 months.  The complexity involved in developing and resourcing a new approach to assessing these licences should not be underestimated.  We now have a robust and reliable procedure in place.</p><p> These delays, however, have led to a backlog of some 1,900 files on our system for consideration.  This backlog, which is a subset of our overall licensing output, is of particular concern to me and I am anxious that we resolve it as quickly as possible.  We are committed in a project plan to key performance indicators for this cohort of licences that we are not meeting and we must redouble our efforts to do this.  We are tackling this backlog through a dedicated project plan.  A project manager is in place and a project management board is overseeing and monitoring delivery weekly.  We have invested heavily in extra ecologists and now employ 16 full-time equivalent ecologists where previously we had one.  Ten additional forestry inspectors have been recruited to deliver on the plan.  This is already yielding progress with an increase in output month on month.</p><p> I understand that my Department is now sharing with the committee the weekly dashboard of outputs.  In that, members will start to see early signs of progress with October bringing the highest output this year.  We issued 12 new forestry licences every day in October and more than 300 licences for the month.  Our aim is to sustain and grow this level of output.  Productivity will improve further as experience grows and as we adjust and review the system to make it more effective. Additional resources will also help.  We have also provided updated guidance and advice to companies on how to maximise the quality of their applications, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders to resolve this.</p><p> I assure the committee that I am very much committed to turning this situation around and believe we have the right processes and people in place to do so.  Notwithstanding the current difficulties, we must look to the future.  The Government is committed to the development of a new climate Bill, and forestry will be a key part of that.  We have huge potential to increase our forest cover from 11% and I am determined to put in place the strategies and programmes to deliver this.  There is a clear opportunity to do this as we have the second lowest forest cover in Europe.  To do so will require an ambitious new national forestry programme.  It will need to be transformative in nature to encourage farmer uptake and to garner societal support.  I will therefore be looking for a partnership between the political system, businesses, State bodies, farmers and communities in developing a vision for forestry.  We will start the discussion on this shortly and I look forward to the committee's views on that.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

Before I open to the floor for questions I will make a brief comment.  This committee is extremely concerned about the forestry sector at the moment and the serious problems it has.  A number of stakeholders have been here over recent weeks.  There is huge anxiety about the ability of the sector to survive under the circumstances.</p> <p>  On the issue of ash dieback, I do not believe the response there is sufficient to answer the economic plight being undergone by the people whose operations have suffered this disease.  We must be more proactive in addressing their economic plight to give them the encouragement to revitalise their plantations.</p> <p>  I am disappointed that there is no reference in the Minister of State's presentation to the Mackinnon report.  That is a key report in trying to sort out a number of the issues in the industry.  I am disappointed that there was no reference to the report.</p> <p>  I know that there are detailed questions to be asked.  We will take one question at a time and then the Minister of State or her officials will answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#J00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State and her officials for coming into the committee.  I have been in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the past 18 and a half years and I have never seen such cross-party support on this specific issue.  This is a major issue for everybody right across the board.</p> <p>  The forestry sector totally depends on the nursery sector.  They have always been there to meet all the targets set out by Government.  Two years ago most nurseries would have looked at the targets the Government had set out and they would have sown the sufficient amount of seed to meet the demands of the Minister of State's Department.  Now, two years later, we will see nurseries throughout the country dumping millions of trees because of inaction.  This is not because of the Minister of State.  She has inherited a terrible problem.  I do, however, blame her officials.  The blame for their inaction and the decline of the forestry sector should be put right on top of their desks.</p> <p>  In 2010 the forest service made a decision to restrict farmers on the percentage of marginal land they could plant.  To plant 20% of marginal land a farmer had to plant 80% of good quality ground, which I believe makes very little sense.  I do not know why the Department would restrict suitable land to just 20% if it can grow trees.  Industry stakeholders warned about the viability of the afforestation programme at the time as a result of the decision taken and, I have to say, they have been proven absolutely 100% right.  In 2016 my former colleague and Minister, Tom Hayes, commissioned the Land Availability for Afforestation report.  The report concluded that the COFORD Council identified, "A significant area of land suitable for afforestation (c. 220,000 ha) exists in this usage range that is not currently in farming, and which is outside the main environmental constraint areas."  I have two questions on this issue.  Who made the decision in 2010?  What official in the Minister of State's Department made the decision in 2010 to impose these restrictions on farmers?  Why was that decision made?  If the Minister of State is not able to answer, maybe she will get back to me.</p> <p>  Considering the alarming decline in afforestation since 2010, what efforts has the Department made to bring any of this land back into the programme, given it is suitable for afforestation as recommended in the COFORD Council report?</p> <p>  There are a number of other licensing issues.   I do not normally do this, and I have sat in the Minister of State's position as a Minister of State for nine years.  I never welcomed a Deputy or a Senator coming in and tackling my Department, but on this occasion I must say that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is presiding over and has overseen the absolute destruction of this industry.</p> <p>  Representatives from Coillte were before the committee earlier and they used the word "crisis".  I have never in my lifetime used the word "crisis" lightly, and they do not use the word lightly.  It is a crisis at the moment.  Would the Minister of State agree that a person who applies for a licence should have his or her application over the line within 120 days?  I would say 90 days but most of the people I have talked to about this would settle for 120 days, be the application for thinning, for forest roads or for felling.  If there is an appeal against that licence application, then it is within the applicant's right that the appeal should be heard within 60 days.</p> <p>  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department on 14 October.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue's, reply was that, "As the FAC is operationally independent of my Department, I cannot enquire into an individual licence."  I will give the history of this.  The farmer applied for a felling licence, which was granted.  All of a sudden it was appealed.  To this day he has not received anything in writing from the Department to say it has gone into appeal.  By chance, his forester mentioned it to him.  I submitted the parliamentary question on 14 October, but to date he has not heard one word from the Minister of State's Department.  Two weeks ago I picked up the phone to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because of absolute utter frustration.  The word we got back was we could be waiting for a year to 24 months for our appeal to be heard.  That was before the extra appeals committees were set up.</p> <p>  I feel bad saying this, but having listened to the industry, I put it to the Minister of State very clearly that they are literally on their knees.  They are looking for leadership, and I hope the Minister of State will provide the leadership.  The Minister of State must get the backing and the support of the officials in her Department.</p><p>I am of the view that she has not been getting that, and neither did previous Ministers.  This did not land on the desks of the officials on 1 January last, it has been going on for several years.  The officials should have seen these problems arising.  I feel sorry for the people involved, whether they work in the sawmills, drive the trucks transporting the timber, are tree harvesters or work in the nurseries.  People from all those areas have contacted my office in recent months because they have seen the industry in decline.  If we are to be real about carbon credits, etc., we must get real about the problems and face up to and solve them.  I am sorry for the Minister of State, and these comments are in no way aimed at her.  Her officials must listen to the industry and the problems which it is facing.</p></speech>

We have spent more than &euro;7 million up to now supporting farmers with ash dieback in their plantations.  The new scheme has been in effect since June.  We have received more than 200 applications to date, so it is not as if no one is applying for the scheme.  People are applying.  I refer to the support measures to remove diseased trees and to encourage the aggressive thinning of plantations.  We heard in the previous session that ash responds well to vigorous thinning and that it is possible to the delay the onset of dieback in other trees so they can continue to grow.  I also refer to the support for the reconstitution and planting of other trees.  We feel those support measures are effective at this stage, and the scheme is being engaged with by farmers on the ground.</p> <p>  Moving on to the Mackinnon report, we have already implemented a good deal of it in the context of aligning the appeals process, the introduction of fees for appeals and the planning process.  I hope, however, to make an announcement on Thursday in that regard.  I ask the committee members to watch this space and I hope they will be pleased.  That is happening.  If people have not read the Mackinnon report, I recommend that they do so.  We hear a great deal about the report and comments relating to it get bandied about , but it is a fairly short report and is worth reading.  There is a great deal in the report for those on both sides of the argument.  It is not just a bible for industry.  There is a great deal of fairness in the report, so I recommend that everyone read it.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Kehoe's comments, I fully acknowledge the crisis the sector is in.  It is something I have inherited.  I can only really speak to the four months for which I have been in office.  In that time, however, I have seen the officials and staff in the Department working incredibly hard.  I cannot comment on what happened before, but I have seen much hard work.  A great deal has happened in those four months in respect of the legislation and hiring more people to help with the licensing process.  That is something and there have been improvements.  As I indicated in my opening statement, in October we issued more felling licences than in the entirety of the previous 12 months.  We must keep working on that, and if we need more resources in that regard, which I think we do, we will continue to push resources in that direction.  If we need to hire more ecologists, we will hire more ecologists.  If we need more forest inspectors, we will ensure that happens.</p> <p>  That is all I can say for now.  We will endeavour to get through the backlog as quickly as possible, but there is no silver bullet here.  There is no one thing that will fix all these problems in a couple of months.  There is a backlog and we must deal with it.  We must also apply due process to the backlog in the outstanding appeals.  It is important that we do it right, but I have confidence that the system works now.  The issue is getting through the backlog, and I realise that is what is driving the crisis.  I am working really hard with my officials, whom I know are also working hard, to deliver on this, because nobody is happy with the situation.</p></speech>

On the island in total, there was processing of some 4.9 million cu. m.  That is the COFORD Council report, so I obviously believe it.  On the Department's dashboard, it is stated that 13,972 ha of felling licences were issued.  In fairness, that was done out as 3.8 million cu. m of timber.  In 2019, there were some 57,195 ha.  The Department did not calculate the cubic metres in this regard - I did it myself - but it comes out at 15.5 million cu. m.  Going on the basis of what the Department put on the dashboard, this means that in 2019 and 2020 there were 19.3 million cu. m of timber.  We are using 5 million cu. m of timber a year.  That is 10 million cu. m maximum even if we did not import anything, which we do.  In October, the Department stated that felling licences had been issued for 761,213 cu. m.  I have looked at the number of appeals for 2019 and 2020.  Those appeals related to 7,313 ha in the context of licensing and 417 licences.  Where is the timber?</p></speech>

It is not like bringing cattle to the factory because the trees will still be standing.  There is a desire, I am sure, to make the best use of the price when the licence is obtained, so a holder might decide to hold off for six months, a year or two years.  What we issue in the dashboard are the output figures for the Department in respect of licensing.  We do not make any predictions regarding when that timber will be harvested.  It is very likely that the timber for which we issue licences this year may not be harvested for three or four years.</p></speech>

That timber is not available, obviously.  The guts of 20 million cu. m over two years, if we go by the Department, has been put on the dashboard.  That is there.  Where is the timber?  Why is there a shortage if the Department states that there is all this licensing?</p></speech>

Price is obviously a key factor.  As I said, however, we do not make any predictions in terms of when the timber will come to market.  It is very likely that timber being harvested at some point this year was licensed two years ago, and it is the same with what we licence now.  It may also come to the market in two years' time.</p><p>Our focus is entirely on licensed output.  It is really up to the licence holder. </p></speech>

The planting target for Ireland for the four-year period from 2017 to 2020 was 31,140 ha.  To date the Department has licensed the planting of 15,109 ha.  That is less than 50% of the target.  There is a shortfall of 15,000 ha.  We have climate targets.  Farmers are being kicked around because of cows.  This system has failed over several years.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck, but with due respect to her, I do not buy what has been said about the habitats directive.  That directive was in force in 2011.  The Department has had the period since then to dot the "i"s and cross the "t"s.  There is no point in putting something in place in 2018 or 2019, when the horse has bolted.  This problem was already here.  I am not blaming the Minister of State but the Department she supervises has not addressed the issue.  We have to plant 8,000 ha in 2021.  How can we even hope to achieve that?  I have tallied the figures.  We would have to issue about 8,500 licences a year.  We cannot cater for our needs.  How does the Department intend to address this?</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State have faith in this Department?  Personnel have been in place looking at this for ten years.  The habitats directive was introduced in 2011.  It is there for everyone to see.  Departments were told about it.  I was not even in politics at the time and I knew about the 15 km rule.  This Department watched over this.  This is a mess and 12,000 jobs are at stake.  I like what the Minister of State said in her submission but it was aspirational.  She spoke about the future but did not address where we are now.  We are in a crisis.  What are we doing to solve this?  With the figures the Minister of State has seen, does she not think she needs to bring in new people to resolve these issues?</p></speech>

She acknowledges that there is a crisis and she has seen the interest in this issue in recent months.  It has been going on for some time but is now coming to a head.  This is a huge issue for farmers and foresters.  It is also a huge issue for companies like GP Wood, which employs 500 people in west Cork.  This firm is now forced to import timber and could have to lay off staff.  The Minister of State says she has looked at many single solutions.  I would like to ask several questions.  I will try to make them brief and to the point, because a lot of members want to comment.</p> <p>  The system must ensure that no farmer has to wait more than four months for a forestry licence, irrespective of the size of the application, as set out in the Forestry Act 2014.  Forest road, felling and thinning licence applications that have been in the system for more than four months should be approved automatically under an amnesty provision.  Would the Minister of State consider this?  She is looking for solutions.  These are the real solutions that might make a difference here.</p> <p>  Another solution would be to amend the Forestry Act 2014 to introduce exemptions for forest road and thinning operations.  These do not present a significant landscape change.  They present a low level of environmental risk.  I also call for the introduction of a cost-based planning support grant, as referenced in the Mackinnon report, to assist with increased costs and the requirements associated with applying for licences.  Finally, an independent project manager should be appointed within the Department to implement the operational changes recommended in the Mackinnon report and develop an appropriate and effective licensing system.  Can the Minister of State adopt some of those solutions?  We have to consider an amnesty if we hope to alleviate the present crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1661" speakername="Pippa Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#L03400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Several people have suggested such an amnesty, with a licence granted automatically if an application has not been processed in a certain period.  That would be illegal and deeply unjust to the process.  Unfortunately it cannot be done.  The Deputy referred to exemptions for thinning and forest roads.  This would depend on where the forest road goes.  That is why there is a licensing process.  The same applies to thinning.  Thinning a commercial forest can have an impact on the environment.  That is why a licensing regime is necessary.</p> <p>  I have indicated that I intend to make an announcement on the Mackinnon report.  I hope to name an independent chair in a matter of days.  We will work through the recommendations of the Mackinnon report.  I hope to work closely with the chair to decide on the best way to implement the report.  There are a lot of good points in it.  I look forward to that. </p></speech>

I would like to thank her for all she has done in recent months.  Knowing her, I can say that nobody is more passionate about resolving the crisis in forestry.</p><p>As a forester, the Minister of State is passionate about the sector.  As an environmentalist, she is also passionate about setting policy that will chart a better way forward.  That should be acknowledged.</p><p> The Minister of State referred to future policy in this area.  She should have an opportunity to elaborate on that.  She mentioned the national forestry programme.  Will she inform members of her thoughts on that as that would be beneficial for the committee?</p><p> On research available to the Department, up to this point research has generally been directed at maximising output and increment, which has been for very good reasons, but we are in the midst of a climate and biodiversity crisis.  Research should be focused in that direction.  Does the Minister of State have the necessary resources in her Department or does she intend putting the resources in place to ensure we have the right research in order that we can set policy in the right direction?</p></speech>

I am not quite a forester yet.  I am still a farmer with some trees but one never knows.  The commitments in the programme for Government, and I invite the committee to review them, are ambitious for forestry.  We have a forestry model that really is not working for everyone in this country.  Currently, it is not working for anyone but it is important that whatever we do from now on aims to achieve those ambitions in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  I did say during the debate on the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il that I was eager to set up a new forestry policy group.  The inaugural meeting of that group will take place this Thursday.  The group is made up of a broad number of stakeholders, including representatives from industry, the environment, agencies, farmers and communities.  It is to be hoped that will be the start of how we move forward with this.  The group has a great deal of work to do and the first stage is to get everyone engaging with it and to not polarise anybody, which could quite easily happen.  I have seen it happen in other groups.  Sometimes when we get farmers and environmentalists into a room, unless there is some decent structure to the meeting, it does not last long.  I hope to avoid such an occurrence.</p> <p>  I also made a commitment during the debate on the forestry Bill to improve public participation.  I referred to a new online forestry view or portal of which I have had the privilege of having a sneak preview.  That will be available within the next two weeks.  It will open up the public participation element not only for people who want to see where work forestry plans are going but for people to make submissions through it and for applicants to see how their applications are progressing.</p> <p>  On the research we might need as we move forward,I hope the forestry policy group will help in that respect and give direction to me and the Department as to where we should be going with forestry policy in this country.  There are some movements and we heard from a representative of Coillte earlier about Coillte nature and that direction.  We need more of that type of forestry in Ireland because it has to be appealing to communities at the end of the day.  We have seen the dissatisfaction among many.  Deputy Carthy referred to it on many occasions in debates he has had with me on it.  I am fully aware of that.  We have to bring everyone along with us.  While we have a slump in forestry currently, I would like to think we can move on from this in a positive, coherent and collective way and I look forward to that.</p></speech>

I call Senator Daly to be followed by Deputy Carthy and Senator Lombard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#M00400"><p>I will be as brief as possible.  I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her.  It is brilliant to see a fellow Senator from the Upper House in a ministerial role.  As she will have noted from previous contributions and our deliberations during the past week, the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; has been used and it has not been used loosely.  I conscious she inherited this issue.  I want her to outline some potential solutions or indicate how we will turn the corner, get this industry back on the road, save the 12,000 jobs that are at stake and meet the programme for Government afforestation target of 8,000 ha.</p> <p>  I was a member of the previous agriculture committee.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor was the former Minister of State, Andrew Doyle, and at that time the Mackinnon report was the holy grail.  I was a little taken aback that it was not referenced in the Minister of State's submission.  Is that indicative of the Department's stance on the Mackinnon report?  Has it been shelved and is it gathering dust?  I would have expected at least a reference to it in her submission.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State consider amending the 2014 Act to alleviate the pressure on the licence applications process and introduce a forestry licence whereby when an applicant applies for an afforestation licence initially, that licence in the context of a management plan would include provision for whatever roadways might be necessary in the future and for thinning and felling licences?  In other words, one licence would cover it all with a built-in workable management plan.  Also, what is her view on how to restore confidence in the sector?  We are talking about upping the hectares of forestry.  Whatever about Coillte, the farmers we expect to buy into that have lost confidence in the sector and will not be prepared to invest in it.</p> <p>  I have a few brief specific questions for Mr. Hayes.  I have asked this question previously and received various answers to it.  Will he categorically state the length of time on average it takes to process a licence in the Department?  I have heard of licence applications that have been with the Department for up to three years.  I was told previously the delay was caused by an ecologist not being available to the Department.  I am aware of an applicant who applied for an NIS and their licence application has been with the Department for more than two years later with no sign of it being issued.  Will Mr. Hayes give a definitive specific target on the average processing time for a licence?</p> <p>  I also seek clarification on another matter.  When an application has to be referred to other State bodies, be it the local authority, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, An Taisce or some other body, I have been told it is sent to one body, and when it replies, the application is then sent to another body.  Why can an application not be referred to all State bodies at the same time if multiple bodies are involved?  Common sense would dictate that the application should be referred to all those bodies at the same time as that would shorten the processing time involved, rather than having the practice of sending it to Joe today, and on receipt of a reply from him, sending it to Pat, and on receipt of a reply from him, sending it to Billy. I would like specific answers to those questions.  I would also like to hear the Minister of State's view on restoring confidence in the sector to get buy-in from potential foresters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#M00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here and for her engagement.  As she mentioned, we have had a number of engagements and I must say she comes across as a very genuine and nice person.  I am just not sure if the job she is in is the place for a nice person.  She acknowledged forestry policy has not been working for anybody.  She mentioned the industry and communities.  Others mentioned sawmills and the other areas.  The Minister of State said that the policy is not even working for her Department.  Regardless of whether she said that, everybody else she mentioned lays the blame for the disaster that is Irish forestry at the hands of her Department.  A good starting point for her would be to recognise there are systemic failures in the forestry section of the Department.  That must be the starting point.  If she starts anywhere else and unless corrective action is taken, mistakes will be repeated.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State indicate what directions are being taken in her Department that would not be happening unless she ensured they were being taken and which her officials have been perhaps reluctant to take?  That is an important point.  The questions facing the sector have been well aired and I will not repeat them.  However, fundamental issues within the forestry sector need to be addressed.</p><p>I would welcome the Minister of State's commentary as to how she intends to address them.<br/><br/>We have talked about the proliferation of Sitka plantations.  We had Coillte before the committee.  Unfortunately, we did not have time to hear its representatives' answer to Senator Boylan's contribution.  The biggest forester in the country, the State-owned body, exempts itself from diversification of forestry so it has whole-scale Sitka plantations in replanting terms.  It is crazy stuff and sets all the wrong examples.  We have seen the backlash and the frustration that have been caused and we have talked about this in the context of a Bill that has been brought forward by Deputy Martin Kenny, which, unfortunately, the Minister of State opposes.  That was a very bad start for her.  As recently as last weekend we saw landslides associated with bad decisions that were implemented in the overall forestry policy.  Above all, I have in front of me a headline from <i>The Irish Times</i>that was repeated all over the world: &quot;Irish forestry 'net emitter of greenhouse gases'.&quot;  We cannot even get forestry right in respect of the provision of an environmental benefit.  If that does not spell out that we are on the wrong track, I do not know what does.  A forestry policy must work.  It has to be farmer- and community-led.  Forestry is being handed over to corporations, essentially.  In counties such as Leitrim we see an effective land grab that is forcing an end to traditional family farming in that county, and we can now see that that is developing otherwise.  I would like to hear again the Minister of State's proposals on ensuring that forestry is genuinely farm- and community-led, with real input and a buy-in from farmers.  How will she make that happen?  I am not talking about Mickey Mouse consultations.  I am talking about real buy-in.<br/><br/>I am trying to avoid the Chairman's eye.  The Minister of State mentioned on a number of occasions that she will make an announcement on Thursday.  That is the absolutely typical ploy used to entrap Ministers.  &quot;Here is a set of public relations engagements for you, Minister, while we carry on and do the real business.&quot;  If the Minister of State is serious about bringing forward proposals, this, the agriculture committee, is the perfect place for her to have done so.  Here she is talking to the people who represent those who are at the coalface of this.  Instead she is trying to give an exclusive interview to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>and getting her photo opportunity.  That is messing.  I urge her to get serious about this.  I have no doubt but that she is genuine about it, but she is playing with a very weak hand with the Department she has been handed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#N00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I realise that the issue she is trying to deal with is very large and very complex in so many ways.  Before her arrival Coillte gave a presentation which stated that it needs 2.3 million cu. m of forestry to go through the appeals process in the next seven weeks.  Coillte says it has only 16% of what is required.  It did not have its usual auction in October.  The industry is in crisis because it does not have the ability to plan ahead.  Is the Minister of State confident that the appeals process can deliver 2.3 million cu. m of forestry in the next seven weeks?  If not, what does she think the plan B will be going forward?  If there is a plan B, what will that mean for the industry and how will it affect the people working in sawmills, the people cutting and drawing the timber and the end user?  I often say one cannot get a six-by-three to build a shed in west Cork today.  It just does not exist.  Four different shipments of timber are coming in from Scotland into Passage West to keep a sawmill in west Cork going.  That is not sustainable.  How can we ensure we have a credible industry with the current number of licences and the level of cutting?</p> <p>  Would the Minister of State be open to the suggestion that there be a monthly update from her office to this committee?  I notice she has given the dashboard in the past four weeks, which has been in some way helpful, but more detail is required.  In fairness to Mr. Hayes, he mentioned that even if one gets a licence, it could be cut over a period of time.  We need more information to get a real, fact-based understanding of where the timber is, how much timber is in the system and how much timber is licensed and not cut.  Issues such as those need to be looked at.  The primary issue is the statement given by Coillte.  That was a really significant figure.  Do we have the capabilities in the next seven weeks to produce that?  If not, how will the industry survive next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1661" speakername="Pippa Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#N00300"><p>I will try to be succinct but detailed enough.  I thank Senator Paul Daly for his contribution.  Yes, we need to find the solutions, and that comes through engagement with those across the sector.  Again, it is not just about the industry.  We are in this problem because of the way the licensing process was working and the challenges it has faced in that environmental legislation has us where we are.  Charging on through to get licences rushed through as quickly as possible so we have all the timber does not solve the problem.  The problem is deep-seated.  I agree that we have to get confidence back, not only in the sector itself and the supply chain that it supplies but also that farmers have the confidence to plant.  I know their confidence has been bruised.  I get plenty of calls from farmers who are waiting for their licences and wondering what is the point, and that is not good.  We do not need that.  There are other planting options for farmers which we probably have not teased out enough in previous policy and which might be more attractive to farmers.  Those options will not only deliver an income for them but also deliver for our climate and, potentially, our biodiversity targets.  There are farmers who want to plant legacy woodlands on their farms for their grandchildren.  They do not all want to plant Sitka spruce or commercial forestry.  Some people just want to have a nice area that they can look at, develop and grow.  Other farmers might want to get into agroforestry, which has not been looked at at all in any great detail in this country.  There is great scope there.  There are a few examples of agroforestry around the country.  One can run cattle through such land.  There are trees in the fields but one still has a normal farming livelihood with it, and there are co-benefits of that.  Planting along rivers and riparian margin planting are another way of supporting farmers and their farms.  There are options there, and some of them will provide some of the solutions to our afforestation targets.</p> <p>  Somebody mentioned the Mackinnon report.  It is not shelved.  I thought long and hard about the report because I knew there were concerns with it and knew there was much pressure from one side for the report but not so much from the other side.  As I said, I recommend people read it thoroughly because it is quite broad in its reach.  It certainly is not shelved.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Carthy, it is my policy group.  I have set it up.  It has not been set up for me by my Department.  It is my group, I pick the people on it and they will be announced on Thursday also.  It is my direction, and I hope I will bring that direction to the Department.  If it has not been there in the past, I cannot speak for previous Ministers or administrations.  I am "enthusiastic", although that is not the right word because it sounds too flippant.  I am determined and I want to fix this.  If I set my mind on getting something fixed, I will work as hard as I can to fix it.  This involves engaging with people and also with politicians because we get all the representations from all the various sectors on the ground.  We simply have to fix this and bring about a confidence in the sector that we can do so.  We must ensure that the 2.3 million cu. m that Coillte needs is not all stuck in appeals.  Am I confident we can get all that to Coillte in seven weeks?  No, probably not, but we have to signal what we can do.  What is important is the confidence of knowing that we are working and that more and more is coming online.  That is what we are looking at.  The more we can get online and the more we have sight of more timber coming on stream, the more that is a confidence in its own right.  I agree that we are importing too much at the moment.  It is not sustainable.</p> <p>  I was not quite sure what Senator Lombard meant.  On what matter would he like a monthly update?</p><p>We need to get clarity on what is going through the system.  We have got the dashboard in recent weeks, which has been very helpful.  With no offence to the Department that is nothing more than a faint shadow of what the Department got.  In a report coming to this committee it is important to inform us of the licensing process and the timber involved so we can get a complete run all the way through.  If there is movement, then we are going to see the movement.  It is the information that we need.  We need a line of information coming directly to us.  That would be very helpful, not alone for the members here, but for the industry and for the general public who want to know exactly what is happening with the level of planting, the licences being granted and what they are for.  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the issue of whether the licences are for thinnings, fen licences or roads.  To a degree, all the information is there but for the next 18 months we must have that information on a regular basis.</p></speech>

We aim to do it that way.  I would like to think the vast majority do.  There are a lot of moving parts to an individual licence, between archaeology, ecology and other matters.  It is possible that between the jigs and the reels there may be individual licences where they do not all go on the same day, but the policy at least is that where more than one external body is to be consulted on a licence, that they are consulted at the same time.  Sometimes applications can come back from external bodies that require further work and information as well, but the baseline policy is clear on our part.</p> <p>  On the average length of time for a licence, if members look at the Department's website tomorrow morning they will see all the licences that we have issued since the start of the week.  On that, they will see licences where the application came in two or three months ago but, equally, they will see licences where the application came in two years ago.</p></speech>

We fully acknowledge that.  As the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, indicated, the aim very much has to be to squash that range to the closest possible average.  I will get the committee members an average figure but I do not have it to hand.  We are very clear in terms of the policy, targets and goals, which are to drive that down and to meet the three and four-month targets.</p></speech>

The Forestry Act specifies that felling licences are to be provided in four months, but we are clearly not meeting that.  We do not claim to.  We are holding our hands up.  There will be individual licences that meet it, but it is not the majority and it needs to be the majority.  I think the reasons have been given for that.  That is what we are aiming for and that is our stated goal.</p></speech>

I will be very brief because many of the issues have been raised already about the crisis in the industry.  My first question is in respect of the changes introduced by SI 417/2020, which relates to fees for access to applications, appeals and communications in respect of licences.  Given that the Minister of State has confirmed today that the portal is going to go up in two weeks, why would fees be introduced for access to applications when that information will be available on the portal?</p> <p>  I do not know whether the Minister of State or her official will want to respond to my second question.  Who gave the advice on whether the fees were compliant with Article 6 of the Aarhus Convention?  We have seen the trouble caused for other Ministers where officials were interpreting the law rather than getting the advice from the Attorney General's office.  Was it the Attorney General who advised that the fees were compliant with the Aarhus Convention or was it the case that the officials interpreted the convention and said that they were compliant?  Why would access be charged for applications when the portal will provide the information?</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy mentioned the fact that the report on managed forest land in Ireland is now a net emitter of carbon.  I refer to a response to a parliamentary question by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who cited that the reason forestry should remain tax exempt is because of the environmental sustainability from commercial occupation of woodland.  How does the Minister intend to square that circle?  If forestry is a net emitter of carbon but it is also getting tax breaks, that is not a very good deal for the public purse.  The report that went to the Commission only deals with managed forestry.  The implication is that it becomes a carbon sink if we give tax exemptions to large investment companies, as is the case in Leitrim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#O00900"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for her presentation.  I wish her the best of luck in her post.  The Mackinnon report suggested that the Government has not shown any great interest in forestry.  The programme for Government is heavy on environmental and climate change objectives but there is a lack of attention being given to the commercial aspect of forestry.  Is there a reason for that being left out?  The Minister of State also referred to the programme for Government target of 8,000 ha as aspirational, when it should be achievable if the system was operating efficiently.</p> <p>  In terms of the financial cost of the Natura impact statement, NIS, and the need to apply for licences, is it not possible that tree felling, afforestation and roads could all come under one licence?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Hayes on an issue Deputy Fitzmaurice raised earlier.  Could he tell us the specific number of applications that are currently in the backlog?  I find it very strange that he has come to a meeting of the committee saying he does not know where the figures are that were sought by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  They are on the monthly reports of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's forestry division.  The current backlog is 2,056 for tree felling licences, as was stated.  That equates to 7.1 million tonnes of timber, which is two years' worth of production.  It would also mean that the backlog is higher than the widely publicised 2,500.  The backlog for afforestation licences is 1,122, which equates to 9,400 ha.  The backlog for applications for forest roads is 738, which equates to 302 km.  The Department keeps telling us about 2019 figures and claps itself on the back because we are reaching quotas.  If one goes back three years, 6,500 licences were issued.  At this stage in 2020, the Department is only doing half what it did previously.</p> <p>  I have been contacted by various stakeholders in the sector and they said the inspectors are referring 80% to 90% of the applications to the ecology section, even the native woodland applications.  Does that mean too many NIS reports are being requested?  I have also been told that the ecology section in particular is slow.  In one case, the NIS was submitted in April and nothing has yet been heard back.  Could Mr. Hayes outline the problem within the ecology section, the number of staff processing the reports and how many additional staff are in place?  I will leave it at that.  Ash dieback was covered before.</p></speech>

I have six more speakers and I want them to be able to put their questions.  They will have to accept the answers in writing from the Department as we will not have time to get them now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020111700002#O01100"><p>I will be as brief as I can.  I thank the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and her officials for attending and I wish her well. From people contacting me I can see that there is a sustained programme of clawing funding back from people who have planted forestry.  People who planted ten or 20 years ago are receiving letters from the Department demanding repayment of funds over alleged over-claims.  Does the Minister of State think it is reasonable to do that, considering that many of the reclaims are arising due to a new mapping system that is available to the Forest Service that was not available 20 years ago?  As she is aware, this is causing negative publicity and stress to the farming community.  Is it true that if a farmer wants to plant 5 acres of land in County Kerry and he or she is within 15 km from a specific protection area or a special area of conservation, which is the case in nearly every inch of Kerry, unless he or she spends more than &euro;1,500 on a Natura impact statement, the application will be sitting in the ecology section of the Forestry Service for two years before a decision is made?</p><p>Could the witnesses inform the committee as to the number of files in the ecology department of the forest service, and the number in archaeology department?  Why can forest entrances not be treated like agricultural entrances?  It is fair to say that the new single consent system is not working with regard to forest road approvals.  Some councils are looking for extraordinary bonds to be put in place by forest owners prior to the commencement of work.  I give the example of a council that looked for a cash bond of &euro;240,000 before works could commence.  The forest service and some councils look for sight lines which would be more in keeping with an industrial factory, rather than a forest entrance.</p><p> Take a typical application, for example.  It goes from the ecology department to the archaeology department and then to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Are these steps taking too long?  Could these steps not run simultaneously?  As has been outlined, there are some applications with the forest service for many years.  In Kerry, as the witnesses know from their records, most roads being built can be dug out of clay.  In other words, the material is in the ground nearby.  We can dig off the bog, dig out the clay, make a road and put 804 stone on top of it.  This road is perfectly suitable for purpose.  I remind the Minister of State that this is how the roads were made for many years.  There was no such thing as importing material.  One actually went into an area.  I am talking about local authority roads, not forestry roads.  We dug out clay, we made roads and we put tar and chip on top of them, although for many years, there was only gravel on top of them.</p><p> I ask Mr. Hayes to address the following matter.  Inspectors who are listening to me right now on their computers are going around inspecting roads.  I ask these inspectors the following question.  For God's sake, where is the common sense in the context of a forestry road of telling a person to dig out the bog and import 804 broken or crushed stone, where there is a depth of forestry that might be as high as this committee room, or maybe higher?  First, consider the damage to the environment of going to a quarry 20 or 30 miles away to fill up lorries with stone and then to fill in a depth of this room and to cover it with 804 stone.  There is no common sense in that.  I am not directing this question to the Minister of State or Mr. Hayes but to the inspectors who are at home listening to me.  Where is the common sense in this process?  The available grant will not sustain this.  Forestry roads will not be built if inspectors continue to ask people to do this.  </p><p> I want to say to the Minister of State, Mr. Hayes and to other individuals who I will not name because, as the Chairman knows, I am too polite that there are people who over the past ten years have taken over roles in the forest service and that we were planting between 10,000 ha and 12,000 ha of forestry each year.  This is down to 2,000 ha to 3,000 ha under their watch.  I am asking those people and Mr. Hayes the following question.  How can anyone in the forest service say that he or she has done a good job if he or she has seen us go from a high figure to a low one.  They have run it into the ground.  The Minister of State knows I am not blaming her.</p><p> Our adorable foresters, many of whom are old and for whom I worked for years, are at home watching this committee.  They are ashamed at where we are today.  The Minister of State said a while ago that officials are not happy with the situation.  I disagree with her.  I would say there are officials in her Department who are extremely happy because they have driven us to where we are today.  They put us here through gobbledegook and nonsense.  Mr. Hayes said, "We hold our hands up" and "We are where we are."  They would want to be holding their hands and their legs up.  Many people would want to hang their heads in shame as a result of what they have done.  There are people, who know who they are, who have brought us to where we are today and it cannot be allowed to continue.  We will not allow it to continue.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and her statement.  I concur with other speakers on the lack of reference to the Mackinnon report.  However, I acknowledge the Minister of State has held up the report and recommended we all read it.  I have read it, and it makes interesting findings and recommendations.  The report states that in 2019 almost half the applications took more than 99 days to decide.  It states also that "concerns that bureaucracy and regulation has taken precedence over enabling woodland expansion", that "strong concerns were expressed about the performance of the Department and the quality of customer service" and that "KPIs need to be developed essentially around timescales for decision making".  I welcome the fact the Minister of State has put in place a project management board and that 16 full-time equivalent ecologists and ten additional forestry inspectors were appointed.  That is a move in the right direction.  The Minister of State is going to initiate the forestry policy group and has hinted that Ms Jo O'Hara will be announced as the person appointed to oversee the implementation of the Mackinnon report.</p> <p>  Will there be a possibility for the forestry policy group to interact with the project management group and the chair of the implementation group in a seamless way?  This would impact cases such as those highlighted at today's meeting, where there is an undue length of time or obstacles are put in the way of a seamless process.  Will there be a mechanism to enable the triumvirate of Mackinnon, the project management board and the forestry policy group to deal with every issue that arises, and that a process will be put in place to take seriously the issues we heard about today in order that there will be a result?  We must be output driven and must see results.  That is the only question I have today.</p></speech>

We understand and are familiar with the contents of the Mackinnon report.  We were hoping that the Minister of State would say, and perhaps she will say it on Thursday, that the report will be fully implemented.  This is what needs to happen.  The Minister of State and I are in the same constituency, Laois-Offaly.  People there see that the forestry sector is on its knees.  Everyone in this sector is affected from sawmills to harvesting to haulage.  We are going to see more job losses if solid action is not taken very soon.</p> <p>  Is the Minister of State aware that the cost to engage specialists, such as ecologists, archaeologists, engineers, hydrologists, etc., can be between &euro;1,000 to &euro;5,000?  This is not sustainable or fair, particularly to small landowners or participants.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State consider extending the 2004 Act to introduce new exemptions?  This was mentioned already in terms of forest road construction and thinning.  Farmers who planted land in good faith need to be supported when acts of God occur, such as frost, wind or pest damage.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to the reintroduction of the reconstitution scheme?  </p> <p>  My final question is directed to Mr. Hayes.  Last week I heard the Department forcefully defend forestry for the first time, following misrepresentation on the calculation of carbon storage by trees.  Why has the senior inspectorate of the forest service not defended the forestry sector?  Instead it has allowed the industry to be attacked, constantly, by individuals and other Departments and NGOs.</p></speech>

Serious questions need to be asked of senior management.  If one commits manslaughter, one would only get seven years, or one may not even get seven years.  I know of a man who reared the finest family of daughters but his application is in the system for seven years.  I have 27 applications from a small forestry consultancy firm.</p><p>Most of them go back to 2018 and some to 2017, and one fellow has been waiting for seven years.  Surely those kinds of people deserve an amnesty now.  In the current system, there is no timeline.  We in the Rural Independent Group fought very hard to provide timelines for applications and for freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Even Deputy Kehoe admits there should be a timeline.</p><p> It has been brought to my attention that there is a boatload of timber coming from Scotland to the value of &euro;230,000.  That is a loss of income to small Irish farmers.  The Minister of State needs to pull out all the stops.  This cannot and will not continue.  The fellows who have presided over it will be paid, along with their pensions.  I am sorry to see what is happening to people in rural areas and people who were depending on this.  We talk about felling licences but the Department gave these people grants to plant forestry and premiums each year.  There should have been an expectation that they would at least be able to cut and sell it and build a road to take it out.  Those forests were planted 20 or 30 years ago.  We are now making laws retrospectively to stop them removing or selling the timber they had expected to sell.  We talked about Coillte getting felling licences, but this is the company's second or third time-----</p></speech>

We have to do something about the applications that have been in the system for two, three and up to seven years.  I call on the Minister of State to examine the matter.  I do not blame her.  She has been in the job only three or four months and we will give her every chance in the world, but we are telling her how it is.  It is very wrong to think what is happening to people who use wheelchairs, who want to cut their bit of timber and to improve their house by making it more accessible for the man who planted the timber 25 or 30 years ago.  We need to look after those people and we will be in the House day after day fighting for them.  What is happening is very wrong, as it is that people in the Department who are paid high wages have let this country go the way it has in respect of forestry.</p></speech>

Our purpose as a committee is to get things right and there is no vendetta against anyone.  We want a thriving forestry sector.

Deputy Conway-Walsh is taking his place and she has received notice of that.  Members are reminded to use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks to supplement regular sanitation.  I ask members swapping seats to clean down their desks and chairs.  I also remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting because they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when they are in silent mode.</p> <p>  The draft minutes of the meeting of 10 November have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#A00400"><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Foley, the Minister of State with special responsibility for special needs and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, and the officials from the Department.  The Minister and the Minister of State may call on their officials to speak briefly for clarification during the meeting where a specific or technical point arises.  The officials can clarify issues for the committee.  Any follow-up questions should be put to the Minister or the Minister of State because they are the accountable persons before the committee.  I am aware that a wide range of issues will be the subject of discussion today.  If necessary, further and more detailed information on certain issues raised can be sent to the clerk of the committee for circulation to members.  The committee and I want to assist the witnesses in every possible way to ensure that this meeting is beneficial for members and witnesses and that we have a good and productive session.</p> <p>  I ask officials to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their presentations to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If their statements, therefore, are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I now ask the witnesses to brief the committee on the key priorities of the Department, specifically regarding: the effect of Covid-19 on special needs provision; educational disadvantage; classroom sizes and current pupil-teacher ratios; children and mental health; the 2020 leaving certificate calculated grades and the 2021 leaving certificate preparations; digital learning; ensuring that schools are open in a safe and sustainable way and the circumstances around the recall of hand sanitising products from some schools.  The format of the meeting will be that I will invite the witnesses to make brief opening statements, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member will have six minutes and that will include the reply from the Minister, the Minister of State or both.  I will cut off contributions after six minutes, and I ask that any further information then be forwarded to the clerk of the committee.  As the witnesses will probably be aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The meeting will conclude at 3.35 p.m.</p> <p>  I ask the other witnesses to turn on their cameras now and ensure that they are available so that the members will know who they are.  I call on the Minister to make her opening statement</p><p>I invite the Minister, Deputy Foley, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to appear before it.  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, as well as a number of departmental officials who can help support our engagement.</p> <p>  Last Thursday was my first appearance before the select committee and there was discussion about splitting the financial allocations between my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  In addition, officials of my Department appeared as witnesses before this committee on the subject of the leaving certificate and I am sure we will touch on these matters again today.</p> <p>  The programme for Government sets out immediate priorities for the Department of Education and, on taking up my role as Minister, the Government moved quickly to achieve the reopening of the school sector, to provide an expanded summer programme for eligible students and to complete the calculated grades process to issue results and allow the 2020 leaving certificate students to progress.</p> <p>  We have hit significant milestones since the publication of the programme for Government.  We have seen over 12,000 students with special education needs avail of this year&rsquo;s summer programme and 9,000 avail of the summer programme for DEIS schools &ndash; both significantly ahead of previous years; had almost 1 million students and nearly 100,000 school staff return to their classrooms, playgrounds and school campuses in late August and early September; issued calculated grade results to over 60,000 students, allowing this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate cohort to progress to the next stage of their lives; and reached agreement with the representatives of school secretaries and caretakers on an understanding for a pathway to progress the issues before the WRC, comprising several key strands.  There is continued engagement with stakeholders and enhanced support responding to the needs of our school communities.  Schools successfully returned following the mid-term break against a backdrop of level 5 restrictions being in place and yesterday, 16 November, the leaving certificate 2020 examinations began.</p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to education has been underlined by this year&rsquo;s budget for the Department of Education, which is just short of &euro;9 billion.  This budget will facilitate key actions, such as a reduction in the average pupil-teacher ratio at primary level from 26:1 to 25:1; increased numbers of SNAs; continued Covid-19 financial supports for schools, with &euro;232 million provided in 2021 for the remainder of the 2020-21 school year; and a significant capital programme of over &euro;740 million into 2021.</p> <p>  What has been achieved since July is a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone in the schools system and in our school communities across the country.  We could take it for granted, but it is worth acknowledging that we are all working differently now from in previous years and currently living and working under level 5 restrictions.  In a world that feels so different in many ways from the previous normal, the benefits to the students and wider school communities of having classroom learning functioning as normally as possible can be seen as a signal of hope for society as a whole.  Decisions taken by the Government have been taken to support school communities, and while all concerned can be justifiably proud of what has been achieved we have to meet the challenges that continue to be faced.  We are best placed to meet those challenges by continuing to engage with each other and bringing our different perspectives, but with a common goal in mind.  We have seen tremendous flexibility and responsiveness across the system.</p> <p>  The Department is in ongoing discussion and engagement with the partners in education and school communities.  In response to concerns raised by education partners relating to contact tracing and the public health response to positive cases in schools, my Department and the Department of Health have put in place enhanced schools teams.  These are dedicated resources and supports for school leaders where a positive case of Covid-19 has been identified.  These teams are led by public health professionals and are further supported by members of my Department.</p> <p>  I appreciate that this is a challenging time for all in the school community, staff and students alike.  The Department has sought to bolster well-being supports through a number of initiatives.  While much support has been provided to support teacher well-being through Spectrum.Life and other departmental support services, it was agreed that additional support for school leader well-being might be valued and a focus is being brought to this area now by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, with the professional development service for teachers, PDST, and teacher education centres.</p> <p>  While most students are happy to be back at school, some students have experienced anxiety and concern regarding Covid-19.  For this reason, the Department has created 17 additional NEPS psychologist posts for schools as well as 120 whole-time equivalent guidance counsellor positions.  NEPS psychologists have been asked to support with reluctant school attendance behaviour, although the number of cases emerging is fewer than had been initially anticipated.  NEPS psychologists are also focusing on supporting the inclusion and participation of children with special and additional needs through their casework and consultation service.  Furthermore, a well-being toolkit has been provided to teachers as further support with user-friendly materials to promote student well-being in the classroom.</p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s engagement with the committee is particularly timely given that the Department is currently engaged in consultation towards the development of a three-year statement of strategy for 2021 to 2023.  The strategy will be accompanied by an annual work programme which will contain significant actions against which we can measure our progress.  A wide range of submissions and responses have been received, including from the general public, key stakeholders and other Departments.  Our new statement of strategy will build on the long-term strategic priorities for primary and post-primary education in the context of a fundamentally altered operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  We will continue to manage the pace and sequence of change in partnership and consultation with key stakeholders.</p> <p>  The priorities set out in the programme for Government closely reflect these longer-term strategic priorities, including improving standards of teaching, learning and assessment, inclusion and meeting the needs of those at risk of educational disadvantage and continuously improving the quality of the learning experience and outcomes for all learners.  I would welcome the committee's views on these priorities, which can help to feed into the work on the statement of strategy.  I look forward to the discussion with committee members on these and other matters.</p></speech>

It is important that they remain open.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss the testing and tracing.  Can the Minister confirm that the school principals are being told not to tell anybody when somebody tests positive, including the teacher who is teaching that child?  Teachers tell me they are being told to switch off the apps on their telephones because they are deemed by the app to be a close contact or else they are told to leave their telephones at home.  Does the Minister agree with this?  What does the tracing entail for schools?  What duration or proximity is being looked at in terms of somebody being a close contact?</p></speech>

It is a recognition of the invaluable work that is conducted by the public health sector, but it also offers an opportunity to public health teams to be supported by staff in the Department of Education.  That is in response to requests to be supportive of public health.  In terms of any adjudication of a case within a school or a child or a member of staff being impacted by Covid-19, that adjudication is strictly and only conducted by public health and nobody else.  There is-----</p></speech>

Is the Minister concerned that it is creating an ethos of secrecy not only in the school but also in the community, where there are vacuums of information that are then being filled by untruths or inaccurate information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#B00700"><p>It is very important that any decisions relating to public health in the school sector or in wider society are made by public health professionals.  For that reason, and with the support of the partners in education, school teams are public-health led.  No adjudication as regards what should happen in the school environment is being placed on the shoulders of any school principal or member of the management of a school.  It is important that the expertise and professionalism of those in public health are utilised.  It is not appropriate for the Department of Education or anyone in the public sector to tell public health how to do its job.  Those people do their job because they are the experts in the area of public health.  That is what is happening in every sector in society and I would not expect it to be done differently in the school environment.</p></speech>

What if that teacher shared a household with high-risk family members?  Is it right that they are not told they are a close contact of the student involved?</p></speech>

That is what we do in every environment and I expect that that would be the same in the school environment.  I reiterate that at no stage did any principal or member of school management wish to have the burden of making a public health adjudication placed upon them.  For that reason, it is public health making the adjudication and no-one else within the school environment.  That is practised everywhere so it is practised in schools.</p></speech>

Who is telling them to switch off their phones so that they are not continuously bleeping if there are students within the school with confirmed cases?  Neither I nor the Minister would be told to switch off our apps.  Is it right they are being told to switch them off, that they are not a close contact or that they are not given the information that may affect their own lives, health and well-being?</p></speech>

When a situation arises in a school, however, they come to the school and evaluate the entire situation and make a judgment.  They utilise everything and all information that is at their disposal, including the app.</p></speech>

The decisions on public health and what should and should not operate within a school are made by public health and only by public health.  That was the process agreed by the partners in education and is the agreed process both in school and outside the school environment.  I believe that that is what is happening elsewhere and it is what should happen in schools as well.  Public health has the experience, the expertise and the professionalism and it is appropriate that they would make the decisions as regards-----</p></speech>

I wish the over 2,500 leaving certificate students sitting the written exams well.  It is fantastic.  I wish the same to 60,000 students who received calculated grades.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the Minister and Minister of State, the Department, teachers and parents for coming together and getting over 1 million students back to school, it is phenomenal.  In my own are of east County Galway and County Roscommon I have spoken to principals and teachers and am aware that there is anxiety, particularly about overcrowding.  On the 25:1 pupil-teacher ratio in schools, if I am correct we are looking at over 1,065 teachers being hired and of those 400 will be in special education.  How many of those teachers are in place or what is the timeline for when they will be?  I am aware of another challenge from our own school out in Creagh, near Ballinasloe.  It has 28 to 29 pupils per classroom.  Where is the space going to be found for these students and teachers?  We in Ballinasloe are the only ones in County Galway with a primary school at DEIS level 1.  The pupil-teacher ratio change did not apply to DEIS schools.  They have a lower ratio to begin with but will these schools be considered for the support and help they need, especially when dealing with children with high levels of complex needs?</p> <p>  On disadvantage, community and support groups across the country are seeing a huge need for food packs to families.  I am particularly interested in the school meals programme.  I am aware that this is cross-departmental and involves the Department of Social Protection as well as the social inclusion unit of the Department of Education.  What steps are being taken here?  I am thinking in particular of secondary schools in DEIS areas or Pobal deprivation areas that are seeing huge need from their students for lunches, breakfasts and so on.</p> <p>  Principals are at breaking point.  The Minister mentioned teacher well-being and well-being supports in her opening statement.  I am very happy to see that.  What other administrative supports are being put in place to support principals in this really stressful and challenging time?</p> <p>  I ask also about the roll-out of the school inclusion project.</p></speech>

At DEIS band 1, where it is currently at 24:1, it will reduce by one to 23:1.  On the junior and the vertical schools, it is at 20:1 on the junior level and at 22:1 on the vertical level.  As I confirmed last week, a package of measures is being put in place for DEIS schools and consideration of a reduction will also apply there.  The finer detail of that entire DEIS package will be announced imminently.  I cannot give a specific date but we are working on that.</p></speech>

It is a cross-departmental initiative with the Department of Social Protection.  It is a programme of which I am a huge fan.  I am hugely supportive of getting the maximum roll-out and take-up of it.</p> <p>  On teacher well-being, considerable resources have been put in place to acknowledge the burden that has been placed, as the Senator mentioned, on principals in the first instance.  For that reason an additional day is being provided for teaching principals.  There are other measures in place.  Spectrum.Life has been employed to offer resources and support to teachers on the ground.  We are also working towards a webinar that will facilitate school leaders.  I should acknowledge that in excess of 17,000 members of school communities engaged in a previous health and well-being webinar.  That is a facility that is available to the entire school community, not just one particular sector.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the impact of the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio on school facilities.  I am very conscious of that but there has been a huge push toward the reduction of the ratio because it can only advantage the pupils and indeed the staff as well.  There is a very substantial build programme moving ahead this year in spite of Covid.  There will be &euro;740 million spent on additional accommodation.  Substantial work was already done in schools by school communities in terms of accessing additional space within the school, which is terrific.  The minor works grant facilitated quite an amount of that and another allocation of &euro;55 million, split between primary and secondary schools, will be made towards the end of December.</p><p>I am conscious of the need for additional accommodation.  We are working towards that.  It is very positive that we will be looking at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio. </p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, might like to take the question on the school inclusion model.</p></speech>

Special schools have an enhanced pupil-teacher ratio.  There are about three medical special schools attached to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  There are 114 schools for children with special needs.</p> <p>  Regarding the school inclusion model, the World Health Organization has always said that schools are best placed to have an inclusive education model because they already have a management structure in place.  This is the very first budget in which we are in a position to roll the model out nationally.  We ran a pilot in two community health organisation areas.  We will now be in a position to implement the model in three.  This is a tailored wraparound suite of therapeutic supports for children with special needs, including occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and crisis behaviour practitioners.  It is really about putting the child at the centre of education.</p></speech>

We heard from them last week.  They are becoming regular features here.  I will use my time productively.  There are four or five issues on which I would like to touch base.  Talking about an ethos of secrecy in schools is not helpful or welcome.  We all know this is a difficult time for schools, principals and people working in schools.  Rather than using my time to point fingers or pigeonhole people, I would like to make a much broader contribution.</p> <p>  First, we unanimously welcome the reopening of schools.  In other parts of the world schools and schoolchildren are not as fortunate.  That must be pointed out at every opportunity.</p> <p>  I would like to discuss IT in schools.  In my 15 years as a teacher I found that broadband or internet capacity varied greatly from one school to another.  We have to consider rolling out community broadband initiatives in our schools against the worst-case scenario of further difficulties because of Covid-19 next year.  I would welcome the Minister's comment on the possibility of community broadband initiatives based in schools.  I know broadband has already been rolled out in some schools. </p> <p>  I welcome the news on school secretaries.  Many in my own party have championed this issue.  Could the Minister comment on pay and conditions for special needs assistants, SNAs?  Will that be addressed in the coming years?</p> <p>  I refer also to the school building programme.  The additional funding for capital programmes is very welcome.  It highlights a degree of ambition.  The education and training board in my constituency of Cork North-Central acknowledges that we are in need of another school in suburban east Cork.  I will use this opportunity to mention once again St. Gabriel's Special School, which I mentioned last week.  The board of management there has a new chairman.  People from the Department of Education need to go down there as a matter of urgency and see the conditions for themselves.</p> <p>  Like previous speakers, I would like to refer to the pupil-teacher ratio.  Our greatest tool in the battle against Covid-19 is keeping class numbers down.  Consideration should be given to employing teachers on temporary or part-time contracts for the duration of Covid-19 if doing so could further reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  If a package of additional funding for schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme is being formulated, I hope that will considered as a short-term measure.</p> <p>  Finally, I must mention school transport again.  This is my hobby-horse.  The Minister said last week that the terms of reference of a review are being drawn up.  I want to keep this on the agenda and I hope the Department will follow through on that front.  I would appreciate any comment on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#D00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He asked about the provision of IT and other services to schools.  The positive news is that our schools are up and running and have remained open even under level 5 restrictions.  Notwithstanding that, there is absolutely a requirement for investment in IT.  The last five years have seen investment of more than &euro;210 million.  This year two tranches of &euro;50 million have been paid out.  The last tranche will be issued near the end of the year.</p> <p>  Connectivity in our schools is recognised as hugely important.  Some 700 of our primary schools are involved in the national broadband plan.  We are trying to roll that out as expeditiously as possible.  I refer also to the successful schools connect programme.  There is a body of work to be done on connectivity.  We are hugely determined to ensure it is rolled out as quickly as possible.  High-speed broadband is available in all our second level schools and is being utilised very well.  I take the Deputy's comments on board.</p> <p>  Developments on the school building programme are very positive.  An investment of more than &euro;740 million is envisaged.  We are looking at a variety of projects for next year, 200 of which are to be completed by the end of 2021.  A further 145 will begin by mid-July.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about teachers and Covid-19.  We have made huge efforts to adapt to the environment in which we are living, particularly in schools.  The substitution scheme has been rolled out and the substitution panels have worked very well.  Further detail on DEIS schools will be made available in the next week or two.</p> <p>  I know school transport is a huge issue for the Deputy and his constituency.  We have secured substantial funding to ensure the roll-out of transport at 50% capacity, which will cost approximately &euro;100 million.  The review will be a milestone.  As the Deputy notes, its terms of reference are being drawn up.  We are looking to move that forward.  I appreciate that there is a huge body of work to be done on school transport. </p></speech>

As I mentioned to the Deputy last week, discussions are ongoing with the Cope Foundation, the patron of Scoil Aislinn.  Several building projects in Cork are being re-examined for any potential capacity.  That process is ongoing.</p> <p>  Discussions with F&oacute;rsa on SNAs are ongoing.  If there any issues they will be resolved through those talks. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#D00600"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  I wish to raise a few issues.  I will speed through them and give the Minister as much time as possible to respond.  In my interactions with schools and school principals I find there is a certain exhaustion in the system.  The Minister will appreciate that they are working very hard to keep going and keep the schools open.  There is an argument for a long Christmas break, perhaps ending school on December 18.  I would like to get the reaction to that.  I know that a huge amount of work would have to be done on childcare and consultation with education partners.  Is the Minister minded to consider an elongated Christmas break, with schools closed for an extra two days over Christmas?</p> <p>  On the topic of SNAs, I would like to ask about the 72-hour requirement.  There is a controversial suggestion that SNAs will have to fulfil their requirement for 72 non-contact hours on-site.  That is quite questionable practice during a pandemic.  Does the Minister have a view on that?  I know a letter was sent from the Department to principals last week.  Considering the nature of the pandemic it would be strange if SNAs were asked to spend more time on-site than absolutely necessary.</p><p>Last week, the Minister said the issue pertaining to the DEIS pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, would be addressed imminently, and she used that phrase again today.  Will she move to a situation where any reduction in the PTR would automatically transfer to DEIS schools and that it would not have to come through a separate process? <br/><br/>I would like to get a sense of the expansion of the free books scheme which, in fairness, the Minister has rolled out.  There was an announcement that there was potential for 50 schools to benefit and the Minister has doubled that to 102.  That is extremely welcome, and something that we support.  Is there ambition for a further free book scheme where, after a time, we might mirror what happens in Northern Ireland? <br/><br/>The expansion of second level places in expanding areas is a constituency issue for me.  There are caps in newly established second level schools in what I might broadly call the Dublin 13 area, which has had a huge expansion of population and where there is potentially 15,000 of a new population in the area.  There is a cap in place on newly established second level schools.  Can that be investigated so that second level schools, whether newly established or existing, can expand their places because it is becoming a big pinch point and a problem in the system?  </p></speech>

In recognition of that, every effort has been made to support school leaders, as I mentioned earlier, with additional days offered, well-being supports with Spectrum.Life and school teams, which was a specific issue that was raised, as well as other issues which were raised.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate a great deal of work has been undertaken daily in schools.</p> <p>   On additional holidays, I am mindful that the school calendar has been agreed and parents are aware of it and have made necessary arrangements based on it.  I am also very conscious that time has been missed during the year during the lockdown.  We are working very hard to ensure there is no repeat of that time being lost and that it does not become a feature of this school year.  I am conscious of the public health advice which tells us that students are much better served in school.  Students have been disadvantaged when they are not in school.  Schools, nationally and internationally, are very safe environments in terms of Covid-19.  For those reasons and others, while I appreciate the goodwill with which the Deputy is making the suggestion, I will follow the public health advice at this time that things are operating well within our schools.  </p> <p>  I appreciate the Deputy acknowledging the free books scheme.  It is an initiative that I would like to see rolled out as much and as widely as possible.  It has huge potential and that we have doubled it is testament to that.  I acknowledge that DEIS is a particular area of interest to the Deputy and he has raised it consistently.  I did use the phrase "imminently" last week but that was only on Thursday and today is Tuesday.  </p></speech>

The package of DEIS supports will be announced in the not-too-distant future.</p> <p>  The Minister of State will probably wish to speak on the SNAs but I want to acknowledge the clarification issued on that.  As I have said in other forums, the contribution of SNAs to the school environment and everything we seek to achieve in schools is invaluable.  I say that here and everywhere and I acknowledge that.  What issued was clarification on what the Deputy referred to as 72 hours, or the 12 days as they were originally in 2005.  This was an arrangement that was agreed to and signed up to in 2005 and was modified under the Croke Park agreement and so on in 2011.  There was no change in work practice and nothing new or extra was added in these duties.  I want to be clear that no one should be or is being asked to perform anything extra or anything outside of what was agreed and signed up to as a duty.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#E00500"><p>I think the Minister has answered that adequately.  I have previously expressed my appreciation for the valuable work that SNAs do, which I reiterate today.  To be clear on the use of the 72 hours, it should be pupil-centred activities such as assistance with care planning, learning resource administration such as preparing classrooms and materials, class and school planning and development and assistance with special examination centres for State examinations and training.  They are the duties and obviously, there are ongoing discussions with F&oacute;rsa as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#E00600"><p>I reiterate the importance of fair treatment for DEIS schools.  I have sent petitions which came from DEIS schools in County Laois to the Minister's office.  They are concerned and want to ensure that they are also included in class size reductions.  We must be fair across the board.  I sincerely hope that the package to be announced will include reductions in class size.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's remarks on improving inclusion and supporting those at risk of disadvantage.  I acknowledge that a lot of very good work is being done in this area.  Are there plans to reinstate the disadvantage committee, which was set up under the Education Act 1998?  It was a fantastic committee.  It did great work and was great value for money.  I did research on this and introduced a Bill some years ago seeking its reinstatement.  It did a lot of work around the DEIS initiatives.  If we had this model, we could do more to build on what has already been done to prevent people being trapped in a cycle of disadvantage and ensuring that every child and student in the State reaches his or her full potential, as outlined in the Education Act.  </p> <p>  The Minister spoke of well-being supports and mentioned additional supports for school leaders.  I seek some clarity and information in this regard.  What exactly are these supports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#E00700"><p>The points raised by the Deputy and others on DEIS schools are very much to the forefront of the package that will be announced in the coming days or weeks.  All aspects of DEIS provision are being considered.  I want to acknowledge and be clear that there is already a reduced pupil-teacher ratio.  It is very significant and important that it be there but it exists already in the DEIS schools.  There are 887 schools in the DEIS programme serving 20% of the school population.  In the 2020 programme, &euro;120 million was spent on DEIS initiatives and on supporting the programme.  I am a great supporter of all the tremendous work that is being done in the DEIS schools, which I acknowledge.</p> <p>  I will keep an open mind on the disadvantage committee.  I can discuss that with Deputy Nolan again.</p><p> Regarding the additional well-being supports that are being offered, I am conscious of the need for such supports for the entire school community and the school leadership specifically, which is the matter the Deputy raised.  One of the first initiatives in that regard was to acknowledge the amount of work being done in schools and the need for assistance to be offered to principals.  This involved the establishment of school teams to take on any additional workload that schools believed had been placed on their shoulders.  A public health webinar is being set up for school leaders, as is a well-being webinar.  Additional days have been made available to schools, particularly for teaching principals.  I acknowledge the work being done by Spectrum.Life for the entire school community, not just school leaders.  We are conscious of the need to be as supportive as we can.  In a normal environment, the work of school leaders and school communities is difficult and challenging.  That is even more the case in a Covid-19 environment.  We are working with the educational partners and we are keen to meet needs as they arise.  For that reason, we are providing additional supports - not just well-being supports, but also workload supports.  Did I miss any questions?</p></speech>

As I told Senator Dolan, the interim evaluation report that we received on the school inclusion model pilot was advantageous and showed that children had improved listening skills and competence and had reached most of their targets.  We are now rolling out the model to additional community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  We hope to do the entire nine CHOs over a period of approximately three years.  It will be a revolutionary change and experience for children with special needs because they will have occupational therapists and access to speech and language therapists and behaviour and crisis practitioners.  This will complement, rather than be in lieu of, the services that they obtain from the HSE.  It will be exciting for children with special needs.</p></speech>

I welcome that there will shortly be an announcement on DEIS band 1 junior and vertical schools.  The senior level was taken into account and saw a reduction, as the Minister outlined.  It is important to mention that, given that many members have missed that information in some of their comments at this meeting.  I look forward to the announcement and I hope to see a reduction in class sizes.</p> <p>  Last week, I raised a matter in respect of which I was not sure what was happening.  We know from the calculated grades that the results gap between DEIS non-DEIS schools reduced.  Will the Minister outline what steps are being taken to ensure that we do not lose that reduction in future leaving certificates?</p> <p>  I have received many emails outlining concerns about a smaller number of ASD classes at second level compared with primary level.  Will the Minister of State comment on this matter?  Will there be a move to increase numbers?</p> <p>  Was the issue of extended breaks raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in?

I do not agree with the proposal for an additional break of two days.  I do not see much benefit in it in terms of stopping the pandemic.  It has been clearly shown that children are benefiting from returning to school.  I would argue that some children would benefit more from being at home, but that is my background.  We need to be honest with ourselves and say that, although school is fantastic and children are delighted to be back, it is also a form of childcare and there are many people who do not want their children to take any more days off school.  It is a benefit to workers.  That is my view on the matter, which I wanted to share with the Minister and Minister of State.  They might revert to me on the issues of calculated grades and ASD classes.</p> <p>  Many people have contacted me, particularly those who are sitting exams currently, who feel a little like they were collateral damage and that much of the conversation has been about how most people were not downgraded but instead saw an increase in their grades compared with previous years.  There are those who feel that, because they were in classes of high-achieving young people, they were unfairly downgraded.  Does the Minister agree with their belief that they were collateral damage and that they need to be part of the conversation?</p></speech>

In the midst of a pandemic, to have a facility for in excess of 60,000 students to receive grades - calculated grades in this instance - and provide them a pathway to move forward in whatever direction they chose was significant.  I acknowledge the co-operation of all involved who made that a reality.  However, it is important that there be a facility to afford people the opportunity to take written exams in November.  It was available for them if they chose to take it up.  They were also free to choose not to take it up.  Approximately 2,500 are availing of the facility.  Whichever of the calculated and written exam grades is the best they receive is the one they will be awarded.  Having both options available was important to students.</p></speech>

I have worked in the sector for many years, so I say this in good faith - some people are happy with their results in particular subjects but unhappy with others.  Unfortunately, that can happen.  In this instance where calculated grades existed, that there was a further facility to take a written exam was important.  We are providing that facility now, so the option is open to everyone.  I will take this opportunity to wish everyone who is taking written exams the best of luck.</p> <p>  I appreciate the argument and view expressed by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in but, for all of the reasons I have already outlined, it is not our intention to extend the Christmas break.  I am mindful of the importance of children being in school.  We have articulated that every step of the way.</p><p>That is why we have worked so hard, even in the midst of level 5 restrictions, to ensure that the schools are open.  Notwithstanding the case that has been made by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, it is important that schools finish out their time.  On DEIS band 1, I appreciate Senator O'Reilly reiterating that the pupil-teacher ratio has already been reduced from 24:1 to 23:1, and we will look at other measures as part of the DEIS package.  On supports that have been put in place for DEIS schools, since the Senator was talking about bridging the gap, tremendous support has been made available to DEIS schools and we are working positively to enhance that.</p></speech>

We have approximately 1,600 special classes in the country.  That is a high figure when compared with 548 such classes in 2011.  Of the 200 school projects that we have at present, 116 will have autism spectrum disorder units, five of which will be in Galway, where Senator O'Reilly comes from.  The NCSE meets the Department every week to discuss forecasting and ensure that we always have enough places.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the significant contribution that principals, school management, teachers and the Department have made to get schools open and keep them open.  I acknowledge the investment the Government has made both during the summer and more recently, with significant additional resources provided.</p> <p>  I raise one matter in schooling which Covid has highlighted, which is the digital divide and the difficulties students are having with online learning because their computer technology is not up to scratch.  Some schools are, unfortunately, not in the position they could be in with regard to computer technology.  I wanted to touch on that and on resources for students who are perhaps non-neurotypical with conditions such as developmental co-ordination disorder, dyspraxia or dyslexia, as well as the availability of supports for them at primary and secondary level.</p> <p>  I also raise the issue of anxiety, which was mentioned by a colleague in the course of our hearing.  Anxiety places a significant strain on students.  I have lost count of the number of parents who have come to me citing anxiety in their children, particularly at second level, and the effects that that may have on them and the learning environment that they are in.  The Department needs to co-ordinate to have more psychologists available.  The Minister referred to his.  The Department might take simple, logical steps to provide an allocation of an educational psychologist to schools with autism spectrum disorder units.  Children who are not in ASD units but in mainstream schools could have more ready access to such psychologists and mental health supports.  As the Minister is undoubtedly aware and I am sure most Members of the House know, the difficulty of accessing those services is ever-present.  Those questions about digital matters and anxiety are for both the Minister and Minister of State.</p></speech>

I have already referred to some supports that are available to the wider school community.  On well-being for our students, the Deputy is quite correct.  As I said, 120 additional guidance counsellor posts have been allocated.  That is important and brings the number up to the 2011 benchmark.  The value of having guidance hours available in the school is unquantifiable.  I am personally aware of how well that works in the schools.  I am pleased that we have made those 120 posts available.</p> <p>  Some 17 additional NEPS psychologist posts have been made available to support the work of schools.  There are 221 full-time equivalent posts in the schools, so there are approximately 250 people.</p></speech>

Has she analysed regional disparities for those supports across the country?</p></speech>

Their initial report concerns facilities available in schools and the attitude of students and how they are managing in the school system, especially in a Covid environment.  They have covered almost 50% of schools.  When all of those data are fully available, we will discuss it at greater length.  I am conscious that we will have specific data available.</p></speech>

They were primarily recruited for children with special needs.  Most of that money would be targeted at pupils with special educational needs.  On the inclusion model, the NCSE can recruit therapists directly, so the HSE is not in a position to take any therapist from children who need help most.  The Deputy mentioned distance learning.  The home tuition scheme is valuable for children who are not in a position to attend school.  There are 20 hours for children over the age of three and ten hours for children under the age of three.  The July provision helped to significantly reduce regression, so that children could get back into the school environment.  Any progress reports that they had were sent on to their teachers when they started school in September.</p></speech>

There is provision in the budget for those resources and the Department consistently takes those data to ensure that no child does not have access.  The Deputy is right and if there is ever a pandemic again, we want to ensure that nobody is left out on a limb without access to technology to learn.</p></speech>

I recall mentioning it to the Minister briefly when I met her in the corridor of Leinster House.  I wrote about it in the <i>Irish Independent</i>at the time.</p><p>When it was decided to make a Covid package available, there was major surprise and concern among the fee-charging schools when it emerged that they were to be excluded from the payments.  There was a subsequent partial concession to their pleas, with such schools being allowed to apply for the grants but being judged on a case-by-case basis.  I understand that this involved a lot of paperwork wherein the schools were required to show that they could not find the resources otherwise.  Even where they submitted a financial case there was no transparency about the decision criteria.  The sense among the schools was that this was a decision that came from within the Civil Service that reflected a negative attitude to fee-charging schools.  An attitude in which the schools were seen as a problem as opposed to being seen as a sector involving many people who are not rich and make sacrifices to send their children to fee-charging schools and who end up saving the State money because those schools are funded to a lesser degree than are those in the non-charging sector.  There was a particular sense of feeling wounded about the idea that this was about money that intended for keeping children safe.  People felt that if we are going to cherish all the children of the nation equally then we cannot have a situation where families of children in fee-paying schools are subsidising supports for everyone else's children with their own school of choice getting nothing at all.  There was a real misstep here and the damage has not been remedied.  Does the Minister agree?</p></speech>

We are a sector constituted of many parts and each part makes a hugely important, significant and valued contribution to the system of education as we know it in this country.  I want to say that quite unequivocally.  I do not for one minute accept that there was a view from the outset to exclude.  I must point out that in the very first instance there is a staff salary grant for fee-charging schools in the normal run of things.  For example, in the 2018 to 2019 year, in excess of &euro;95 million was paid out in staff grants to fee-charging schools.</p> <p>  Specifically in relation to Covid-19 measures, I must point out that all of the fee-charging schools qualified for the same rate of support as was made available to the free schools in terms of the allocation of PPE and enhanced cleaning.  The ratio of &euro;51 per pupil was applied to all within the fee-charging school remit in the same way as it was applied to second-level schools in the free scheme.  Equally, the ICT grant was given at a rate of 50% to the fee-charging schools.  The Senator is correct about the minor works grant; all schools in the fee-charging scheme were invited to apply for that on the basis of need and where there was a need, a financial need, to meet any of the Covid-19 measures then that need was addressed.  Thus, quite a substantial amount was done in relation to Covid-19 measures being made available.</p></speech>

They saw it as something of a stroke from within the Civil Service, to be respectfully honest with the Minister.  They felt that while the fee-paying sector, as she rightly says, gets money in terms of the payment of teachers, they get a lot less.  As this was in the context of children's safety, it went down extremely badly.  Certainly people in that sector who I have been speaking to, including school managers, point out that many of the people who send their children to these schools are not wealthy and many of these schools operate on the basis of the fees they get enabling children who are less well-off to also attend those schools.  I respect, and listened to, everything the Minister said but there is a lesson in what happened during the summer.  It was not good and it left a bad taste which remains.</p></speech>

One principal said that imposing all of this paperwork on them at a time when they were really struggling was unfair.

I am absolutely 100% adamant in saying that.  I do not for a minute take away from what the Senator might reference about how people were discommoded by making an application or whatever.  However, it is very important too that the Department had X amount of funding, the funding was managed and where there was a definite need in any school it was absolutely provided for.

We are becoming very used to them at this stage and might begin keeping seats permanently reserved for them.</p> <p>  My first point will be brief because it has been made before and I will not belabour it.  It concerns the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, band schools.  I echo the call that we ensure that the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is passed on to all such schools.  I am very interested in seeing the package coming down the track for DEIS.  Can the Minister provide the time line for when we might see that?</p> <p>  I note the very good work with the July provision and the special educational needs, SEN, teams within schools who worked so hard during the first lockdown to maintain the connection between schools and children with special educational needs in particular.  There was also the increase in National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists announced in the budget.  All of these are very welcome.  I have a question on this however.  Did the first lockdown have an impact on the throughput of assessments?  We know that within schools teachers will begin the assessment process and that takes a good few months.  In fact, it generally takes close to two years to move from the start of an assessment process to the end.  Has there been any impact on the throughput of assessments and is there a backlog, seeing as the assessments presumably were not conducted over the closure period?</p> <p>  I raise home-school liaisons.  It is an area that was affected by cuts during the last recession and it is very often the children in the most vulnerable communities who pay the price of that.  This being the case, will the Minister comment on the increased provision of home-school liaisons?</p> <p>  Lastly, a sentence jumped out at me in the briefing document.  It refers to "...the growing number of pupils who are self-isolating at home...".  Do either the Minister or the Minster of State have figures available on that?  Are we seeing a large increase in the number of children, presumably with underlying health conditions or with parents with such conditions, who are self-isolating at home?  How are we tackling that in terms of blended learning?  Is this putting additional an workload onto the classroom teachers?  Are we looking at a situation where a teacher is delivering content during the day and then trying to deliver content in tandem in the evening time?  How large an issue is that in numerical terms and what provision is in place to support teachers who may be having to deal with that issue?</p></speech>

Students who have been designated as very high-risk are availing of an adapted education experience.  That is really where they have worked in conjunction with the schools and where there is a designated person within the schools to provide for the needs of that student.  That is as it should be and it is working quite well.</p><p>In terms of students who have not re-engaged for other reasons, initially, there was a view that given anxieties around Covid-19 and so forth, there might be a high uptake of students in that particular cohort.  That, however, has actually not materialised.  To give the Deputy a definite number on that, the Tusla education support service engaged with all schools and asked them to provide updated figures.  Not all schools have done so.  They had until around 16 November to have that completed.  Up to this point, approximately 60% of schools have engaged with it so approximately 40% are outstanding.  We will have better figures when the remaining schools make their returns and I will make those available to the Deputy.</p><p> I acknowledge the invaluable assistance and support provided by the home school community liaison service in liaising between education services, communities and families.  The increased provision is important.  I am conscious of that as part of the roll-out of the package of DEIS supports and, indeed, other aspects such as the educational welfare service, etc.</p><p> I acknowledge that a phenomenal service was provided by the Tusla education support service during lockdown, particularly in terms of targeting students who might have withdrawn their connection to the schools.  I acknowledge that engagement was made with families and homework and materials were brought to homes.</p><p> Finally, the Deputy referenced the DEIS support and that will come as quickly as we can, certainly before Christmas.</p></speech>

The schools have discretion to manage their resources.  I believe that was everything the Deputy asked about.</p></speech>

The HSE makes the assessments and one does not need an assessment to obtain an SNA within a school environment.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of early intervention.  That is generally done through the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and through the access and inclusion model.  That should also continue.  If there is any backlog, I am not aware of it.  I believe significant supports have been given by the Department to try to alleviate any backlog.</p></speech>

I had been booked for a Commencement debate on education and was then told the Minister and the Minister of State would be at the education committee.  I said I knew that because I was planning to attend this meeting.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, took the matter in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I was pressing the need for the new much-awaited and much-needed secondary school in the Newbridge area of County Kildare.</p> <p>  In terms of the issues we have to hand, first, I thank the Minister, Deputy Foley and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for the incredible amount of work that has gone on since they took office.  We saw that in the opening statement, not alone with the reopening of the school sector, but also in keeping classes open in the summer as part of the expanded summer programme and in the whole calculated grades process.  It is quite significant.  I still feel strongly about the agreement with F&oacute;rsa regarding school secretaries and caretakers and a pathway going forward with regard to therapy.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of specific points.  I thank all the school communities that have done incredible work with the extra help of the investment given by the Department.  My first question involves the whole area of special needs provision, which I have also raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  Children in mainstream schools or special schools were enjoying the support of extra therapists, but unfortunately some of those therapists have been redeployed.  In my area in County Kildare, I know that two full-time therapists and one part-time therapist were taken away to deal with assessment as opposed to the intervention that was needed at schools.  That is regrettable.  The Minister might comment on that.</p> <p>  I am aware the Minister spoke briefly about educational disadvantage.  I welcome the fact that a review has been done with regard to those children who did not go back to school in September.  From speaking to principals and teachers, it is sad and such a shame that children are missing out.  That is a crucial point in terms of intervention.  As somebody who always asks and talks about the importance of developing resilience, and supports our young people in terms of positive mental health, in one way, young people have developed a new form of resilience.  I know, however, from conversations with students and their parents that young people are anxious and stressed, particularly those who are in sixth year.  I am, therefore, also interested in knowing a little bit more about NEPS.</p> <p>  With regard to the complexities of the leaving certificate and calculated grades, etc., I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Foley, has made some arrangements for those taking the leaving certificate for 2021.  More information needs to be given because students feel they are absolutely not going to cover all of their courses.  I feel an intervention needs to be made on that.</p> <p>  The digital divide has been addressed here.  Many schools have inadequate broadband capacity and we must bear in mind that young people self-isolating at home do not have access to what they need.</p> <p>  The last question reverts back to the leaving certificate.  It is interesting to talk to students who are doing the leaving certificate this year.  They actually prefer the calculated grades while teachers prefer to have the normal form.  Are there any thoughts about the possibility of including more continuous assessment throughout the school year which would go hand in hand with exams at the end of the year?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#J01000"><p>I must pop out briefly so I will answer first, if that is okay.  We have spoken a good bit about NEPS today.  It has published a well-being resource, a toolkit and a webinar.  We have 120 NEPS psychologists, who are obviously of assistance because the well-being of children, particularly those with special needs, is important.  It is mostly targeted at those kinds of children.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the NCSE, which can directly recruit therapists now.  Because we had an unprecedented pandemic, it was obviously the case that some HSE therapists were used for contact tracing and other issues.  That, however, has since been resolved so at least the NCSE is in a position to recruit those therapists directly in order that they can assist with the inclusion model, and in general terms, with children with special needs.</p></speech>

Again, the issue of students who have not engaged with schools was referenced earlier.  We are told that 99% of our students have actually engaged with and returned to school so that is positive.  To add to what the Minister of State said, a welfare approach has very much been taken as regards students coming back to school and encouraging them.  Again, I acknowledge the terrific work that was done during lockdown to ensure students continued to engage.</p><p>Accommodation has been made in terms of the assessment of the curriculum for the leaving certificate of 2021.  It would not be possible for us at this point to change the curriculum for the simple reason that different schools and teachers take different approaches to covering a course.  What one teacher might have covered at a particular time, another teacher might not have covered.  It would be difficult to take out chunks here and there - excuse the phrase.  The accommodation has been made and notified to the schools in terms of the assessment with wider choice and so on.</p><p> I was asked whether calculated grades and continuous assessment would become part of the leaving certificate of 2021.  It is our full determination that the traditional leaving certificate will be the leaving certificate that will be experienced in 2021.  Notwithstanding that we are in a pandemic and so on, all of our energies are being placed towards running the system in 2021 as we have come to know it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#K00200"><p>I will ask some questions as there are no other speakers are left.  I will go for a second round and will give people a reduced time to ask a direct question to the Minister.  I have three or four issues I wish to ask about.  The Minister might not have the answers but she might be able to come back to me.</p> <p>  There are few large primary schools in the country.  When I say large primary schools, I mean those with 700 pupils or more.  A primary school of such numbers is entitled to a principal and a deputy principal for administration.  Let us compare that to a post-primary school with between 300 and 600 pupils.  Such a school is entitled to a principal and several deputy principals, albeit with reduced teaching hours in some situations and not in others.</p> <p>  There are many challenges in primary schools.  Will the Minister examine this specifically as it applies to larger primary schools?  There are some primary schools with almost 1,000 pupils.  It is unfair for a primary school to have only a principal and deputy principal for administration compared to the resources available to a smaller secondary school.  Is this something the Minister can look at?</p> <p>  Several primary schools throughout the country, especially in urban areas have seen an increased number of overseas families.  I will offer an example.  In my area there are four meat factories.  As the Minister knows, most employees of meat factories are foreign people who have come in from overseas.  Their families get visas and they can bring in their children.  I understand that when they start primary education - some may start secondary education - the school must have 25% of the pupil population under the level of B3 proficiency.  I believe that goes against the larger primary schools.  A smaller primary school might get to 25% more easily but larger primary schools definitely will not get to that level.  I call on the Minister to look upon this area.</p> <p>  My children are going to school in my local area.  The school has a large number of overseas students but nowhere near enough to reach the 25% mark.  The school does a fabulous and brilliant job.  However, I believe some of the children coming in need additional resources in teaching English and so on.</p> <p>  This is something that occurs in urban areas because most of the families who come in want to live in the towns rather than out in the middle of the countryside.  They want to be where there is more to do.  Perhaps they can settle in more easily in accommodation provided in urban areas.  I know from speaking to some of my other colleagues throughout the country that this is an issue for them as well because I have asked them about it.</p> <p>  I know several other Deputies have raised the issue of the change in the budget this year.  I welcome the classroom size reduction for DEIS band 1 schools but it does not apply to junior DEIS band 1 schools or vertical DEIS band 1 schools.  I appeal to the Minister to look closely at this.  As I did not hear the reply the Minister gave to Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh on this point, the Minister may wish to repeat the reply.</p> <p>  I raised another matter last week, namely, calculated grades in the leaving certificate.  Will the Department be looking at going towards continuous assessment in the leaving certificate?  Is this part of a review that the Minister might undertake, if not shortly, then perhaps in the coming years?  It would take a good deal of consultation with teacher unions and so on and all the stakeholders involved in education.  Is this something of which the Minster is personally in favour?  Might the Minister consider holding a review in this regard?</p> <p>  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, announced that all new school buildings will include classroom facilities for children with special needs.  Will the Minister of State flesh out what is involved in this?  I very much welcome it.  Normally, when we see a new school building we see a structure and that is it.  Often, we forget about the future and what might be the needs of people in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#K00300"><p>I do appreciate the points made in terms of larger schools.  There was an acknowledgement of that, especially in the Covid-19 measures.  Additional days would be made available to teaching principals and additional resources were being put in place as much as possible.  Certainly, this is an area I would look at.</p> <p>  The same applies equally in terms of students coming from overseas and the need for English as an additional language and all of that.  I am absolutely conscious of that.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about DEIS band 1 schools.  Again, I will reiterate what I have said.  There will be a reduction from 24:1 to 23:1.  The Chairman asked about junior and vertical schools.  What I have said is that we are currently looking at a suite of measures in terms of a DEIS package.  There will be several initiatives within that package that will be announced, hopefully prior to Christmas.  That is what I am aiming for.  I am giving consideration to it at that point.</p> <p>  I will reiterate what I said to the Senator about calculated grades and changes to the leaving certificate.  I am conscious that for 2021, notwithstanding that we are in a pandemic and so on and provided public health advice prevails, we are working towards the traditional leaving certificate.  Any other changes will be a matter of engagement and discussion and so on.  To be fair, there has been positive endorsement of the traditional leaving certificate as we know it.  In the short term that is the aim and target for 2021.</p></speech>

In fairness, the larger schools are under severe pressure with overseas students.  They do a fabulous job.  Will the Minister acknowledge that?  The school I am referring to is almost up to the 25% level.  This is something that could be given to the school but we must acknowledge what the schools are doing and what they have done.  It is difficult for teachers when a pupil comes in with little English.  Yet, then within two or three years the pupil is absolutely fluent and very much part and parcel of the place.  In the classes my children are in, there could be three, four or five different nationalities.  This is an area of concern.  We have seen this in Ireland in recent years.  The teachers have done a fantastic job in giving fluency in English and making this fit into the classroom.  It is not only about spending time to ensure the pupils fit in with the peers and everything like that as well.  I appeal to the Minister personally to look at this one area.  I do not want a reply from the Minister now.</p></speech>

It is an area I am familiar with.  The Chairman has made the point about the 25% criterion.  Excellent resources are in place but I appreciate the point the Chairman is making about a particular percentage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#K00600"><p>In essence, when I was appointed to this position as the first dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for special education, it was clear and evident to me that we needed to tackle the dearth of special class places in particular pockets throughout the country.</p><p>I was delighted that I got a commitment from the school building unit to ensure that there will be sufficient accommodation for special classes in all new school builds into the future, which will help alleviate that problem, and that is in tandem with the NCSC forecasting model.  It is developing a five-year plan, together with the forward model of the Department of Education, so that we can see and anticipate, from a demographic perspective, what and how many types of special classes we are going to need in the future.  We can work with existing schools, but for all new builds there will be provision made for that accommodation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#L00200"><p>I thank both witnesses for the considerable amount of work that has been done since they both took office.  It has been an extraordinary journey.</p> <p>  My questions are twofold.  One arises from the comments made here last week by the officials from the Department in relation to the leaving certificate students of 2020 and those who were downgraded from their teachers' grades.  Last week I asked the officials if there is an acknowledged group of students that were downgraded who previously had patterns of achieving consistently high grades.  The response I got was that there is no acknowledgement of such a specific, discreet or distinct group and that this was dealt with by saying that these are students whose grades were overestimated.  That appears to suggest that there has been a systematic review of the students who claim that they were downgraded from a pattern of high grades and that there was some sort of an engagement with their results in order to be able to cast a net around them to say that this is the group that has been downgraded and the only reason for the downgrade is that they were overestimated and there is not any other possibility for it.  I am curious about that review and how such a widesweeping definition and decision could be applied to that particular group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#L00300"><p>I am not aware of any specific review as the Senator has spoken to in her question.  I made the point earlier that obviously there are students who are very pleased with what they have received and those who are less pleased.  As part of the calculated grades programme there was a commitment that there will be a review of the full process and I am very committed to that and it will take place.  I ask the officials clarify that it was that they said to the Senator last week in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#L00400"><p>I think what I was saying in the conversation we had on this day last week was that when we look across, there was overestimation in terms of what the level of results would be in comparison to other years.  Dr. Hislop who was with me last week gave an example in the case of Agricultural Science, where the percentage of H1s would have been in the order of 13% or 14% if a standardisation approach had not been applied, compared to 2019, when it was in the order of about 4% to 4.5%.  There are lots of incidences like that and they are published in that national standardisation group report, which is available on the Department's website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#L00500"><p>I appreciate that and that this year's H1 percentage comes in at around 9%.  However, that does not explain that there is a very distinct group of students who are saying that they had an historical pattern of high achievement and expected that their teachers' grades were in line with what their expectations were.  Within that, there is the group who are now currently sitting the leaving certificate examinations and getting a rather unsympathetic ride on that because they are not getting any accommodation with regard to the actual paper that they are sitting, they have had no support since last March, or extra tuition - they have had nothing.  In fact, they are going into this alone.  A disproportionately high percentage of that group are the students who believe that they were downgraded unfairly because they had a standard pattern of high achievement.  How can it be attributed to overestimated grades for that particular cohort, who are a unique group within those leaving certificate students, without an actual interrogation of the over 2,000 students who claim to be in that position?  Not all of them will necessarily have missed out on obtaining a place in college; some of them expected to do better but just scraped by.  There is also a very significant number that did not get their places and that are being put out by a year, but one cannot say that it has been caused by an overestimation without absolutely examining that particular group or having a mechanism to do so, so it does not answer how they are being ascribed that particular group.</p></speech>

I would say that it is not solely that group who are sitting the exams at the moment.  We did have others who, unfortunately, for various reasons, we could not give a calculated grade to, although we tried our very best, for example, out-of-school learners or those who were carrying an additional subject or two outside of school.  There are a number of reasons why people are choosing to sit the exams.</p></speech>

I ask that she takes a few minutes to tease out what that accommodation will be for 2021.  How much have we spent so far on the legal cases?  Are the legal cases being contested individually?  Will the expenditure on the legal cases, both in terms of what is spent on the legal teams and what is allocated for compensation, come out of the budget of the Department of Education and will that have an impact on what the Department can deliver through its budget?</p> <p>  When are the 120 guidance counsellors going to be put in place?  We did a survey earlier this year that showed that 75% of leaving certificate students from last year felt that they did not receive adequate career guidance.</p></speech>

On the issue of the 120 guidance counsellors, in many instances it involved an increase in the number of hours that were available.  In some schools there would have been a presence of a guidance counsellor, but with reduced hours and perhaps teaching in another capacity.  That is how these posts have been divided up in some instances.  For example, in a 500-pupil school, it meant that there would be an additional three hours of counselling provided on top of what is already available.</p></speech>

In relation to 2021, the accommodation for students is around the question format that is on the paper, where there is a wider choice being given.</p><p>All of that has been disseminated to the schools and students would be aware that where there might have been a limited option, a greater option is now being provided for examination.  Mr. Tattan might like to come in there to comment on the legal side of things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#M00200"><p>On Deputy Conway-Walsh's question on the legal cases, the nature of the litigation - and litigation normally - is that costs only arise afterwards.  There has been no expenditure to date in respect of the cases that are ongoing.  Obviously, expenditure is potentially incurred once a legal team is engaged, etc.  When a case is over, the costs are ruled on by the judge.  In the event that we are successful, costs would normally follow the event, which means that the losing party pays.  In the event the State loses, there is a sharing whereby the State's legal team is paid for through the Office of the Attorney General's budget, and the opposing side's legal team costs would be paid for by the Department out of its budget.</p></speech>

I believe there needs to be a larger element of choice than has already been disseminated through the schools.</p> <p>  On the review of DEIS and school transport, I am aware that these two issues are on the Minister's radar.  Will the Minister give us an update on that?  The school completion programme has been moved to the Department of Education, which is very welcome news, and it is a much better fit there than with the Department with responsibility for youth, children and Tusla.  Does the Minister feel that there is more scope in what can be done via that programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020111700002#M00700"><p>I am very keen that the school transport review would take place as soon as possible.  We are currently scoping out the terms of reference.  We will proceed with that as expeditiously as possible.  We are seeking to roll out the 50% programme also, but we will be moving apace with that.</p> <p>  There are 887 schools currently in the DEIS programme, which caters for approximately 20% of the school population as we know it.  Significant resources have been spent on DEIS programmes.  We are finalising the new DEIS identification model and we are working as quickly as we possibly can on that.  It is a positive step forward that the education support services are coming within our remit from Tusla.  We will have the education welfare service, the home school community liaison, and the school completion programme.  As I said earlier, there is a particular package of additional resources being made available to us this year, including DEIS and pupil-teacher ratios, and the other aspect of DEIS to which I referred.  When that package is announced I will be in a better position to give members more concrete detail on what it will mean going forward.  It is an excellent programme that delivers very well in our schools.  The more we can expand it and the more we can progress it, the better.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to this briefly earlier.  It was already an issue before we ever had a pandemic.  There was pressure on the system and schools' ability to access the system and have assigned psychologists affects their ability to determine the needs of children with special needs, or indeed where there are behavioural issues.  The possibility for delay within the system was already a problem.  In light of the pandemic and all that we hear about mental health and the associated challenges, and with the pressures on children with special needs in particular because of the lack of engagement and the acute nature of the pandemic challenge for some, where are we now regarding the operation of NEPS?  In the context of the ability of NEPS to grapple with the challenge that was already there, to paraphrase the words of U2, is it getting better or is it still the same?</p></speech>

Overall, there are 120 of them.  Their work is primarily targeted at children with special needs.  When I took over this role, one of the aspects of which I was most acutely aware was that of children with special needs and the extra anxiety and well-being issues that might have arisen for them in terms of going back to school, especially from a regression perspective.  The July provision was accessed by 15,000 children, an increase of 9,000 on last year - 24,000 were actually eligible for it - and it assisted those with special needs to integrate back into the school environment.  All the progress the reports they would have received during that period were provided.</p> <p>  The Minister will agree that well-being was at the heart of the entire reopening of the schools.  Of the &euro;447 million that was provided, a huge amount went towards reducing potential anxiety for children.  There are a lot of well-being resources, tool kits and webinars, and inductions for teachers.  Again, the budget has provided an increased amount for an extra 400 teachers for special educational needs, which will also assist.  We have a school inclusion model that will help to reduce children's anxiety around it.   The best interests of the child within the Covid environment is always at the heart of it, and we are always aware of it.</p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, if there are children who are very high risk and who, for whatever reason, cannot go back into the school environment, tuition and assistance is available for them.  We constantly monitor all of those situations.</p></speech>

Following on from Senator Mullen's point, are there many schools that have not been assigned educational psychologists?  I presume schools share psychologists at the moment.  What other alternative supports are available for schools in that regard?</p></speech>

With the reopening of schools, we wanted to ensure that we were in a position to replace an absence, and particularly around SNAs.  The &euro;14.7 million was there so if, for whatever reason, an SNA was absent then he or she would be immediately replaced.  The same applied to educational psychologists and we got an additional 17 positions.  We are recruiting with the school inclusion model now in order to kick that off for September 2021.  Some of that was paused because of Covid.  There is a suite of different therapeutic supports on offer if an educational psychologist is not available, but one should be available at all times.</p></speech>

I am aware that this is an issue.  For a while in my county, where a pupil had an SNA right up to sixth class, he or she was refused the SNA when going into first year in secondary school.   What percentage of pupils might have continued on with their SNAs on entering post-primary?</p></speech>

The exceptional review process is available for any school that needs additional SNAs, and the front-loading of SNAs will commence from September 2021 in tandem with the rolling out of the school inclusion model.</p><p>There is nothing prohibiting an SNA moving from one school to another so long as they are wearing PPE which, again, is provided for under the budget.  Their role is completely integral and a lot of children, those with special needs in particular, can get attached to individual SNAs.  That is something that schools themselves work out between them in terms of trying to look after the kids.</p></speech>

It was not the issue we brought her in to discuss but I hope she does not mind.  It is more of an observation than a question.  Some schools have needed additional school buildings for Covid reasons and they have probably been given prefabs or whatever.  This issue is a major bugbear of mine.  I know Covid is totally different but I hope this does not mean other schools that might be suffering will be given prefabs instead of permanent structures.   Since 2011, this is something every Government and all Ministers have made great strides on.  When I was elected first in 2002 I would say that 70% of schools in my own constituency had some form of a prefab and in fairness they have moved away from that policy and towards permanent structures.  It makes a huge difference where value for money is concerned and I hope it continues on in the Department and that the Minister will continue to it.</p></speech>

He is right that there has been an element of exception there because of Covid.  Notwithstanding that, our determination to progress school building with bricks and mortar is underpinned by the fact that in 2021 we are looking at the completion of more than 200 projects, and 145 beginning in the mid-year stream as well.  These will all be bricks and mortar so I appreciate the Chairman's point, notwithstanding, as I said, that we are also in a Covid environment.</p></speech>

I welcome the members present and the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to Members in Leinster House, any other location in Leinster House, Leinster House 2000 or the Convention Centre, Dublin on days on which the relevant House sits there.  I ask members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed above as privilege for their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division, the committee member must be physically present in the room.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that due to Covid-19 restrictions, each session must conclude within two hours.</p> <p>  We are discussing the Finance Bill.  Members received a proposed timetable for the consideration of provisions today.  I draw members' attention to the proposal regarding section 54 and later sections.  It will be necessary to make an Order later today in this regard.  Members are asked to review that and contact the clerk with any proposals and issues they might have.</p> <p>  Any member acting in substitution for another member of the committee should formally notify the clerk.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members attending this meeting should be aware that, pursuant to Standing Order 106(3), they may move their amendments but cannot participate in voting on those amendments.</p> <p> I would also like to thank the clerks, all of the staff, the Minister and his officials for their work yesterday, because it was an exceptional challenge.  The members co-operated fully and we got through quite a lot, but we are due to finish tomorrow evening at 7 p.m, so I ask that we stick to that.  </p> <p>  Members are tied up in these sessions for long periods of time and are often not in a position to participate in D&aacute;il debates.  Therefore I am using my position as Chair to express my thanks to one side of the Cabinet for reaching the decision not to go ahead and prosecute people, as was being proposed in a memo sent by the Minister for Health.  I am not asking members to comment on it, but I hope that common sense prevails in respect of many other issues relative to lockdown.  The issue relates to the Finance Bill, because it is one that is affecting our economy, and if we do not open in a way that is constructive and that brings all stakeholders on board to co-operate in terms of the law, then we will end up in serious difficulty for the future.  As we discuss matters pertaining to the Finance Bill, I have discussed with another Minister the issue of Cork Institute of Technology and the need to deal with outstanding matters there in terms of the waste of taxpayers' money.  I intend to raise it this week in the D&aacute;il to make it public, because it is not being dealt with, and I feel that if the matter were to be approached in a constructive manner, we would have no difficulty.  There is always the option to appoint an investigator to address that particular situation, or a visitor, as they say.  I will return to that issue in due course. </p></speech>

I thank them and everybody who is supporting us in the operation of the ICT.</p><p> I will now deal with the amendment.  The trading profits of companies in Ireland are generally taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Some of the main features of the current corporation tax regime are its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base.  Changing this rate would involve increased complexity and could change the attractiveness of our corporation tax offering.  The Deputies may be aware that the Department of Finance carried out a comprehensive economic impact assessment of our corporation tax policy in 2014.  A distinctive feature of the economy is the high share of activity accounted for by foreign direct investment, FDI.  As part of this assessment, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, analysed firm-level data on over 3,000 newly established multinational subsidiaries in 26 European countries.  It found that if the Irish corporation tax rate had been 22.5% over the period examined, the number of new foreign affiliates entering the country would have been significantly lower.</p><p> The implications for Ireland are clear.  An increase to the 12.5% corporation tax rate could be expected to damage inward FDI flows and reduce investment and economic activity in the State, with consequential negative impacts on the overall corporation tax yield and employment in the State.  For the year to date, corporation tax receipts have continued to perform well, notwithstanding the current economic circumstances.  The sustained corporation tax receipts are critical to maintaining Exchequer revenues and supporting the Government&rsquo;s measures to support both individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.</p><p> We are fully engaged in international tax reform and, in conjunction with other EU and OECD member states, have introduced in recent years extensive reforms aimed at tackling aggressive tax planning.  This includes reform of company residence rules and transfer pricing rules, the introduction of new controlled foreign corporation, CFC, rules, anti-hybrid rules and an exit tax, and improved transparency and reporting requirements.</p><p> Taking all these considerations into account, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#B00200"><p>The amendment was tabled by Deputy Barry but, unfortunately, he is tied up with Leaders' Questions in the House.  While the amendment is in our names too, I should have said that People Before Profit holds a slightly different position, namely, that of raising the tax rate to 25%.  I nonetheless think that the spirit and thrust of the amendment, in focusing on this issue, is correct because, as I suggested last night, the effective rate is much lower than 12.5%, which relates to gross trading profits.  The total profits for the latest available figures are &euro;182 billion, whereas the taxable profits are only &euro;96 billion.  I do not accept, therefore, the Minister's claim that it is straightforward.  The fact that, in most cases, large corporations can write down their taxable profits using myriad reliefs, deductions and allowances available to them - loopholes, in layman's terms - means they are not really paying 12.5% on their profits.  They are paying 5.7%, less than half of that.  There is no need for that and I reject the claim that if they were made to pay the actual 12.5%, they would all go flying out of the country.</p> <p>  I refer the Minister to a recent interview on "Morning Ireland" with US Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democratic Congressman from Philadelphia, where he was asked about this issue.  He was categorical and there was no equivocation.  He said bluntly that Ireland's tax rate was not the key issue with the location of US multinational investment in this country but rather that it was our involvement in the EU market and the fact that Ireland is an English-speaking country.  Critically, he emphasised the fact that we have a highly educated workforce.  There is a suggestion that if these multinational corporations were made to pay 12.5% - which, if they did so on gross trading profits, would deliver double the sum we are getting now, or an additional &euro;10 billion in revenue - they would leave.  Brendan Boyle, however, in putting forward arguments from the point of view of an American politician, stated that they would not leave.  There is simply too much profit being made here by those companies and, even if they had actually to pay 12.5%, they would still make very considerable profits and pay a very low proportion of those profits in corporation tax.</p> <p>  We should not, therefore, take this kid-glove attitude to the corporations.  We need money for housing, water infrastructure, health infrastructure and so many different areas.  Indeed, those companies depend significantly on that infrastructure, not least the education infrastructure.  As Brendan Boyle pointed out, with that educated workforce from which they generate so much money, why on earth would we not at least make them pay 12.5% in order that the money could be redirected into further enhancing our education system and other key public services and infrastructure?</p></speech>

Section 481 concerns the film tax relief, which amounts to approximately &euro;80 million a year, although the figure varies from year to year.  This is significant public financing of the live action and film industry.  I stress that I support public funding of film and the arts generally, and I would like arts funding, including for film, to increase from its fairly low levels, by European standards.  Currently, 0.1% of GDP goes to the arts, whereas in the rest of Europe, it is 0.6%.  That is six times less than the average in a country that has a significant international reputation based on it arts output.</p><p>My call for a review of this relief is not because I want in any way to obstruct - indeed, I want only to see increased funding for the arts, including film.  As I have outlined on numerous occasions in the House, and the Minister will be aware of this, there remain significant problems with section 481.</p><p>As spelled out in the Taxes Consolidation Act, the purpose of that section is to generate quality employment and training.  I will add a point that I did not make yesterday.  Under EU law, state aid to the film industry - I want this aid to be provided - is predicated on it generating companies of scale and creating a permanent pool of skill, talent and creativity.  That is not happening, though.  The film producer companies that receive the money do not want to acknowledge the rights of those who work in the sector or take responsibility for them as employees.  Therefore, there is no permanent pool and there are no companies of scale.  The largest film producer companies in this country might have ten or 15 permanent employees.  Some have no permanent employees at all.  As such, the number of people who are recognised in any way as employees in the industry is tiny.  Most of them are employed on a project-to-project basis.  Even if they have worked in the industry for 20, 30 or 40 years, which is the case for many of them, when the next film comes up, it is as if that is the first time they have sought employment in the industry.  They have no pension rights, there is no proper system of accreditation for trainees and there is no acknowledgement of the service that people have given to the industry over many years.  This puts the workers in a very weak position.</p><p> Despite the fact that the Government has acknowledged some of these points and sought to introduce reforms to improve the workers' situation, there has been no change on the ground.  To a large extent, the situation remains the same because the film producers, in what I can only describe as a bloody-minded refusal to acknowledge the intent of the Government's reforms and an attempt to ignore employment law and the conditions placed on state aid by the EU, refuse to acknowledge their obligations to their employees.  They even refuse to acknowledge that they are the employers and that their workers are employees.</p><p> We must press home the fight in order to end this situation and give people rights and acknowledgement as workers in the industry, with pensions, proper training pathways and so on.  This has still not been achieved.  I will not elaborate on the arguments further, but there is more to be done in this regard.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.  While I have acknowledged the Government's willingness to listen and make some improvements, the situation has still not got to where it needs to be even in terms of meeting our obligations under EU state aid rules.</p></speech>

However, I will emphasise two points to the Deputy.  First, I expect that the process that is under way in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which I understand is hoped to lead to a framework agreement on such matters by the end of the year, will be a significant step forward in dealing with the matters to which the Deputy referred.  I accept the point that he made yesterday that it is not a collective agreement, but I do not believe I ever stated that it was purported to be one.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's point about this being an employment relationship between an actor, a set designer and a film or television series that is due to be made and that there is not the same continuity of relationships as there is in other parts of our economy for different kinds of work.  All of that being said, the process of trying to get to a framework agreement later this year must have an effect on the matters the Deputy raised.  They are best dealt with as employment relations and in the arms of the State that deal with such matters as opposed to in the Finance Bill.</p> <p>  Second, and as the Deputy has been good enough to acknowledge, this is an area that my officials and I have followed up on over the past two years after he raised it with me.  I have with me a copy of the form that he referred to yesterday.  It lays out the requirements that we expect to be adhered to in order to access section 481 tax relief.  This form has not been implemented for long.  If it does not begin to have the kind of effect that we want it to have, we will take further action.  In what I believe was a Report Stage debate two years ago, I made the point to the Deputy that, if a tax relief was granted on the expectation of quality employment being made available, such employment should be made available.  That is what led to the development of this form, which reads: &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo;.  We did what we said we would do in conjunction with the Deputy.  If this does not begin to have the desired effect or if issues are raised with me regarding its operation, there is much that we will be able to do between Finance Bills to examine these matters.</p></speech>

We have had an extensive debate on it.  However, I will make a few final points to him.</p> <p>  A key aspect of quality employment and training, particularly as set out in the fixed-term workers legislation at European and national levels, is recognition of service.  The Minister cannot make commitments on it now, but I ask that he and his officials examine this issue carefully.  The film producers, who receive significant amounts of money year in and year out and employ largely the same people year in and year out, refuse to acknowledge the service that those workers have given them.  They have done that by hiding behind designated activity company, DAC, status.  In other words, they are implying that it is not them but a series of different companies when the fact of the matter is that it is the same producer companies.  This essentially allows them to evade their legal responsibilities to employees.  In doing so, they are in serious breach of EU directives and our national legislation.  This behaviour must be clamped down on seriously.</p> <p>  If the Minister's officials read the submissions being made by the producer companies in receipt of section 481 relief in various cases that have been before the Labour Court and the WRC in recent times, they would see those companies explicitly stating that they are not the employers and that the DACs are.</p><p>That is in breach of the declaration they are signing and the clear intent behind the section 481 relief and the conditions surrounding it.  This matter needs to be looked at carefully and those companies need to be told that what is happening has stop.  It is an abuse, a failure to comply with the law and those companies must be told that they will have the section 481 relief removed from them if they continue to make those arguments.</p><p> The state aid rules also need to be examined as they apply to support to the industry.  They are explicit in stating that one must build companies of scale and create a permanent pool of employment and talent in this sector.  That is simply not happening at all.  There is no such permanent pool for the same reason, that is, the producers do not want to accept that they have any responsibility to the people who work in the industry.  I will leave it at that but I ask the Minister to look at those particular points.</p></speech>

We all want to expand knowledge, see innovation and research to improve our society, develop technology and advance enterprise and industry that is beneficial to society.  That is a no-brainer and a noble objective.  However, I put it to the Minister that the mechanisms by which we do that, including the knowledge development box and research and development grants with which we will deal later, are largely benefiting a very small cohort of companies.  The major objective of those companies is to make money, largely in the IT sector.  I am not saying they have not contributed to the advance of technology, and useful technology, but there is a hell of a lot more out there in terms of scientific and technological advance than the small number of social media and IT companies that are dealing with smart technology and are the major beneficiaries of reliefs and grants.  We should be carrying out a cost-benefit analysis as to whether the significant amounts of money which, in the main, go to a small group of multinationals would not be better directed into our public universities.</p> <p>  This may be a better time than ever to make the argument in this regard, given Covid-19, because we all now see the value in, for example, research into things such as vaccines and medicines, and across the whole health area.  The research capacity of our universities for testing and tracing and of our health system for researching medicines is way below what it should be, faced with the sort of crisis we are in.  I seriously suggest that we need to weigh up whether we would be better off giving direct funding to our public universities, health service and so on in the areas of research development and innovation, rather than giving reliefs such as this which benefit a small number of wealthy multinational corporations.</p></speech>

When we look at the knowledge development box, we should not think that it is the only thing the Government is doing to try to support research and development, and a high-innovation economy.  We are, through may different investments, doing the kind of work to which Deputy Boyd Barrett has referred in our universities and places of higher education.  That is funded directly by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Much of the work to which the Deputy referred is happening.  It is funded via expenditure, as opposed to tax expenditure, and it is overseen by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department.</p> <p>  The knowledge development box is comparatively small in the context of the kind of money that is correctly spent by the taxpayers in supporting research.  That is illustrated by answering the questions that Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell put to me regarding the scale of the knowledge development box.  I will do that before concluding by answering her question regarding why it is being extended in the way I am proposing.  For 2016, the total cost of expenditure for the knowledge development box was &euro;9.4 million, with a total of 12 claimants on it.  For 2017, the budget was &euro;10.3 million, with a total of 13 claimants.  We expect to have the final figures for 2018 in the first half of 2021.  The total cost is estimated to be &euro;9 million with fewer than ten claimants.  In terms of the scale of the tax expenditure and the number of companies that are accessing it, this is one of the smaller tax reliefs in place in our tax code.</p> <p>  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell asked about the rationale for the scheme and its extension.  The rationale for the scheme is to encourage companies to locate qualifying research and development activities here in Ireland and, by doing that, to encourage employment and more substantive operations within the State.

That is something the Government has resisted but Covid-19 creates a new context for the case for wealth taxes because we are borrowing huge amounts to finance income supports and other increased expenditure in areas such as health and so on to sustain us through Covid-19, and particularly the incomes of those who have been hit by the pandemic.  It is worth saying that many of the people who have been hit had precarious incomes and circumstances in the first place or would have been low paid people in areas like bar work, hospitality, the arts, about which we have talked a good deal, music, live entertainment and taxi drivers.  These would not be people who had very high incomes to start with and they have been hurt very significantly by the measures.  While there has been some income supports for them they are people who are really suffering as a result of Covid-19.  There are other sectors of our society who are not suffering but actually doing extraordinarily well.  The report of the Central Bank for the second quarter of this year that came out in the past few days underlines that in spades where the net household wealth has now reached the highest level ever in the history of the State at &euro;817 billion.  That is a jump of approximately &euro;60 billion on the year before.  It is an extraordinary accumulation of wealth.  As the Central Statistics Office, CSO, demonstrated in its studies on the distribution of wealth, that wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in a small number of very wealthy households.  For example, the richest 1% of the population have more wealth than the bottom 50%.  That is an extraordinary fact.  The richest 1% have more wealth than the combined household wealth of the 50% at the bottom.  The wealthiest 10% have half of that wealth, 50% of that &euro;817 billion.  That is extraordinary, and it is growing every year because once we reach a certain threshold of wealth the money begins to make money.</p><p>Against the background of many people being hurt in the Covid-19 pandemic and us clearly needing very significant additional investment in key public services more so than ever after Covid-19, for example, in our health service, to reduce class sizes in education and to invest in key infrastructure projects, surely there is a serious case for wealth taxes or, in this specific context, for a Covid solidarity wealth tax.  These are measures that have been introduced in a number of countries since Covid-19 or are being actively discussed around the world if countries have not yet introduced them.  I refer to the idea of imposing Covid solidarity wealth taxes on those with the very highest incomes and those who have very significant accumulated wealth.  That would save us from having to borrow as much as we are having to borrow and it would be an important measure, underpinning with real action, the principle of &quot;we are all in it together&quot;, which has very much provided the framework for the public attitude towards the sacrifices and hardship they have to make to deal with Covid-19.</p><p>That is why we press the case for removing more aggressive taxes on working people and replacing them with wealth taxes, in particular in the current climate a Covid solidarity wealth tax.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#F00200"><p>There are a considerable number of issues with the proposal the Deputies have suggested, including Exchequer cost, significant erosion of the tax base and impact on the competitiveness of our tax code.</p> <p>  I note that the Deputies have not specified the level of income tax rates that would apply under this proposal.  However, it is estimated that the removal of the application of the universal social charge, USC, on all incomes below &euro;70,000 as suggested would cost in the region of &euro;1.6 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely that if the new tax took the form of a new USC rate for those earning over &euro;100,000, it would need to be as high as 14.6 % in order to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure that this is a cost-neutral proposal.  This estimation does not take account of any behavioural changes that could result from the significant increase in marginal rates of taxation. </p> <p>  To introduce any higher rate of USC would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates have an impact on work and also cause harm to our international competitiveness.  The considerable progress that has been made in recent years to restore our economy cannot be taken for granted, particularly given the challenges in the international arena that confront us at present.  </p> <p>  Introducing a USC exempting all those earning up to &euro;1,346 per week would considerably erode the tax base.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that 29% of all income earners will not be liable for USC in 2021.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;70,000 would exempt almost 88% of income earners from USC.  This would greatly narrow our income tax base and expose the economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn. </p> <p>  In summary, the USC and our progressive income tax code have shown their mettle in 2020 in terms of their ability to generate a large amount of income tax at a time when we need it to pay for public services that are particularly essential at the moment.  I am not supportive of reducing the number of people who pay the USC, as Deputy Boyd Barrett suggests, while at the same time significantly increasing marginal tax rates in the way the Deputy wants.  That would have an effect on kinds of jobs we have in the State.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

In particular, section 15 updates the definition of &quot;relevant person&quot; in section 835A and replaces section 835E, which provides for an exclusion from transfer pricing rules for certain domestic non-trading arrangements.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that certain aspects of the transfer pricing legislation operate as intended.  The new section 835E also provides that parties to certain domestic loan arrangements may be regarded as &quot;qualifying relevant persons&quot; and fall within the exclusion, provided certain conditions are satisfied.</p><p>Following publication of the Finance Bill, it became apparent that certain<i>bona fide</i>domestic non-trading arrangements, which were similar in nature to qualifying loan arrangements, were not specifically provided for within the exclusion.  Therefore, I am now making provision to include additional domestic non-trading arrangements within the scope of section 835E.  These amendments extend the exclusion from transfer pricing rules for domestic non-trading arrangements in the following circumstances, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  The first is where an individual, tax resident in the State, provides a loan to a trading company or rental company to which they are associated.  The second is where a company within the charge to corporation tax or an individual within the charge to income tax, in each case as a supplier, is owed a debt by either a trading company or rental company which arose from a supply of goods, services or assets.  Of note is that it is only the debt and not the arrangement or part of an arrangement that gives rise to the debt that will be excluded by this amendment.  The third is where a replacement loan is used to repay a loan that previously qualified as a qualifying loan arrangement, in which case the replacement loan will be treated as having been used for the same purpose as the original loan.  Of note is that the replacement loan must satisfy the other necessary conditions.  The final circumstance is where intragroup debt is created between two associated companies as a result of the acquisition of ordinary shares or a subscription for ordinary shares in a trading company or rental company where all of the other necessary conditions for a qualifying loan arrangement are satisfied.</p><p>The other amendments I propose to make are minor in nature and include some updates to cross-references and other minor technical updates.  I commend these amendments to the committee.  I am considering a Report Stage amendment with respect to this section.</p></speech>

It is good to make the rules clearer.  However, I would be concerned if it would allow for the possibility of transfer pricing arrangements via special purpose vehicles, SPVs, and financial vehicle corporations, which appear to take place at arm's length because they use the orphan ownership-type structure we discussed yesterday.  In reality, these are essential intragroup transactions designed for the purpose of tax minimisation.  If a company uses an orphan structure with legal trustees holding the issued share capital, will Revenue and the Central Bank look to find the ultimate beneficial owner when trying to ascertain whether transfer pricing arrangements are being used?</p></speech>

Some international experts are worried about the strength of Ireland's CFC, rules.  I welcome that companies that appear on the EU's new blacklist will no longer be able to avail of exemptions, but I am worried about those companies that are not on the list.  No EU jurisdictions are on the list.  Although these measures spring from the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive, I am concerned that the rules, despite today's welcome amendments, are unlikely to succeed in their aim of curbing aggressive multinational tax avoidance.  Will the Government publish any publicly available data on the impact that blacklisting has on financial flows between Ireland and jurisdictions on the blacklist?  Will a report be published to give us an update on the blacklist?</p></speech>

These rules will not apply to countries that are not on that list.  The rules are demanding in nature and will only apply to countries that are put on this list by a decision of the EU.  Those countries are seem to be unco-operative in terms of fair and effective taxation.</p> <p>  I imagine that most of the information on the operation of the list will be prepared by the EU, but I will see if there is any domestic source of information that I can share with the committee.  If there are national pieces of data that would aid the committee in evaluating these rules, I will see if they are available and share them with it.</p></speech>

Where a farm is transferred into joint ownership, the farmers must own and farm the asset for the next ten years before they can qualify for the capital gains tax retirement relief.  This is preventing farms from being transferred into joint ownership and is a disincentive to female participation in agriculture.</p><p>Where a farmer has owned and used the asset for ten years and it is transferred into joint names, the transferee's spouse should inherit the same ownership and usage status as his or her spouse who had been farming the land up to that point.  This amendment just seeks to clarify that in terms of the retirement relief for capital gains tax.  It will not be used often, but this situation is acting as barrier to the transfer of land to joint owners.</p><p>A number of years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Iringa in Tanzania to see an Irish Aid project that was being run by Concern.  Irish taxpayers' money was involved in assisting women to get their land into joint ownership.  The Irish taxpayer was successful in that initiative, which gave equal power and control to the husband and wife in terms of the land's ownership.  We are encouraging joint ownership of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa, yet this anomaly in Ireland is putting in place an unfair barrier to women having joint ownership.</p><p>I am seeking a small alteration to the definition to ensure that it will not act as a barrier to the transfer of farmland from one spouse to joint ownership.</p></speech>

The provision allows for the aggregation of periods of ownership of the qualifying asset by each spouse or civil partner for the purposes of the ten-year ownership test.  It does not, however, extend and aggregate the use of the assets in the same manner.  The exception to this is in the case where one of the spouses or civil partners has died.</p> <p>  I am aware that the issue to which the Deputy's amendment relates was raised in the context of the 2014 review to which he referred.  Nevertheless, I will make a number of points in this regard.  First, the aim of the relief is to encourage timely disposal of a business or farm to the next generation.  Second, the relief applies to an individual and, therefore, where both spouses meet the criteria, both can benefit from the relief separately, thereby doubling the relief available to the couple.  Where only one spouse qualifies, that person will still be able to avail of the relief.  Third, and most important, this is not an anomaly.  The inclusion of the usage requirement ensures that the individual qualifying for the relief is genuinely active in the farm or business.  This is a fundamental requirement.</p> <p>  A provision allowing that in cases of joint ownership, both owners will be eligible for retirement relief if either is eligible could allow for tax avoidance and greatly expand the scope of the relief.  This is because if the disposal is outside the family or the disposer is over the age of 66, there are limits to the proceeds or consideration on which relief can be claimed.  If couples could both claim relief in cases where either of them qualifies, they could effectively double the relief available to them by putting their assets in joint names just before the transfer of the assets, even in cases where one spouse had never used the asset, that is, had not worked on the farm.  It is for those reasons that I cannot accept the Deputies' amendment.</p></speech>

I am seeking a report into the issue to see whether it is possible to ensure that a mechanism is in place that will not discourage the joint ownership of farmland.  There are many barriers to this happening.  From a policy perspective, we all agree it is important that each spouse has equal ownership of the farmland and we do not want a barrier to be put in place in that regard.</p> <p>  I accept the point the Minister made about not wanting to create a tax avoidance element by altering the legislation as it stands, but I am seeking a review to see whether a mechanism can be found to get over this barrier to transferring land into both names, without creating a tax avoidance loophole.  Will the Minister and his officials reconsider this and see whether there is a mechanism to meet the objectives he set?  I do not disagree with those.  He might also try to facilitate, insofar as is possible, as much land as possible being transferred into joint ownership.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that in putting forward the amendment, he is not in any way seeking to indirectly facilitate tax avoidance.  I fully understand that and the policy issue he wishes to address but I do not believe that the Bill is the place in which a commitment to reports should be put into law.</p> <p>  I am, however, willing to prepare a note for the committee that we will share with it perhaps by the end of this year, although we have to focus on getting the Bill passed.  We will share that with the Deputy and that might be a way in which he can better understand the issues to which I refer.  If options are available - although to manage expectations, I am not sure they will be - we will lay them out in the note.  If that is of help to the Deputy, given that he has raised the matter, I will be happy to do that.  In return, I ask him to consider not pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Under that Act, land being disposed of still attracts these reliefs where the solar panels installed do not exceed 50% of the total area of land concerned.</p><p>The difficulty is there is an ambiguity surrounding the definition as laid out in the legislation and this is deterring many farmers from considering entering into land leases for solar projects.  As the Minister will know well from our discussions through the years, the objective is that by 2030, 70% of the energy on our grid will be renewable.  Having solar as part of that mix is vital and we need to ensure that landowners are prepared to consider leasing land for the installation of solar panels.  Clarity needs to be brought to the existing legislation with a small amendment.  The calculations that are used to determine the area of land on which the solar panels are installed should include only the footprint of the structures that mount the solar panels and the ancillary equipment such as service roads but exclude any area capable of being grazed by livestock.</p><p>There is a lack of clarity as to the definition of the 50% of land that is covered by solar panels.  All these solar panels are mounted at a height that allows sheep to graze under them.  That grazing area should be allowed as agricultural land in the calculation of the footprint of the solar panels.  The lack of clarity in the legislation is causing a great deal of concern for farmers because the liability, if that definition is not clarified, is significant and is an inhibiting factor to farmers signing up to these leases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#H00900"><p>Prior to the Finance Act 2017, agricultural land that was leased for solar panels was not classified as qualifying agricultural property for the purposes of capital gains tax retirement relief or agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax.</p><p>Following a review of the tax treatment of the installation of solar panels on farmland in 2017, a change to this approach was announced in budget 2018.</p><p> Under this revised approach, it is possible for land leased for the installation of solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural property under certain conditions.  A key condition is that the total area of land under lease and on which solar panels are installed does not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.  </p><p> Revenue requires that the total area within the perimeter of the land that has been leased by the developer and on which solar panels have been installed is counted for the purposes of calculating the proportion of land given over to this alternate use.  In other words, the entire area that has been leased is counted.  This includes the marginal areas of land that lie between and around the rows of solar panels that have been installed. </p><p> The view of Revenue is that it would not generally be possible to farm any land on which equipment for the production of renewable energy is installed.  Due to the large scale and high density nature of solar operations, large areas of agricultural land are removed from normal productive agricultural activity.  To maintain the policy objective of agricultural relief, a 50% limit on the amount of land that can be diverted to this alternative use is in place.</p><p> From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, we believe clarity is in place to allow a determination of what land has been used for and the effect, therefore, it has on claiming tax relief.  If the Deputy has particular matters in which this clarity is not apparent for individual cases and shares them with me I will, in turn, share them with the Revenue Commissioners and ask that they respond to him.  From a policy point of view, the Revenue and I are satisfied that there is clarity regarding land use.  I reiterate that if the Deputy is aware of individual matters that the Revenue should consider &ndash; I am sure they have already considered them - if he shares with me I will, in turn, share them with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

The nub of the issue is that I do not think any of the Revenue Commissioners is a sheep farmer.  The problem is with the definition.  The definition, as outlined by the Revenue Commissioners, is that the area around and between solar panels is considered the area for calculation that is suitable for farming.</p> <p>  The reality is that under these solar panels the grass continues to grow.  These solar panels are mounted quite high and sheep can and do easily graze under them.  While the land in question complies with good farming practice under the rules and regulations of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, because it has been grazed by sheep and maintained, the difficulty arises in the Revenue definition.  </p> <p>  It has stated that the area under the solar panel, which is being actively grazed by sheep, cannot be considered agricultural land.  This is the nub of the issue.  The difficulty is the definition set out by the Revenue Commissioners, which refers to the area around rather than under the solar panels where grass continues to grow and sheep can and do graze.  I would be quite happy to bring the Minister to a solar farm and show him exactly how it operates.  I will give him one or two lambs to bring home.</p></speech>

It would appear that farmers of all varieties work within the Revenue Commissioners.  At some point, when the public health guidance allows, I will certainly take the Deputy up on his offer to have a look at land that allows the grazing of lambs and its use for solar energy production at the same time.</p> <p>  As I said, from a policy point of view, it appears that there is clarity that allows the Revenue Commissioners to operate this relief.  I do not need to tell the Deputy that the reliefs in place in respect of the inheritance of agricultural property are significant.  They allow a very significant reduction in the taxable value of property.  That is done for good policy reasons.  We have to ensure, therefore, that the land that is participating in this tax relief is being used for genuine agricultural purposes.</p> <p>  It is for that reason I believe the policy as structured at the moment is clear and effective.  I reiterate that if there are individual cases that the Deputy wants me to bring to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, I am very happy to do so.  I will take him up on his offer of looking at lambs at some point in the future.</p></speech>

I take him at his word.  The difficulty is that I am talking about genuine farming and the grazing of this land.  I am not talking about people who are trying to avoid paying tax.  It is a significant barrier to the roll-out of renewable energy across the country, in particular the deployment of solar panels.</p> <p>  We have the mother and father of all charges in trying to achieve 70% renewable electricity on our grid by 2030.  That is based on our current electricity demand, never mind the petrol that is being put on this particular fire with the number of data centres being connected to the grid.  Unless we can actively encourage farmers to start installing solar panels on their land, we are not going to get anywhere near our 2030 targets.  </p> <p>  This particular definition excludes the area of land under a solar panel that is being grazed not just by lambs but also by ewes because they are a significant height off the ground and allow daylight to get in and grass to grow.  This land is being actively grazed under solar panels and, because of that, should be considered agricultural land.  It cannot have cattle on it, but it can have sheep grazing on it and there is no reason it should fail to comply with the definition.  The difficulty is that the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of agricultural land in this instance is very different from the practical reality.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

The intention behind section 22 of the Bill is to provide that transfers between accounts of the same person in the same foreign currency do not give rise to a gain or loss where there is no corresponding economic gain or loss.</p><p>Section 22 took effect by way of a budget night resolution and applies to disposals made on or after 14 October in order to prevent tax avoidance opportunities before the Finance Bill becomes law.  A further amendment is now required to section 22 in order to clarify that in relation to a subsequent disposal of the foreign currency, the base cost of that foreign currency for capital gains tax will be its original base cost, that is, the cost of the foreign currency before any transfers between bank accounts of the same person took place.  By putting in place this amendment, the budget night resolution underpinning section 22 will cease to have effect.  The original intention behind the amendment, that transfers between accounts of the same person in the same foreign currency do not give rise to a gain or a loss where there is no corresponding economic gain or loss, would take effect from the date of the passing of the Finance Act.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 134 is, relatedly, to have a report on that proposal.  The Minister and I have had this discussion on a number of occasions in the past.  The reality is that within the agricultural sector, there is no alternative to diesel at present.  We do not have electric tractors or hybrid vehicles and the agricultural sector is hugely dependent on green diesel.  I am arguing, as have many others, that we should not be applying a carbon tax where there is no alternative available to diesel.</p> <p>  The principle behind a carbon tax is to encourage people to move to alternative fuels.  The objective behind it is not to bring in additional revenue for the Exchequer but to get people to move to alternative forms of energy.  In the case of agriculture, there is no alternative to agricultural diesel at the moment.  There may well be at some stage in the future but it is not available at present and because of that, we should not be applying a carbon tax to agricultural diesel.  Agricultural diesel is marked diesel because it is used for a specific purpose within the agricultural sector.  </p> <p>  The Minister will come back and make the argument that there is a rebate scheme in place.  That is available for some farmers who have a tax liability but contractors and many farmers who do not have a tax liability are having to pay this particular carbon tax when there is no alternative fuel available to them.</p> <p>  If we accept the principle that carbon tax is not about bringing in more money to the Exchequer and is about trying to drive change across society and the economy to more fuel efficient and cleaner vehicles, we have to accept the principle that we cannot charge it on agricultural fuel because an alternative does not exist at present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#K02300"><p>Okay.  Amendment No. 134, as the Deputy has said, focuses on the agricultural sector and amendment No. 133 is much broader than that.  He has spoken on amendment No. 134 so I will confine my comments to that for now.  The main exposure that the agricultural sector faces to carbon tax is through the use of marked gas oil, MGO, also known as agricultural diesel or green diesel.  It is already subject to an exceptionally low rate of mineral oil tax, much lower than that applied to auto diesel.  The rate of mineral oil tax on MGO is currently 11.8 cent per litre and it will increase to 13.8 cent per litre in May 2021, following the application of the increase in carbon tax.  This compares very favourably with the current rate of mineral oil tax applied to auto diesel, which is 51.5 cent per litre.</p> <p>  In budget 2012, my predecessor made provision for a double income tax relief for farmers to compensate for the increase in carbon tax at the time.  Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel, and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel, which is the 2012 baseline.</p><p>This relief continues to apply.  While I am mindful of the point made by Deputy Naughten that any change in carbon taxation does have an effect on those who are paying it, and I accept that, on the other hand a set of very comprehensive reliefs and supports is in place for the agricultural sector that I believe gives very strong recognition of the challenges it faces as we adjust to a lower carbon future.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#L00200"><p>The difficulty I have is that not only are we discussing the increase in carbon tax from next spring but we are looking at increasing the carbon tax for agricultural fuel from now until 2030.  I will deal with this incremental increase in carbon taxes in far more detail when discussing one of my later amendments.  Specifically at this point, we are looking at an additional carbon tax on the agricultural sector of &euro;27.3 million next year.  This is a sector that does not have an alternative available to it.</p> <p>  The objective behind all of these carbon taxes is that, over time as people buy new cars and upgrade their heating systems, they would move to more carbon efficient alternatives or zero carbon alternatives.  This is the objective behind the introduction of carbon taxes.  This should be done in incremental blocks rather than annually because if it is done on an annual basis, people tend to absorb it rather than being motivated to change.  In the case of the agricultural sector and the farming community, there is not an alternative for them to move to.  Diesel is the only fuel that can currently be used in the agricultural sector.  Farmers cannot go and get an electric tractor.  The machinery is not available.</p> <p>  The Minister made a point regarding the rebates in the agricultural sector.  They are all well and good if someone has a significant tax liability but the reality is, as shown consistently by Teagasc farm surveys, that many farmers are not making enough income on their farms to generate a tax liability in the first instance.  As a result, they are not in a position to claim the relief back for diesel.  The practicality is that farmers do not have an alternative so why are we taxing them in the manner we are?  This is turning out to be purely a tax rather than an environmental tool to get people to change.</p></speech>

Unlike every other tax I will debate with the Deputy on the Finance Bill, we will not use the revenue from carbon taxation to fund general expenditure.  We are using it purely with the objective of putting in place the incentives, plans and changes needed to lower the use of carbon in Ireland.</p> <p>  I listened carefully to the point the Deputy made on the effect of this increase in carbon tax on the agricultural sector.  I recognise the consequences the sector faces and I acknowledge this.  The reliefs I outlined earlier offer a very high degree of support for our farmers in dealing with carbon pricing changes.  This is legitimate and needed given the difficulty they have in changing their vehicles or getting new vehicles with low levels of diesel use.  This is why these reliefs are in place.  I repeat that the changes made in 2012 by the then Minister, Michael Noonan, offer a very high level of support to farmers in coping with the changes that will arise as a result of carbon pricing going up.</p> <p>  The Deputy understands the value of these changes as a former Minister in this area.  He made the case for the change being incremental.  This is what we are doing.  We are making incremental changes year by year and we are committing to making these changes for the next number of years until we get to a level of carbon taxation that experts believe can make a difference to the amount of carbon used in Ireland.  I will conclude by emphasising that the changes made in the budget of 2012 offer a very high level of protection to farmers in dealing with the income consequences of carbon taxes going up.</p></speech>

I do not dispute this but the fact is that a very large proportion of farmers in this country do not have a tax liability because they are making very little, if nothing, from their farms at present.  The reliefs are all well and good but farmers cannot access them unless they actually have a liability to pay tax in the first place.  This is part of the problem.</p> <p>  I will go into greater detail later but I am arguing against an incremental increase in carbon tax on an annual basis.  The Minister needs to do it on a step-change basis and I said this to him when I was in my previous role as Minister with responsibility for the environment.  With incremental slow change, people will absorb the tax rather than act upon it.  It will not bring about the type of motivational change needed.  If the Minister did it in big blocks of changes every three or four years, it would act as a much bigger motivator.  I will come back to this point later.  I do not want to dwell on it now.</p> <p>  The Minister said the objective behind the carbon tax is that it will be ring-fenced to be used to lower the use of carbon throughout the economy.  I welcome this principle.  The difficulty is that &euro;27 million will be collected from the agricultural sector in 2021 in carbon taxes and none of this money will be put back into lowering carbon usage in the agricultural sector.  This is the difficulty I have.  The tools, mechanisms and vehicles are not there as of yet.  The point I am making is that we should not be taxing a sector when alternatives are not available.</p> <p>  We are taxing farmers and investing the revenue in diesel hybrid buses in the city of Dublin when we should be going for zero emission buses, an argument I had in the past with the Minister and the previous Minister with responsibility for transport.  I fundamentally disagree with the idea of diesel hybrid buses.  Regardless, we are subsidising diesel in Dublin Bus but using taxes on the agricultural sector, where there is not an alternative available, to fund this investment.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is why I am opposed to the approach being taken.</p></speech>

These sections provide for multi-annual increases in carbon tax.  I am concerned that they will have a consequential effect on lower income households.  In June 2019, the ESRI published the report, Carbon taxation in Ireland: distributional effects of revenue recycling policies.  In its research, the ESRI found that carbon taxation is found to be regressive, with poorer households spending a greater proportion of their income on the tax than more affluent households.  In its modelling, the ESRI found that with an increase in carbon tax by an additional &euro;30 per tonne, every household bears some cost but the cost is greatest for the poorest households.  Comparing the first and fourth quartiles, it indicated that poorer households suffer disproportionately more from carbon taxes.  In addition, single households with children are the most affected by this policy.  The trajectory set out in last year's and this year's Finance Bill is an &euro;80 per tonne increase in carbon tax.  The ESRI made it clear that the regressive nature of carbon tax can be offset by recycling revenue and offers the distributional effect of different recycling policies.</p> <p>  In its manifesto for the 2020 election, the Green Party proposed gradually increasing carbon tax in each of the next ten years until it reaches &euro;100 per tonne and introducing a mechanism to return all the revenues raised from further increases to citizens by social welfare payments and tax credits.  That policy platform seems to have been abandoned in this Finance Bill and I wish to raise a number of issues the Minister can address in this regard.  In the note provided by the Department of Finance, the combined proceeds of the 2020 and 2021 increases in carbon tax amount to &euro;238 million.  A total of &euro;48 million was allocated to targeted social protection intervention.  That is 20% of carbon tax revenues.  That is a total departure from the Green Party's manifesto proposals to return the revenue raised to households through social welfare payments, as it has reduced from 100% to 20%.  While these sections provide for multi-annual increases in carbon tax, there is no such commitment for multi-annual increases in social welfare payments to offset the regressive nature of carbon tax on lower income households.  Will the Minister make a commitment that if these sections are agreed, the Government will hard-wire multi-annual increases in social welfare payments in the upcoming social welfare Bill?</p></speech>

While I accept the principle of carbon taxes, I am opposed to this particular carbon structure approach being taken by the Government because I do not believe that a drip-feed model will motivate people to avoid paying tax and change their approach.  This is an approach I debated with the Minister around the Cabinet table.  It is an approach that I presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I know that both the Minister and the committee did not agree with my approach because politicians love gentle taxes that do not cause a political shock or pushback.  They want to introduce tax that brings in additional revenue that can be used in the approach the Minister is talking about.  I fundamentally disagree with that.  Carbon taxes should be there to encourage people to avoid paying the tax in the first place.  If we took an approach where we had significant incremental jumps in carbon tax in 2023, 2027 and 2030, it would give people an opportunity to change in the interim, whether it is to change their car or, if they are upgrading their heating system, to alter that so that it minimises the amount of tax they pay.</p> <p>  Second, I believe that our carbon tax structure should vary with the cost of a barrel of oil because if carbon taxes increase and the price of oil decreases significantly, as we have seen over the past decade, they will not have the motivational impact we all want to see happen.  On the contrary, if we increase the carbon taxes as we are planning to do and the price of oil goes through the roof, so to speak, we will grind our economy to a halt.  We need to have an approach that is flexible.  As the price of oil goes up and down, the carbon tax should go up and down to reflect that and bring about a real change in people's attitude to using fossil fuels in the first place.</p> <p>  Picking up on another point Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell raised, this particular carbon tax structure is regressive because those living in rural communities will pay far more in carbon tax than those living in urban areas.  I have already given the Minister the example in respect of agricultural diesel where farmers do not have an alternative available to them but in addition, people living in our cities who have jobs locally have local transport alternatives available to them that are not available to people in rural areas.  By the time we get to 2030 and we have a carbon tax of &euro;100 per tonne, half of the households in Dublin will be paying less than &euro;9.11 per week in transport costs when the Dublin Bus subsidy is taken into account.  On the other hand, rural commuters will be paying &euro;39.50 a week, up to four times more than those who have a bus passing the door every few minutes.  Those types of taxation structures will not motivate people out of their cars and onto buses in urban areas for &euro;9.11 a week yet, at the other end of the scale, people who are commuting long distances to work in Dublin and so forth who do not have the alternatives available to them will be paying significantly in terms of these carbon taxes.</p> <p>  This particular section, section 26, which deals with home heating oil-----</p></speech>

It discriminates against people residing in rural areas who do not have alternatives available to them.  I made the point that a family living in this city with direct access to Dublin Bus pays a weekly carbon tax - half the households in Dublin are paying a weekly carbon tax of &euro;9.11 when the Dublin Bus subsidy is taken into account - whereas rural commuters will be paying &euro;39.50 per week when the full carbon taxes are introduced.  That is four times the amount for a rural commuter compared to his or her typical urban counterpart.</p> <p>  I want to make a specific point in respect of home heating oil.  The latter is also the subject of section 26.  Based on current rates, typical rural households will pay &euro;1 more per week in carbon tax in 2030 than their counterparts in Dublin for the cost of heating their homes.  In practical terms, however, the difference will be far greater because over the next decade the Government is going to subsidise carbon removal from the gas network through the introduction of biomethane, whereas families living in rural areas will have to borrow substantially to move away from oil.  Again, whether it is transport or heating, the people who do not have alternatives available to them are going to pay significantly more in carbon tax.  That is the wrong approach to take.  While I agree with the principle of carbon taxes, I disagree with the approach that is being taken.</p></speech>

For example, out of the &euro;238 million that is now being raised in additional carbon taxes as a result of the changes made in this year's budget and in last year's, &euro;100 million is being invested in residential and community energy efficiency projects, &euro;48 million is being used to deal with the equity issues which do exist to ensure lower-income citizens are shielded from the effects of increases in carbon taxes, &euro;20 million is being invested in environmental programmes in the area of agriculture and &euro;70 million is being invested in various schemes that can make a difference to communities all over our country.  Thus, we are using the revenue from higher carbon taxes in exactly the way recommended by those who advocate increases in carbon pricing as a way of credibly responding to the climate crisis that is in front of us and that could intensify further.</p> <p>  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell put a specific question to me about why we are not making a commitment to the indexation of social welfare increases in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.  That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, but under the last two changes we have made in carbon taxing, we have made alterations to social welfare rates in order to ensure that those who are most affected by increased carbon taxes are protected.  This could be a matter that the Minister for Social Protection may want to consider but I imagine she would also want to have flexibility in case, for example, new payments are needed which do not currently exist and which are not referenced in social welfare legislation.  It is a very clear programme for Government commitment that as we make these changes in carbon taxes we will ensure those most affected by it get further protection in the form of changes to social protection payments.  We demonstrated that in the two most recent budgets.</p> <p>  As I understand it, Deputy Denis Naughten is making the case that instead of making gradual moves, we should make a smaller set of bigger moves.</p></speech>

I cannot help but feel that if we did get to 2023 and were proposing a very large move, I am not sure he would be supportive of it at that point.  If we cannot get the Deputy's agreement to a series of smaller moves, I am unsure that we would get his agreement in respect of a smaller set of big moves.  If we were to go down that path, we would have a higher level of distributional issues as a result of such a big move.  A gradual set of moves such as those we are proposing that involve protecting those who are most vulnerable through our social welfare code and giving predictability as to where we are going to end up is the fairest way of managing the kind of change we need to see happen in order to ensure that we can reduce the use of carbon in our country.</p></speech>

If one takes my constituency of Galway West, for example, there are people living in rural west Connemara who have no, or very limited and expensive, access to public transport, so for those people there will be an increase in their travel costs, and also in their heating and cooking costs.  The Economic and Social Research Institute has stated that those in lower income households are going to be hit harder by this tax.  We are being asked, in this Finance Bill, to agree to a multiannual increase of this regressive taxation, but at the same time, we cannot get confirmation that there will be a multilannual increase in social welfare payments to offset the regressive nature of this tax.  <br/><br/>The<i>Distributional Analysis of Budget 2021 Tax and Welfare Measures</i>looks at the regressive nature of the carbon tax and the reduction of VAT to 9% is included in this.  I have a query on this.  Are we making the assumption that this lowering to 9% of the VAT is going to be passed onto the customer, when realistically, it is my understanding that it was viewed as help for small businesses by absorbing the reduction on the balance sheet rather than passing it on?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that, and also put on the record that social welfare increases will not be locked in as we are being asked to lock in this regressive tax.<br/><br/>I have another question.  It relates to the view that I think we need to be taking, in a progressive sense, to deal with the climate crisis.  We know that this State is already Europe's data centre capital, with 54 data centres here, and another 31 for which planning permission has been approved.  By 2028, data centres and other large users will consume 29% of Ireland's electricity, according to EirGrid, and worldwide, data centres consume about 2% of electricity - a figure that is set to reach 8% by 2030.  Few countries, if any, will match Ireland's level of consumption.  This surge in the processing industry will increase Ireland's already excessive carbon emissions, and offset any meagre process that might result from the carbon tax, which as I have said already, punishes those in lower income households, and as we have seen, also punishes those in single-parent households.  It seems obvious to me that any talk of a carbon tax as a means to transition to a lower carbon economy needs to begin with these data centres.</p></speech>

I am not going to go into the argument today, as the Minister knows my views on the issue very well, but the one point I wish to add to Deputy Farrell's argument is that every other example of where there are large numbers of data centres, they are part of a very large electricity network.  That is not the case in Ireland, where we have an isolated stand-alone grid, and we are disproportionately impacted upon by the large number of data centres here.  However, I will leave it for another day to go into that particular debate.</p> <p>  I wish to return to a number of points made by the Minister.  He has made the point that this money is being ring-fenced for the most vulnerable and targeted towards them.  I have here in front of me correspondence from Galway County Council.  The midlands energy retrofit pilot programme, into which the carbon tax from last year was invested, is intended to target local authority houses across the midlands, most of which are in energy poverty, to try to support them in insulating their homes to bring them up to the highest possible insulation standard.  I think we all agree that people in local authority homes across the country do need to see this investment.  However, in the case of Galway County Council, its application for funding for local authority houses was only partly approved, because the Department advised it that it would only fund local authority houses that were in an an estate containing a mix of both council and private houses.  Where it was exclusively a local authority housing estate with local authority tenants in it, they were automatically excluded from this retrofit programme.  Rural local authority houses were also excluded.  I have already made the argument to the Minister that people living in rural areas are disproportionately impacted upon by carbon taxes in the structure that exists.  Local authority tenants living in rural houses were deliberately excluded from having the retrofit carried out to their particular homes.  Therefore on one hand we are saying that we are targeting the most vulnerable, then we are excluding the most vulnerable.  That is wrong, and not just in relation to this issue.  This is an approach that has been taken by Departments of housing and local government, and local authorities across the country for years, where previous retrofit programmes deliberately excluded anyone that was in arrears.  In many cases, they were the people who were struggling to pay their energy bills yet they were put to the back of the queue in terms of having any upgrade carried out on their homes.  Again now, we are seeing that those living in rural areas, who are the most rurally isolated deprived families in the country, are being deliberately excluded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in terms of having the retrofit carried out on their homes, and when we are talking about housing estates that contain exclusively local authority tenants.</p> <p>  I asked the Minister a question about how much of the &euro;27 million in carbon tax that is to be collected from farmers is going to be put back into schemes to reduce the carbon footprint in respect of agriculture.  There is not any, because those initiatives are not there at the moment, yet we are taxing that particular cohort of the population.  I think the Minister is being a bit disingenuous about what I have said on the issue of incremental jumps in carbon tax.  The Minister knows well what I am talking about because I have put it in writing to him, I have articulated it to him and I have put it to the committee prior to this occasion.  What I am talking about is introducing a completely different structure to carbon tax, and bringing it in on an incremental basis.  I accept that we need to have environmental taxes, but the core principle behind environmental taxes is that they should not bring in revenue, rather, they should be revenue neutral and should motivate people to actually change.  That is what environmental taxes are supposed to be about, instead of a confrontational approach.  For example, if we use targeted investment, we have an opportunity to actually reduce the carbon tax which motorists pay on diesel by up to 50%, as well as dealing with the problem that we have in respect of waste oils.  It is possible to blend renewable oils such as hydrotreated vegetable oils at a rate of 50% into our existing diesel that is used in transport and the agricultural sector, and there does not have to be any alteration to the existing vehicles.  That would slash the amount of carbon tax by 50% that people are actually paying in those sectors, which are two of the most difficult sectors to deal with.  We need to introduce a taxation model in this country that actually suits the Irish situation; we should not just copy and paste the models coming from Europe.  The carbon tax model that we are implementing here will work very well in continental Europe, where there are high densities of population very close to public transport in urban areas.  In Ireland, 37% of the population lives on 96% of the landmass of the country, which is the most dispersed rural population in Europe, so we need to introduce carbon and environmental taxes here that reflect the type of society and economy that we have, bringing about real change, rather than increasing revenue to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

The carbon tax and dividend model was shown by the ESRI to be the most progressive method of introducing a carbon tax in order to induce the behavioural change required to reduce emissions.  That is Green Party policy but that is not what was agreed in the programme for Government.  What was agreed was the hypothecation of the carbon tax in a number of areas to retrofit homes throughout the country, starting with those most at risk of fuel poverty and the most poorly performing housing stock.  It was also aimed at social protection measures to protect those on lower incomes who are most vulnerable to the cost of the carbon tax.  The third leg is agricultural supports, to which Deputy Denis Naughten referred, to assist and support farmers to sequester carbon and protect our environment, as well as schemes like the rural environmental protection scheme.  Those factors are built into the carbon tax model.  The ESRI was tasked with looking at and researching our recent budget and it showed that this was the most progressive and supportive model for families on lower incomes.  In that regard, our carbon tax is progressive.</p> <p>  I, too, share the concerns about data centres and how power-hungry they are.  They are being drawn here because of our cool climate, which is attractive to them, as well as our reasonably secure power supply.  Earlier today, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage discussed the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill, which will result in a massive increase in offshore renewable energy and build resilience into Ireland's energy supply.  We must move away from fossil fuels, which create carbon emissions, which are the problem.  I just wanted to make those points in response to the points raised by Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Denis Naughten.</p></speech>

He is correct about the commentary by the ESRI.  If the ESRI looked at a continental European model relating to the introduction of carbon taxes, then its commentary may very well be correct.  We need to design carbon taxes that reflect the actual situation here in Ireland.  That is not happening and is not being looked at.</p> <p>  Deputy Matthews is right to express concern about data centres, but, as the Minister for Finance and I know, offshore renewables are not going to resolve this issue.  It will be a decade at least before there is any significant development in offshore renewables coming onto the grid.  The difficulty is that many data centres will be coming on stream in a very short period.  Meeting our 70% target will require a trebling in the number of onshore wind farms and a trebling in the size of existing wind turbines.  That is if we are going to meet that 70% target based on the current modelling.</p></speech>

On Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's point, there is a very clear commitment in the programme for Government to increase social welfare allowances.  It is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection to decide if automatic indexation should be granted in respect of certain payments.  It is likely that new payments and new forms of payment will be needed in the future to ensure we continue to stand by what we have done in the last number of budgets by putting in social welfare changes to protect the most vulnerable.  In budget 2021, the increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child payment is specifically in place to support low-income families with children.  There is also an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;5 per week and an increase in the fuel allowance of &euro;3.50 per week.  This is a repetition of what we did in the previous budget, which included an increase in carbon taxation.</p> <p>  As Deputy Matthews noted, analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance using the ESRI's simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model, indicated that households in the first five income deciles will see increases in their disposable income as a result of the measures that have been implemented.  Those who would be most affected by changes in carbon taxation will be protected the most because of the changes we are making in our social welfare code.  I do not know what assumption was made about the pass on in retail pricing in the SWITCH model but last year, when we did not make any changes to the VAT rate for the hospitality and service sector, the model used by the ESRI at that point also indicated that those on the lowest incomes would be protected by the social welfare changes that were made.</p> <p>  The Deputies make an important point about data centres.  I debated this matter with Deputy Denis Naughten when he was Minister, as he acknowledged a moment ago.  We need to have a discussion on how we can ensure the continued protection and resilience of our energy systems if more data centres are located in our country.  The data centres being referred to are often accompanied by jobs in other locations in the companies building these data centres.  It would be fair to say that the data centres themselves do not employ many people once they are up and running.  The job activity tends to be in the construction of data centres, rather than their maintenance and operation.  However, they then form the kinds of investment and activity located here in Ireland that give us a better chance of retaining the jobs delivered by these companies in other locations.  While we need to evaluate how to ensure the growth of data centres does not undermine the resilience of our energy systems, they still play a valuable role in the overall mix of things we need located in our country to retain some of the larger international investment.</p> <p>  I will follow up on the point made by Deputy Denis Naughten about Galway County Council.  I was not aware of the correspondence to which he has referred and I cannot see why retrofitting and spending by the local authority should be dependent on the housing estate in which the local authority homes are located.  I will follow up on that.  I am not sure what the argument behind that is.</p><p>A local authority home is a local authority home regardless of where it is located.  I was involved in the original decisions behind this scheme and it did prioritise local authority housing but I do not recall any discussion regarding where the local authority housing is located.  Deputy Naughten might give me a copy of that correspondence when we next meet and I will follow up on it.</p><p> On his point regarding the design of the scheme and ensuring that it reflects the particular qualities of our country, I believe it does in terms of the manner in which we are allocating the revenue that comes from the higher level of carbon tax.  The Deputy made a point regarding the type of environmental programmes that are needed to support farmers in moving to lower carbon use.  He may be aware that there was an additional allocation in Budget 2021 of &euro;20 million which is designed to pilot new schemes to help offer lower carbon solutions to farmers.  I will be open and make the point that the contribution made to that scheme by the higher level of carbon pricing is &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million of that &euro;20 million, but that work is still going ahead.  It is going ahead in recognition of the point Deputy Naughten makes regarding a potential risk that those who are affected the most by some of the changes that we are referring to are those who have the lowest levels of access to public transport and would not be living within our cities.  I will relate this to something I know is very important to Deputy Naughten, namely, the national broadband plan.  It is the reason we are going ahead with this plan.  Deputy Naughten and I can recall the difficulty involved in the discussions in regard to this matter.  Ultimately, it is going ahead in order that those who commute into cities might have a chance to commute into villages that are near them instead to work in, for example, hot-desk centres or businesses that have located to towns and villages away from the busier cities or so that we are moving to the kind of hybrid work model that the Deputy and I discussed earlier in the debate on the Finance Bill.  One has to view this issue in the round.  For me, one of the strongest reasons for going ahead with the national broadband plan was the need to find a different way of addressing the issue raised by the Deputy.  </p><p> I concur with the point made by Deputy Matthews.  As he said, we ultimately did not reach agreement in regard to a full fee and dividend model although we had a lot of discussion on that point in the programme for Government negotiations but we did compromise on a model that has ensured that all of the revenues raised by higher levels of carbon taxation are being spent on priorities that, for example, had been raised by the Green Party and others.  We do recognise that there is difficulty involved in this change and we are using this money to support families, businesses and farms in dealing with the consequences of that change.  </p></speech>

Can the Minister clarify if he expects this measure to be passed on to consumers or as a business support to be absorbed by the business balance sheet?  If it is the latter, will he accept that it should not be factored into the distributional analysis carried out by his Department?  Separately, the VAT reduction is temporary, as are certain social welfare measures, so will he commit in this committee to multiannual welfare increases in every year to 2030 in line with these sections of the Bill?</p></speech>

In terms of data centres, we all accept that the direct economic activity from data centres is minimal.  Using the construction dividend in terms of it is undermining our housing programme across the country.  The Minister is correct that once these data centres are completed the amount of direct jobs generated is small.  In terms of indirect jobs, I fully accept the argument that is being made in that regard.  We have far more data centres being developed in this country than just those linked to high value jobs across our economy.  </p> <p>   As I have said previously to the Minister at Cabinet, I believe it is immoral that families across this country who are struggling to pay electricity bills should be subsidising the cost of electricity supplied to data centres across the country.  I firmly believe that is immoral and I argued vehemently in that regard at Cabinet, as reflected in the Government policy statement issued on the matter.  This particular element of the commitment in that policy statement has yet to be implemented.  We need data centres paying for their own costs in terms of the electricity infrastructure that is being put in place and in terms of the generation of green electricity.  This cost should never be put on the backs of struggling families across this country.  I accept the type of model that is being introduced here in terms of carbon tax is an allocation of revenue approach.  This is where we fundamentally differ.  I believe that if an environmental tax is structured well it should not create the revenue in the first instance.  It should motivate people to change and avoid the tax being generated in the first instance.  That is the difference between our two approaches in regard to this issue.</p> <p>  I will make two final points.  In terms of agriculture, the Minister will know that the &euro;3 million that is being invested this year in the pilot environmental scheme is the same &euro;3 million invested last year in the pilot environmental scheme that never went ahead and is now being rolled over into next year.  I made the point earlier that none of the &euro;27 million that will be paid out of farmers' pockets next year in carbon taxes will go back into the agricultural sector.  That is the fundamental weakness in terms of the model and approach that the Minister is taking at the moment.</p> <p>  The Minister is 100% correct that the national broadband plan is very much about reducing the emissions profile of people in rural communities.  I know that the Green Party had opposed it in opposition.  The leader of the Green Party was very critical that his own constituency would end up with poorer broadband than rural areas and he did not agree with it for that reason.  Is that the reason there is no additional money being put into the national broadband plan over and above the money that the Minister and I agreed to be invested next year to help fast-track the delivery of the national broadband plan, which we both agree would help to reduce the emissions profile of people living in rural communities?</p></speech>

Some businesses will pass it on while others will not.  I know the VAT reduction is a move that Sinn F&eacute;in was supportive of.  In my response to the Deputy about this point earlier, I specifically said I was not sure how the ESRI counted for the VAT move in this year's model.  I thank her for reminding me, and for telling me what it did, but I also said that in last year's modelling of this, which did not take account of any reduction in pricing, because the VAT levels were unchanged, it still did find that the measures we took in last year's budget to offset the increase in carbon taxation did protect the most vulnerable.  Our commitment to continue to do this is laid out in a programme for Government commitment.  I will pass on to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the point on whether certain payments should be indexed as well, but it may be the case that new payments need to be created to deal with the challenge of continuing to protect families that have the lowest level of income from changes that are happening with carbon taxation.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Naughten, we have covered off the issue concerning data centres.  The reason more money was not put into the national broadband plan is because the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told me that the main difficulty we have in accelerating the roll-out of the national broadband plan next year is the logistical difficulties of trying to accelerate the pace of work, rather than funding.  If it is the case that funding can be put in place to accelerate the roll-out of the national broadband plan there will be other opportunities to fund it later in the year.  The national broadband plan is the other piece in this jigsaw.</p> <p>  Regarding the point Deputy Naughten made about the &euro;3 million, I did make reference to &euro;20 million.  Overall, the fund is &euro;20 million.  I did say that &euro;3 million of it was coming from carbon price and carbon taxing again.  It is a fair point.  This may be the continuation of the &euro;3 million from last year's budget but the &euro;17 million extra is not.</p></speech>

These big military forces have a massive impact on the environment.  The US military is one of the largest polluters in history.  It consumes more liquid fuels and emits more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries.  The F-15 fighter jet uses 25 gallons of fuel per minute, or 1,580 gallons per hour.  My mind boggled when I saw this come up in the Finance Bill.  Will the Minister provide an explanation as to why he is proposing this because I cannot see any rhyme or reason to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#X00400"><p>We are discussing parts of the Bill which provide for tax exemptions for NATO forces and European security and defence forces and other arrangements.  One section allows for excise duty to be waived while another allows for VAT to be waived.  This applies to canteen facilities, which would include food and drink.  This may apply in a variety of circumstance, including when troops are here on exercises, manoeuvres and so on.</p> <p>  We have to put this matter in a certain context.  Part of that context is the presidential election in the US.  A new Administration is due to come to power in January.  Another backdrop to this is the issue of Brexit.  At this juncture, powerful forces within Europe, particularly the German and French states, are pushing for the increased militarisation of Europe.  Yesterday, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, talked about the European Union building up what he described as security autonomy.  Effectively, this means the militarisation of Europe.  Today, the German defence minister has put forward a view which is slightly different but which points in the same direction.  She suggested that Germany and Europe, while not replacing US forces in Europe, need to take more responsibility within the framework of the so-called shared relationship.  The push for militarisation in Europe is not unrelated to the EU directive which puts an onus on each EU member state to waive excise duty and VAT for NATO forces and EU security and defence arrangements in respect of canteen facilities in various countries which, as I have said, include food and drink.</p> <p>  I suspect that the Minister will argue that this is an EU directive of no major consequence, that the sums of money that would accrue to the State if those VAT and excise duty arrangements were to remain in place would not be significant, and so on.  There are two points I would make in that regard.  First, it is of symbolic importance that we say no to militarisation and to the militarisation of the EU.  Second, it is not impossible to push back against an EU directive.  This can, and should, be done in this case.</p> <p>  My second point is that while big sums of money are not currently involved, the fact that we are being asked to implement an EU directive of this kind may point to the possibility that in the future, if not next year or the year after then maybe some years hence, more NATO activity or EU military activity will be taking place in the State.  I refer to battle groups and the like.  It is fair to ask whether there is a connection.</p> <p>  The final point I would make on this issue is that this Finance Bill has been put forward by the Government parties - Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  It does not surprise me in the least that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are putting their names to this measure but attention should be drawn to the fact that this policy is being backed by the Green Party and its representatives.  The Green Party made a name for itself and built a reputation in this country in part due to its opposition, in words at least although sometimes in deeds, to the militarisation of Europe and to the politics of militarisation.  The fact that the Green Party is signing up to this policy, however small it might be, is a real sign of that party's direction of travel and of how it has left behind some of its best traditions.  As I have said, this has symbolic importance at the very least and we should say no to it.  That is why I will be voting against these proposals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#X00500"><p>This section amends section 104 of the Finance Act 2001 to align Irish excise legislation with the provisions of the EU general excise directive.  This directive requires member states to apply a relief to excisable products that are supplied to the armed forces of any state which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty other than the armed forces of the EU state within which the excise duty is chargeable.  It also requires that a similar relief be applied, with effect from 1 July 2022, to forces of member states undertaking a common defence effort under the European Union&rsquo;s common security and defence policy, other than the armed forces of the EU state within which the excise duty is chargeable.  This amendment is therefore necessary to transpose relevant provisions of the general excise directive into Irish legislation.</p> <p>  In response to the point made by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, it is important to note that the provisions of the general excise directive that are being transposed are already applicable in Ireland as the directive is directly applicable to Irish law in this regard.  This does not arise as an issue in Ireland because the provisions only apply to the delivery of excisable products within a member state intended to be used by the armed forces of another member state or their accompanying civilian staff.</p><p>As there is no change to the constitutional provisions relating to armed forces, which effectively prohibits foreign forces being based or maintained within the State, I do not expect these excise provisions to change anything.  To be very clear, in order for this to be a charge on the State it would require foreign forces to be present here in such a way that they can claim this excise relief.  As the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are very clear in standing over the constitutional provisions on neutrality this is not a matter that will occur.  The longstanding foreign policy priority of protecting the neutrality of our country is utterly unchanged by this.  This section is the transposition of something that is a general excise directive and it in no way affects our commitment to our provisions on our neutrality.</p><p> On Deputy Farrell's point, because of our standing over our neutrality I cannot see any circumstances in which this would protect or create a charge within our jurisdiction.  Deputy Barry's concerns around European security sovereignty and developing a defence capability for the European Union are indeed worthy of debate but they are not affected by the passage of this section.</p></speech>

I do not understand why this section needs to be provided for.  I need more clarification.  The Minister is saying that because Ireland is a neutral State there will not be any impact by this at all.  Will the Minister clarify what the impact will be?</p></speech>

The Minister has said that Irish neutrality is safe in his hands.  He did not say those words but that is the gist of it.  The problem here is that I do not believe that.  There are other parties and other Deputies in the House, and plenty of people in society, who do not believe that.  We could point to many examples, but none that illustrates the point more clearly than what has been happening at Shannon Airport for many a long year.  The question raised by Deputy Farrell is a very strong point.  Why would the Minister introduce a policy that is never going to be used and will never have any consequences, unless it is going to be used at some stage and it does have some consequences.  One could flip it on its head and say that because it is never going to be used and because it is never going to have any consequences we are not going to bring it in.</p></speech>

Because our neutrality is very clear, those circumstances will not arise in our country.  As to Deputy Barry's question on why I am going ahead with the implementation of this directive, if I do not go ahead with the directive now that I am aware of this issue I would have to seek a derogation from it.  I tend to seek derogations in matters that would materially affect our economic or political interests as a State.  This section is not one of those things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#Y00500"><p>If we want to state clearly and categorically that we are a neutral State then we absolutely should be pushing back on this.  I believe there is no question on this matter.  The mind boggles that this was not already pushed back before it was brought to this point.  If we want to make it very clear, and we need to be a lot clearer, that we are a neutral State then we should be pushing back on this.  I ask the Minister for Finance to do that on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

If we are looking to send signals about our neutrality we will find far better opportunities, and there might be a far greater need in the future, than with regard to the implementation of an excise directive.  This does not influence our neutrality.  I am bringing it in because to use a derogation on an issue I do not believe will arise inside our jurisdiction is not a good use of a derogation on behalf of our country.  A liability only arises if an activity takes place in our jurisdiction.  This will not present a charge to us in the future.  The commitment we have to our neutrality is clear and unaffected by this.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that this is the first time we are entering into Irish law provisions that would apply if there was a foreign army in the State?  It is not insignificant.  The intentions of the Government in the future on neutrality is one thing, and we would all question how that has been eroded, but this section actually provides for circumstances where a foreign army in the State would be tax exempt in relation to VAT.  It is a wild statement, and if it was suggested a couple of years ago that this was something that could be countenanced one would say: "You are daft and off your head, of course no Irish Government would be putting such a piece of text into Irish financial law."  No harm to Deputy Matthews, but it would definitely not be one to be supported by the Green Party.  I hear what the Minister has said on what the triggers would be for this section to apply, but nonetheless this text suggests that in certain circumstances this would apply.  It is quite significant that we are even putting into Irish law preparations that would allow for provisions to apply if foreign armies were in our State.</p><p>There have been foreign armies on our island for the past 800 years but that is a different matter and it would take us all night to discuss that.  What is being asked is significant and it should not be lost on anybody.  There was a way to deal with this through a derogation but instead the Government has asked us to amend the law to allow for this type of circumstance, which nobody should do, especially those who value neutrality and who have a concern with the slippage in neutrality.</p><p> I mention the Minister's old buddy who is in with the heads of the vulture funds and banks, former Deputy, Brian Hayes.  Does the Minister remember the document he brought out on behalf of Fine Gael called Beyond Neutrality?  That was an official policy document at the time, which stated that we needed to go beyond neutrality.  This is significant and on that basis this should be opposed.</p></speech>

It is an equally significant statement if a member of Government reassures the committee that this does not impact on our neutrality.  At the start of her questioning to me, Deputy Farrell asked how a charge could be created and I explained that because of our neutrality, a charge would not be created due to the implementation of this directive.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty referred to other strands of opinion within Fine Gael and that is a strand of opinion that I do not agree with.  I believe our neutrality is an essential element of our foreign policy identity within the EU.  Sinn F&eacute;in has had, until recently, a poor view overall of the general development of the Union.  I have to protect and negotiate on behalf of our country within the EU and it is my recommendation to this committee that use of a derogation on this matter is not a good way to manage such derogations.  It is implementing an excise directive, which will have no effect on our neutrality whatsoever.</p></speech>

The Minister should not lose the significance of that.  He is asking Oireachtas Members in a neutral country to legislate for that, which is serious.  He pointed out the different strands of opinion within his party - and I accept he does not share those opinions - but that was the official policy of the party at that time in the policy document authored by former Deputy, Brian Hayes, and there are others who have different views.  We understand that this would not be triggered today but it could be triggered in the future and for the first time ever, the Minister is asking us to legislate to allow for how this would have an effect for taxation purposes on NATO troops on our soil.  How could we support that when there are other options?  The Minister contended that a derogation should not be sought but we get derogations on many issues.  He also contended that the easier option is to legislate for the first time for foreign NATO troops on Irish soil and what that would mean.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

We are having this debate at precisely when in the past 24 hours there have been key statements from the French President and the German defence minister basically calling for the EU to step up its spending and its emphasis on so-called defence.  In reality, this is a push for the militarisation of Europe.  That is the background and the context from the past 24 hours that debates of this kind are being held in.</p> <p>  The Minister speaks as though he has a limited number of derogations that he can push the button on in the same way one has a limited number of chips in a poker game or something like that.  There is no limit.  There is no problem or particular consequence if Ireland says it will not agree to this and will not sign up to this.  Whatever about the immediate practical consequences, there is an important symbolic consequence to Ireland speaking out strongly and clearly saying that we are fundamentally opposed to this militarisation that is being promoted in the past 24 hours.  This is a small but significant way in which that point can and should be made.</p></speech>

We are seeing a massive increase in military spending in the EU.  Between 2004 and 2006, &euro;65 million was spent and now we are looking at billions of euro.  We have also agreed to the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, which sees an increase in our military spending so I agree with Deputy Barry.  It would definitely be a strong pushback from this committee and State to show we are a neutral state and that we want to remain so if we sought this derogation.</p></speech>

The context of this is a long-standing commitment to neutrality on behalf of the Irish State and the idea that the implementation of this section in any way diminishes or affects the commitment that we have to our neutrality is completely wrong.  Furthermore, if at some point in the future, a Government was in a situation in which it was making a decision on the presence of NATO forces in Ireland, the ability of that Government to claim relief on excise duty would not be a relevant factor in that decision.  The context is all and this does not affect our commitment to our neutrality.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#BB00200"><p>I will comment on section 34 as well as section 32 to avoid repeating myself later.  I have an issue with the worldwide harmonised light vehicle testing procedure because it is nothing more than another three-card trick.  We have seen what happened previously with Volkswagen and some car manufacturers whereby they used sleight of hand in terms of the emissions from their vehicles.  While we now have a harmonised system for measuring emissions, a laboratory test is still being used to set the emissions for these vehicles rather than an actual emissions profile.</p> <p>  The reason we need to move away from laboratory tests and directly link emissions profiles to motor tax for vehicles is that it will bring about the type of transformational change needed in transport emissions, without having to go down the road of raising carbon taxes, which we spoke about earlier.  This has already been proven.  If one recalls when the Green Party were last in government, it altered the motor taxation system to incentivise the purchase of diesel vehicles.  The scheme was a phenomenal success, far more successful than anyone had expected at the time.  In fact, its success has led to a problem with air quality in our cities caused by particulate matter because we discovered that diesel vehicles are far more polluting and damaging to air quality and life expectancy, particularly in cities, than petrol vehicles.  When I was a member of Cabinet I made a submission on this to the Minister, and I previously made a submission to the committee on climate change.  If we were to replicate the measures that were taken over a decade ago when the Green Party was last in government and altered motor tax on the basis of the actual emissions profile of vehicles, that would be a far more effective tool to drive the type of change we need.  It would also act as a very effective congestion charge.</p> <p>  People living in Dublin who choose, despite having a bus route outside their door or access to the Luas, to sit in their diesel vehicles and drive 5 km to and from work on congested roads, have an emissions profile for their vehicles that is far higher than the profiles under the worldwide harmonised light vehicle testing procedure standards.  A vehicle that travels long distances from a rural area would have a profile much closer to those in the laboratory tests because it is being driven at a much more efficient rate than vehicles in urban areas.  My proposal would also incentivise people who travel and commute long distances to drive at 100 km/h rather than 120 km/h.  As we all know, vehicles travelling at 100 km/h are far more efficient and produce far less emissions than vehicles travelling at 120 km/h.  In the past, it was suggested that the speed limit on motorways be reduced to 100 km/h.  If we used the actual emissions profile of each vehicle, we would not need to alter the speed limit because people would reduce speed by osmosis.  This change would also encourage people to avoid travelling in rush hour and park their cars a bit further away from school or work and walk the last kilometre, thereby reducing the emissions profile of their vehicles.  </p> <p>  How then do we measure the emissions profile of vehicles?  This could be done through an altered national car test using new technology.  If, at the end of the national car test, drivers received a certificate detailing the emissions profile and they taxed their vehicle based on that profile, it would be a far more effective tool.  It would also incentivise people to choose HVO, which I spoke about earlier, as it has a reduced emissions profile compared with ordinary diesel.  It would encourage people to convert diesel vehicles to natural gas or switch to petrol, hybrid and electric vehicles, which would be more efficient.  Over time, this would be a far more effective tool in driving the type of change we need to see in Irish society.  I know this would be unique to Ireland but it is the way we should go.  For this reason, I oppose the approach being taken in sections 32 and 34.</p></speech>

Does the Minister agree that the distributional benefits of this measure are geared towards higher earners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#CC00100"><p>I will deal with the different points that were raised.  In response to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, some cars that have the lowest possible CO2 emission, which would be in the first band of vehicle registration tax, VRT, are clearly more expensive than the average car, but plenty of cars on the lower bands of VRT, bands 2, 3 and 4, have a very low level of VRT and are not the most expensive cars in the market.  When we are designing a structure like this, we need to give the lowest VRT rate to the vehicles that have the lowest emissions.  However, other bands have very low levels of VRT for cars which are not the most expensive energy-efficient cars on the market.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughten is correct in stating this is a laboratory test.  However, it differs from the other kind of testing that has happened in that it is laboratory testing that more accurately simulates road conditions.  I disagree profoundly with the Deputy that this is in any way a three-card trick.  This is a method of testing CO2 emissions that is significantly more accurate than the discredited system that preceded it.  He asked if we should have a system that relates the VRT rate to the expected CO2 emissions from the vehicle.  We have that in the model that is being proposed because the vehicles with the highest emissions have the highest rate of VRT, as the Deputy will know.  He is suggesting that we have a VRT model that reflects the actual usage of the car.  I am not sure how we could do that with VRT because VRT is charged at point of purchase of the vehicle.</p> <p>  Regarding us having a different system of testing, this will become an EU-wide system of testing as other countries implement the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure, WLTP, system.  It would not be feasible or even possible for us to have a non-WLTP testing methodology, particularly as a country that imports cars.  We need to have and now have an EU-wide form of testing car emissions.  It is, of course, up to us to then decide on how we want to tax based on WLTP, and there are choices regarding the VRT table that is before the Deputy.</p> <p>  This is a significantly more credible way of testing CO2 emissions than what went before it.  I have tried to make lower VRT rates applicable across a broader range of vehicles.  I am trying to get the balance right between introducing changes that are needed and trying to reflect that this, of course, will cause change in the purchases of vehicles, which in turn will have an effect on car sellers in the State.  I think we have the balance right in the measures proposed here.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure is still a laboratory test.  It is very dependent on the preconditions applied to the model.  That model, which has been enshrined in section 32 of the legislation, is then being used in section 34 as the basis for motor tax.  I accept that a tax at the point of purchase will need to be on whatever the manufacturer's profile of the vehicle is; we have no choice in that.  However, if following subsequent NCTs, that vehicle is taxed based on the actual emissions profile as certified by the National Car Test centre, it would act as a major incentive for people to avoid congested streets, to use public transport, to use their vehicle in a far more efficient way, to park their car and walk the last kilometre and, to avoid the congestion which is the dirtiest part of any vehicle's journey.  The same applies in the vicinity of schools.  It would transform air quality in our towns and cities overnight and would provide motorists with an actual output showing the emissions profile from that vehicle.</p> <p>  Over time as the database builds up, that can be reflected in alterations to the VRT.  It might reflect, for example, that the world harmonised model does not work in this country for car A whose actual emissions profile is significantly higher than that.  With another vehicle it might be significantly lower, based on the actual data readings in Ireland.  The principle is that the motor tax on vehicles should be based on the actual emissions profile of the vehicle rather than being solely dependent on a laboratory test that will not alter over time.  Therefore, a ten-year-old vehicle will have a higher emissions profile than a vehicle that has just left the factory.  However, if their WLTP ratings are the same, the exact same motor tax will be paid on both vehicles.  As we know, motor tax here is a far greater motivator of change than any other form of vehicle taxation.</p></speech>

It is possible that we could move to the form of taxation the Deputy is proposing, but it is a medium-term project.  At the moment our NCT centres do not have the technology to do the kind of real-time CO2 emissions testing he is referring to.  We could move to that point over time but it is a medium-term project.  What we have here is a significant improvement on where we were in the past and will make a big difference to the purchase of cars that have a less harmful effect on our climate and environment.</p> <p>  I will briefly make reference to the further changes I am making to the NOx surcharge, included in this section.  It is a response to the point Deputy Naughten made about NOx particulates at the start of the section.</p></speech>

Deputies will be aware that the medical assessments conducted by the HSE in respect of access to the scheme have been on hold since the Supreme Court decision earlier this year.  The Supreme Court found that the regulations setting out the medical criteria underpinning qualification for the scheme were inconsistent with the mandate provided in section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.  This amendment brings the medical criteria into the primary legislation. </p><p>The measure is designed to address the immediate issue raised by the Supreme Court and allows for assessments to recommence without further delay in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  I consider this to be an interim solution only.  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by Members of this House and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p><p>With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p><p>I remind the committee that earlier in proceedings, I indicated that assessments in respect of the certificate were recommencing on the back of a communication I issued to the HSE.  I wish to confirm again that the commencement of assessments will only begin on the implementation of the Bill.  </p></speech>

Many people are deeply concerned about this.  I hope it will be rectified quickly because it is an issue that is really affecting people's lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#HH01500"><p>I welcome the Minister's move in this regard.  I also welcome his clarification because his comments to me yesterday were that the scheme was opened up again, which is not the case.  I brought this to the Minister's attention just before we came into the meeting.  The position is now that there will be no processing of the primary medical certificates until the beginning of next year when this legislation is enacted.  The difficulty I raised yesterday with the Minister was that there are 1,500 people who should have a primary medical certificate now who, because of the suspension of the scheme and because of Covid-19 will not have it at the end of this year and the indication I am getting from the HSE is that it will not start to deal with this particular backlog until the new year.</p><p>This will be in the context of Covid-19, the vaccination programme and developments relating to that.  As a result of the suspension of this scheme, the 1,500 people who should have got their primary medical certificates this year will not get them until some time next year.  Those who apply next year will be obliged to wait a considerable period before they get access.  In line with the Minister's comment to me yesterday that if there is a problem with this he will look at it, will he give a commitment that he will consider providing some type of additional resource to ensure that this backlog is addressed in a very timely manner?</p></speech>

The Minister stated that this is an interim solution.  While I welcome the fact that a scheme will at least now be available, we know the challenges that exist.  The restrictions are quite severe.  A person needs to have lost both hands or both arms.  I am sure every Deputy, including the Minister, is aware of constituents who feel they should be entitled to these certificates and the scheme because of the circumstances in which they find themselves, yet they cannot get certificates.  Is it intended that the conditions relating to this scheme will be changed?  What timeframe does the Minister have in mind?  What are his initial thoughts on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#JJ00400"><p>I agree with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell that this scheme affects the lives of many people.  This is why the suspension of the scheme in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling is a serious issue.  While a number of people are waiting to obtain access to the scheme, I will work with the HSE and raise this matter with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to see what we can do to process the outstanding applications as soon as possible.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Denis Naughten, I have already confirmed the processing of applications relating to the scheme will recommence on 1 January next.  As I said to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, I will talk to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth regarding what can be done to process applications quickly in light of what has happened this year.  This is a very sensitive matter.  I anticipate that we will have to assess the current eligibility criteria for the scheme because most of the contact I get is about that.  While it will be difficult to pin down the exact time that will be involved in doing this work, I would like to have a report and a conclusion to this process for next year's Finance Bill because this matter has been ongoing for a period and I would like to be in a position to be able to amend next year's Bill in order to deal with the conclusions that will come from this process.</p></speech>

I hear what the Minister is saying in terms of next year.  I do not think there is a Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad who has not had the issue of eligibility raised with him or her on numerous occasions so it is good that this is being reviewed.  I ask the Minister to try to review this as quickly as he can.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight could also have a role in future policy direction on this matter.  There is a role for the Oireachtas in its entirety in terms of looking at this issue.</p></speech>

One of things we must do is determine criteria that are fair and open and that will become applicable across the board.  Fortunately or unfortunately, several years ago it was much easier to qualify, it was a much fairer system and it was clearly seen to be fairer.  In recent times, I have seen totally contradictory decisions made in different cases.  It is no good saying that if a person is missing an arm or a leg, he or she has difficulties.  Whether he or she requires the loss of both in order to qualify remains to be seen.  I do not accept that.  There have been other cases where it appears there was no real compelling reason a person could not qualify at all and did qualify, so those issues must be dealt with in order to bring the scheme into repute as opposed to where it is now, in disrepute.</p></speech>

We will try to get the review done as soon as possible.  I am sure there will be an opportunity to hear the views of this committee with regard to it.  Again, I appreciate how sensitive the matter of this scheme is but there are some serious issues relating to it that need to be considered and teased out.  We will try to get the work done as soon as possible.</p></speech>

If the Government is going to incentivise a scheme whereby the road haulage sector moves to using trucks with ultra-low emissions engines, this is what we must do.  It has been presented before, not as amendment to a finance legislation, but to the Minister through lobbying by the IRHA.  It is necessary that the scheme provides for all of the homes where the money will spent but nothing is being spent in the road haulage sector.  The gains that could result from an air pollution and air quality perspective would be far greater if this scheme was incentivised.  The Minister knows that we are moving towards Euro 6 but in this country, we have a much slower uptake.  A total of 35% of vehicles are on what is called the clean Euro 6 engine while 65% are operating off Euro 2, 3 and 4 engines.  There is an argument to be made in lots of other ways but there would be a higher and faster return if this scheme was incentivised.</p></speech>

There are two matters.  The Minister is addressing the diesel rebate scheme.  I thought we were dealing with amendment No. 156 but it is amendment No. 139.  I presented it incorrectly but the Minister is fully aware of what I am talking about.  I will explain it to other members if necessary.</p></speech>

I thought the Deputy's comments were relevant to the amendment proposed, which is amendment No. 139.  I am aware of the points made on the matter by Deputy Murphy.</p> <p>  I made changes last year to the operation of the diesel rebate scheme, where we doubled the marginal rate of compensation that is available if and when the retail price of diesel goes above &euro;1.07.  I know the point being made by Deputy Murphy is that we should have incentives in place to encourage the transition into low-carbon trucks and engines.  I understand that in response to her point, the Department of Transport is currently working on the design of a grant to facilitate that.  The point she makes is fair, as there are grants and incentives available for change with private vehicles, for example.  For commercial vehicles, the kind of incentives that are available are not as comprehensive as they should be.</p> <p>  As I stated, the Department of Transport is currently working on a grant to help bridge the cost differential between conventional and alternatively fuelled vehicles.  I understand it is aiming to make this grant available next year.  Perhaps the main area of engagement should be on what the grant will be and how it will operate.  This is so we can move to a place where the change in vehicles for the heavy duty sector would have effective incentives in place.  We want to see a change in engine there just as we want to see it happen with other vehicles.</p></speech>

The current increase in carbon tax is not being taken account of for hauliers.  I appreciate the Minister's comments about the grant.  It is good to hear that and I am sure the hauliers will be very pleased.  We must incentivise this as we have done with many parts of the agricultural sector.  It is not a highly profitable sector and margins are around 3%.  I could not see the majority of hauliers moving fast to upgrade their trucks.</p> <p>  This amendment was presented by the Minister for Public Expenditure, Deputy Michael McGrath, last year when he was a spokesperson for the Opposition.  It is the exact amendment.  I hope that when we move to Report Stage, the Minister will allow for a report post-Brexit in particular.  We do not know how the landscape will be then.  It is a sector we cannot do without.  We saw through this Covid-19 pandemic that it has not let us down.  Shelves were stocked.  The sector will come under major pressure post-Brexit.  It is already under pressure but after Brexit these will be the workers on the front line.  I would appreciate the Minister putting some serious thought and effort into this.</p></speech>

As I said, I take her point that we must ensure there are incentives in place to facilitate change.</p> <p>  I understand where she is coming from with respect to her observations on the operation of the diesel rebate scheme.  The current price of diesel means the rebate scheme does not offer the degree of support that it otherwise would.  If and when the price of diesel increases, the rebate scheme will play a role.  I may not be in a position to agree to the report on Report Stage but I hope at that point, in two weeks, I will be in a position to give an update on the work that the Department of Transport is doing on a grant.</p></speech>

Everybody understands that the haulier will not get this increase in the carbon tax back and it will have to be passed to the consumer in the form of a double whammy.  When haulier costs go up, everything on the shelf goes up.  The Minister should bear that in mind.  I hope this is not the final result.</p></speech>

SECTION 34

Question proposed: &quot;That section 34 be agreed to.&quot;</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#KK01100"><p>This will see an increase in motor tax for a small proportion of newly registered cars in 2021 and also for cars that have been registered since 2008.  I understand the changes will amount to between &euro;10 and &euro;40.  Concerns have been raised, particularly with respect to cumulative changes in the Finance Bill for a family with a car.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, has indicated this will push up the price of a family car by approximately &euro;1,000.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  Our taxation regime, particularly vehicle registration tax, is guided towards emissions and this makes complete sense.  We must all recognise that in all of this, not everybody can trade up to a newer car because some people do not have the means to do.  I also note the changes for pre-2008 cars mean there will not be any increases in tax there.</p> <p>  There is always a matter that arises and I have raised it on numerous occasions.  It relates to families with four or more children, and to travel as a family they need a car with seven seats.  They may be described as gas guzzlers but they may be required in order to do the school or football run or getting to a shopping centre with the p&aacute;ist&iacute;.</p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the cumulative effect of these changes, particularly the statement from SIMI that this will push up prices for a family car by &euro;1,000.  It contends that this measure will disincentivise people from changing their cars to more energy-efficient models.  What about the impact of the motor tax provision on older cars, which may be used by those in lower income households because those people do not have ability to change?  They will see an increase in taxation.</p></speech>

I will deal with the motor tax issue first.  Members can tell me if I miss any elements.  </p><p> Minor changes are being made to the current CO2-based motor tax table.  There are rate increases for the most polluting cars only.  No changes are being made to the table of rates accorded by engine size.  We estimate that 92% of cars already registered in the State up to the end of 2020 will not see an increase in their annual motor tax bill.  Most of the remaining 8% will see a motor tax increase of around &euro;10 per annum.  Some cars could see an increase of around &euro;50 in motor tax.  We estimate that this will account for about 0.5% of cars on the road.  These cars produce a very high level of emissions.  As the Deputy said, rates for cars registered before July 2008 will remain unchanged.  </p><p> Regarding the points made by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, on the impact of VRT, I note that particular examples were presented to illustrate the most extreme increase in VRT for car purchases.  For obvious reasons I will not refer to examples of specific cars in this debate.  Most cars that are purchased will see minor changes in VRT.  However, it is true that there will be significant increases in VRT on the purchase of larger vehicles with larger engines.  On average, however, they will not reflect the examples we heard before the budget was announced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#LL00200"><p>I am concerned about this section.  I do not support it because I have not seen evidence of the impact it will have, particularly on low-income households.  I have raised some motorists' need for larger cars in the debate on numerous Finance Bills.  I would like to raise the issue of how motor tax is charged, which I have continually raised with the Minister.  As the Minister acknowledges, 8% of motorists will see an increase.  That means tens of thousands of people, albeit a minority, will see increases of between &euro;10 and &euro;40.</p> <p>  Motorists who pay motor tax but are not in a position to pay annually face a penalty.  I do not expect the Minister to deal with this issue now and I do not have an amendment to the Finance Bill on it.  However, I appeal to the Minister to get with the times.  We must tax fairly, whether we are trying to raise revenue or change behaviour.  It is unfair to apply an additional charge to those who are not in a position to pay their motor tax annually and instead pay on a biannual or quarterly basis.  This charge dates from an era when this tax created a quite heavy administrative burden involving paperwork, postage, stamps and whatnot.  With the evolution of technology and the Internet, most motor tax renewals are done online.  Someone who pays motor tax online but cannot afford to pay it annually pays it quarterly instead.  As a result he or she pays 13% more.  The quarterly charge is not 25% of the yearly tax, but rather 28.25%.  This means a person in this position pays 113% of the tax charged on his or her vehicle.  Someone who is in a position to pay the tax every six months is charged an additional 11%.  He or she pays 55.5% of the nominal charge every six months and 111% per year. </p> <p>  I acknowledge that collecting tax, posting out a disc and so on may create an administrative burden.  However, the cost is not that high.  The total additional money raised by the State as a result of people paying motor tax on a quarterly or biannual basis is &euro;52.7 million.  We need to reduce this.  I appeal to the Minister to have this reviewed in a serious way by the tax strategy group.  Perhaps it does not need that.  This has not been changed for decades.  Fairness must be applied.  Taxing cars according to their emissions raises revenue but it is really intended to change behaviour, and rightly so.  I question whether it is the right approach and wonder if we are doing enough to incentivise alternatives, but that is for another day.  We should not penalise those who cannot pay every full year.  People with cars that emit more should pay more tax, but they should not have to pay 13% more because they cannot pay in one go.  I would appreciate if the Minister took this seriously and reviewed it for the reasons I have suggested.  An additional 13% burden is not acceptable.</p></speech>

However, I would expect a report to point to the fact that higher costs are involved in processing these payments on a quarterly or biannual basis.  There will therefore be a reduction in the net yield to the Exchequer from such payments.  However, I will look at the matter.</p></speech>

Changes have been made to VAT to support hair salons during the current Covid-19 restrictions.  These have benefitted hairdressers but not beauticians.  This is causing a real problem.  As many beauticians share the same premises as hairdressers and the two professions go hand in hand, the measure should include beauticians.  I know that may have a knock-on effect in other areas, but it would make sense.</p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing the hospitality and tourism sector, the section provides that the 9% rate of VAT applies from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021 to the supply of certain goods and services which primarily relate to the hospitality and tourism sector and which are currently subject to a VAT rate of 13.5%.  The 9% rate of VAT will apply to the supply of restaurants and catering services, guest and holiday accommodation and various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, museums, fairgrounds and amusement parks.  It will also apply to hairdressing services and certain printed matter such as brochures, maps and programmes.  It is estimated that this change will cost the Exchequer &euro;336 million in 2021 and &euro;401 million in total.</p><p> The VAT rates applying to Ireland are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under EU law, there are a limited number of areas where a reduced rated can be applied, and these areas are set out in the third annexe to the VAT directive.  Beauty salon services are currently liable for VAT at the rate of 13.5%, as services consisting of care of the human body under paragraph 21(1) of Schedule 3 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  This rate is provided for under Article 118 of the VAT directive.  It is not possible to reduce the rate of VAT applying to those services to 9% because for those services, the applicable VAT rate cannot be reduced below 12%.</p><p> My Department will continue to monitor the economic impact of the pandemic and in the event that we identify another sector where a reduction is possible, and where such a reduction could be a critical factor in sustaining businesses and jobs, we will consider that case.  What we have done with VAT has to be considered in the round of all the other measures that have been put in place to support the economy and the beauty sector, including measures such as the CRSS and the employment wage subsidy scheme, for which the beauty sector qualifies, despite the fact that it does not qualify for this change in VAT.</p></speech>

Beauty salons should be included in the VAT reduction because hairdressers and beauticians are basically sister professions and often work out of the same premises.  Beauticians find it difficult to understand why hairdressers will benefit from the reduction but they will not.  It is unfair.  I know the Government is trying to do the best it can to manage through the Covid crisis but this issue shows how nonsensical the approach is.  There could be two practitioners using the same premises and one would qualify for the reduction while the other would not, simply because of a definition contained in an EU directive.  It is unfair and the Minister should look at some way of alleviating that.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by representatives of the beauty sector.  Unfortunately, there are very clear legal reasons as to why I cannot do that.  I am raising the matter with the European Commission for clarification because I can understand why the beauty sector is asking why it is excluded from a measure in which hairdressing services are included.  While I have a clear reason based in law for doing this, I know that some in the beauty sector are looking at how they can pursue this matter.  I will seek further clarification from the European Commission on this issue.</p></speech>

As we know, it is to run from late this year to December 2021.  On the review of this 9% VAT rate and whether it will be extended in the Finance Bill 2021, what is process involved and what consultation does the Minister plan to undertake?

It provides that the zero rate applies to goods supplied to or acquired by the HSE, hospitals, nursing homes, care homes and GP practices for use in the delivery of Covid-19 related healthcare services to their patients.  These goods which are subject to the zero rate of VAT are personal protection equipment, thermometers, hand sanitisers, medial ventilators and specialist respiratory equipment such as respirators for intensive and sub-intensive care, other oxygen therapy apparatus, including oxygen tanks, and oxygen itself.</p><p>This measure has been applied administratively by the Revenue Commissioners since 9 April following my request to them to apply this relief.  My request followed the European Commission's indication that notwithstanding the VAT directive, member states could apply a reduced rate to such items.  The end date of the measure, which is currently 31 October, is linked to the end date provided in the Commission's decision.  However, as the Commission has decided to extend the end date to 30 April, I have prepared these Committee Stage amendments to make that change.

He is extending the time period.  The zero VAT rate applies to front-line staff in hospitals and other care settings and the flexibility has been approved by the European Commission.  Initially, Family Carers Ireland secured tens of thousands of euro worth of PPE for distribution to family carers throughout the country who could not access PPE at that time.  Will the Minister consider applying the zero VAT rate to PPE for use domestically by family carers?</p></speech>

With the exception of the medical bodies and professionals that are listed in the legislation, it cannot be extended to other medical professionals.  Therefore, the standard rate of VAT must be applied in those cases where PPE is being supplied to or acquired by other medical professionals.  I am informed that the answer to Deputy Harkin's question is "No".  That said, the first time I became aware of this issue was when the Deputy raised it with me this evening.  It was not subject to an amendment so I have not had the opportunity to look into the matter in more detail.  The Deputy mentioned that she did not have the opportunity to table an amendment.  While I still expect that the answer will be "No", in truth, I will follow up on the matter between now and Report Stage in order to better understand why and whether there is any flexibility possible.  I do not want to give false hope but it is a matter that I have not considered up to this point.  I will look at it before Report Stage.</p></speech>

There is a small change under this section which brings candles into the VAT net.

They already have a zero rate of VAT and I am just using the discretion that is available to me now to make changes in the other products that are listed in this Bill, which is clearly the right change to make.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point, I was briefed on the anomaly that exists at the moment.  Actually, I will not use the word anomaly but will simply say that candles that are white, cylindrical and unperfumed were not subject to VAT whereas candles that are perfumed, a different shape, or coloured were subject to this tax.</p><p>I was advised that we need to make a change to ensure these candles are treated in the same way as other candles, and that is what we are seeking to do.  I have seen some of the commentary on this and some of the charges being made.  The last thing I am trying to do is cause any hardship.  I have been informed that allegations have been made about this affecting people's ability to pray.  That is the furthest thing from my mind in making this change.  If there is evidence of hardship as a result of this change or evidence of difficulty being created, I will be happy to hear about it.  Perhaps the Deputy and I can discuss it now.  However, these candles have been zero rated and they are mainly used in church settings.  Candles that are sold alongside them that are not white, cylindrical and are perfumed have the normal rate of VAT applied to them.  If there is evidence of this change causing hardship or difficulty, perhaps this is the time at which it could be presented.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is a practice that has been mainly deleted for approximately 1 million people each week in this country.  Those candles are used.  People light candles and pray for a dead loved one or an issue of great importance to them.  Faith can offer strength to people to deal with some of the darkness we all experience at present.  Even the Minister said that these candles are typically used in that environment.  In addition, from the church's perspective, it has experienced, like everyone else, a radical fall in income over the last number of months because its buildings are closed.  I ask the Minister to reconsider.  It is a small detail in the scheme of things, but for many individuals it is a very big thing.</p></speech>

It is a burning issue for many, and there has been some commentary on it over the last while.  I have a question for the Minister on the background to this change.  Is the Tax Appeals Commission's ruling relating to the &euro;394,000 that was deemed to be paid by a company for the sale of church candles between 2013 and 2016 the instigation of this measure?  I am interested to hear what prompted the change.  The Minister said he did not want to call it an anomaly, but that Tax Appeals Commission ruling made it clear that cylindrical, white candles are VAT exempt or zero rated and that the standard rate of VAT applies only to those that are tapered, perfumed or coloured.  It is important to outline the intentions behind this and where it came from.  Many people go into a church and when one lifts white, cylindrical candles they are generally church candles.  People go in to light a candle for somebody who has passed away and so forth.  I am sure many of us have done it.  There is a sensitivity about this issue so perhaps the Minister could outline the background to it and why it emerged now.  Was it the Tax Appeals Commission ruling?  That ruling said the legislation was clear and unambiguous, so obviously something prompted a change since then.</p></speech>

I am glad he did not suggest that I am trying to interfere with that human right because a number of allegations have been made regarding the intention behind this change.  It was not prompted by the Tax Appeals Commission ruling referred to by Deputy Doherty.  Every year when I deal with the Finance Bill there are dozens of issues on which I am asked to agree to change and to deal with issues that have developed in the tax code.  It is in that spirit that I am making this change but I am aware of the debate that has ensued.  I am also aware of the financial difficulties that churches are experiencing at present.  If any evidence can be presented to me that this is causing a significant difficulty for churches, on top of the other problems they currently face, I am happy to engage with the committee and stakeholders before Report Stage on the matter.</p></speech>

What is the revenue that is expected to be generated from the introduction of VAT on these products?  I presume this applies when we purchase small candles for our homes as well and that it is not just church candles.  Is that the case?  It is all cylindrical candles we buy, so it is wider than that issue.</p></speech>

Other candles that do not meet these criteria are charged VAT as is normal.  Regarding the revenue gain from this, it is negligible if there is one at all.  It will be very small.  If there is genuine evidence of hardship or difficulty created due to this change, I will engage with stakeholders on the matter before Report Stage.  Some of the language that has been used about this change and my intentions behind it is utterly unjustified.  If there are issues regarding the effect it will have on churches and on those who are helping parishioners who are very vulnerable, as they are now in 2020, I am happy to engage with them and the evidence on the matter.  It will be on the basis of engagement and evidence that I will consider this issue, not on the basis of some of the charges that have been made about my intention or the effect of this change.</p></speech>

I will begin by discussing amendment No. 146 in particular.  As the Minister knows, I have been quite vocal on the tax treatment of REITs and IREFs.  Amendment No. 146 calls for a report on the application of the full rate of stamp duty on non-residential property to all corporate structures, including REITs and IREFs, in certain circumstances.  I welcome the number of measures that have been introduced in previous years to address what were glaring gaps in the taxation of these structures.  Some of this we discussed yesterday during the passage of various sections of the Bill.  I welcomed in particular, for example, the move to close the revaluation loophole on REIT cessation.  Section 705P requires that the relevant REIT has to be in operation for over 15 years before it enjoys preferential treatment, and that is to be welcomed.  I was on the record as far back as 2017 calling for the dividend withholding tax on REIT and IREF structures to be increased to the 25% rate, and I welcomed the adoption of that proposal in last year's Finance Bill.  Let us be clear, however, that this needs to go much further.  I have called for dividend withholding tax to be increased further to 33%.</p><p>There is no doubt but that there is a need for a complete overhaul of the tax treatment of non-resident investors in our property market, both residential and non-residential.  My views on this have been made well known to the Minister and have been articulated time and time again on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and through the many other opportunities I have in the D&aacute;il.  We need to overhaul the treatment of both capital gains tax and dividend withholding tax.  The section before us deals exclusively with stamp duty, as does this amendment.  In last year's Finance Bill a stamp duty loophole for REITs was closed, which I welcomed; however, it did not go far enough.  On a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il last year I raised the example of Green REIT and its sale to Henderson Park.  The change made ensured that a 1% stamp duty was applied to the &euro;1.34 billion sale of Green REIT to Henderson Park.  That brought in about &euro;13.4 million to the Exchequer, and while something is better than nothing, it is simply not good enough that it was able to pay as little as that in stamp duty.  Non-residential stamp duty is not 1% but 7.5%, and there is no justification for a REIT or an IREF enjoying lower levels of stamp duty that are denied to other businesses operating within the State.  Last year I called for the full rate to be applied to the REIT structures, a change which in the case of the Green REIT sale would have brought in &euro;100 million and a little more in change to the taxpayer, money that could be well spent in these times.</p><p>The amendment before us uses the type of procedure we have to use.  It calls for a report to examine legislative change that would ensure that the full rate of stamp duty is applied to these structures.  I am aware that officials within the Department of Finance discussed such changes to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act in the summer of this year.  A stamp duty anti-avoidance measure was introduced in budget 2018 under section 31C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  However, this measure did not include REITs.  Officials sought approval to amend the section to encompass REITs in the Finance Act before us but approval was not granted.  The sale of shares attracts stamp duty at a rate of 1%.  A stamp duty anti-avoidance measure was introduced in section 31C of the Act.  However, following the increase of the stamp duty rate on the acquisition of non-residential land and property from 2% to 6% in budget 2018, the measure ensures that the higher rate, now 7.5%, also applies where non-residential property held by an entity such as a company, a partnership or an IREF is indirectly sold by way of sale of the shares in the company, effectively selling the non-residential property itself.  In the absence of section 31C, it is probable that only a 1% stamp duty rate that applies to share purchases would apply to such sales.  REITs, as we know, are collective investment vehicles designed to hold rental investment properties in a tax-neutral manner.  They are not currently covered by section 31C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, and their inclusion was overlooked at the time.  Therefore, the acquisition of shares in some REITs which are comprised solely or principally of investment in various types of non-residential property may only be subject to a 1% stamp duty as opposed to a 7.5% rate for all other types of property of that nature by other structures.</p><p>Owing to the infrequent occurrence and unpredictable size of the transactions which would be encompassed by the extension of section 31C, it is not possible, we are told, to provide an estimate of the revenue that might be derived from it.  However, we know from the Green REIT sale to Henderson Park that there are clear advantages to the taxpayer in applying the full rate of stamp duty to REITs and IREFs.  In addition, there are positive effects these measures would have on our property market more generally in terms of turning it towards affordability rather than into an environment which is geared towards non-residential investors, with the impact on prices that results from that.  I ask the Minister to clarify why the changes were not made despite approval being sought by officials.  We discussed how he provided approval in regard to candles and so on.  In terms of REITs being able to avail of stamp duty at 1% when non-residential stamp duty applies at 7.5%, there is a loophole that needs to be closed and was sought to be closed by officials but did not get ministerial approval.</p></speech>

In regard to amendment No. 146, in general the purchase of company shares is liable to stamp duty at 1%.  When stamp duty was increased from 2% to 6% in budget 2018 an anti-avoidance measure was included to ensure that the new 6% rate would also apply where non-residential property held by an entity such as a company is indirectly sold by way of a sale of the shares in the company and, effectively, the company itself.  This section applies the higher - now 7.5% - rate for non-residential property to the acquisition of entities that deal in land or that secure development of land for non-residential purposes.  The charge applies where the entities derive the greater part of their value from Irish property and hold land where there is little or no other activity carried on by the business, or hold and develop land for residential or non-residential purposes and where the purchase of the shares, interest or units results in a change in control of the entity and thus a change in control of the land or buildings.  Not all companies deriving value from property are affected.  Sales of the following types of entities should not attract the 7.5% charge, provided they are carrying on an active business: hotels; car park businesses where the land was acquired for that business; office rental businesses; and cr&egrave;ches.</p> <p>  Last year, officials in my Department prepared a report on REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market.  The report was presented to the tax strategy group in July last year and provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments introduced in the Finance Act 2019.  Deputy Doherty asked me a question in regard to a recommendation that was made to me.  I will have to check the communications sent to me during that period by my Department and revert to him with an answer on the matter.  In light of changes that I made recently, and the new measures introduced in the Finance Act 2019, I do not believe now is the time to undertake a further report in this area.  I did implement significant anti-avoidance measures last year in the area Deputy Doherty refers to.  I will continue to keep this area under review to see if further action is merited.</p></speech>

I refer to Green REIT and Henderson Park, where a 1% stamp duty applied as opposed to the 7.5% that should have applied.  This is a question of fairness and balance.  There is not need for a further review.  I am unconvinced.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on why these structures should apply a stamp duty of 1% as compared with 7.5% because I do not get it.  That is not acceptable in my view.</p></speech>

The 1% is the stamp duty rate that applies with regard to the purchase of shares and that is the reason for it.</p></speech>

When Green REIT sells to Henderson Park it does not sell only shares.  Henderson Park owns all of the property.  It is a property investment company.  It is bricks and mortar that is being sold in this instance.  There is a loophole in the law.</p></speech>

This is the sale of over &euro;1 billion of property in the state.  If a company in Ireland sold off hotels, apartments, shopping centres, residential units and so on a 7.5% stamp duty would apply but because this structure can sell the shares as a means of selling the property it gets away with paying stamp duty at 1%.  It is ridiculous.  It is a massive loophole that the Minister's officials sought to close-off in this Finance Bill.  It is not acceptable to continue to support these types of structures in the way we have been doing.</p> <p>  We had a discussion yesterday in regard to how no capital gains applies to them.  No corporation tax applies to the rents that are received and now when they are disposing of the property they can do it by way of the sale of shares and, therefore, pay only a fraction of the stamp duty that would apply to other structures.</p></speech>

When I identified issues that needed to be addressed, changes were made.  In our debate yesterday I highlighted the higher rate of tax that is now being paid by some of these entities as a result of changes that were made.  In last year's Bill, I brought in some comprehensive measures that are aimed at preventing tax avoidance.  This shows my commitment to trying to ensure effective taxation within this sector.  I am happy, as I said already to the Deputy, to keep this area under review and to examine it again in the context of the tax strategy group papers.  As I said, I made significant changes to this area in last year's Finance Bill.</p></speech>

As I said, 1% is better than nothing but the stamp duty on non-residential property is not 1%, it is 7.5%.  This is not an entity that is engaged in selling shares.  It is not a company that is involved in research and development, R&amp;D, or manufacturing and the company is being sold through its shares.  This is an entity structured in a way that allows it to purchase and develop property in the State.</p><p>REITs and IREFs do nothing else.  Therefore, when they sell their shares, they are selling the apartment blocks, shopping centres and other commercial entities.  They are able to do so in a way that is not envisaged.  It was never envisaged that they could sell commercial property at a 1% rate.  This was a loophole that was exploited by Green REIT.  The Minister has talked about keeping it under review.  However, he knows what the issue is, and he is willing to let it go, which is not acceptable.</p><p> I am conscious that this amendment is also grouped with amendment No. 148.  I will speak to that amendment now.  It asks the Minister to lay before the House a report on the introduction of a residential property tax surcharge where property is purchased by a non-resident.  The Minister will know, because his tax strategy papers also discuss this issue, that a 2% stamp duty surcharge on non-residents purchasing residential property will be introduced in the North and in Britain from 1 April 2021.  The objective of that policy is to try to control price inflation, which is nothing like what we have seen here in recent years.  The intention is also to support residents in attaining home ownership. </p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is about doing as other jurisdictions are starting to do so that a non-resident purchasing residential property through one of these structures would pay additional tax by way of a surcharge.  Britain has decided to impose a 2% stamp duty surcharge.  Here, never mind a surcharge, the Minister does not even want them to pay 2% and wants them to pay as little as 1%.  These are the types of policies we need to look at.  There is a serious issue with non-residential investors disturbing the market and pushing up prices as a result.  Calling for these two reports is a mechanism to allow us to table amendments.</p><p> I strongly argue that the Minister should not allow REITs to get away with paying 1% stamp duty when every other company that sells or disposes of commercial property in the State is required to pay 7.5%.  What is so special about these REITs?  Why does Fine Gael think they are so special above every other structure?  These are multibillion euro structures and not wee companies.  They are not corner shops, but multibillion euro companies that are able to pay a fraction of what others would have to pay on disposal of non-commercial property.</p></speech>

When I have become aware of issues that have required action, I have taken action.  The Deputy and I differ in that he thinks more should be done on this.  When I continue to monitor the operation of the sector, which I will do, if more needs to be done to deal with tax avoidance issues, I will act.  However, I do not hold any special affection for these organisations or entities.  They have a role to play as landlords of commercial property and, to a lesser extent, of residential property.  When I have become aware of issues that need to be addressed in how they are taxed, I have acted on them.  The Deputy thinks I should do more, but I have made changes already.</p> <p>  Under section 31C of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999, shares are taxed at 7.5% but only for companies that focus on the dealing in and development of property.</p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the implementation of a surcharge to take effect from 1 April 2021 in Britain and the North.  I will look at the operation of that surcharge in the context of the tax strategy process. </p></speech>

I have also acknowledged that some of those changes have happened because of amendments I have tabled or by exposing areas where loopholes have existed in the past.  I acknowledge that the Minister and his officials have introduced amendments to close them.  However, he allowed Green REIT to get away with blue murder last year.  He allowed it to get away with not paying over &euro;90 million in tax because he allowed it to pay stamp duty at 1%.  Where there is acknowledgement - fair play to the Minister and his officials on those issues - there must also be acknowledgement that he is letting them away without making their fair contribution in tax, which I believe is also their duty.  He mentioned shares where 7.5% stamp duty applies where there is development of property.  However, the problem is that REITs are not developing the property.  Therefore, the stamp duty that applies to them is just 1%.</p> <p>  The Minister has said he will keep the 2% surcharge under review to see how it will operate and will look at it next year.  These entities do substantial damage by buying property, pushing up house prices and pushing first-time buyers out of the market because they are non-residential purchases.  CSO figures show the numbers that have been purchased in the past, particularly in concentrated areas as I have mentioned.</p> <p>  I will continue to pursue this.  The Minister points to the role of REITs in being a commercial landlord, which is fine.  However, I believe they should not have a tax advantage that other structures do not have.  That is where we differ significantly.  It is really challenging and frustrating because we have been dealing with this for four, five or maybe even more years.  It is painfully frustrating trying to get the Minister to close some of these loopholes.  I am sure in his rebuttal he will say that where they have been pointed out to him, he has closed them.  He has done so in some, but it was pointed out to him that Green REIT was able to pay stamp duty not at 7.5% but at 1% when it sold its properties and he did nothing.  He actually facilitated it, which resulted in &euro;90 million lost to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

REITs are given a competitive advantage in the market through taxation.  They already have a competitive advantage with regard to the international interest rates that they receive.  They have a distorting effect on the market.  They crowd out other purchasers they compete with.  The tax forgone is an opportunity cost.  That tax take could be used for many purposes throughout society.  Pressures are coming from every direction at the moment.  The Government should be looking to maximise its tax take from these hyper-profitable organisations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.706" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#A00700"><p>I thank the committee for making time available to me to consider the Supplementary Estimates for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Prisons and Courts Service Votes, and the Further Revised Estimates for the Justice Vote.  I am joined by my officials from the Department of Justice, Seamus Clifford, principal officer, and Martina Colville, assistant secretary.</p> <p>  A net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;44.325 million arises in respect of the Garda Vote this year.  This comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;63.9 million, which is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid receipts of &euro;19.75 million, giving a net additional requirement of &euro;44.325 million for the Garda Vote.  There are two main components giving rise to this requirement.  The first is the impact of Garda Covid expenditure, which is &euro;33.32 million, and the adjustment to take account of the Government's July stimulus economic package, which totalled &euro;11 million for the Garda Vote.</p> <p>  The Garda has maintained a front-line, high-visibility presence since the outset of the pandemic and on behalf of the Government, I sincerely thank the Commissioner, his senior team and all members and staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their exemplary service to communities across the length and breadth of the country in response to this pandemic.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a range of operations and activities to keep people safe in support of public health measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19.  This has included a large number of static and rolling checkpoints, high-visibility community engagement patrols, visits to retail premises and ongoing support for the most vulnerable and isolated in our society.</p> <p>  I am glad to say that a further phase of Operation Faoiseamh is in place, which prioritises people who are vulnerable to and victims of domestic abuse.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively makes contact with previous victims to provide reassurance and support, and to offer the assistance of local and specialised resources.  It has worked proactively to intervene with previous offenders.  There is also renewed focus across the criminal justice system, with the courts prioritising the hearing of applications for court orders and the prosecution of breaches.  Notwithstanding these significant preventative efforts, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of domestic abuse, and the entire system continues to work with the voluntary sector to try to keep people safe.</p> <p>  The impact of the pandemic is expected to result in additional costs for the Garda Vote in the region of &euro;53.1 million by the end of this year.  While certain offset costs are available, such as from scaled down activities, redeployment of resources from the Garda College and the surplus receipts from pension contributions, the extent of the additional cost is such that a Supplementary Estimate is required.  The additional cost directly related to Covid comprises approximately &euro;25.2 million in payroll costs, which mainly relates to the implementation of emergency Covid rosters since last April.  This has been extended to the end of the year, taking account of some revisions following the first month of operation.  In addition, the earlier attestation of trained garda&iacute; to respond to the Covid crisis increased payroll costs beyond what was originally budgeted for in 2020.  Expenditure on PPE has become a significant cost factor for all front-line services in the State and the Garda is no different.  The additional cost in 2020 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;16 million, with most of the expenditure having been incurred already.</p> <p>  The community focus of policing has been central to the success of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's response to Covid and this has been supported with additional investment of &euro;6.1 million in the transport fleet, bringing the total expenditure on the Garda fleet to &euro;15.1 million for 2020.  The original budget of &euro;9 million provided 296 patrol vehicles but, significantly, the additional spend of &euro;6.1 million supports the purchase of a further 228 vehicles, mainly for community policing.  It is important to say that those vehicles will be there long after Covid.  Other additional costs directly related to Covid include the temporary hire of vehicles, which cost &euro;2 million, and ICT, telecommunications and overheads such as additional cleaning and sanitisation, which comes to &euro;3.8 million.</p> <p>  The additional element of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the provision of &euro;11 million in the Government's July economic stimulus package for a range of projects in the Garda Vote.  This includes the building and refurbishment of stations to support the establishment of business service hubs and the new operating model of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is being rolled out at the moment; custody management facilities in stations, and prisoner processing areas and custody CCTV; immigration facilities at sea ports and airports; public office facilities for meeting members of the community, including universal access; at Garda headquarters to meet the requirements of the new units being established; at Garda stations to support the establishment of protective service units in a number of divisions, which is directly linked with the O'Malley recommendations, all of which have been implemented since the end of September; as well as the provision of special victim interview suites.</p> <p>  The Prisons Vote requires a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;14 million in the current year.  This is largely accounted for by three main areas in expenditure.  Additional expenditure arises from Covid, which is expected to be in the region of &euro;6 million by the year's end.  There is the Government stimulus package of &euro;8 million.  There is an additional requirement for compensation payments of approximately &euro;4.6 million.  The additional requirement is reduced in part by underspends in other areas of the Vote, including building capital due to Covid-related delays in the redevelopment of Limerick Prison.  A proportion of this underspend will be carried forward to 2021 under capital carryover provisions.  The main impact of Covid-related expenditure is the cost of PPE, medical deep cleaning and the ICT for remote working, including the provision of services such as video link facilities for prisoners' families.</p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service management and staff, and indeed prisoners themselves, are to be commended on the manner in which the challenge of Covid-19 has been managed in the high-risk, closed environment of our prisons.</p><p>A very significant amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service to address the challenge of Covid-19.  The measures taken have been informed and guided by the advice received from National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and consistent with the prison-specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organization, WHO, in March 2020 and human rights guidance issued by the Council of Europe.</p><p> I acknowledge that this has been a difficult and worrying time for prison staff, offenders and their families, as it has been in other areas of Irish society.  Great efforts have been made to limit and curtail the spread of the virus in the prisons.  These measures include close co-operation with the health services on outbreak control and the establishment of a robust contact tracing model, which has been acknowledged by the WHO as best practice for prisons worldwide.</p><p> I was very pleased to support this work with additional capital funding of &euro;8 million for the prisons Vote as part of the Government&rsquo;s July stimulus package.  The Irish Prison Service has continuous demands for minor and mid-scale refurbishments.  These involve security-related works in addition to a nationwide carbon-related programme of replacing lighting with LED fixtures both internally and externally and the upgrading and replacement of fire alarms.  There are also, unfortunately, issues with leaking roofs in some locations because of severe weather events as well as requirements for window replacement and the upgrading of laundry and other equipment.</p><p> A net supplementary estimate of &euro;23 million is required in 2020 in respect of the courts Vote.  There are two components to this: a significant shortfall of &euro;18 million in court fee income due to the impact of Covid-19 on the business of the courts and &euro;5 million in respect of the Government&rsquo;s July stimulus package.  The Courts Service expects that the shortfall in court fee income will be in the region of &euro;18 million as a direct result of the impact of Covid-19.  This shortfall amounts to 43% of total fee income, which is significant.  A sum in the region of &euro;9 million is accounted for in the reduction in special exemption order applications from the licensing trade and hospitality sector.  This relates to the announcement made at the end of the summer.  There is also a &euro;1 million reduction from the waiver of liquor licence fees as part of the Government&rsquo;s support package to publicans.  To date, the Courts Service has also lost the equivalent of three months&rsquo; fee income, or circa &euro;8 million, due to the impact of Covid-19.</p><p> The July stimulus package provided for additional capital funding of &euro;5 million for the courts Vote in 2020, a significant proportion of which is being utilised to cover the additional costs of leasing, fitting out and basic ICT installation to ensure that criminal jury trials can be held while observing social distancing and national Covid guidelines at a number of new locations in Dublin and nationwide.  A number of other projects were also included in the stimulus package.  These relate to urgent refurbishment works and various sustainable energy initiatives in courthouses throughout the country.</p><p> The Courts Service has been working with members of the Judiciary and other partners across the justice sector to continue to provide court hearings in as safe a manner as possible during this public health emergency.  It is important to acknowledge the leadership of the Courts Service and the Judiciary across all the courts in ensuring continuity of service during this period and the ongoing work by all concerned to ensure the safety of court users, jury members, practitioners, staff and judges, and the public.  I am particularly pleased to note the steps taken to use video links and other technologies to the greatest extent possible.  These developments represent welcome progress in the modernisation of services.  I have provided substantial additional funding in budget 2021 for the courts modernisation programme and I look forward to the positive outcome of this investment for the service in the future.</p><p> The further Revised Estimate for my Department&rsquo;s Vote is required to reflect the transfer of certain functions both to and from the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth under the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  The functions transferring from my Department mainly relate to equality, disability, migrant integration, international protection accommodation services and the Irish refugee protection programme, whereas the functions transferring to my Department relate to a small number of projects in the area of youth justice.  The net budgetary impact on the justice Vote from the original Revised Estimate voted on by the D&aacute;il in July is a reduction of &euro;114 million, which represents an adjustment of &euro;115.5 million in respect of functions transferring out less a figure of &euro;1.5 million in respect of the functions transferring in.</p><p> As part of the process, I am taking the opportunity to increase the allocation for the cash-limited subhead B11 which provides for the criminal injuries compensation tribunal, which is being increased by &euro;4 million through relocation of funding from elsewhere in the Vote.  This will facilitate additional payments of compensation to victims of crime before the end of this year.  An increased net allocation of &euro;4 million is also being provided as part of the Revised Estimate to offset a potential shortfall in immigration and visa income mainly due to the impact of Covid travel restrictions.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimates and the further Revised Estimate to the committee.  I am very happy to address any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I understand that work is still in progress with regard to the transfer of responsibility for domestic violence between the Minister and her colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  Will the Minister give us an update on what is happening in that regard and on how that transfer is going?</p> <p>  I will also pick up on another issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been rolling out district protection units, which is a very positive development.  Something I have said to both the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the previous Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is that it is imperative that Tusla has staff seconded to these units to help them work.  One thing I said to the Minister for Justice's predecessor is that sometimes people have to be asked to dance.  Will the Minister link in with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and encourage him to have some sweet words with Tusla to ensure that the duty social workers who work on cases of domestic violence and other such difficult issues will be in the units working cheek by jowl with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  That would result in the best outcomes for the children and families involved.  Will the Minister give us an update on where things stand with regard to the transfer of responsibility for domestic violence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.719" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#B01300"><p>It is important to say, as I mentioned in my initial speech, that while the number of sexual offences seems to have reduced, the number of domestic violence cases and breaches of orders has increased significantly.  The number of cases brought to the Director of Public Prosecutions has increased frighteningly since the beginning of March.  I believe the increase has been more than 86%.  A number of things have been happening in response to that.  We obviously work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Operation Faoiseamh, which was launched earlier this year, has been in operation throughout the pandemic.  It was relaunched only a few weeks ago.  Through this operation, garda&iacute; are out in the community, proactively engaging with previous victims of domestic abuse to try to ensure that they have information on the supports An Garda and community and voluntary organisations provide.</p> <p>  Various NGOs and my own Department have been working on a very significant campaign.  The Deputy will have seen the No Excuses campaign, which was relaunched last year, and the Still Here campaign, which is visible on our television screens, on social media and in newspapers.  A very significant amount of work is happening in that regard.  We are very lucky in that this is an area the Garda Commissioner has prioritised.  It was also a priority of his in his previous role in the PSNI and he has carried that over.  There is a great focus on the issue but it is a massive problem at the moment.  We need to use people's heightened awareness of the problem as an opportunity to address it and to make these issues much more visible and to make people much more aware of them.  That is why these campaigns are so important.  They highlight the signs so that people can identify them in themselves or in people they know.</p> <p>  The roll-out of the divisional service protective units had begun but, as a result of the Tom O'Malley report which made more than 57 recommendations to support victims of domestic and sexual violence, An Garda committed to having all of those units up and running by the end of September.</p><p>That target was met.  I will discuss and will undertake to have conversations with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and the Commissioner on how the resources are put in and whether this is something that they have discussed before.  Obviously, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will continue to have an element of responsibility.  We are both working in the area of domestic violence.  I will outline what we are doing at the moment.  I have begun a process of auditing across all Departments how we best drive and ensure the implementation of supports and services for victims of domestic and sexual violence.  I am keen to ensure this happens in the best way possible.  The Department of Justice, the Department with responsibility for equality matters, the Department of Education, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage all have a remit in tackling and supporting victims of domestic violence.  This audit will look at all of these Departments and agencies and work with them in that regard.</p><p> This may not be specific to the Garda role but additional funding was allocated with &euro;280,000 plus provided as part of the Supplementary Estimate.  The additional funding this year is specifically to work with the community and voluntary organisations that are linking in with the Garda.  That was important funding at the height of the pandemic.</p></speech>

I will bring him in at this stage.</p></speech>

One thing I mentioned to the Minister privately was the issue of administrative pay for garda&iacute;, especially of those out from Templemore at the moment.  They would have been expected to go through their training programme over a certain period and then go to Garda stations throughout the country.  They were all out early last spring as it happened.</p> <p>  Several people from different parts of the country have contacted me.  They have been a long time out but are only getting the training support payment.  This is a small payment they get as if they were in Templemore.  They are basically unable to survive on that.  I wrote to the Commissioner with regard to this issue but I have not received a reply yet.  This issue needs to be dealt with.  These trainee garda&iacute; provide a vital service.  It would be most unfortunate if their experience was that they were undervalued in any way.  I do not believe that is the intention of the Minister or the Commissioner or anyone involved, but there seems to be a loophole whereby they are not being properly remunerated for the hands-on work they are doing.  That needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If possible, payment should be backdated to an appropriate time when they would have been starting that kind of work.</p> <p>  I will comment on the Garda Vote in general.  The provision of additional vehicles has been one of the benefits we have seen flow from Covid-19 - although there have been few of these.  Anyway, certainly from speaking to garda&iacute; near me I have learned one of the big issues they had was the problem with vehicles and that there were never enough of them.  Often calls would come into Garda stations and they could not physically go out to answer the calls because no vehicle was available.  The additional vehicles will be welcome.  This is one of the things that should have happened a long time ago.  I will leave it at that.  I have some other issues I will talk to the Minister about when it comes to the courts and the other services.</p></speech>

I will raise the first issue with the Commissioner.  I mentioned in the initial comments that there was an increase in payments for those who are out and not in Templemore and who should technically be still in Templemore.  I understand Deputy Kenny as saying that what they are being paid is not the same amount as others on duty.  I will raise that with the Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny is right about the Garda cars.  Some 524 new vehicles have come into use this year.  I have looked at the individual divisions and counties.  Every division or county has seen an increase in Garda numbers and vehicles in recent years.  This is welcome for the reasons Deputy Kenny has outlined.</p></speech>

I have a few questions before we move on from Vote 20.  Under A3, which relates to clothing and accessories, the figures are given as &euro;263 million and &euro;274 million.  How does the clothing and accessories procurement process work?  Is there a tender?  I imagine there is.  How often is that issued or renewed?  What is the due diligence around that?</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will take my second question at the same time for the sake of efficiency and reply to both.  Subhead A10 relates to compensation.  There is a reasonably significant figure under this as well.  How does that compensation figure break down?  What sort of claims or payments are contained under that subhead?  I see the figure is down this year, but what exactly does it cover?</p></speech>

The figures mainly relate to personal protective equipment.  It is broken down as outlined in my statement.  We have looked at clothing as well.  There is a process under way for new Garda uniforms.  Most likely this will come at the end of next year.  That is taken into account in the figures.  What was the second question?</p></speech>

I am asking about Vote 20 at the moment.  It is under subhead A10 relating to compensation.  The figure is down this year by &euro;4 million but the total figure is normally &euro;16.6 million.</p></speech>

There are injuries on duty - the figure for that is down.  The second relates to the actions against the Garda.  Both figures are down but I will get more detail on that.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether the Minister will have the detail.  It relates to the hiring of non-sworn civilian staff.  Extra provision was made in the budget for this.  Does the Minister have any idea how many front-line garda&iacute; will be released to other duties as a result?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.732" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#C01300"><p>Let us consider the overall numbers, including Garda recruits in general.  We have 14,600 Garda members at the moment and 700 recruits for the front line.  That takes into account the approximately 300 retirements that take place yearly.</p> <p>  We have gone from a situation since 2018 where 18% of the overall Garda workforce are now civilian staff.  We have seen a significant increase in the number of garda&iacute; on front-line duties.  We have seen progress in recent times.  The most up-to-date figure we have is that 500 posts have been filled in 2019.  That is 500 divisional garda&iacute; who are out working now.  They are not working in offices or dealing with human resources, information and communications technology, business or such issues.  I do not have the full figures for this year yet but the intention is that we would have a similar figure again for this year.</p></speech>

We will move to Vote 21.  We will do a round robin and members can come in.  We will take questions under Vote 21.  We will start with Deputy Kenny as he had his hand up first.  If there are supplementary questions we will try to do it in the same manner.</p></speech>

The appropriations-in-aid figure is projected to be &euro;9.1 million.  This is set off against expenditure.  What does that category account for with regard to the Prison Service?</p> <p>  I noticed in the previous budget a certain amount in all Votes was set aside for audit.  An audit company would come in to check to ensure there was adequate spending of public money.  I am especially concerned about the Prison Service.  In the past we have had issues.  I know inquiries have been made, especially in regard to the mess committee in the prisons and how moneys were used.  There were questions around all of that.  I am keen to know whether further inquiries have been made in this regard.  What is happening in respect of the particular issues raised in public some two years ago at this stage?  I understand some of the allocation relates to ongoing inquires.  Is a conclusion to that expected any time soon?  It is a serious issue.  It relates to public money and it needs to be accounted for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#C01600"><p>The answer to the first question is that it relates to superannuation contributions.  Several issues have come into the public domain in several prisons in recent months.  There are several mechanisms through which there can be investigations either through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Prison Service.  We have the Inspector of Prisons as well.  This year as part of the budget the Inspector of Prisons has received a significant increase.</p><p>She is also hiring at least six staff, which will allow the Inspector of Prisons to investigate a number of current situations and allegations that have been made.  It is hard for me to comment on anything in particular that is under way at present.  It is important to point out that there are various mechanisms.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it occurs when there is a death in custody, and the Irish Prison Service has its oversight mechanism.  There is also the Comptroller and Auditor General which audits the prisons annually.  A report which was published last September outlines the work that was done in that regard.  There was also the issue regarding catering that was raised earlier this year.  That is being examined and I anticipate we will have a report on that some time in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.737" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#D00200"><p>At the start of the pandemic the prisons did very well in keeping Covid-19 out of the prisons, which are contained environments in which the virus could spread quite rapidly.  That was good.  One of the things the prisons relied on was isolation for vulnerable prisoners.  It is important to try to minimise the amount of restricted time for prisoners.  People were on 23-hours isolation or the like, and I understand the numbers have increased and that there are still people spending a long time in their cells.  We must work to minimise that.</p> <p>  One of the other issues was the community prison link workers.  These are community workers who would work on an outreach basis with people in prison to ensure they have links in their communities when they are released.  They have two functions.  One is supporting people in prison and the other is ensuring a smooth transition when they leave prison, which is incredibly important in terms of recidivism.  However, some of these prison link workers were having trouble accessing the prisons, accessing video chat and even accessing telephone calls with prisoners.  Prisoners could, of course, call them, but it would have taken up some of their family call time, as the prison link workers were having difficulty getting onto the list of approved professionals.  This varied from prison to prison and depended, to a certain degree, on the relationship with the individual governors.  It would be beneficial if we could ensure that NGOs, community supports and the like could be added either automatically or certainly much quicker, without necessarily being at the discretion of support from the Department, so prisoners can continue to access these vital services, even at a time when restrictions might be in place.  It should not mean the prisoner making the choice as to whether he or she calls his or her family or uses that time to call a support worker.  That should never have to be a choice for a prisoner.</p> <p>  Some of this worked itself out and much of it involved local individual solutions, but if the Department could ensure that community prison link workers are linking with the prisons, that could be very helpful.</p></speech>

A general policy discussion is probably a little outside the scope of that, but perhaps the Minister wishes to make an observation as it pertains to the Estimates.</p></speech>

Can we ensure that there is sufficient money in the Estimates to allow the prison link workers to be added to the list properly?  Is that better, Chairman?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020111700002#D00600"><p>The additional funding we have sought, which has been specifically identified for the Irish Prison Service, has been to ensure the safety of those who work in the prisons, the prisoners and their families.  The Deputy made a valid point.  At the outbreak of the pandemic we managed to keep Covid-19 out of the prisons.  It was a credit to the Irish Prison Service, the prisoners and their families.  Figures have increased in the last number of weeks and months.  As of yesterday, 16 November, there were 21 confirmed cases among the prison population.  That is spread out among six different prisons.  The additional funding is being put in place to support measures to contain this as much as possible.</p> <p>  In addition, there are a significant number of measures such as basic health checks and taking temperatures for all persons and prison staff.  There is ongoing revision of physical family visits.  The HSE is working with the prisons on testing and tracing and the isolation of suspected cases or prisoners with symptoms to prevent the risk of transmission.  The Deputy referred to the length of time prisoners are spending in isolation.  The prisons are trying to keep that to a minimum, but where there are suspected cases there is a requirement for it.  People over 70 years of age are cocooning, and there is training for the prison staff.  Risk assessment is taking place.  There are also standard operating procedures and the continuation of strong communication between prison staff and prisoners.  A great deal of work has been done and that has been aided by the increased used of video technology, which is part of the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  There is an issue with visits.  They have been stopped again because of the level 5 restrictions.  It is challenging because as we are in level 5 the physical visits that were booked had to be cancelled and they have had to try to reschedule.  Not everybody is able to get a telephone call whenever they wish.  They have to go through a process and that includes whether the call is with community support workers or otherwise.  There is a reason that people have not been let into the prisons with the pandemic as it is at present, but it is important to point out that the Inspector of Prisons has always been allowed into the prisons throughout the pandemic to ensure that if there are any concerns of prisoners or any issues that have arisen, she and her team have access to them and are able to engage with them in that regard.  Some of the issues the Deputy outlined are, perhaps, the issues that have been raised by prisoners.</p> <p>  Separately, and this might be going off track, the focus on prisoners after they leave is a major priority, particularly ensuring that supports are available.  A special mental health committee has been established with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Feighan, and myself to look at not just mental health supports in prisons but also the community supports that are available to prisoners when they leave prison.  That would include engagement with the NGOs and groups the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

There was reference to video linking in respect of prisoners' families.  What about video linking in respect of court attendance?  If there is more video linking, there is improved security.  It saves money on transport and keeps the staff on site, which can be a help for security.  It also reduces the potential for contraband to be passed in and around the courts.</p> <p>  I have an associated question on prison vehicles.  There is a need for a review of prison vehicles because if there are going to be more video links then some of the prison vans are too big.  Is there any provision for smaller vehicles to be used in the transport of prisoners to and from the courts when it is necessary?</p> <p>  There is a further point.  The Minister mentioned the Inspector of Prisons.  I welcome her announcement of the extra funding and more staff because there has not been a report from the Inspector of Prisons for about three years.  I understand she was complaining that there were not enough resources, so any extra resources are welcome.  The difficulty with the Inspector of Prisons is that in a recent case she was waiting for quite some time to obtain the terms of reference.  She reports to the Minister for Justice, so there is a question about the independence of the Inspector of Prisons.  I note there is a suggestion that the remit of the Ombudsman will be extended.  The Minister said that in a recent reply to a parliamentary question.  Has the Minister considered, perhaps, a separate prisons ombudsman to create a bulwark of independence for complaints which arise from within the prisons?</p></speech>

I will get the exact percentage, but it is over 60%.</p><p>As the Deputy rightly says, it reduces the need for prison staff to have to transfer but also for garda&iacute; to have to be physically present in the courts.  As the use of vehicles reduces this, it is something we would like to see continue.  While these measures have been introduced because of Covid, there is a very obvious benefit to it and we would like to see that continue.</p><p> In regard to vehicles, this is something the Irish Prison Service is looking at and if it makes a recommendation or a request on that basis, it is something we will look at in the same way we would look at such a request from the Garda or in regard to any other additional requirements.</p><p> In regard to the Inspector of Prisons, I want to outline that, since 2014, quite a number of reports have been undertaken, including 82 reports into deaths in custody, two inspection reports in regard to Loughan House - one in 2014 and one on the training unit in 2017 - seven thematic reports, functional reports and two special investigation reports.  Given the small size of the office, a huge amount of work has been done and, obviously, with the bigger office, I would anticipate that even more work can be done. </p><p>There was an option for the inspector to carry out investigations herself, based on issues that are brought to her attention.  There is also a provision within her remit for me, as Minister, to ask her to investigate something specifically and, as referred to recently, terms of reference were set out in regard to a specific investigation.  It is important that I have that remit, as Minister, where there is a concern, to be able to ask that a particular investigation can be carried out.  It is also important that, as an independent body, the inspector and her team can carry out an investigation on foot of a request from prisoners or prison officers.</p><p> In terms of a separate prisons ombudsman, that is not something I have had conversations about.  That is not to say I could not or would not, but it has not been brought to my attention.</p></speech>

On the other side, there is the issue of the youth diversion programme and the resources that have been going into it.  This is one of the things we see in justice in general.  From Garda resources, to the resources in the prisons to the resources in the courts, they all have a trend running through them because the same people, unfortunately, end up passing through all the systems very often.</p> <p>  One of the issues I have been made aware of for quite some time is that of youth detention facilities.  There was a case a number of years ago where it was deemed not appropriate for young people to be in adult prisons.  However, the only youth detention facility in the country is at Oberstown, which is always full, and we have had dilemmas where there is nowhere to put young people who are perhaps dangerous to themselves and others.  The Minister mentioned the Limerick Prison extension and the delays in getting work done.  Are there any plans to provide a facility or additional spaces in youth detention facilities?</p> <p>  I want to make a clear it is not that I think it is a good idea to be locking people up but, at the same time, we need to have facilities when they are required.  Sometimes, the courts have been put in a terrible situation where they have someone who they clearly do not want to release into society, yet there is nowhere to put them.  That situation is untenable as we move forward.</p></speech>

While some of the responsibilities have come back into my remit or into the Department of Justice, there are specific programmes separate to any facilities that might exist.  There is over &euro;2 million in funding connected with three different programmes, one of which is the dormant accounts fund, and that funding is specifically going to various different youth support and diversion programmes.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, who has specific responsibility in the Department for youth justice, will be publishing a youth justice strategy by the end of this year.  A lot of work has been done in the Department, prior to the time of the Minister of State or myself, in terms of engaging with other Departments to ensure there is a collaborative approach in the overall strategy.  The Minister of State will also be establishing and chairing a committee on antisocial behaviour, which, again, will try to tackle issues before they ever get to a stage where somebody is potentially going to a detention facility or other facility.</p> <p>  I am not aware if there is any kind of review, work or progress in train through the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, but that is something I can ask him to come back to Deputy Kenny on.</p></speech>

I know that, at some stage, we will have the Director of Prisons before the committee.  I had heard of late of a case within the paramilitary block where the security was a little over the top.  A prisoner was away on day release over a weekend and came back on a Monday.  He had a doctor's appointment across the road in Portlaoise the following day, when there was a full Army escort to get him across the road.  He had been out for the whole weekend, for what was a three-day or four-day release, and came back in, so perhaps he could have been allowed to go across the road to the doctor's appointment.  While I understand he is in a very high security wing, perhaps some flexibility could be arranged to allow people to go across the road in those circumstances, which would save money.</p></speech>

There is a very clear process that has to be undertaken, and that is adhered to.  However, there are compassionate grounds for many prisoners and they generally centre around hospital visits or appointments, visiting family members, funerals and various significant events like that.</p></speech>

Before we leave that heading, Deputy Daly referred to the electronic connection of courthouses.  It is worth noting the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, passed by the Houses in July, which enables a lot of that electronic interaction between courthouses, prisons and other venues.  I believe that has been relatively successful and has been adopted by courts around the country.  It was an efficient and pragmatic thing to do at the time and has helped to move things along.</p> <p>  We move to Vote 22 - Courts Service.  For the information of the committee, the Minister and the wider world, it is the intention that our work programme will have a wider consideration on the Courts Service and courts system, including courthouses, capacity, modernisation and so on, at a later date.  While there is not scope for it today, it is something we will be returning to and we might seek the views of the Minister down the line. </p> <p>  I have two questions.  Under either subhead A.1 or A.2, on the legal aid provisions within the Courts Service, it has been the case for some time that the number of practitioners in the criminal sphere is in decline, and legal aid rates have effectively been frozen since 2010 or perhaps even before that.  It is leading to impediments in regard to access to justice that the number of practitioners is declining, and this is happening for financial reasons.  It is something the chair of the Bar Council has raised, and the Law Society may have raised it as well.  It impacts on clients, accused persons and defendants of any kind.  Where does this sit within the Estimates and is there any provision for that to be revised or reconsidered down the line?</p> <p>  My second question is on the general management of the Courts Service, including during the pandemic.  It has its challenges, like any other part of society, and these have been admirably met in many cases.  However, I note the comments of Maura McNally, SC, the chair of the Bar Council, who only yesterday commented on the fact the courthouses in the Dublin district have effectively gone into abeyance to an extent and prefer remote hearings, whereas venues on circuit continue to have hearings.</p><p>The question of access to justice - whether litigants can get their case heard or get their day in court, be it for vindication or to pursue whatever they need to pursue - is a concern within the Courts Service.  Why is it that Dublin venues seem to be progressing?  I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to answer right away but it is a concern that reflects the wider work.  On the legal aid side, that might come under A1 or A2.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to answer that.</p></speech>

There is a continuing increase in need for it.  Having met the Legal Aid Board, in recent weeks, I have given a commitment to review the overall process and how people can access legal aid.  There was a reduction as part of FEMPI in respect of a number of different elements, including criminal legal aid, which was mentioned by the Chairman.  This is an ongoing issue that requires engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Again, I have given a commitment to the Legal Aid Board with regard to this and a number of other issues it has raised relating to reduced costs for other groups such as international protection applicants, although that was following engagement with the Legal Aid Board itself and looking at the work that was being done.  Again, this is something that needs to be engaged with through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have given a commitment to meet the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to progress this.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall structure, how the courts function is not within my remit.  There has been a significant effort.  Towards the end of the summer, the Chief Justice highlighted the fact that he wanted the Courts Service to be operating at 80% by September.  Things were on track, not just in Dublin but around the country.  With the introduction of level 5 and the change in the dynamic of Covid-19, that has changed.  Every effort is being made to have hearings held remotely.  Some significant progress has been made and there have been very positive results.  I refer to a domestic violence case recently where a barring order was given out via a video camera so it has been very successful.  For most of the courts, where they are hearing in person, possibly mainly the District Court, it is the emergency cases such as family law, domestic violence and breaches of the various different family orders that are being heard.  The overall running of the courts is a matter for the Courts Service working with the president.  With regard to the additional funding that was allocated, the &euro;5 million related to the July stimulus was aimed at getting them all up and running and provide any of those additional measures, including PPE and hiring additional buildings to be able to conduct jury trials.  That has been pretty successful in making sure criminal trials in particular have continued.</p></speech>

How is that going?  Is there a timeline for the Family Courts Bill so that once we have the building, we can put the court in it?</p></speech>

The design stage is being finalised.  Once that happens, it will go to tender.  There is quite a large hole in the ground so a bit of work has been done but quite a significant amount of work needs to be done.  I would like to see it as soon as possible.  If the design can be concluded as quickly as possible, and I believe it is nearing an end stage, we will move to the tender process and things can progress quickly.</p> <p>  The Family Courts Bill is a huge body of work that looks not just at the physical infrastructure but the system itself and how people go through it and the ancillary supports.  It is similar to what we are doing with the domestic and sexual violence piece with regard to a person's journey if he or she goes through the courts.  The legislation will be worked on for most of next year but I wish to alert Deputies that early next year, while we have an implementation group consisting of the specific agencies that must implement the changes, there will be separate engagement with NGOs and representative groups and public consultation to allow people to have an input into the legislation and what is being proposed so far in the heads of Bill that are published.  It is a huge body of work that will take most of next year but, obviously, once that is in place, I would like to see Hammond Lane and other pieces of work progress as well.  There is a question around the family court structure, whether we will use existing courthouses and whether they will be designated particular days or whether we need to develop or build new structures.  We must then decide where they will be so a body of work needs to be done.  I will engage with Deputies on those issues early in the new year.</p></speech>

Criminal hearings and sentencing hearings are being moved to Limerick.  The result is that garda&iacute; must leave the county.  They are away all day and perhaps for longer than that.  Another difficulty is that complainants and their families along with the families of accused people must also move outside the county.  Justice should be seen to be done in the local area as much as possible.  While Covid restrictions are in place, we have an opportunity to improve courthouses.  For example, there is no video link facility in the courthouse in Tralee and no space has been rented in that area for remote jury selection.</p> <p>  There is a wider issue relating to Tralee courthouse, which the Minister may have heard me mention before.  This is the time to refurbish the existing site on Ashe Street.  There is ample space there for redevelopment and the Covid restrictions provide us with the opportunity.  Some of the concerns that the Courts Service may have had about the existing building might not constitute such an issue after all.  For example, victims of crime and domestic violence cases do not necessarily have to be within the court building and have separate rooms.  The Department is renting office space a couple of hundred yards up the road and I understand that hundreds of thousands of euro is being spent annually when there is space upstairs in the existing building that could be utilised.  As regard the family law courts, in which Tralee may or may not be included, there is a building across the road that could be used as a family law court to keep it separate but more or less, make a complex out of it.  I hope the Minister is fairly well versed in most pros and some of the cons relating to keeping it there.  I suggest that now is the time when things are in a state of flux to act and refurbish the existing courthouse, which would benefit the town and county by keeping and securing the future of court services in the town.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Deputy has a very clear preference for that.  The options are: building a new courthouse on the portion of the Ballymullen barracks site; refurbishment of the existing courthouse; possible acquisition of a site owned by An Post that is to the rear of the courthouse; and building a new courthouse on the Island of Geese site.  I understand the last one is now in council ownership.  This is under consideration and I hope a decision will be made soon.  The Deputy is not the only one to have made views known as to which would be best for various reasons, including the court itself, community impact etc.  All that will need to be assessed and taken on board when a decision is made.</p> <p>  On the sittings of the court, we have asked the Courts Service to ensure inasmuch as possible and particularly for emergency cases that trial hearings can continue in a safe way and that the health of those who are working there and others attending are protected as much as possible.  It has meant a reduced number of sittings and that certain places are not being used in the way that they would have been.  These measures are based on Covid restrictions and are continually reviewed.  As we come out of the pandemic in the coming year, I hope, there will be a resumption of much of what was happening prior to the pandemic.  It is also important for us to review how things have worked to date.  Obviously, the capital plan is much longer than the Garda one which we are considering renewing and changing next year going into 2022.  I believe another ten years are left in the courthouse capital project.  A review needs to happen, taking into account the Covid pandemic, how things have been operating, the restructuring of the family court system and many other factors, with a new or revised version of the current capital plan put in place.</p></speech>

I detect from practitioners that a certain war-weariness is creeping in that nothing is being done.  Not even a stair or a wheelchair-accessible lift has been installed there.  The Garda and the practitioners are all happy with the existing building.  The Ballymullen site should be ruled out as it is outside the centre of the town.  I would like a decision to be made sooner rather than later because a weariness is coming in.</p></speech>

It would be useful to get detail on the A3 line item, which would allow us to see the stages of progression of courthouses around the country.  I will be making a submission on Naas courthouse.  I will not delay the committee with it now.  It is one of the largest districts in the country, serving Kildare and west Wicklow.  With the closure of the Kilcock courthouse, it means that all business is effectively being done in one building in Naas.  I might return to that on another occasion.</p></speech>

They are all having difficulties.  Based on reports in a local newspaper, the relatively new courthouse in Carrick-on-Shannon is considering severely limiting the number of sittings and closing it down much of the time because there is insufficient space for people to move around.  We need an assessment of each courthouse and what can be done to make it work better.  While I understand the Courts Service may already be doing some of that, it is important for it to happen as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  As we are discussing courthouses it would be remiss if I did not mention this.  All Opposition parties and groupings have requested the Minister to come to the D&aacute;il Chamber this week to make a statement and answer questions about the process of appointment of senior judges.  It would be important for her to do so from the point of view of her position and the position of the Judiciary.  To clear up the matter it would be important that she would do that.  I take this opportunity when she is here.  I know it is not is not part of what we are doing, but I thought it was important to put that to her when she is here before the committee.</p></speech>

I hope we will have many sessions of the commission ahead of us over the next few years.  We will have an opportunity to delve into all sorts of matters, but for the business before us today-----</p></speech>

Earlier this year the Chief Justice identified that there was a vacancy within the Supreme Court.  He asked the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to fill that vacancy.  Obviously, the process then ensued.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which is an independent board chaired by the Chief Justice and contains the presidents of the courts along with others, made a recommendation.  Given that there had been an election, there was an interim Government and with the outbreak of Covid, that appointment was not made.</p> <p>  Having been appointed at the end of June, after a number of weeks I looked at the recommendation that had been made and other expressions of interest that often come for any of these positions.  Following that I spoke to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Attorney General.  On foot of that, a recommendation was made, and a name was given to Cabinet.  It is important to say only one name is ever given to Cabinet, whether it is for judicial appointment or appointment of a chairperson or member to a board from any other Department.  Based on that recommendation, which had come through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which is an independent board, that name was approved by Cabinet.  It is important to say there is a very clear process.  As Minister for Justice, I adhered to that process and the person who was appointed came through an official process from an independent body chaired by the Chief Justice himself.</p></speech>

I am reluctant to set a precedent because we have much work to do in the coming years and I want to stick to our agenda where we can.  I appreciate that the Deputy asked a question and got an answer.  We will bank that.</p> <p>  Are there any other questions on Vote 22?  As there are no questions, I will move on to the consideration of Vote 24, which largely relate to the sections that are moving to other Departments owing to the restructuring of Departments.  There are no questions.  They are of minor monetary value in any case.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister and her officials for attending today and for their briefing materials and the notes supplied in advance.  I appreciate that further notes will be provided following the meeting.  I thank the members for their questions and participation.  I thank the clerk and the team for their support.</p></speech>
