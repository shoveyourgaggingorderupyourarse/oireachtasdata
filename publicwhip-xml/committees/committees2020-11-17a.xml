I welcome the members present and the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to Members in Leinster House, any other location in Leinster House, Leinster House 2000 or the Convention Centre, Dublin on days on which the relevant House sits there.  I ask members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed above as privilege for their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division, the committee member must be physically present in the room.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that due to Covid-19 restrictions, each session must conclude within two hours.</p> <p>  We are discussing the Finance Bill.  Members received a proposed timetable for the consideration of provisions today.  I draw members' attention to the proposal regarding section 54 and later sections.  It will be necessary to make an Order later today in this regard.  Members are asked to review that and contact the clerk with any proposals and issues they might have.</p> <p>  Any member acting in substitution for another member of the committee should formally notify the clerk.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members attending this meeting should be aware that, pursuant to Standing Order 106(3), they may move their amendments but cannot participate in voting on those amendments.</p> <p> I would also like to thank the clerks, all of the staff, the Minister and his officials for their work yesterday, because it was an exceptional challenge.  The members co-operated fully and we got through quite a lot, but we are due to finish tomorrow evening at 7 p.m, so I ask that we stick to that.  </p> <p>  Members are tied up in these sessions for long periods of time and are often not in a position to participate in D&aacute;il debates.  Therefore I am using my position as Chair to express my thanks to one side of the Cabinet for reaching the decision not to go ahead and prosecute people, as was being proposed in a memo sent by the Minister for Health.  I am not asking members to comment on it, but I hope that common sense prevails in respect of many other issues relative to lockdown.  The issue relates to the Finance Bill, because it is one that is affecting our economy, and if we do not open in a way that is constructive and that brings all stakeholders on board to co-operate in terms of the law, then we will end up in serious difficulty for the future.  As we discuss matters pertaining to the Finance Bill, I have discussed with another Minister the issue of Cork Institute of Technology and the need to deal with outstanding matters there in terms of the waste of taxpayers' money.  I intend to raise it this week in the D&aacute;il to make it public, because it is not being dealt with, and I feel that if the matter were to be approached in a constructive manner, we would have no difficulty.  There is always the option to appoint an investigator to address that particular situation, or a visitor, as they say.  I will return to that issue in due course. </p></speech>

I thank them and everybody who is supporting us in the operation of the ICT.</p><p> I will now deal with the amendment.  The trading profits of companies in Ireland are generally taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Some of the main features of the current corporation tax regime are its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base.  Changing this rate would involve increased complexity and could change the attractiveness of our corporation tax offering.  The Deputies may be aware that the Department of Finance carried out a comprehensive economic impact assessment of our corporation tax policy in 2014.  A distinctive feature of the economy is the high share of activity accounted for by foreign direct investment, FDI.  As part of this assessment, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, analysed firm-level data on over 3,000 newly established multinational subsidiaries in 26 European countries.  It found that if the Irish corporation tax rate had been 22.5% over the period examined, the number of new foreign affiliates entering the country would have been significantly lower.</p><p> The implications for Ireland are clear.  An increase to the 12.5% corporation tax rate could be expected to damage inward FDI flows and reduce investment and economic activity in the State, with consequential negative impacts on the overall corporation tax yield and employment in the State.  For the year to date, corporation tax receipts have continued to perform well, notwithstanding the current economic circumstances.  The sustained corporation tax receipts are critical to maintaining Exchequer revenues and supporting the Government&rsquo;s measures to support both individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.</p><p> We are fully engaged in international tax reform and, in conjunction with other EU and OECD member states, have introduced in recent years extensive reforms aimed at tackling aggressive tax planning.  This includes reform of company residence rules and transfer pricing rules, the introduction of new controlled foreign corporation, CFC, rules, anti-hybrid rules and an exit tax, and improved transparency and reporting requirements.</p><p> Taking all these considerations into account, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#B00200"><p>The amendment was tabled by Deputy Barry but, unfortunately, he is tied up with Leaders' Questions in the House.  While the amendment is in our names too, I should have said that People Before Profit holds a slightly different position, namely, that of raising the tax rate to 25%.  I nonetheless think that the spirit and thrust of the amendment, in focusing on this issue, is correct because, as I suggested last night, the effective rate is much lower than 12.5%, which relates to gross trading profits.  The total profits for the latest available figures are &euro;182 billion, whereas the taxable profits are only &euro;96 billion.  I do not accept, therefore, the Minister's claim that it is straightforward.  The fact that, in most cases, large corporations can write down their taxable profits using myriad reliefs, deductions and allowances available to them - loopholes, in layman's terms - means they are not really paying 12.5% on their profits.  They are paying 5.7%, less than half of that.  There is no need for that and I reject the claim that if they were made to pay the actual 12.5%, they would all go flying out of the country.</p> <p>  I refer the Minister to a recent interview on "Morning Ireland" with US Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democratic Congressman from Philadelphia, where he was asked about this issue.  He was categorical and there was no equivocation.  He said bluntly that Ireland's tax rate was not the key issue with the location of US multinational investment in this country but rather that it was our involvement in the EU market and the fact that Ireland is an English-speaking country.  Critically, he emphasised the fact that we have a highly educated workforce.  There is a suggestion that if these multinational corporations were made to pay 12.5% - which, if they did so on gross trading profits, would deliver double the sum we are getting now, or an additional &euro;10 billion in revenue - they would leave.  Brendan Boyle, however, in putting forward arguments from the point of view of an American politician, stated that they would not leave.  There is simply too much profit being made here by those companies and, even if they had actually to pay 12.5%, they would still make very considerable profits and pay a very low proportion of those profits in corporation tax.</p> <p>  We should not, therefore, take this kid-glove attitude to the corporations.  We need money for housing, water infrastructure, health infrastructure and so many different areas.  Indeed, those companies depend significantly on that infrastructure, not least the education infrastructure.  As Brendan Boyle pointed out, with that educated workforce from which they generate so much money, why on earth would we not at least make them pay 12.5% in order that the money could be redirected into further enhancing our education system and other key public services and infrastructure?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#B00500"><p>I move amendment No. 127:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 40, after line 35, to insert the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;Report on compliance of producer companies in receipt of section 481 tax relief</b>  	<b>22.</b>The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, produce a report on the extent to which producer companies in receipt of section 481 tax relief are complying with requirements to provide quality employment and training, with employment legislation, taking direct responsibility for their employees and trainees, and acknowledging the service of employees who have worked for them over many years and in productions similarly financed through section 481 relief.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>The amendment seeks to have a report produced on the section 481 relief within three months of the passage of the Bill.  Section 481 concerns the film tax relief, which amounts to approximately &euro;80 million a year, although the figure varies from year to year.  This is significant public financing of the live action and film industry.  I stress that I support public funding of film and the arts generally, and I would like arts funding, including for film, to increase from its fairly low levels, by European standards.  Currently, 0.1% of GDP goes to the arts, whereas in the rest of Europe, it is 0.6%.  That is six times less than the average in a country that has a significant international reputation based on it arts output.</p><p>My call for a review of this relief is not because I want in any way to obstruct - indeed, I want only to see increased funding for the arts, including film.  As I have outlined on numerous occasions in the House, and the Minister will be aware of this, there remain significant problems with section 481.</p><p>As spelled out in the Taxes Consolidation Act, the purpose of that section is to generate quality employment and training.  I will add a point that I did not make yesterday.  Under EU law, state aid to the film industry - I want this aid to be provided - is predicated on it generating companies of scale and creating a permanent pool of skill, talent and creativity.  That is not happening, though.  The film producer companies that receive the money do not want to acknowledge the rights of those who work in the sector or take responsibility for them as employees.  Therefore, there is no permanent pool and there are no companies of scale.  The largest film producer companies in this country might have ten or 15 permanent employees.  Some have no permanent employees at all.  As such, the number of people who are recognised in any way as employees in the industry is tiny.  Most of them are employed on a project-to-project basis.  Even if they have worked in the industry for 20, 30 or 40 years, which is the case for many of them, when the next film comes up, it is as if that is the first time they have sought employment in the industry.  They have no pension rights, there is no proper system of accreditation for trainees and there is no acknowledgement of the service that people have given to the industry over many years.  This puts the workers in a very weak position.</p><p> Despite the fact that the Government has acknowledged some of these points and sought to introduce reforms to improve the workers' situation, there has been no change on the ground.  To a large extent, the situation remains the same because the film producers, in what I can only describe as a bloody-minded refusal to acknowledge the intent of the Government's reforms and an attempt to ignore employment law and the conditions placed on state aid by the EU, refuse to acknowledge their obligations to their employees.  They even refuse to acknowledge that they are the employers and that their workers are employees.</p><p> We must press home the fight in order to end this situation and give people rights and acknowledgement as workers in the industry, with pensions, proper training pathways and so on.  This has still not been achieved.  I will not elaborate on the arguments further, but there is more to be done in this regard.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.  While I have acknowledged the Government's willingness to listen and make some improvements, the situation has still not got to where it needs to be even in terms of meeting our obligations under EU state aid rules.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#C00200"><p>We debated this matter at length yesterday, so I will not repeat the same arguments.  However, I will emphasise two points to the Deputy.  First, I expect that the process that is under way in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which I understand is hoped to lead to a framework agreement on such matters by the end of the year, will be a significant step forward in dealing with the matters to which the Deputy referred.  I accept the point that he made yesterday that it is not a collective agreement, but I do not believe I ever stated that it was purported to be one.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's point about this being an employment relationship between an actor, a set designer and a film or television series that is due to be made and that there is not the same continuity of relationships as there is in other parts of our economy for different kinds of work.  All of that being said, the process of trying to get to a framework agreement later this year must have an effect on the matters the Deputy raised.  They are best dealt with as employment relations and in the arms of the State that deal with such matters as opposed to in the Finance Bill.</p> <p>  Second, and as the Deputy has been good enough to acknowledge, this is an area that my officials and I have followed up on over the past two years after he raised it with me.  I have with me a copy of the form that he referred to yesterday.  It lays out the requirements that we expect to be adhered to in order to access section 481 tax relief.  This form has not been implemented for long.  If it does not begin to have the kind of effect that we want it to have, we will take further action.  In what I believe was a Report Stage debate two years ago, I made the point to the Deputy that, if a tax relief was granted on the expectation of quality employment being made available, such employment should be made available.  That is what led to the development of this form, which reads: &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo;.  We did what we said we would do in conjunction with the Deputy.  If this does not begin to have the desired effect or if issues are raised with me regarding its operation, there is much that we will be able to do between Finance Bills to examine these matters.</p></speech>

We have had an extensive debate on it.  However, I will make a few final points to him.</p> <p>  A key aspect of quality employment and training, particularly as set out in the fixed-term workers legislation at European and national levels, is recognition of service.  The Minister cannot make commitments on it now, but I ask that he and his officials examine this issue carefully.  The film producers, who receive significant amounts of money year in and year out and employ largely the same people year in and year out, refuse to acknowledge the service that those workers have given them.  They have done that by hiding behind designated activity company, DAC, status.  In other words, they are implying that it is not them but a series of different companies when the fact of the matter is that it is the same producer companies.  This essentially allows them to evade their legal responsibilities to employees.  In doing so, they are in serious breach of EU directives and our national legislation.  This behaviour must be clamped down on seriously.</p> <p>  If the Minister's officials read the submissions being made by the producer companies in receipt of section 481 relief in various cases that have been before the Labour Court and the WRC in recent times, they would see those companies explicitly stating that they are not the employers and that the DACs are.</p><p>That is in breach of the declaration they are signing and the clear intent behind the section 481 relief and the conditions surrounding it.  This matter needs to be looked at carefully and those companies need to be told that what is happening has stop.  It is an abuse, a failure to comply with the law and those companies must be told that they will have the section 481 relief removed from them if they continue to make those arguments.</p><p> The state aid rules also need to be examined as they apply to support to the industry.  They are explicit in stating that one must build companies of scale and create a permanent pool of employment and talent in this sector.  That is simply not happening at all.  There is no such permanent pool for the same reason, that is, the producers do not want to accept that they have any responsibility to the people who work in the industry.  I will leave it at that but I ask the Minister to look at those particular points.</p></speech>

What does the Minister believe the level of take-up of this tax relief scheme has been, particularly by smaller companies, and what is the rationale for extending the expiration date for two years?</p></speech>

We all want to expand knowledge, see innovation and research to improve our society, develop technology and advance enterprise and industry that is beneficial to society.  That is a no-brainer and a noble objective.  However, I put it to the Minister that the mechanisms by which we do that, including the knowledge development box and research and development grants with which we will deal later, are largely benefiting a very small cohort of companies.  The major objective of those companies is to make money, largely in the IT sector.  I am not saying they have not contributed to the advance of technology, and useful technology, but there is a hell of a lot more out there in terms of scientific and technological advance than the small number of social media and IT companies that are dealing with smart technology and are the major beneficiaries of reliefs and grants.  We should be carrying out a cost-benefit analysis as to whether the significant amounts of money which, in the main, go to a small group of multinationals would not be better directed into our public universities.</p> <p>  This may be a better time than ever to make the argument in this regard, given Covid-19, because we all now see the value in, for example, research into things such as vaccines and medicines, and across the whole health area.  The research capacity of our universities for testing and tracing and of our health system for researching medicines is way below what it should be, faced with the sort of crisis we are in.  I seriously suggest that we need to weigh up whether we would be better off giving direct funding to our public universities, health service and so on in the areas of research development and innovation, rather than giving reliefs such as this which benefit a small number of wealthy multinational corporations.</p></speech>

When we look at the knowledge development box, we should not think that it is the only thing the Government is doing to try to support research and development, and a high-innovation economy.  We are, through may different investments, doing the kind of work to which Deputy Boyd Barrett has referred in our universities and places of higher education.  That is funded directly by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Much of the work to which the Deputy referred is happening.  It is funded via expenditure, as opposed to tax expenditure, and it is overseen by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department.</p> <p>  The knowledge development box is comparatively small in the context of the kind of money that is correctly spent by the taxpayers in supporting research.  That is illustrated by answering the questions that Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell put to me regarding the scale of the knowledge development box.  I will do that before concluding by answering her question regarding why it is being extended in the way I am proposing.  For 2016, the total cost of expenditure for the knowledge development box was &euro;9.4 million, with a total of 12 claimants on it.  For 2017, the budget was &euro;10.3 million, with a total of 13 claimants.  We expect to have the final figures for 2018 in the first half of 2021.  The total cost is estimated to be &euro;9 million with fewer than ten claimants.  In terms of the scale of the tax expenditure and the number of companies that are accessing it, this is one of the smaller tax reliefs in place in our tax code.</p> <p>  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell asked about the rationale for the scheme and its extension.  The rationale for the scheme is to encourage companies to locate qualifying research and development activities here in Ireland and, by doing that, to encourage employment and more substantive operations within the State.  It is being extended for two years in the context of uncertainty about a no-deal Brexit and some of the operational challenges that have been created due to Covid-19.  It normally takes approximately two years to build up data for a relief such as this in order to allow us to evaluate its operation.  We will have a new sunset clause on the knowledge development box of 31 December 2022.</p><p>That will allow the knowledge development box for a company to have been in operation for a period of time and then they will have claimed it for the two years after that, which should give us more information to evaluate its operation.</p></speech>

That is something the Government has resisted but Covid-19 creates a new context for the case for wealth taxes because we are borrowing huge amounts to finance income supports and other increased expenditure in areas such as health and so on to sustain us through Covid-19, and particularly the incomes of those who have been hit by the pandemic.  It is worth saying that many of the people who have been hit had precarious incomes and circumstances in the first place or would have been low paid people in areas like bar work, hospitality, the arts, about which we have talked a good deal, music, live entertainment and taxi drivers.  These would not be people who had very high incomes to start with and they have been hurt very significantly by the measures.  While there has been some income supports for them they are people who are really suffering as a result of Covid-19.  There are other sectors of our society who are not suffering but actually doing extraordinarily well.  The report of the Central Bank for the second quarter of this year that came out in the past few days underlines that in spades where the net household wealth has now reached the highest level ever in the history of the State at &euro;817 billion.  That is a jump of approximately &euro;60 billion on the year before.  It is an extraordinary accumulation of wealth.  As the Central Statistics Office, CSO, demonstrated in its studies on the distribution of wealth, that wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in a small number of very wealthy households.  For example, the richest 1% of the population have more wealth than the bottom 50%.  That is an extraordinary fact.  The richest 1% have more wealth than the combined household wealth of the 50% at the bottom.  The wealthiest 10% have half of that wealth, 50% of that &euro;817 billion.  That is extraordinary, and it is growing every year because once we reach a certain threshold of wealth the money begins to make money.</p><p>Against the background of many people being hurt in the Covid-19 pandemic and us clearly needing very significant additional investment in key public services more so than ever after Covid-19, for example, in our health service, to reduce class sizes in education and to invest in key infrastructure projects, surely there is a serious case for wealth taxes or, in this specific context, for a Covid solidarity wealth tax.  These are measures that have been introduced in a number of countries since Covid-19 or are being actively discussed around the world if countries have not yet introduced them.  I refer to the idea of imposing Covid solidarity wealth taxes on those with the very highest incomes and those who have very significant accumulated wealth.  That would save us from having to borrow as much as we are having to borrow and it would be an important measure, underpinning with real action, the principle of &quot;we are all in it together&quot;, which has very much provided the framework for the public attitude towards the sacrifices and hardship they have to make to deal with Covid-19.</p><p>That is why we press the case for removing more aggressive taxes on working people and replacing them with wealth taxes, in particular in the current climate a Covid solidarity wealth tax.</p></speech>

However, it is estimated that the removal of the application of the universal social charge, USC, on all incomes below &euro;70,000 as suggested would cost in the region of &euro;1.6 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely that if the new tax took the form of a new USC rate for those earning over &euro;100,000, it would need to be as high as 14.6 % in order to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure that this is a cost-neutral proposal.  This estimation does not take account of any behavioural changes that could result from the significant increase in marginal rates of taxation. </p> <p>  To introduce any higher rate of USC would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates have an impact on work and also cause harm to our international competitiveness.  The considerable progress that has been made in recent years to restore our economy cannot be taken for granted, particularly given the challenges in the international arena that confront us at present.  </p> <p>  Introducing a USC exempting all those earning up to &euro;1,346 per week would considerably erode the tax base.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that 29% of all income earners will not be liable for USC in 2021.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;70,000 would exempt almost 88% of income earners from USC.  This would greatly narrow our income tax base and expose the economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn. </p> <p>  In summary, the USC and our progressive income tax code have shown their mettle in 2020 in terms of their ability to generate a large amount of income tax at a time when we need it to pay for public services that are particularly essential at the moment.  I am not supportive of reducing the number of people who pay the USC, as Deputy Boyd Barrett suggests, while at the same time significantly increasing marginal tax rates in the way the Deputy wants.  That would have an effect on kinds of jobs we have in the State.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

In particular, section 15 updates the definition of &quot;relevant person&quot; in section 835A and replaces section 835E, which provides for an exclusion from transfer pricing rules for certain domestic non-trading arrangements.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that certain aspects of the transfer pricing legislation operate as intended.  The new section 835E also provides that parties to certain domestic loan arrangements may be regarded as &quot;qualifying relevant persons&quot; and fall within the exclusion, provided certain conditions are satisfied.</p><p>Following publication of the Finance Bill, it became apparent that certain<i>bona fide</i>domestic non-trading arrangements, which were similar in nature to qualifying loan arrangements, were not specifically provided for within the exclusion.  Therefore, I am now making provision to include additional domestic non-trading arrangements within the scope of section 835E.  These amendments extend the exclusion from transfer pricing rules for domestic non-trading arrangements in the following circumstances, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  The first is where an individual, tax resident in the State, provides a loan to a trading company or rental company to which they are associated.  The second is where a company within the charge to corporation tax or an individual within the charge to income tax, in each case as a supplier, is owed a debt by either a trading company or rental company which arose from a supply of goods, services or assets.  Of note is that it is only the debt and not the arrangement or part of an arrangement that gives rise to the debt that will be excluded by this amendment.  The third is where a replacement loan is used to repay a loan that previously qualified as a qualifying loan arrangement, in which case the replacement loan will be treated as having been used for the same purpose as the original loan.  Of note is that the replacement loan must satisfy the other necessary conditions.  The final circumstance is where intragroup debt is created between two associated companies as a result of the acquisition of ordinary shares or a subscription for ordinary shares in a trading company or rental company where all of the other necessary conditions for a qualifying loan arrangement are satisfied.</p><p>The other amendments I propose to make are minor in nature and include some updates to cross-references and other minor technical updates.  I commend these amendments to the committee.  I am considering a Report Stage amendment with respect to this section.</p></speech>

It is good to make the rules clearer.  However, I would be concerned if it would allow for the possibility of transfer pricing arrangements via special purpose vehicles, SPVs, and financial vehicle corporations, which appear to take place at arm's length because they use the orphan ownership-type structure we discussed yesterday.  In reality, these are essential intragroup transactions designed for the purpose of tax minimisation.  If a company uses an orphan structure with legal trustees holding the issued share capital, will Revenue and the Central Bank look to find the ultimate beneficial owner when trying to ascertain whether transfer pricing arrangements are being used?</p></speech>

Some international experts are worried about the strength of Ireland's CFC, rules.  I welcome that companies that appear on the EU's new blacklist will no longer be able to avail of exemptions, but I am worried about those companies that are not on the list.  No EU jurisdictions are on the list.  Although these measures spring from the EU's anti-tax avoidance directive, I am concerned that the rules, despite today's welcome amendments, are unlikely to succeed in their aim of curbing aggressive multinational tax avoidance.  Will the Government publish any publicly available data on the impact that blacklisting has on financial flows between Ireland and jurisdictions on the blacklist?

Those countries are seem to be unco-operative in terms of fair and effective taxation.</p> <p>  I imagine that most of the information on the operation of the list will be prepared by the EU, but I will see if there is any domestic source of information that I can share with the committee.  If there are national pieces of data that would aid the committee in evaluating these rules, I will see if they are available and share them with it.</p></speech>

My judgment is that that is probably unlikely because the list of countries that are not inside the scope of our tax co-operation or of our tools for dealing with tax non-co-operation is very small.  The combination of this list and, for example, measures taken through the OECD will have a significant effect on better tax co-operation.</p></speech>

Where a farm is transferred into joint ownership, the farmers must own and farm the asset for the next ten years before they can qualify for the capital gains tax retirement relief.  This is preventing farms from being transferred into joint ownership and is a disincentive to female participation in agriculture.</p><p>Where a farmer has owned and used the asset for ten years and it is transferred into joint names, the transferee's spouse should inherit the same ownership and usage status as his or her spouse who had been farming the land up to that point.  This amendment just seeks to clarify that in terms of the retirement relief for capital gains tax.  It will not be used often, but this situation is acting as barrier to the transfer of land to joint owners.</p><p>A number of years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Iringa in Tanzania to see an Irish Aid project that was being run by Concern.  Irish taxpayers' money was involved in assisting women to get their land into joint ownership.  The Irish taxpayer was successful in that initiative, which gave equal power and control to the husband and wife in terms of the land's ownership.  We are encouraging joint ownership of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa, yet this anomaly in Ireland is putting in place an unfair barrier to women having joint ownership.</p><p>I am seeking a small alteration to the definition to ensure that it will not act as a barrier to the transfer of farmland from one spouse to joint ownership.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#H00200"><p>To qualify under sections 598 and 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a relevant individual must have owned and used the qualifying asset - farmland, in this case - for a minimum of ten years prior to disposal.  The provision allows for the aggregation of periods of ownership of the qualifying asset by each spouse or civil partner for the purposes of the ten-year ownership test.  It does not, however, extend and aggregate the use of the assets in the same manner.  The exception to this is in the case where one of the spouses or civil partners has died.</p> <p>  I am aware that the issue to which the Deputy's amendment relates was raised in the context of the 2014 review to which he referred.  Nevertheless, I will make a number of points in this regard.  First, the aim of the relief is to encourage timely disposal of a business or farm to the next generation.  Second, the relief applies to an individual and, therefore, where both spouses meet the criteria, both can benefit from the relief separately, thereby doubling the relief available to the couple.  Where only one spouse qualifies, that person will still be able to avail of the relief.  Third, and most important, this is not an anomaly.  The inclusion of the usage requirement ensures that the individual qualifying for the relief is genuinely active in the farm or business.  This is a fundamental requirement.</p> <p>  A provision allowing that in cases of joint ownership, both owners will be eligible for retirement relief if either is eligible could allow for tax avoidance and greatly expand the scope of the relief.  This is because if the disposal is outside the family or the disposer is over the age of 66, there are limits to the proceeds or consideration on which relief can be claimed.  If couples could both claim relief in cases where either of them qualifies, they could effectively double the relief available to them by putting their assets in joint names just before the transfer of the assets, even in cases where one spouse had never used the asset, that is, had not worked on the farm.  It is for those reasons that I cannot accept the Deputies' amendment.</p></speech>

None of us is trying to create loopholes in the tax law or encourage tax avoidance.  That is not the objective behind the amendment.  I am seeking a report into the issue to see whether it is possible to ensure that a mechanism is in place that will not discourage the joint ownership of farmland.  There are many barriers to this happening.  From a policy perspective, we all agree it is important that each spouse has equal ownership of the farmland and we do not want a barrier to be put in place in that regard.</p> <p>  I accept the point the Minister made about not wanting to create a tax avoidance element by altering the legislation as it stands, but I am seeking a review to see whether a mechanism can be found to get over this barrier to transferring land into both names, without creating a tax avoidance loophole.  Will the Minister and his officials reconsider this and see whether there is a mechanism to meet the objectives he set?  I do not disagree with those.  He might also try to facilitate, insofar as is possible, as much land as possible being transferred into joint ownership.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that in putting forward the amendment, he is not in any way seeking to indirectly facilitate tax avoidance.  I fully understand that and the policy issue he wishes to address but I do not believe that the Bill is the place in which a commitment to reports should be put into law.</p> <p>  I am, however, willing to prepare a note for the committee that we will share with it perhaps by the end of this year, although we have to focus on getting the Bill passed.  We will share that with the Deputy and that might be a way in which he can better understand the issues to which I refer.  If options are available - although to manage expectations, I am not sure they will be - we will lay them out in the note.  If that is of help to the Deputy, given that he has raised the matter, I will be happy to do that.  In return, I ask him to consider not pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Under that Act, land being disposed of still attracts these reliefs where the solar panels installed do not exceed 50% of the total area of land concerned.</p><p>The difficulty is there is an ambiguity surrounding the definition as laid out in the legislation and this is deterring many farmers from considering entering into land leases for solar projects.  As the Minister will know well from our discussions through the years, the objective is that by 2030, 70% of the energy on our grid will be renewable.  Having solar as part of that mix is vital and we need to ensure that landowners are prepared to consider leasing land for the installation of solar panels.  Clarity needs to be brought to the existing legislation with a small amendment.  The calculations that are used to determine the area of land on which the solar panels are installed should include only the footprint of the structures that mount the solar panels and the ancillary equipment such as service roads but exclude any area capable of being grazed by livestock.</p><p>There is a lack of clarity as to the definition of the 50% of land that is covered by solar panels.  All these solar panels are mounted at a height that allows sheep to graze under them.  That grazing area should be allowed as agricultural land in the calculation of the footprint of the solar panels.  The lack of clarity in the legislation is causing a great deal of concern for farmers because the liability, if that definition is not clarified, is significant and is an inhibiting factor to farmers signing up to these leases.</p></speech>

A key condition is that the total area of land under lease and on which solar panels are installed does not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.  </p><p> Revenue requires that the total area within the perimeter of the land that has been leased by the developer and on which solar panels have been installed is counted for the purposes of calculating the proportion of land given over to this alternate use.  In other words, the entire area that has been leased is counted.  This includes the marginal areas of land that lie between and around the rows of solar panels that have been installed. </p><p> The view of Revenue is that it would not generally be possible to farm any land on which equipment for the production of renewable energy is installed.  Due to the large scale and high density nature of solar operations, large areas of agricultural land are removed from normal productive agricultural activity.  To maintain the policy objective of agricultural relief, a 50% limit on the amount of land that can be diverted to this alternative use is in place.</p><p> From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, we believe clarity is in place to allow a determination of what land has been used for and the effect, therefore, it has on claiming tax relief.  If the Deputy has particular matters in which this clarity is not apparent for individual cases and shares them with me I will, in turn, share them with the Revenue Commissioners and ask that they respond to him.  From a policy point of view, the Revenue and I are satisfied that there is clarity regarding land use.  I reiterate that if the Deputy is aware of individual matters that the Revenue should consider &ndash; I am sure they have already considered them - if he shares with me I will, in turn, share them with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

The nub of the issue is that I do not think any of the Revenue Commissioners is a sheep farmer.  The problem is with the definition.  The definition, as outlined by the Revenue Commissioners, is that the area around and between solar panels is considered the area for calculation that is suitable for farming.</p> <p>  The reality is that under these solar panels the grass continues to grow.  These solar panels are mounted quite high and sheep can and do easily graze under them.  While the land in question complies with good farming practice under the rules and regulations of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, because it has been grazed by sheep and maintained, the difficulty arises in the Revenue definition.  </p> <p>  It has stated that the area under the solar panel, which is being actively grazed by sheep, cannot be considered agricultural land.  This is the nub of the issue.  The difficulty is the definition set out by the Revenue Commissioners, which refers to the area around rather than under the solar panels where grass continues to grow and sheep can and do graze.  I would be quite happy to bring the Minister to a solar farm and show him exactly how it operates.  I will give him one or two lambs to bring home.</p></speech>

It would appear that farmers of all varieties work within the Revenue Commissioners.  At some point, when the public health guidance allows, I will certainly take the Deputy up on his offer to have a look at land that allows the grazing of lambs and its use for solar energy production at the same time.</p> <p>  As I said, from a policy point of view, it appears that there is clarity that allows the Revenue Commissioners to operate this relief.  I do not need to tell the Deputy that the reliefs in place in respect of the inheritance of agricultural property are significant.  They allow a very significant reduction in the taxable value of property.  That is done for good policy reasons.  We have to ensure, therefore, that the land that is participating in this tax relief is being used for genuine agricultural purposes.</p> <p>  It is for that reason I believe the policy as structured at the moment is clear and effective.  I reiterate that if there are individual cases that the Deputy wants me to bring to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, I am very happy to do so.  I will take him up on his offer of looking at lambs at some point in the future.</p></speech>

I take him at his word.  The difficulty is that I am talking about genuine farming and the grazing of this land.  I am not talking about people who are trying to avoid paying tax.  It is a significant barrier to the roll-out of renewable energy across the country, in particular the deployment of solar panels.</p> <p>  We have the mother and father of all charges in trying to achieve 70% renewable electricity on our grid by 2030.  That is based on our current electricity demand, never mind the petrol that is being put on this particular fire with the number of data centres being connected to the grid.  Unless we can actively encourage farmers to start installing solar panels on their land, we are not going to get anywhere near our 2030 targets.  </p> <p>  This particular definition excludes the area of land under a solar panel that is being grazed not just by lambs but also by ewes because they are a significant height off the ground and allow daylight to get in and grass to grow.  This land is being actively grazed under solar panels and, because of that, should be considered agricultural land.  It cannot have cattle on it, but it can have sheep grazing on it and there is no reason it should fail to comply with the definition.  The difficulty is that the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of agricultural land in this instance is very different from the practical reality.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

A further amendment is now required to section 22 in order to clarify that in relation to a subsequent disposal of the foreign currency, the base cost of that foreign currency for capital gains tax will be its original base cost, that is, the cost of the foreign currency before any transfers between bank accounts of the same person took place.  By putting in place this amendment, the budget night resolution underpinning section 22 will cease to have effect.  The original intention behind the amendment, that transfers between accounts of the same person in the same foreign currency do not give rise to a gain or a loss where there is no corresponding economic gain or loss, would take effect from the date of the passing of the Finance Act.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 134 is, relatedly, to have a report on that proposal.  The Minister and I have had this discussion on a number of occasions in the past.  The reality is that within the agricultural sector, there is no alternative to diesel at present.  We do not have electric tractors or hybrid vehicles and the agricultural sector is hugely dependent on green diesel.  I am arguing, as have many others, that we should not be applying a carbon tax where there is no alternative available to diesel.</p> <p>  The principle behind a carbon tax is to encourage people to move to alternative fuels.  The objective behind it is not to bring in additional revenue for the Exchequer but to get people to move to alternative forms of energy.  In the case of agriculture, there is no alternative to agricultural diesel at the moment.  There may well be at some stage in the future but it is not available at present and because of that, we should not be applying a carbon tax to agricultural diesel.  Agricultural diesel is marked diesel because it is used for a specific purpose within the agricultural sector.  </p> <p>  The Minister will come back and make the argument that there is a rebate scheme in place.  That is available for some farmers who have a tax liability but contractors and many farmers who do not have a tax liability are having to pay this particular carbon tax when there is no alternative fuel available to them.</p> <p>  If we accept the principle that carbon tax is not about bringing in more money to the Exchequer and is about trying to drive change across society and the economy to more fuel efficient and cleaner vehicles, we have to accept the principle that we cannot charge it on agricultural fuel because an alternative does not exist at present.</p></speech>

The Minister can reply in whichever order he wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#K02300"><p>Okay.  Amendment No. 134, as the Deputy has said, focuses on the agricultural sector and amendment No. 133 is much broader than that.  He has spoken on amendment No. 134 so I will confine my comments to that for now.  The main exposure that the agricultural sector faces to carbon tax is through the use of marked gas oil, MGO, also known as agricultural diesel or green diesel.  It is already subject to an exceptionally low rate of mineral oil tax, much lower than that applied to auto diesel.  The rate of mineral oil tax on MGO is currently 11.8 cent per litre and it will increase to 13.8 cent per litre in May 2021, following the application of the increase in carbon tax.  This compares very favourably with the current rate of mineral oil tax applied to auto diesel, which is 51.5 cent per litre.</p> <p>  In budget 2012, my predecessor made provision for a double income tax relief for farmers to compensate for the increase in carbon tax at the time.  Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel, and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel, which is the 2012 baseline.</p><p>This relief continues to apply.  While I am mindful of the point made by Deputy Naughten that any change in carbon taxation does have an effect on those who are paying it, and I accept that, on the other hand a set of very comprehensive reliefs and supports is in place for the agricultural sector that I believe gives very strong recognition of the challenges it faces as we adjust to a lower carbon future.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#L00200"><p>The difficulty I have is that not only are we discussing the increase in carbon tax from next spring but we are looking at increasing the carbon tax for agricultural fuel from now until 2030.  I will deal with this incremental increase in carbon taxes in far more detail when discussing one of my later amendments.  Specifically at this point, we are looking at an additional carbon tax on the agricultural sector of &euro;27.3 million next year.  This is a sector that does not have an alternative available to it.</p> <p>  The objective behind all of these carbon taxes is that, over time as people buy new cars and upgrade their heating systems, they would move to more carbon efficient alternatives or zero carbon alternatives.  This is the objective behind the introduction of carbon taxes.  This should be done in incremental blocks rather than annually because if it is done on an annual basis, people tend to absorb it rather than being motivated to change.  In the case of the agricultural sector and the farming community, there is not an alternative for them to move to.  Diesel is the only fuel that can currently be used in the agricultural sector.  Farmers cannot go and get an electric tractor.  The machinery is not available.</p> <p>  The Minister made a point regarding the rebates in the agricultural sector.  They are all well and good if someone has a significant tax liability but the reality is, as shown consistently by Teagasc farm surveys, that many farmers are not making enough income on their farms to generate a tax liability in the first instance.  As a result, they are not in a position to claim the relief back for diesel.  The practicality is that farmers do not have an alternative so why are we taxing them in the manner we are?  This is turning out to be purely a tax rather than an environmental tool to get people to change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#L00300"><p>The way this measure differs from other taxes is that we have made a commitment that we will use the revenue raised from this carbon tax to fund the activities needed to lower carbon use in our economy.  Unlike every other tax I will debate with the Deputy on the Finance Bill, we will not use the revenue from carbon taxation to fund general expenditure.  We are using it purely with the objective of putting in place the incentives, plans and changes needed to lower the use of carbon in Ireland.</p> <p>  I listened carefully to the point the Deputy made on the effect of this increase in carbon tax on the agricultural sector.  I recognise the consequences the sector faces and I acknowledge this.  The reliefs I outlined earlier offer a very high degree of support for our farmers in dealing with carbon pricing changes.  This is legitimate and needed given the difficulty they have in changing their vehicles or getting new vehicles with low levels of diesel use.  This is why these reliefs are in place.  I repeat that the changes made in 2012 by the then Minister, Michael Noonan, offer a very high level of support to farmers in coping with the changes that will arise as a result of carbon pricing going up.</p> <p>  The Deputy understands the value of these changes as a former Minister in this area.  He made the case for the change being incremental.  This is what we are doing.  We are making incremental changes year by year and we are committing to making these changes for the next number of years until we get to a level of carbon taxation that experts believe can make a difference to the amount of carbon used in Ireland.  I will conclude by emphasising that the changes made in the budget of 2012 offer a very high level of protection to farmers in dealing with the income consequences of carbon taxes going up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-17a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111700002#L00400"><p>I accept that for farmers who have a tax liability the changes made in 2012 will benefit them.  I do not dispute this but the fact is that a very large proportion of farmers in this country do not have a tax liability because they are making very little, if nothing, from their farms at present.  The reliefs are all well and good but farmers cannot access them unless they actually have a liability to pay tax in the first place.  This is part of the problem.</p> <p>  I will go into greater detail later but I am arguing against an incremental increase in carbon tax on an annual basis.  The Minister needs to do it on a step-change basis and I said this to him when I was in my previous role as Minister with responsibility for the environment.  With incremental slow change, people will absorb the tax rather than act upon it.  It will not bring about the type of motivational change needed.  If the Minister did it in big blocks of changes every three or four years, it would act as a much bigger motivator.  I will come back to this point later.  I do not want to dwell on it now.</p> <p>  The Minister said the objective behind the carbon tax is that it will be ring-fenced to be used to lower the use of carbon throughout the economy.  I welcome this principle.  The difficulty is that &euro;27 million will be collected from the agricultural sector in 2021 in carbon taxes and none of this money will be put back into lowering carbon usage in the agricultural sector.  This is the difficulty I have.  The tools, mechanisms and vehicles are not there as of yet.  The point I am making is that we should not be taxing a sector when alternatives are not available.</p> <p>  We are taxing farmers and investing the revenue in diesel hybrid buses in the city of Dublin when we should be going for zero emission buses, an argument I had in the past with the Minister and the previous Minister with responsibility for transport.  I fundamentally disagree with the idea of diesel hybrid buses.  Regardless, we are subsidising diesel in Dublin Bus but using taxes on the agricultural sector, where there is not an alternative available, to fund this investment.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is why I am opposed to the approach being taken.</p></speech>

These sections provide for multi-annual increases in carbon tax.  I am concerned that they will have a consequential effect on lower income households.  In June 2019, the ESRI published the report, Carbon taxation in Ireland: distributional effects of revenue recycling policies.  In its research, the ESRI found that carbon taxation is found to be regressive, with poorer households spending a greater proportion of their income on the tax than more affluent households.  In its modelling, the ESRI found that with an increase in carbon tax by an additional &euro;30 per tonne, every household bears some cost but the cost is greatest for the poorest households.  Comparing the first and fourth quartiles, it indicated that poorer households suffer disproportionately more from carbon taxes.  In addition, single households with children are the most affected by this policy.  The trajectory set out in last year's and this year's Finance Bill is an &euro;80 per tonne increase in carbon tax.  The ESRI made it clear that the regressive nature of carbon tax can be offset by recycling revenue and offers the distributional effect of different recycling policies.</p> <p>  In its manifesto for the 2020 election, the Green Party proposed gradually increasing carbon tax in each of the next ten years until it reaches &euro;100 per tonne and introducing a mechanism to return all the revenues raised from further increases to citizens by social welfare payments and tax credits.  That policy platform seems to have been abandoned in this Finance Bill and I wish to raise a number of issues the Minister can address in this regard.  In the note provided by the Department of Finance, the combined proceeds of the 2020 and 2021 increases in carbon tax amount to &euro;238 million.  A total of &euro;48 million was allocated to targeted social protection intervention.  That is 20% of carbon tax revenues.  That is a total departure from the Green Party's manifesto proposals to return the revenue raised to households through social welfare payments, as it has reduced from 100% to 20%.  While these sections provide for multi-annual increases in carbon tax, there is no such commitment for multi-annual increases in social welfare payments to offset the regressive nature of carbon tax on lower income households.  Will the Minister make a commitment that if these sections are agreed, the Government will hard-wire multi-annual increases in social welfare payments in the upcoming social welfare Bill?</p></speech>

While I accept the principle of carbon taxes, I am opposed to this particular carbon structure approach being taken by the Government because I do not believe that a drip-feed model will motivate people to avoid paying tax and change their approach.  This is an approach I debated with the Minister around the Cabinet table.  It is an approach that I presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I know that both the Minister and the committee did not agree with my approach because politicians love gentle taxes that do not cause a political shock or pushback.  They want to introduce tax that brings in additional revenue that can be used in the approach the Minister is talking about.  I fundamentally disagree with that.  Carbon taxes should be there to encourage people to avoid paying the tax in the first place.  If we took an approach where we had significant incremental jumps in carbon tax in 2023, 2027 and 2030, it would give people an opportunity to change in the interim, whether it is to change their car or, if they are upgrading their heating system, to alter that so that it minimises the amount of tax they pay.</p> <p>  Second, I believe that our carbon tax structure should vary with the cost of a barrel of oil because if carbon taxes increase and the price of oil decreases significantly, as we have seen over the past decade, they will not have the motivational impact we all want to see happen.  On the contrary, if we increase the carbon taxes as we are planning to do and the price of oil goes through the roof, so to speak, we will grind our economy to a halt.  We need to have an approach that is flexible.  As the price of oil goes up and down, the carbon tax should go up and down to reflect that and bring about a real change in people's attitude to using fossil fuels in the first place.</p> <p>  Picking up on another point Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell raised, this particular carbon tax structure is regressive because those living in rural communities will pay far more in carbon tax than those living in urban areas.  I have already given the Minister the example in respect of agricultural diesel where farmers do not have an alternative available to them but in addition, people living in our cities who have jobs locally have local transport alternatives available to them that are not available to people in rural areas.  By the time we get to 2030 and we have a carbon tax of &euro;100 per tonne, half of the households in Dublin will be paying less than &euro;9.11 per week in transport costs when the Dublin Bus subsidy is taken into account.  On the other hand, rural commuters will be paying &euro;39.50 a week, up to four times more than those who have a bus passing the door every few minutes.  Those types of taxation structures will not motivate people out of their cars and onto buses in urban areas for &euro;9.11 a week yet, at the other end of the scale, people who are commuting long distances to work in Dublin and so forth who do not have the alternatives available to them will be paying significantly in terms of these carbon taxes.</p> <p>  This particular section, section 26, which deals with home heating oil-----</p></speech>
