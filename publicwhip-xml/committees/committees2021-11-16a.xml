This is important because it interferes with the broadcasting.  In respect of non-microphone seats, members are reminded that if they speak from positions that do not have microphones in the room their contributions cannot be included in the Official Report.  For the purposes of the Official Report, I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are requested to remove their face-coverings when speaking to ensure that their contributions can be recorded adequately before replacing their face-coverings.</p> <p>  I welcome the members and also viewers who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the precincts of Leinster House.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the assigned accommodation to the member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, or another location in Leinster House 2000.  I ask the members to note that members may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the located listed earlier as privilege to their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division in committee, members must be physically in this chamber.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials.</p> <p>  In order to provide for the smooth running of the meeting, I draw the committee's attention to a couple of housekeeping points.  If any member is acting in substitution for a member of the committee, he or she should notify the clerk to the committee now if he or she has not already done so.  Divisions will be taken as they arise and members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that pursuant to the Standing Order, he or she may move his or her amendment but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.  That is in relation to those who are deputising.</p></speech>

It moves the threshold from annual income of &euro;20,687 to &euro;21,295 to ensure that the 2% rate remains the highest rate of USC charged on the income of full-time minimum wage workers.  This has arisen from the 30% increase to the minimum wage that was recommended by the Low Pay Commission.</p> <p> I would have huge concerns that this 30 cent increase will not do much for the people who are relying on this minimum wage when inflation is currently running at approximately 5%.  The Minister has raised on many occasions his concern about the rise in inflation.  This 30 cent increase will only bring it up to &euro;10.50.  Putting it in context, we all will be aware, if we look at our local butchers or our local shop, that there are price increases.  This increase will not be enough to offset the cost of inflation that we are witnessing.  According to conservative estimates, there are 135,000 people on the minimum wage and relying on this.  We need to be mindful of the real-life impact when discussing this.  These are not only figures.  They represent people who are relying on this.  We see the huge rise in inflation and the cost of living in energy prices, etc., and the impact that it will have.  The minimum wage is still far lower than the living wage of &euro;12.90.  We need to be quite ambitious in this regard because people are struggling on a daily basis.</p> <p>  I welcome the move to extend the reduced rate of USC until the end of 2022 for full medical card holders under 70 years of age whose individual annual income does not exceed &euro;60,000 but, although the Finance Bill can be quite technical and although it can seem removed from society, we need to think of the real-life impact that those people who are on the minimum wage experience due to the increase in inflation and the increased cost of living.  I wanted to raise that.  It is important that it is noted in the Finance Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#A01400"><p>We all would like to see a move to a living wage.  I have some sympathy for the Government in this regard in relation to the 30 cent proposed increase.  The convention has been since 2015 that the Low Pay Commission recommendation is accepted by Government.  Far be it for me to speak for the Low Pay Commission, but it may very well be that when the commission was considering its recommendation and the data, because there is an evidence-based approach to the recommendation in terms of the setting of the minimum wage, it may not have had the up-to-date information that we have now on the trends in relation to inflation.  I am sure that is something the Low Pay Commission will return to when appropriate.</p><p>It is fair to say that many, if not all, of us around the table would like to see the national minimum wage be converted to a living wage for all.  The Low Pay Commission can only look at the data that it has at that time.  I imagine that when it was considering its recommendation to the Government about what the hourly minimum wage should be next year, the rate of inflation was nowhere near what it is at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#B00200"><p>As Deputy Nash acknowledged, this is a process whereby the Government receives a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission and acts on it.  A process with an independent group acting on behalf of the State, evaluating information independently of the Government or its view on the matter, is the right process.  It has been a reason this is just one of a series of increases to the minimum wage in recent years.  When we are debating this minimum wage, the context in which it should be seen is not just looking at this as a single move, but as a series of moves that have taken place over recent years, as a response from the State to support those who are earning the least as our economy is growing.  The challenge from a tax policy point of view relates to those who are on a low level of income in the first place.  They tend to pay a lower level of tax.  This is a consequence of having a starting position of a highly progressive tax code.  Any changes that we make at the lower level of income sometimes lead to a change in take-home pay that can be a subject of debate.  Some would say that we are making a change that is only worth a small amount of money to somebody on a low level of income.  That is a consequence of the fact that they are not paying a high level of tax in the first place.  It is a reason why the work of the Low Pay Commission is important.  I have no doubt that, as it continues its independent process into next year and beyond, the kind of trends that are developing in the cost of living will be considered seriously by the Low Pay Commission.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's views, it is important that the committee be aware that changes such as the one I am making to reduce the level of universal social charge that somebody would pay on the minimum wage were not included in Sinn F&eacute;in's proposed budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the overall view that there should be no changes in personal taxation at a time when the cost of living is increasing for many.  I take a different view.  I believe that targeted changes in our tax code that are inside the parameters agreed by the Government as part of our summer economic statement are appropriate to help those who are under pressure and facing challenges because of an increase in the cost of living.  Some on the Opposition benches take a different view.  While I listen to Deputy Farrell's view on the adequacy of this proposal, it is much more adequate than doing nothing at all, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in proposes.  This is a sensible change.  I accept that one could ask the question as to whether it is enough but it has to be seen in the context of changes made in budgets each year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#B00300"><p>We all agree that we want to see an increase in the minimum wage.  Anyone on the minimum wage would want to see that.  We are speaking on the Finance Bill and the everyday impact it will have on people.  It is important to raise the difficulties that people face with the increase in costs and inflation.</p> <p>  What happened to the plan to abolish the USC?  The Minister can correct me if I am mistaken that he is on the record, as is the T&aacute;naiste, saying that he wanted to merge USC with PRSI.  Has that been officially dropped?  Have we missed something?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#B00400"><p>That plan was not included in the programme for Government commitments.  I looked at it in the last Government.  Having considered it in detail, it became apparent to me that there would be considerable complexity in doing this.  Looking at the many challenges that we face with regard to tax revenue and how we pay for public services that we need, this Government believed that a more targeted form of indexation for income tax, in particular, was a better use of the country's resources.  This may well be a matter to be considered by the Commission on Taxation and Welfare as it begins to consider what the future of our tax code will be as we move, I hope, into a future where the pandemic is lessened.  The focus of this programme for Government is targeted indexation for those who need help at a time when the cost of living is increasing.</p></speech>

We believe that the current rule is unfair.  We think this would be a fairer way to deal with the USC.  We are mindful of small business.  We want to protect and grow it.  We believe that if a business has a net profit exceeding &euro;1.5 million per year, it could shoulder a burden more fairly than people who are on a lower income.  When we talk about lower incomes, we are talking on people on a broad range of incomes.  We are looking at people on incomes of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000, or less, and at the ever-increasing basic living costs, including for energy, heat, and fuel.  It is unprecedented.  I have been the holder of a high carbon licence for more than 30 years, in other words, selling petrol and diesel, and I have never seen such a spike in costs for the customer as we have seen over the past 12 months.  We are quickly heading to &euro;2 per litre, which is having a significant knock-on effect on the price of everything, because everything in this country comes by wheels.  Nothing falls out of the sky.  There is a massive knock-on effect on the cost of living, which is why we have to look at how we are taxing people and at the universal social charge.  We have to try to be fair and equitable.</p><p>I thank the Minister for the work that he has done to try to protect small businesses and for the work during the pandemic, when, if not for the concerted effort of the Minister and others, thousands of small businesses would have gone to the wall.</p><p>Who am I talking about?  I am talking about the small shopkeepers, small publicans, the hairdresser, the beauty salon and the small retailers.  They would have been gone, only for the imaginative supports that were in place.  Even though I come along and give out to the Government and to the Minister, I will also thank and compliment people when I believe they are doing their best.  That is why we are putting forward this proposal in good faith.  I hope the amendment will gain and gather support.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#C00200"><p>I would like to speak to our amendment.  Let me say that, in spite of whatever allegations the Minister may throw at others, we are consistent in putting forward alternative proposals to raise revenue to provide for our objective to significantly increase expenditure in housing, health, education, and in other key infrastructures and services.  We do so consistently every year.  We have been consistent in saying that the universal social charge, USC, was an unfair austerity tax imposed on workers.  It was particularly unfair, given that the Government trenchantly resists efforts to impose additional taxes, as it did during the austerity period, but it continues to be largely opposed to redistributing the tax burden in a fair way.  The only discussion that ever seems to take place is a discussion about increasing or maybe occasionally slightly reducing the tax burden on the majority.  Never do we talk about what we think is the elephant in the room.  That is the gross inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in Irish society.  If we were to have a policy objective of trying to redistribute income and wealth to move towards a more equal society, then it could be done.  It could produce much revenue and it could result in a fairer society.  In our view, never has that been more justified than in the context of Covid-19.</p> <p>  Working people really demonstrated how important they are.  It was the retail workers, public sector workers, transport workers, health workers, and many others who kept us going when society was shut down.  They showed how important they are.  They are very often the same workers who are hammered by the universal social charge and who are on much lower incomes.  That contrasts with how net household wealth increased substantially in Irish society, even during the Covid-19 period.  However, most of that wealth and income is concentrated in the top 10% or so of our society.  We think that for all of those reasons it is justified to take radical measures to redistribute the tax burden and, through that, to redistribute wealth and income more generally.  That is the logic of what we are doing.  We are delighted that the Rural Independents Group has now adopted socialist policies in this regard-----</p></speech>

I would like to put this on record, and I said it during the budget.  The total income that comes to PAYE workers, or to the 2.8 million workers who pay tax and USC, is &euro;130 billion.  Their total tax and USC contribution on that &euro;130 billion is &euro;27 billion.  That is from the Department&rsquo;s ready reckoner.  Corporations&rsquo; total income is &euro;203 billion and their total tax contribution is &euro;11 billion.  That is an extraordinary contrast, is it not?  The corporations make &euro;203 billion.  That profit has gone up by approximately 172% in gross declared pre-tax profits since 2012.  Therefore, the corporate sector makes about 70% to 80% more than workers in pre-tax income.  It pays almost three times what 2.8 billion workers pay, who between them earn only &euro;130 billion.  That shows in a stark way that the workers get less and pay much more.  The corporations, whose profits have gone through the roof, earn much more profits and pay much less tax.  That is just unfair in our view and we will continue to highlight this.</p> <p>  This particular amendment intersects with a number of other amendments that seek to address that, whether it is through wealth taxes, or a higher earners&rsquo; social charge to replace the universal social charge, which, for the record, we have always said should be abolished completely.  We are for getting rid of the universal social charge completely and replacing it with higher bands of income tax on the highest earners with a higher income social charge.  I think that is fair and justifiable.  It is, in our view, the elephant in the room that is never really discussed or touched upon.  On that basis, I intend to move my amendment and will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  </p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  I hope that Deputy Michael Healy-Rae does not think of withdrawing the amendment based on the accusation by Deputy Boyd Barrett that he is a socialist.  I do not know how comfortable Deputy Michael Healey-Rae would be with that label.  I understand entirely what Deputy Boyd Barrett and the other sponsors of the amendment are trying to achieve.  The amendment is not particularly precise about what a national solidarity tax would involve.  I am not averse to having a discussion about taxation.  It is a discussion we need to have in this country, if we want to fund the public services we say that we all want to see.  However, I would be careful about how we should proceed, particularly around income at this sensitive time, considering everything that our economy is experiencing at the moment.  Then again, the focus needs to be on wealth.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will know well that the vast bulk of wealth in this country is not in incomes but in assets.  Many of those are non-productive assets that are often passed from generation to generation, often relatively unmolested by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is where the discussion, I think, needs to be, with respect to what the movers of the amendment wish to achieve.  I would guard against any movement in the direction of focusing imprecisely on taxable income at this stage in the game.  Our focus should be entirely on net assets and how we can tax them in a way that will benefit our society more broadly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#C00700"><p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments.  There are a considerable number of issues with this amendment.  These include the cost on the Exchequer, the significant erosion of the tax base, and the impact on the competiveness of our tax code.  On Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the universal social charge, it is estimated that this would cost &euro;4.4 billion in a single year.  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to replace the USC with a high-income social charge of 10% on all earnings &euro;90,000 would yield &euro;1.59 billion in a single year.  Therefore, this would give rise to a shortfall of approximately &euro;2.8 billion for the year.</p><p>In fact, it is estimated it would be necessary to place an additional charge of 28% on all earnings over &euro;90,000 in order raise an equivalent level of revenue for the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to be cost neutral to the Exchequer.</p><p> With regard to the Rural Independent Group&rsquo;s proposal to abolish the USC for those earning less than &euro;70,000 and replace it with a national solidarity tax on incomes of those earning in excess of &euro;120,000 per year, I note the Deputies have not specified the level of income tax rates that would apply under this proposal.  However, it is estimated the removal of the application of the USC on all incomes below &euro;70,000 would cost in the region of &euro;1.7 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely that if the new tax took the form of a new USC rate for those earning over &euro;120,000 it would need to be as high as 14% in order to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure this is a cost neutral proposal.</p><p> I note the estimations I provided do not take account of any behavioural change that could result from the significant increase in marginal rates of taxation.  To introduce any higher rate of USC would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates could cause harm to our international competitiveness.  The considerable progress that has been made in recent years to restore our economy cannot be taken for granted, especially given the challenges in the international arena we confront at present.</p><p> Abolishing the USC in its entirety or exempting those earning up to &euro;70,000 per year would considerably erode the tax base.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is estimated 28% of all income earners will not be liable to USC in 2022.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;70,000 would abolish and exempt about 88% of income earners from USC, or 100% if the USC was abolished in its entirety.  This would significantly narrow the income tax base and would expose our economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn.  The USC is an important and sustainable source of revenue for the Exchequer.</p><p> I note Deputies have also suggested raising money also from companies whose profits are in excess of &euro;1.5 million per year.  This could have serious consequences for the competitiveness of our corporation tax regime with potentially significant impacts for our overall economy.  Some of the main features of the current corporation tax regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base.  Changing this rate or imposing additional levies on corporate profits would involve increased complexity and this could change the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.  It is impossible to accurately predict the effect changes to the rate would have on the behaviour and decisions of large employers in Ireland.  This uncertainty prevents a reliable estimate being made of any yield that might accrue to the Exchequer.  While it is possible imposing such a levy could lead to theoretical gains, it could also potentially lead to lower levels of economic activity and to companies passing the additional tax burden onto their staff, customers, suppliers and investors.  Therefore, having regard to these issues I do not believe there is a need to carry out any further analysis of the proposal outlined here and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I disagree with him.  We should have a report into this to further examine it and study it.  If he looks at this national solidarity tax, it is based on a similar model operating in Norway.  There is a tax like this on large corporations, including oil and gas companies.  I cannot see why we should not further explore the possibility of a tax like this.  Again, I can see it working to the advantage of the person on the lower income but also that of smaller businesses.  Ireland is made up of an awful lot of businesses where there are one, two, three, five or ten employees.  Those businesses are really struggling, as I already outlined, with the extra basic costs on them today.  If it is working in places like Norway and has been proven to work, why not further examine it?  The Minister said it does not merit being further looked at.  I humbly argue with him and ask why not look at it more.  Why not explore it?  If, after doing that, we can in the committee or wherever see there are compelling reasons we are wrong then that is fine and the Government can beat us on that.</p> <p>  In life you must look at every aspect of a problem before you come up with a sound and solid solution.  We have a problem at the moment that many people are struggling and we are just trying to look out for them.  We are just trying to ensure those people will survive.  I have been talking for the last long while about mam's purse.  Mam's purse is under attack and it is not in order.  When that purse is not in order at the weekend then we are in trouble.  Whether you are the Minister for Finance or whoever you are, mam's purse has to be right and it is not right at present and is not going to be right for a long time.  Anything we can do to address that or rectify it or help in that situation should, I politely suggest to the Minister, be further explored.</p></speech>

It remains, despite the fact the financial emergency has now passed.  We have moved from a situation of virtual economic collapse to one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe and one in which, I repeat, profits have gone through the roof even in the context of a pandemic.  We need to seriously look at the fairness and justice in that situation, something that was highlighted even more during the pandemic.  Even the Government, as well as members of the Opposition, had to laud the contribution of workers who are often very on very low pay, relative to some of the very high earners in our country.  In many ways they were disproportionately affected by the impact of the pandemic, either through the extraordinary work they had to do during it or through the fact they lost income because their sectors were shut down.  Again, we know high earners were the least affected.  They did okay.  The profits of the corporations continue to rise.  The Central Bank's quarterly figures, which I always find very useful, show net household wealth continued to go through the roof during that period.  Mom and pop, to use Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's example, did not see an increase in what was in their purse.  Yet the figures do not lie; there was a massive increase in household net wealth during that period.  Who then was getting it?</p></speech>

It tells you these things.  The Central Bank quarterly report actually said there was a very significant rise in financial assets as well.  This is because the rich can make money from money.  They do this and did so during the pandemic.  That is what happens when you have a certain amount of wealth.  You make money just by virtue of having money.  We are not talking about people's principal private residence in terms of making money.  Yes, the value of that may increase-----</p></speech>

That is what we propose to increase.  We are not talking about hitting the family home.</p><p>We are talking about hitting the additional wealth people have beyond that.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Nash is saying, but I am a bit surprised by it.  Let us put it this way; the contribution of workers through tax and USC went through the roof, relatively speaking, after 2007.  If I remember correctly, workers were paying approximately &euro;13 billion in tax, pre-crash.  It is now up to &euro;27 billion.  The big jump happened as a result of the USC, which has never been rolled back.  We have, in effect, turned an emergency tax into a permanent tax.  Every worker in this country will tell one how angry he or she is to see the little brackets around USC printed on their pay packet and the big lump of money taken out by it.  I do not believe there is ever justification for the USC but, to my mind, there is no justification now given the fact we are out of the emergency used to justify it and workers are, proportionately speaking, making a much larger tax contribution than corporations or people at the very top who are so wealthy they can make money just from having money.  That money continues to grow.</p><p> The Minister is correct in his point about our high income social charge only replacing some of the universal social charge but, as I said in my introduction, the proposal we are making intersects with a number of other proposals we will come to in other amendments that will make up the difference.  We are proposing, for example, new bands of income tax for those earning more than &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000, &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000, which would raise approximately &euro;3.8 billion.  We would not only get the money the abolition of the universal social charge would lose us, but more when it is combined with the higher income social charge.  It would probably get to the sort of figures the Minister mentioned when he asked what could be done to make it cost neutral.  The sort of thing one would have to do is significantly increase the income tax contribution of those earning in excess of &euro;100,000, &euro;150,000 and so on.  </p><p> By the way, it is again worth saying, and this is a point the Labour Party and others on the left should appreciate, that 20 or 30 years ago it was commonplace to have that level of taxation on higher incomes in the top couple of deciles.  There were Labour Party leaders who talked about things such as taxing the rich until the pips squeaked.  That was commonplace on the left, but it seems we have rowed back from it.  The left should not row back from that, as is clear when one looks at people like Thomas Piketty who has studied these things.  I know the Minister, fair play to him, has read Piketty so he knows how the accumulation and concentration of incomes and wealth have occurred since the onset of neoliberal economic orthodoxies.  To my mind, it is just old-fashioned left-wing politics but it is justified now more than even when one sees the high concentrations of wealth, income and profits at the top compared with the burden working people are suffering from.</p><p> When one thinks about our inability to retain and recruit workers across a number of key areas, whether it is in the health service, construction, education and all sorts of sectors, and talks to young people, they will say they are leaving in droves, and are considering leaving, because it is not worth their while living here.  Their after-tax income just cannot allow them to live a decent life here whereas, if they go to Australia, Canada or elsewhere, they can.  The income they will get in those countries will allow them to live a decent-quality life.  We have to address that.  Perhaps Deputy Nash, the Minister or others do not agree with my particular prescription but we need to start to look at this.  That is the point about these amendments.  We need to start to take seriously what is a legitimate and valid argument about wealth redistribution.  I do not think we do that.  We tend to operate on a budget-to-budget basis, tweaking this and reacting to this, that and the other thing, but we are not looking at a more strategic debate about how we redistribute wealth and income on a basis that will allow us to have a sustainable and equitable economy in the future.  I will not delay the meeting any further.</p></speech>

The discussion will continue because it is a necessary debate to have.  We want to achieve the same things as Deputy Boyd Barrett, but we want to start from a different departure point.  That would be fair to say.  I never like to describe tax as a burden.  That is the language of the right, if I can use that term.  Tax is not a burden.  It is required to contribute to the kind of public services we aspire to have in this country.  That is what the universal social charge system does.  It is the most progressive form of taxation ever introduced in this country and the vast bulk of lower-paid workers do not pay any USC whatsoever.  They also pay very low levels of PRSI and personal tax.</p> <p>  I appeal to Deputy Boyd Barrett not to get into the argument about tax cuts and how that can contribute to rising incomes.  We contribute to rising incomes by, for example, empowering our collective bargaining system to ensure workers get a greater share of the pie in terms of their productivity.  We know, and the Deputy knows, that has been falling considerably year-on-year since the 1970s because of the kind of economic system that has been prevalent across the world.  The USC is, by definition, a very progressive tax system and we ought to be very careful about how we approach any adjustments we make to it.</p> <p>  The best way of ensuring that working people have a decent standard of living is by providing universal basic public services to a very high standard.  We know that in this country general levels of Government expenditure on public investment, pre-pandemic, were low and need to improve.  We do that by ensuring we have a tax base that can efficiently and productively resource those services.  Let us not get into the business of narrowing our tax base now.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett is making the case for tax reductions that would make the most hardened neoliberal wince.  He is arguing not just for the reduction of a tax but for its complete abolition below a certain level.  They tend to be the kind of arguments I hear from the other end of the political spectrum than the one the Deputy associates himself with.  I say this to him with respect, but also with as much sincerity as he offers in making his views known to me.</p> <p>  I believe that it is important we ask those who can afford to make a contribution to the cost of public services in our country to do so.  While I accept and understand, to use Deputy Healy-Rae's analogy, that the purse and wallet of many are under real pressure at the moment, we should reacquaint ourselves with the way in which the USC is structured and designed, which is to ask those who earn more to pay more.  The figures speak for themselves.  Somebody in the PAYE sector earning between &euro;12,012 and &euro;21,295 pays 2%.  Someone earning more than &euro;100,000 per year, or &euro;70,044 per year, in the PAYE sector pays four times that or 8%. </p> <p>  This is a progressive tax.  When I make the case for its progressivity, I acknowledge and appreciate that for many it is an additional challenge, and additional payment they have to make, at a time when we are seeing the cost of living go up for many in Ireland and elsewhere.</p><p>However, to respond to that by putting in place a fundamental reduction and change in USC as the Deputy is proposing is not something that I believe should be referenced in the Finance Bill.  I appreciate the constructiveness with which Deputy Healy-Rae has put his argument forward, but if we put into a Finance Bill a report to the effect that we will look at doing something, the rest of the world will look at that and assume it will happen.  That is not a signal that we should be sending at the moment.  One of the reasons I believe that is because of another issue that we will begin to debate as the afternoon goes on, namely, the change in corporate tax policy.</p><p> To deal with the point that Deputy Boyd Barrett made regarding trying to find ways in which large companies should pay more, look at what is happening at the moment, namely, a large and historic OECD agreement on this matter into which Ireland has taken an important decision to enter and to make the case for.  Is the Deputy arguing that we should be doing more than that?</p></speech>

However, many of the companies that the Deputy is arguing should pay an even higher level of tax on top of the major change that Ireland has already committed to making employ as workers the people that the Deputy referred to and correctly acknowledged.  I want those workers in Ireland.  I want that investment in Ireland.  To move forward with a further increase in the taxation of any company on top of what we are doing in entering an OECD agreement would be a danger to the jobs and investment in our country.</p> <p>  Regarding the figures that Deputy Boyd Barrett cited in making his case to me, he made the point that gross profits amounted to &euro;203.8 billion.  However, the same table concludes that the taxable income of the companies is &euro;106.4 billion.  Given that this is a debate that the Deputy and I have had for years, I know the next line in his argument is that he will describe as mostly tax avoidance the change between &euro;203.8 billion and &euro;106.4 billion.  I would say that it was due to the use of allowances that form a normal part of corporate tax codes all over the world.  If we begin with a starting point of &euro;104.6 billion, then a payment of &euro;10.9 billion in tax over that taxable income is an effective tax rate of 10.2%.  While it is lower than our current 12.5%, it is still closer enough to it than using the larger profit base of &euro;203.8 billion.</p> <p>  To indicate at this time that Ireland was going to do more than the OECD agreement in terms of how we tax larger companies would be dangerous for our economy.  As I understand it, Deputy Boyd Barrett would not just extend Deputy Healy-Rae's tax proposal to larger companies.  Rather, he would extend it to any company that paid corporate tax, which includes a whole range of Irish SMEs that employ workers he is representing and for whom he is making a case.  That would be a danger to our economy.</p> <p>  Regarding the point that Deputy Healy-Rae advocated, there are many SMEs that have profits of more than &euro;1.5 million per year.  The relief that they gained when they found out that they would not be paying 15% would quickly dissipate if they discovered that they were going to be paying a higher rate of tax, the nature of which has not yet been made clear by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We do not believe in taxing the family home because it is not the same as wealth that is additional to that, for example, multiple properties, large landholdings, large holdings of shares, large amounts of cash in the bank, etc.  Those are two different types of wealth, particularly in a country where 70% of people own their own homes.  I suspect that is where our approach to these matters differs from the Labour Party's, but we stand over it and do not believe that people should be punished for managing to own a family home, particularly where the State has failed so badly in the provision of social housing and the fear of homelessness or paying extortionate rents often drives people towards trying to purchase their own homes.  They work hard and struggle to achieve that only to get landed with regressive further taxes on something that they have already paid for using income on which they have already paid a great deal of tax.  That is our view.</p> <p>  It is with this in mind that our proposal on a wealth tax comes about.  At the end of the first quarter of 2021, net household wealth - that is after debts, liabilities and so on - was &euro;883 billion, an increase of &euro;89 billion in just one year.  That was an extraordinary increase over 2020, which was the year of the pandemic.  Tying into Deputy Nash's point, the &euro;883 billion includes &euro;400 billion in financial assets.  That is a lot of financial assets.  I do not have the exact figures in front of me, but the bottom 50% have only 1.4% of all the wealth whereas the top 10% have 53% of the wealth.</p><p>It is self-evident when we are talking about that amount of wealth, 53%, which is &euro;440 billion, in the hands of about 140,000 people.  Our proposal, just so we are not accused of taxing the family home, is to strip out &euro;1 million for those 140,000 people but we are still left with hundreds of billions of euro concentrated in the hands of that group.  We are proposing a very modest 2% tax on the value of that wealth and assets.  Frankly, they would not feel it but it would generate a lot of revenue.</p><p> Wealth taxes are commonplace in many other jurisdictions.  They were more commonplace 20 or 30 years ago and I think it is regressive that countries have moved away from wealth taxes, although some countries still have them and some have actually introduced them in the context of Covid as a sort of solidarity effort to try to redistribute some of the wealth and income.  It is a reasonable thing to do.  Our proposal goes slightly further than other proposals for wealth taxes that groups like the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, have proposed over the years.  Why would we not at least discuss the possibility of a wealth tax when it is done elsewhere?  We can discuss the fairness of it and have a national debate about that inequality in the distribution of wealth and to what extent it could contribute a lot more money to the revenue for the public services that we all agree we need.  I do not see why we would not want to have that debate.  I do not apologise for pressing to have that debate every single year because, eventually, we will have that debate, in my opinion.</p></speech>

We have long been arguing that those people who earn more should be paying more and we have been quite clear on that, budget after budget.  We would probably look to have something a bit broader than this but the fact we would have a discussion and that this report would start the conversation in regard to introducing a progressive wealth tax is important and welcome.</p> <p>  What we have seen, and what was clearly outlined in the debate on the previous two amendments, is that people have really been suffering.  Just yesterday, I was knocking on doors in an estate beside my own estate, and one thing that came back clearly from people is that they are seeing their costs rise and rise.  Many people are struggling because they have not seen their income rise in any way, shape or form.  However, there are those who have done better out of the pandemic and who, if asked, would be more than willing to pay more to help because they know there needs to be that element of solidarity.</p> <p>  While we would probably look at a broader, more comprehensive report in this regard, it is welcome and, in fact, crucial that we start this conversation in regard to a wealth tax and in regard to those who earn more being able to pay more.  This would be very welcome and I will support the amendment.</p></speech>

I disagree on the need for a wealth tax.  The reason I disagree with it is that, first, we already have a set of wealth taxes in our country - capital acquisitions tax, CAT, capital gains tax, CGT, and DIRT, and one could argue that the local property tax, LPT, is also a form of wealth of tax.  We already have four taxes that perform many of the functions that tend to be associated with the operation of wealth taxes.  In fact, CGT and CAT are set at a rate of 33%, and many of the different analyses that have been done in comparing those taxes with their equivalent taxes in peer countries suggest Ireland has among the highest capital taxes compared with similar countries.  The reason I do not believe there is a need for a further tax on wealth in Ireland is that we have four different taxes that, in their differing ways, perform that role.</p> <p>  For those who would still advocate the case for tax beyond that, it begs the question regarding how it would be implemented.  My understanding is that the other European country that recently looked at the role of a wealth tax is France, and France abandoned the use of that tax because of all of the difficulties it had in its implementation.</p> <p>  I cannot help but be struck by the contradiction that those who make the case for a wealth tax also oppose the existence of the local property tax and call for its abolition, which means that those who live in mansions would gain the most from the implementation of their policies.  It is the most regressive tax cut advocated by anybody in the Oireachtas.  To argue, on the one hand, that we need a further wealth tax while arguing also for the abolition of the LPT is inconsistency at best.  In addition to the LPT, as I said, we already have CGT, CAT and DIRT, all of which, in effect, play a role in taxing what approximates wealth at a rate that is very high, 33%.</p> <p>  That being said, of course, I utterly respect the fact that other colleagues in this committee take a very different view from me on that matter.  I respect why they are making a case for it but I do not believe the place in which we should indicate the role of that debate is in the Finance Bill.  For that reason, I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

It is just not accurate.  We are very clear in what our proposal is, namely, this wealth tax will target the wealthiest 5%.  By the way, we do not do year-on-year studies of this distribution but they were done by groups like TASC and, at one point, the CSO, which does not seem to do this on a regular basis, as it should.  They both came up with figures that the top 10% had 53% of the wealth and the top 5% had about 37% of the wealth.  We are proposing to design a wealth tax, or at least have a requirement arising out of this Bill that the Government would look into a serious study on how it could design a tax which would be directed at that group of people, excluding the family home.</p> <p>  Is it impractical to do it, as the Minister suggests?  Is it very difficult?  We could answer those questions if we seriously looked at the matter but we do not want to look at the matter.  What I do know is that the Central Bank has managed to produce figures on it, so somebody has some information about where the wealth is.  Somebody has that because every single quarter the Central Bank produces its quarterly report and is able to tell us how much household wealth there is and how many liabilities there are.  Also, at various times, although not constantly enough, in my opinion, we have had the CSO and groups like TASC do actual studies of the distribution of that wealth.</p> <p>  By the way, their findings are largely in line with other global studies in the western world.  There is a bit of difference here and there but, largely, that inequality in the distribution of wealth is fairly consistent around the western world.  Piketty did a study of it, as the Minister knows very well because he has read the book.</p><p>He knows that it is a very definite pattern of concentration of wealth that has accelerated over the past 20 to 30 years and we think that we should seriously look at it and study it.  Then we can answer the question as to whether it would be too difficult to do it.  I do not believe that.  The argument is always made that it is too difficult to tax the rich but it is really easy to tax the workers and that is what we do.  That is unfair and we should at least try to get the facts on it so that we can have an informed debate.  It is simply inaccurate for the Minister to say that what we are proposing is regressive.  The local property tax raises just over &euro;500 million per year.  What we are proposing would raise a hell of a lot more than that, multiples of it, from the people at the top.  They might benefit by a small amount from the abolition of the property tax but what is the highest amount that multimillionaires in mansions pay in property tax?  What is the highest amount being paid?  It is around &euro;1,000 per year.  They might benefit by that amount but under our proposals, they will pay a hell of a lot more on the other side with a wealth tax, although it is still very affordable from their point of view.  They would also, as per an amendment we will be discussing soon, pay an additional property tax on properties other than their principal private residence.  Just for factual accuracy, we are not proposing something that is regressive.</p></speech>

The IMF has said that post-pandemic, we should look at a solidarity tax.  In terms of where the conversation is at for a lot of people, it is a missed opportunity not to prepare this kind of report looking at the possibility of a wealth tax.  In 2016 the ESRI prepared a report entitled Scenarios and Distributional Implications of a Household Wealth Tax in Ireland.  That was five years ago so why not consider an updated report now?  The Minister said that it might be difficult to do but it would be up to the authors of the report to look at that.  The report could tell us whether it is unworkable.  In reality, we have better data collection and automatic exchange of information now, including registries of beneficial ownership and so on.  If we look at all of that, surely we have better access to data now than we ever did.  This would be something for the report to look at but the conversation is out there now; it is being argued that we need a wealth tax or a solidarity tax.  The Minister said that amendments calling for reports could be interpreted by the outside world as being a policy change rather than just a report but that should not stop us from undertaking these kinds of reports.  Of course, I would like to see a wealth tax implemented but I do not think that should stop us from doing these kinds of reports.  It is absolutely imperative that we do so and there is an onus on us, as members of this committee, to commission a report to see if such a tax is workable.  The Minister might disagree with us and argue that it is not workable but let us commission a report on it and take a look at that question.  It is a missed opportunity not to have such a report.</p></speech>

It is important to be clear that we live in a country in which the top 1% of taxpayers pay just under one quarter of all of the income tax and USC collected.  That is a progressive tax code in operation.  That is a tax code under which the more income one has, the more tax one pays.  In making his point, Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced a report by the Central Bank.  It is one thing to produce the figures but it is an entirely different matter to look at how a tax can be effectively implemented.  Even with that point in mind, let us look at what the constituents of that wealth could be that are captured in the report to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  If that wealth is captured in the value of a home, the individual pays the local property tax.  If it is captured in the value of savings and those savings earn interest, the individual pays DIRT tax.  If it is captured in a financial instrument of some kind, when that financial instrument is sold or is the subject of a transaction, the individual pays tax at that point.  If it is wealth that is inherited from one generation to another, the individual pays tax at that point as well.</p> <p>  One of the reasons I oppose the policy that is being put forward, as I said in my opening statement, is that in effect we have taxes in place already that perform some of the role of the tax being proposed by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  If there is a need for a report and further analysis of the matter, I am sure it is something the Parliamentary Budget Office could look at on behalf of this committee.  This committee has the resources that it needs and it makes good use of same and I am sure it could look at commissioning a report in this area.  Given that Ireland has just made a decision to enter into an OECD agreement that commits us to a minimum effective tax rate, I am not going to include signals in our Finance Bill that indicate that very big changes are coming on the taxation of people and their income which would undermine the competitiveness of our country and undermine our ability to attract and keep wealth and jobs in Ireland.  </p></speech>

He is suggesting that the wealthy will fly out of the country if we tax them a bit more but that is an old argument that has been around forever.  It is a justification for never trying to address the inequality in wealth and income.  It is worth saying that the Government was put under pressure to raise the corporate tax rate to 15%.  It has now done that and the world has not fallen apart.  The spokespeople for some of the big multinationals that the Minister is worried might be frightened by all of this have often said that the tax regime here is not the main reason they are here and we should actually listen to that.  They are here because we are part of the European market, we have an educated workforce, a certain level of political stability and so on.  I do not agree with the idea that they are going to run away from the amount of profits they are making in this country, unless we do something very radical indeed.</p></speech>

While I never really expected that the Minister would take on board the wealth tax or our more far-reaching proposals on corporate tax, this is one that should be considered.  This amendment seeks to have a report prepared, and ultimately implemented, on getting rid of the tax on the family home and replacing it with a tax on multiple properties.</p><p>This amendment makes a distinction, which the Government wilfully refuses to make when we discuss wealth because it wants to collapse the distinction between those who own family homes and people who own two, three, four, five, ten, 15, 20, 30, 50 or 100 properties.  There is a world of difference between those two types of property owners.  The family home, by and large, is not an asset to generate wealth for the people who live in it.  It is a roof to put over their heads when access to housing is a concern for people, particularly when we are in the teeth of a housing crisis, although it always has been a concern for people.  There is a distinction between that and people who rent out properties and profit from doing so.  This amendment proposes a property tax that excludes the family home but imposes a &euro;1,000 tax on a second home, &euro;1,500 per home if one has three to ten homes and &euro;2,500 per home if one has ten or more.</p><p> When we consider the enormous rents being charged and the inflation in property values, to which Deputy Nash referred, which is part of the rise in household wealth - although it is also financial, something to which I pointed - that concentration of wealth where it has grown exponentially constitutes serious wealth for people who have two, five, ten, 15 or 20 homes.  Those people are making money by virtue of the fact that they own many properties.  We are proposing a very modest measure to remove the regressive burden on people who may have low incomes and are paying property tax on the value of their principal private residences and to replace it with a tax on second or further homes on an escalating basis depending on how much property one owns.  According to our costing of this proposal based on the ready reckoner the Department provides, if implemented, it would raise the money to cover the loss in revenue on foot of the removal of the current property tax levied on family homes.</p></speech>

The only issue I have with it is that it does not deal with the issue of sweetheart deals for funds.  The number of vacant homes is a major issue.  There is a large number of vacant homes in my city of Galway.  It is a massive issue in many of our town and cities  We need to do everything we can to address it.  We have the tenth highest number of vacant homes in the world.  We are supportive of this amendment.  We have long been calling for the introduction of this type of a tax on multiple homes.

Since its introduction, the charging structure for the local property tax has included a higher rate for properties valued above &euro;1 million, the revised system continues to apply a higher rate above &euro;1.05 million, and a third rate to properties valued above &euro;1.75 million.  This approach increases the progressivity of the tax by increasing the effective rate on the highest value homes.  This is a tax that has yielded &euro;3.6 billion since its introduction in 2013.</p> <p>  Revenue publishes statistics relating to local property tax on a regular basis.  I note the annual statistics report includes information in respect of ownership of multiple properties.  For instance, in 2020 this report indicated there were around 177,000 property owners with two or more properties covering 559,000 properties.  </p> <p>  Using these published Revenue figures and applying the rates of tax in the amendment, the estimated yield would be approximately &euro;700 million from the measures proposed here.  This compares to the estimated local property tax yield in 2022 of approximately &euro;530 million.</p></speech>

This would aggravate an already difficult housing situation, especially in large urban centres.  As the committee will be aware, we have seen recent market commentary from Daft.iethat rents have risen by an average of 2.6% in the third quarter of 2021 nationwide, and that across the country as a whole, market rents are now nearly 7% higher than a year ago.</p><p>The local property tax is an effective and important stable and sustainable source of revenue for the local government sector.

He is effectively admitting that his rent control measures will be completely ineffective.  I happen to agree with him.  The Government is trumpeting that it will limit rent increases to 2% or the rate of inflation, depending on which is lower.  If the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard were to be effective, which I do not believe they will be, that would not be an issue.  In the world that we would want to construct around the rental sector, we would introduce rental controls where that could not happen.  Therefore, landlords would not be able to pass on the cost.  We would reset rents at affordable levels through a rent authority that would set rents at an affordable level.  That particular criticism does not concern us.  We think the Minister can and should control rents given the extortionate cost of rents and the contribution they are making to the current housing crisis.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for giving the full costing in respect of our proposal.  It demonstrates that implementing our proposal could raise approximately &euro;150 million more than the yield from current local property tax.</p><p>People need to know that we could remove the property tax on the family home and replace it with a tax on those who own multiple properties and by so doing we could generate more revenue and have a fairer situation as a result.  That is preferable.</p><p> People should know about the number of people who own multiple properties.  Some 125,000 people in this country have two properties, 50,000 people have three to ten properties, and 3,000 people have more than ten properties.  That is real wealth.  The person who owns a second property is not necessarily stunningly wealthy but it is wealth beyond the principal private residence.  One would not end up paying a lot more under our proposal because one would not be paying tax on the principal residence.  One would pay &euro;1,000 in tax on that second property but that is not punitive.  It is fairer.  If one had between three and ten properties one would pay &euro;1,500 on each property and if one had more than ten properties one would pay &euro;2,500 on each property.  If one has more than ten properties one is seriously property rich and generating a lot of revenue from that property.  It is a modest proposal but it would raise more than the Minister is able to raise with a tax that I and many others believe is unfair.  That is the logic but I know the Minister does not agree.</p></speech>

We are continually advised that it is better to have more taxpayers and tax units all making a contribution.  Yet again, what Deputies Boyd Barrett and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell are proposing is a narrowing of our tax base.  In the circumstances in which this tax is being proposed, three things could happen.  First, the property owner could pay the higher rate of tax on the non-family home the Deputy refers to.  Second, the property owner could pass as much of that as possible on to his or her tenants until he or she hits the cap in rent increases that the Government has in place.  Third, he or she could decide that owning multiple properties is not worth the additional cost and end up exiting the private rental sector.  I do not want that second or third scenario to happen.</p> <p>  We have a huge challenge in our rental market and many people are advocating policies that would end up reducing the supply of rental properties.  I do not want to put measures in place that would add to the number of landlords who decide they do not want to provide rental accommodation anymore, thereby making things even worse for tenants.  Leaving those arguments aside for a moment, I would make the point that this is exactly the same as what the Deputy has proposed in looking to get rid of a large chunk of the universal social charge.  It would narrow the tax base, which is exactly the kind of thing we were all warned against doing in the aftermath of the crisis a decade ago.  That is what the Deputies' measures would do.</p></speech>

This particular instance was brought to my attention by the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association and I belatedly forwarded the Minister some correspondence on this to give him some context on Revenue's approach to these issues.  Bogus self-employment is alive and well in a number of economic sectors but it is particularly prevalent, according to the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, in aviation.  It estimates that up to 5,000 pilots registered under corporate entities here over the last decade or so have been engaged or are still engaged through what are known as intermediary structures.  The Minister will know what intermediary structures are.</p> <p>  The fact of the matter is that a significant number of pilots operating in the Irish market are given a Hobson's choice by the airline that engages them.  One can work with an airline as a pilot but pilots and those in personal services companies have to create company structures to allow them to work for particular airlines.  One must set up a structure to hire oneself to a firm and the firm then has an arm's length relationship with that person.  The pilots themselves would portray all the characteristics of direct employees.  They look after their own tax affairs, including PRSI and so on, even though the airline itself is, for all intents and purposes, the employer.  As I said at the outset, this practice is prevalent in Ireland.  This is one of few countries in the European Union, and maybe the only one, that operates these kinds of structures and where the tax authority does not have the capacity to look through these kinds of arrangements.</p> <p>  The almost exclusive purpose of these company structures is to misrepresent or misclassify the employment status of the pilot or the individual employer, regardless of what the sector might be.  However, Revenue says that it has no power to look through these personal services company structures as they are generally described.  This has a significant impact.  The 2018 report from Revenue and the Department of Social Protection shows that these arrangements have a significant impact on reductions in PRSI, in revenue to the Social Insurance Fund and in revenue to the Exchequer more generally through taxes.  It is quite extraordinary that the Revenue Commissioners says it does not have any function in looking through these companies.</p> <p>  When one looks under the bonnet of these relationships one sees that they are designed to misrepresent the classification of the employee.  They also deny revenue to the State because of these complicated structures and the masking of the actual and real relationship between the employer and the employee.  These arrangements are matters of form and not substance and it is high time that the Revenue Commissioners had a clear function in determining that relationship and had the power in law to carry out investigations of these kinds of structures.  As the Minister will know, it is a matter for the scope section of the Department of Social Protection to determine employment status.</p><p>When so much tax revenue is at stake because of these structures one would imagine that the Revenue Commissioners would have a role in investigating these structures and determining whether they are lawful or not.  It is up to us as a Parliament to define whether these arrangements are lawful or not.  I proposed this particular amendment to give powers to Revenue to investigate these types of structures.</p></speech>

I am not sure how comfortable I am about moving in on the big screen, but we are where we are.</p> <p>  I welcome this amendment.  I commend Deputy Nash on bringing forward this amendment on bogus self-employment, which we know is occurring in many areas.  As highlighted by Deputy Nash, it is happening in the aviation sector, the construction sector, the food delivery sector in terms of the Deliveroo service, the taxi sector and so on.  It was reported to the Committee of Public Accounts recently that up to &euro;1 billion is being lost annually owing to bogus self-employment.  Research by ICTU indicated that the loss could be approximately &euro;600 million.  This is a huge amount of money in the context of the discussions we have had on earlier amendments.  That this amount of money is being lost to the Exchequer is a massive issue.  It is high time we got serious about tackling it.</p> <p>  On a related point, we hear often about the pensions timebomb and people being asked or forced to work for longer or until they are older.  If we are losing out on up to &euro;1 billion or, as stated by ICTU, &euro;600 million, we need to tackle this matter.  In my view, addressing bogus self-employment is crucial for fairness for people.  In discussing the pensions timebomb we should be focused on the bogus self-employment issue in terms of bringing in additional finances to deal with demographic changes and so on.</p></speech>

The question of employment for self-employment status arises in three different areas, that is, tax where it is determined by Revenue, social welfare where it is determined by the Department of Social Protection and employment rights where the Workplace Relations Commission makes the determination.  </p><p>It must be borne in mind that a worker&rsquo;s employment status is not a matter of choice; it depends on the terms and conditions of the job.  While it is usually clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed, it is not always obvious.  However, case law has established tests to determine whether contracts are contracts for service, that is, self-employed contractors or contracts of service, that is, an employee.  These tests need to be applied on a case-by-case basis to the facts of each case.  In July of this year, the three organisations I mentioned earlier, that is, Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the Workplace Relations Commission, published a code of practice which now includes legal tests used to determine employment status.  The code states:</p> <blockquote> 	While the terms of a contract might be quite clear in saying that a person is engaged as a self-employed contractor, courts and statutory bodies may still conclude that they are, in fact, an employee.  Inspectors and adjudicators will consider any formal contracts, but they will also consider how the work is actually carried out and will assess the relationship between the worker providing the service and the business paying for that service.  They will consider whether the worker, or indeed the employer, had no option but to sign up to the terms dictated by the other party.  The true agreement will often only be understood by analysing in the round all the circumstances and facts of the case. </blockquote> <p>The code of practice highlights that there is no single, clear legal definition of &quot;employment&quot; or &quot;self-employment&quot; under EU or Irish law and also emphasises that &quot;the reality behind the contract&quot; is what determines employment status.  It is my understanding that it is that idea of the reality behind the contract that Deputy Nash is referencing where he refers to &quot;a look through&quot;.  The code aims to be of benefit to employers, employees, independent contractors and legal, financial and HR professionals.  It is also aimed at investigators, decision-makers and adjudicators in the Department of Social Protection, the Workplace Relations Commission, Revenue, their respective appeals bodies and the courts. </p><p>It is important to ensure that workers are correctly classified in a way that matches the reality of the relationship between the worker and the business.  The choice of business model should not serve to exclude any worker from his or her proper entitlements.  The misclassification of a worker as being self-employed when the terms and conditions mean that in reality he or she is an employee is a matter of concern.  Misclassification reduces contributions to the Social Insurance Fund and excludes workers from their rights and protections.  </p><p>I believe, therefore, that the newly developed code of practice achieves what this proposed amendment apparently seeks and I do not consider the amendment necessary for that reason.  In addition, the code is described as a &quot;living document&quot;, which will continue to be updated to reflect future, relevant changes in the labour market, relevant legislation and case law.  This is a better way to ensure that the appropriate tests are applied rather than codifying them in legislation which will inevitably need updating over time and may be more unwieldy to change.</p></speech>

I understand why he might not accept the amendment.  The new code of practice is at an early stage in terms of its operation.  There is no doubt about that.  Some of the changes made represent an improvement on the previous code of practice that showed over the past few years that it was no longer worth the paper it was written on.  That is based on the direct experience of workers and trade unions who were using it.</p> <p>  The Minister and I will have a difference of opinion on this but we need to move beyond reliance on codes of practice in this space.  In recent years, bogus self-employment, especially in cities, has become a feature of the labour market in this country.  We will end up regretting that in the coming years.  My view, generally speaking, is that employment status should become a matter of law, as is the case in some of the countries against which we like to compare ourselves.  We have a journey to travel in this country in that regard.  The Minister and I have a difference of opinion as to how all of this should be determined, but I thank him for his response.</p></speech>

We need to realise that the issue of bogus self-employment has a knock-on effect in terms of bid-rigging.  We know that there are concerns in regard to bid-rigging.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been requested to get involved.  Bid-rigging is a process whereby bidders for public work contracts co-ordinate bids to keep them at artificially high prices.  Bogus self-employment ties into this over-inflated cost for public works in that the larger contractors that engage in bid-rigging are able to submit lower tender bids because they save around 30% in labour costs through the avoidance of PRSI.</p><p>It has a knock-on effect on public works being carried out.  I understand that Dublin City Council also expressed concern about the high prices it was having to pay for homes in Dublin city, which could also be attributed to this so it might have a knock-on effect on that too.  It is important to make the point on the impact that it has on public works as well. </p></speech>

First, the document and code of practice agreed by the three different Government bodies does provide a comprehensive response to the issue that has been raised.  Second, I note in the letter that was shared with me as part of the correspondence in anticipation of this debate that the Revenue Commissioners have referred to the Revenue compliance interventions that are always open to them as they look at being satisfied that tax law is being implemented as they and the Oireachtas intend.  Third, Revenue has a dedicated division that now looks at the shadow economy and includes within that issues with relation to the classification of employment contracts.  The Department of Social Protection also now has a dedicated unit which looks at the misclassification of employment contracts.  In Revenue's letter on this matter, it concludes by noting the power available to it to initiate compliance interventions, and we know what that means.  It has acknowledged that in the context of aviation, for example, which is what prompted Deputy Nash to raise this important matter, that independent pilot contractor companies are included in Revenue's risk-based selection approach for compliance interventions.</p> <p>  I acknowledge it is an important matter but I hope that the initiative taken between the three State bodies and the work Revenue has indicated here will provide a strong response back to this important issue.</p></speech>

A partner may lose a partner with whom they have cohabited for considerable years and there can be implications for social welfare entitlements including widows' or widowers' pension entitlements.  This has been raised by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Kelly, particularly in the context of social welfare entitlements but there are also tax implications.  We all know well that the family takes many forms in modern Ireland and I believe it is time to give some legal recognition to all the different forms of diverse family relationships that we have, tricky as that may be.</p> <p>  The amendment calls for a report on the treatment of cohabitants under the taxes Acts, with all of those complexities.  It may be a mammoth task but it may be something that the Commission on Taxation and Welfare could usefully consider, notwithstanding the large body of work it has to examine over the next year or so.  I would ask the Minister and the committee to consider the amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed.  </p></speech>

I do not know if it is just me or if Deputy Nash's microphone.</p> <p>  This is an interesting amendment and I commend Deputy Nash on bringing it forward.  As the Deputy said, the structure of partnerships, families and so on has changed and it would be remiss of us not to mention the many people who have been trying to get married for the past two years but who have been unable to do so because of the pandemic.  The structure of families has changed and many people choose not to marry and they cohabit with their partner for long periods.</p> <p>  I will also mention a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, which was ruled out of order, on the incapacitated child, as it is quite important.  For parents of an incapacitated child, there is a statistical likelihood that the child will not have any or much income from employment over the course of his or her life.  It is likely that such children will depend on the means-tested disability allowance for their whole life and exclusive dependence on that means a life below the poverty line and a high likelihood of enforced deprivation.  Parents will do their very best to supplement that and give them a better quality of life and they want to do everything possible to continue that after they pass away.  If parents do manage to save money to give to their child, and the child simply inherits that, it could result in the child losing their disability allowance.  However, if the inheritance is left to a special needs trust rather than to the child directly, the child will not lose the allowance because he or she does not legally own the asset in the trust.  The problem is that establishing a special needs trust for the child is onerous and costly.  You need to get and pay for both financial and legal advice.  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, spoke to Revenue on this some years ago.  It impressed on him the importance of doing that but it would not give clear and categoric direction on who the trustees could be, that is, how far from the immediate family they must be removed.  It just kept saying that the parents should engage legal and financial expertise themselves.  However, there is huge ambiguity on this point.  We have received conflicting advice from Citizens Information, Revenue, and from financial advisers where there has been a payout resulting from legal claims, such as medical negligence or a car crash where the sums involved can be huge.  The costs of advisers and the trust itself can be negligible relatively speaking.  However, where the parents might themselves be dependent on carer's allowance, putting what they can aside each month, the costs involved in this kind of financial planning, retaining professionals, and the trust itself are a massive problem for people.  I wanted to raise that.  I know that the specific amendment is out of order but it is a really important point because there are a lot of families who are struggling. </p> <p>  I support Deputy Nash's amendment, which is interesting and a sign of changing times.  We also cannot forget those who have been trying to marry in the last few years.  </p></speech>

Since they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to another.  As part of the tax strategy group, TSG, process last year, the tax treatment of couples was considered.  The TSG paper on income tax included an overview of the tax treatment of couples and outlined the rationale for the different treatment of married couples and cohabiting couples.</p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i>. Attorney General.  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution, in which the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  This decision led to the income tax treatment of married couples in operation today.  The constitutional protection of Article 41.3.1&deg; does not extend to non-married couples.</p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances, while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.  As such, I note that any changes in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development regarding such couples. </p><p>There would be legal issues with regard to so-called connected persons.  To counter tax avoidance, connected persons are frequently defined throughout the various tax Acts.  The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  This could be difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple does not have legal recognition.  There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, the legal status for married couples has wider consequences, from a tax perspective, both for themselves and persons connected with them. </p><p>I also note that the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to income tax and is also a feature of other tax heads, such as capital acquisitions tax.  Any changes, therefore, in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective.  That is the reason I am not in a position to accept this amendment. </p></speech>

This section in general deals with the issue of people working from home.  It provides for a formalisation of the tax arrangements for employees who are working from home.  This means that from 1 January 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services income can be claimed, apportioned on the basis of the number of days worked.</p> <p>  While I welcome the moves to encourage and facilitate working from home arrangements, I have a few questions and comments on this section.  I want to tease this out a bit because many people who are working from home are dealing with increased costs.  I am not opposing the section; I just want to tease it out.  I am interested to hear the Minister's view on the points I wish to raise.  Some businesses provide equipment to employees to enable home working.  For example, I previously worked in a bank which made laptops available to employees.  The cost to businesses of items such as computers or office furniture qualify for a deduction through the capital allowances regime but in this Bill, there is no provision to allow workers to claim a tax deduction for expenditure on equipment used for remote working purposes.  There is also no provision to extend relief to desk hire in remote working hubs.  I ask the Minister to explain the rationale for this.  I am very interested to hear his view on the matter.  It should also be noted that the process for claiming the deduction can be quite burdensome.  Recent figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that only one in ten remote workers claimed the relief.  I ask the Minister to consider changing the relief to ensure that applications and claims are easier to make.  Of course, it could be the case that many people are not aware of the relief and that raising it here might improve awareness but it does seem that the application process is quite burdensome for many.</p> <p>  The cost of this relief is being borne by the taxpayer and the State.  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council has prepared a report on the potential savings that may arise for employers from remote working.  It finds that a move away from large scale headquarters in expensive city centre locations not only provides cost savings for firms in terms of office rental or acquisition, it also potentially reduces related costs like electricity, lighting, heating, cleaning and catering.  A lot of businesses and companies are moving towards remote working or a hybrid model.  Despite these savings, the State is bearing the cost of remote working.  I am not saying that I am against these provisions but I wish to tease out the issues involved.</p> <p>  In Portugal, new laws require employers with more than ten employees to share the cost of remote working.  Does the Minister accept that with this measure we are giving employers a bit of a free pass in view of the fact that in some instances they will benefit financially from the shift to remote working?  It could be argued that workers who cannot work from home, like nurses and other front-line workers, cannot avail of such arrangements and are subsidising, through the tax system, working from home arrangements for those who potentially earn higher incomes.  I also want to raise the fact that there is no tax relief for travelling expenses incurred by workers travelling to their place of work.  Does the Minister accept that there is an issue of equity in terms of enhancing tax relief for workers working from home without addressing the costs incurred by those who do not have that option?  Will he agree to a wider review of travel and subsistence reimbursements in that context, including the costs that should potentially be borne by employers?</p> <p>  I did not get the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 9, which relates to SARP, because it was not moved.  I welcome the calls for a report on SARP.  We often hear that the programme is necessary in order to attract top talent or retain existing talent, but the burden of proof is left with the employer that is actually benefiting from this tax subsidy.  Why not give Revenue the opportunity to seek proof from employers and employees or would-be employees that the presence of SARP was the determining factor for employees who also received job offers in other jurisdictions?  I would be quite surprised if that could be demonstrated.  It is unfortunate that amendment No.9 will not be voted on today.</p></speech>

Overall, employers should bear the cost of providing the equipment that their employees need to work from home.  The employer would have to provide that equipment and those facilities anyway were the work to be taking place in a work environment, inside an office or a formal workplace.  The issues of equity that the Deputy touched on a moment ago would rise to a far higher level if we ended up in a situation where the taxpayer was subsidising employers for costs that in the pre-pandemic area were borne in their entirety by employers, albeit that they would have been able to claim recognition of them as a business expense.  We have to get the balance right in our tax code in terms of how we recognise all of this.  In situations where work is transitioning from happening in an office to happening at home, it is up to the employer to bear most, if not all, of the costs involved.  We would end up in a situation where there were real issues of equity if taxpayers were to take over responsibility for a whole set of costs that a short while ago they were not bearing at all.</p> <p>  On the question of whether I believe this raises equity issues for those who are not working at home but are bearing some of the costs of providing support for those who are working from home, we must put the issue into the round.  My officials will give me an exact figure presently, but the total cost associated with this measure is a very low share of all of the tax that we collect.  In that context, the equity issues are not particularly pronounced given that the cost of this scheme overall is not very big.  On the question of whether we should be subsidising travel costs associated with going to and coming from work, we should not do any more beyond the recognition that we currently give through things like benefit-in-kind relief.  In fact, in a world where we are trying to help and encourage those who can travel less to do so, providing additional tax recognition of journey time would not be consistent with that goal.  I think I have addressed all of the issues the Deputy has raised on this section.</p></speech>

I am trying to make that distinction.  Why should the employer not share a cost of the work from home relief for heating, electricity and broadband?  That is more what I mean.  </p></speech>

I was responding back to the question the Deputy put to me about the balance that we need to think about between the taxpayer and the employer.  In the measure that we have here, we are trying to get that balance right.</p> <p>  The Deputy also put a question to me that I neglected to answer in my first response to her regarding whether I think this is a particularly cumbersome way of administering this relief.  The truth is that time will tell.  Time will tell whether enough taxpayers believe that the benefit they can see by registering for this relief is worth the effort.  I hope that even by having this discussion and the prominence it got on budget day, that more taxpayers will be aware of the relief that is available to them.  I note that one way of claiming this that perhaps has so far not gotten the publicity that it might merit, is that the ability is now there to make the client claims in real time.  All that would involve somebody doing is having a look at their utility and broadband bills, taking a photo of the bill and uploading the photo to the receipts tracker app.  This is a well-established way of making claims for, for example, health expenses.  It will not come as much of an inconvenience to any taxpayer who wants to claim this relief. </p></speech>

Has he looked at that potentially as something we could have here?  Again, it is interesting to tease this out.  Some employers will be saving huge amounts of money because they will not have to pay the rent etc. for massive office buildings in big city centre locations across Galway, Dublin, Limerick etc.  It would be interesting to see if there is a way of including employers in those large companies who are doing better of out of this working from home situation.  Many employees of course are happy to work from home.  However, it would be interesting to see whether there is a way of including bigger employers in this as well.  Has the Minister looked at that or considered it?  That would be interesting to know.</p></speech>

That matter would sit with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I would be reluctant to see this matter dealt with through legislation.  It is better off that this is dealt with on an employer-by-employer basis with those who work with them.  We have gone through many months of mass-scale home working without this issue of who pays what raising its head in a significant way.  That speaks to the common sense that is being used by employers all over the country in working this out.  In hundreds of thousands of cases, employees of companies took their laptops home, changed an arrangement at home and managed to work that out with their employer.  We have managed to get this far into this phase of Covid-19 without those particular kinds of issues becoming difficult for a large number of employers.</p> <p>  For what it is worth, without going too far off the Finance Bill, I am not so sure that we will see the mass change in office space that we would have speculated might happen a while ago.  In many cases, employees will still want to go back into the office.  They may want to go back in for considerably less than five days a week.  We are going to see offices move away from where there are many offices and workspaces to where there are meeting rooms and collaborative areas.  That will involve using the same space, but in a different way.  That is already happening.  Employers are looking at how they change existing office space to make it a place where their employees want to come in, and to make it into a genuinely collaborative space, as opposed to a place where an employee comes in to do his or her email.  That is a discussion for another day.  </p></speech>

People are becoming more and more concerned about it.  It could be a situation that this is not in a general public conversation right now.  However, the issue of energy cost rises certainly is.  It could be discussed at a later date.  It would be interesting to look at that, and look at the fact that the likes of Portugal has done this.  It would be an interesting conversation to have.  I always think that it is better to have done the research before it becomes a problem.</p></speech>

We will not get into another question on the various parts of the amendments.  I am saying that because I let Deputy Farrell on.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has three amendments, namely, amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.  They were not moved because he was speaking in the Chamber.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is welcome to speak on them in the context of the section itself.  However, there will not be any voting.  Deputy Nash also has indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#Q00700"><p>I appreciate that, Chair.  Trying to bilocate in here can be difficult at times.  The amendment which I had hoped to move related to this section.  It was amendment to look at the special assignee relief programme.  This is one of the most egregious tax breaks that is given to some of the highest earners in this country.  Many people are not aware of it but it really sticks in the craw of any ordinary worker who becomes of aware of the fact that there is a specially designed relief on income tax, which you only get if you earn more than &euro;75,000 per year.  The thought of that is in and of itself to me mind-boggling, that is, that there is a tax relief that you can only get if you earn approximately twice the average industrial wage.  Included in that is the relief for paying fees for private schooling and for trips abroad, or home, in the case of foreign executives who are on these earnings.  It is well worth saying that while the threshold for being eligible for special assignee tax relief is that one has to earn more than &euro;75,000, the recipients of this relief earn, in many cases, a hell of a lot more than that.</p> <p>  The Minister sent us some recent figures.  I have figures from a reply to a parliamentary question that I asked earlier.  The Minister might give us the updated figures.  They are quite extraordinary.  In 2016 there were 95 recipients of the relief who earned between &euro;375,000 and &euro;675,000.</p><p>There were 26 recipients who earned between &euro;670,000 and &euro;1 million.  For this year, if I remember the figures correctly, 50 people who earn in excess of &euro;1 million will get this relief.  Anybody who hears about this is gobsmacked.  It is lucky for the Government that most people do not know about it.  If they did, they would be enraged.  People need to know about it, which is why I am keen it be highlighted as part of the debate on the Finance Bill.  There should be a review of it and I hope at the end of that we would decide it is unconscionable and unjustifiable.</p><p> The Minister will say that this brings executives in and Government policy is at least consistent in being all about executives and owners of some of the wealthiest multinational corporations in the world.  They feel we would do anything for them.  All the policy measures relating to them add up to the feeling that Ireland is a place that will do anything for them, even giving them tax reliefs on extraordinary salaries that no ordinary worker could dream of getting.</p><p> This is an interesting contrast with the universal social charge.  The Minister will say they pay that charge.  I accept that they do, but the idea that 30% of their income over &euro;75,000 up to &euro;1 million would not be taxed is remarkable.  Imagine what it would do for a lot of workers if they got relief at a threshold above, say, &euro;20,000, such that 30% of their income would not be taxed.  They would love it but, unfortunately, it is a privilege only given to people earning more than &euro;75,000 or, in many cases, earning &euro;675,000, &euro;1 million or whatever.</p><p> I do not think it is justifiable or necessary.  When you are on that kind of money, do you need tax breaks additional to what everyone else is getting in order to come here?  Those who do must be incredibly greedy if they are on that kind of money and want tax breaks additional to what other people get.  It is important to highlight this matter and to appeal again to the Government to reconsider this grossly unjust tax relief for the highest earners.</p></speech>

I understand where both Deputies are coming from.</p> <p>  I will speak to the section relating to the working from home relief.  It is good to see there is now the real-time opportunity to post receipts and make that claim.  That makes it more efficient.  In the real world, people clock up bills in real time and it is important that the system is there to reflect that.</p> <p>  The amendment I proposed, which was ruled out of order, sought to apply the 30% provision to this year, that is 2021.  My understanding is the system is currently done on an administrative basis but the Finance Bill will place that on a legislative footing to give it the protection that implies.  If it is done on an administrative basis, can the political will not be there to provide additional relief for those who have clocked up significant bills working from home this year to reflect the fact that energy, fuel, electricity and heating costs have risen by a huge margin?  Given the scheme is on an administrative footing this year, a decision could be made to provide 30% relief for those experiencing those bills this year and working from home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#R00300"><p>I will deal with the issues relating to SARP put by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I will begin by describing the schemes in place in other countries.  France has an inpatriate allowance which offers a reduction of between 30% and 50% of the remuneration of individuals on the scheme.  Malta has a highly qualified persons scheme that offers a 15% flat rate of tax on all employment income.  The Netherlands has a scheme that offers a 30% tax free allowance.  Italy has a scheme, introduced in 2017, that provides 50% relief.  That scheme was strengthened in 2019 to provide regional incentives.  Portugal has a scheme which offers a 30% reduction in income tax rates for relevant individuals.</p> <p>  That is the essential context for this argument.  Other countries we compete with for jobs and investment have equivalent schemes.  It comes back to the argument and debate we had on other matters concerning doing things that can raise questions but which we do because they are part of what allows our country to be competitive and play a valuable role in attracting certain senior decision-makers here to particular companies, which is fundamental to the creation and retention of other jobs.  Consider the list I have read out.  If we get rid of this scheme, it makes what we offer uncompetitive versus the offerings that are there.</p> <p>  I have no doubt, despite the enviable consistency of Deputy Boyd Barrett's views and for which I have long praised him, that were any job losses to develop in any of those employers, one of the first people to herald this as the collapse of an economic model would be the Deputy and, no doubt, he would criticise me for it.  I hope his consistency of argument would last at that point but I am not willing to take the risk.</p> <p>  The scheme can attract understandable criticism, as it has from the Deputy, but my Department and I go to great lengths to publish information about the scheme on or just after budget day every year.  I take the Deputy's point that, when a scheme confers benefits on people who are already very well paid, there is an additional responsibility on me to make sure it is done in an open and transparent way.  That is why, every year, my Department publishes a report on the operation of the scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy will remember that a couple of Finance Acts ago, I made changes to the operation of the scheme because, even though it plays a role in retaining and attracting certain kinds of jobs, it should not be done with a disregard to any concerns about equity.  I made changes to the scheme at that point because I wanted to deal with some issues I was becoming concerned about and that needed rectification.  The most recent report that was published indicates there were 379 additional employees, compared with 236 in 2018.</p><p>The number of employees retained was 483 compared with 348 the year before.  This combined total of 862 SARP-related jobs in 2019 represented a cost of &euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared with 2018 when there were 584 at an average cost of &euro;73,000 each.  This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%.  I know it can be complex, at times, to make a case for a scheme like this but it does have a role to play in jobs, corporation tax receipts, PAYE receipts and the association of research and development tax credits here in Ireland because of the individuals who are here.  I remind the committee that in 2019 I commissioned an independent review of the scheme.  It said there was a strong policy rationale for the scheme.  One of the main reasons for that is the existence of comparable schemes in other jurisdictions and the role this scheme plays in allowing us to be competitive versus those.</p></speech>

The amendment is reasonably self-explanatory.  It has to do with providing tax credits or reliefs for many of those who are paying for levies in terms of defects identified in their apartments.  These apartments would have been built during the so-called boom time period when regulation of the industry was not particularly sound, to put it mildly.  We have a situation where those who are in the business of being landlords, institutional investors and others have the opportunity in the course of their business to claim against or write off tax against some of the work they may be required to do to bring apartments up to standard.  The reliefs which may be available to them are not available to ordinary apartment owners.  There is a clear injustice there.  It is estimated up to 92,000 apartments built during the boom could be affected by defects ranging from a lack of fire-stopping material to rotting balconies and collapsing roof canopies.  Some people are facing bills, we are told, of up to &euro;60,000.  This amendment requests the Minister to provide in this Bill for a modest form of relief on levies.  It is fair and reasonable and I hope the committee takes that view also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#S00800"><p>Just for clarity, I will be speaking on both No. 12 and No. 165.  The latter is the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  We are all acutely aware of the issues with mica and pyrite and how people are affected by them.  We have long argued for the Government to hold those responsible for defects to account and to implement a redress scheme that supports those affected.  It is something my colleagues, Deputy Doherty, and our housing spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have repeated time and again.  The mission statement of that scheme should be that ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others.  That is why a redress scheme for those affected by mica, pyrite and fire safety defects should require a contribution from those responsible, be they developers, construction companies or financial institutions.  That is why amendment No. 165 should be accepted.</p><p>I note the provisions of No. 12.  They mirror the proposals by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who, in his book <i>Defects: Living with the Legacy of the Celtic Tiger</i>calls for a redress scheme that also provides some form of retrospective relief for owners who have already covered the cost of remediating their homes.  This should be done by allowing these homeowners to write off the capital costs of remediation against their future tax liabilities over a number of years, as is currently the case for landlords.  Amendment No. 12 is prescriptive that we need a scheme that works.  That is why I ask that the Minister, if he does not accept those amendments as he should, report back within six months on the introduction of a redress scheme, including provision for levies to claw back costs from those responsible.  </p><p>On the mica and pyrite scandal, I put on record my disappointment at the divisive strategy emanating from some Departments in recent times.  In many ways it is trying to pit those affected against the general population.  We recently learned that under the National Broadband Plan the taxpayer is paying for over 40,000 premises which will already be covered by Eir at a great cost.  We know also of the cost of the sink that is the National Children's Hospital that continues to swallow money.  We know people have been really affected by this.  We need strong soundings from this finance committee and this Finance Bill in support of these people.  That is why amendments Nos. 12 and 165 should be accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-16a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111600002#S00900"><p>I indicate my support for this amendment.  People who were in multi-unit complexes where there were significant defects related to lack of proper compliance with building and fire safety controls, and who have had to pay large sums of money, should absolutely get some retrospective compensation for that fact.  They, along with the people affected by mica and pyrite, are the victims of cowboy builders who were facilitated by the wild west approach to building development that existed in the Celtic tiger period.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to Noel Manning, who was a slightly obsessive character on the issue of fire safety.  He was an expert on it and used to knock down the doors of many Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  He was always contacting us to point out the almost complete lack of proper fire breaks in buildings from that period in particular.  I remember he took me out to I think, Belarmine, or one of those places on the northside to show me the lack of fire breaks.  It was quite shocking when you saw how this stuff was allowed and that there were not proper controls on it or proper inspections.  The people who bought in good faith ended up picking up the bill for it.  It is outrageous and the Government and the authorities of the time, which allowed it to happen and quite consciously pushed a light-touch regulation policy in that area, are responsible.  They should acknowledge that responsibility to people who suffered very significant financial hits as a result.  These fire safety defects are consistent with those other issues of pyrite and mica and all those affected should get 100% redress.  This at least would go some way to giving this cohort retrospective redress so I support the amendment and the thought behind it.</p></speech>
