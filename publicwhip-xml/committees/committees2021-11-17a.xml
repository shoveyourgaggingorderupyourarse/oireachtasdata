As the Chair set out, I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Deirdre Fay, head of the Department&rsquo;s climate change and bioenergy policy who is online, and Mr. Fergus Moore, head of forestry sector development who is with me.</p> <p>  The recently published climate action plan 2021 sets out what is needed from each sector to achieve the overall economy-wide 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as legislated for in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act.  Achieving this ambitious but necessary target will require action across all sectors of the economy, including both agriculture and the land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, sectors.  The plan highlights the important role that our land and forests can play in storing and sequestrating carbon.  The climate action plan outlines a series of measures and actions to enhance the storage and sequestration of carbon.  I will discuss these in more detail, but first I would like to address the committee on the direction that discussions on the role of carbon storage and carbon farming are taking at both the European Union and national level.  It is also important to highlight that in considering the opportunity for carbon storage, it is first important to recognise that our land is a net emitter at present, principally driven by emissions associated with peat soils, historically drained and now in agricultural use.</p> <p>  I will now address carbon storage and removal and an enabling framework.  Carbon removal offers the potential for a new income opportunity for farmers.  Farmers in Ireland are already provided with incentives to engage in actions that can lead to greenhouse gas reduction, including through afforestation, organic farming and the green, low-carbon, agri-environment schemes, GLAS.  However, discussions on developing carbon farming or trading schemes are at a much more embryonic stage.  Carbon storage and carbon farming have been highlighted in the Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy and within the Fit for 55 package.  They are seen as key activities in stepping up Europe&rsquo;s climate ambition.</p> <p>  Carbon farming overall is a relatively new concept with pilots and business models evolving across Europe, including through peatland restoration, management of carbon in soils and both forestry and agroforestry activities.  Certification and regulation structures are also emerging.  The European Commission will launch a policy communication on carbon farming by the end of this year, with a Commission proposal on a certification scheme due by the end of 2022.</p> <p>  Within the climate action plan 2021, and building on the actions in Food Vision 2030, we have committed to exploring the development of a carbon farming model, with the potential for trading and which rewards farmers for emissions reductions and removals, including through potential private sector investment.  This is in line with the EU's policy direction.  Such an approach will require the establishment of baseline data, auditing, the development of voluntary carbon codes, leveraging of private financing through public-private partnerships, PPPs, and the putting in place of governance structures.  A Department-led working group has recently been established to progress this work and assess the potential for an Irish-based carbon farming market offering, keeping in line with EU activity in this area.</p> <p>  It is essential to recognise that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has a key role to play in the establishment of a carbon farming through an enabling framework, including through research, development and demonstration, co-operation, knowledge transfer, farm advisory services and behavioural change.  However, and importantly, as I have just highlighted, any framework must look to opportunities for support from private finance as we consider the opportunities associated with carbon storage.</p> <p>  The sector is not starting from a point of inaction and there are a number of initiatives and measures that are already happening that will provide a solid foundation on which to build.  These include the woodland environmental fund, WEF, run by the Department.  The fund is an early example of an initiative which makes a payment for ecosystem services, including carbon.  It is aimed at the restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s once vast native forests.  The objective of the fund is to facilitate the planting of more of these diverse woodland habitats and avail of their proven environmental benefits.</p> <p>  WEF funding is a once-off single payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare paid by a participating business to the landowner involved.  This payment is a top-up to premiums paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the native woodland component of the Department&rsquo;s afforestation scheme.  The WEF payment is made once the forest is established and has been approved by the Department.  The fund provides an access point for individual businesses to help expand Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource by providing additional incentives to encourage landowners to plant new native woodlands that they may not have otherwise planted had the additional support not been provided.  This relationship benefits the State by contributing to national targets regarding native woodland afforestation.  It also enhances the reputation of the participating business, as that business will be associated with the creation of a tangible environmental asset that will become a permanent feature of the landscape.</p> <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State at the Department, Senator Hackett, announced a number of new research projects and pilot studies in recent months in order to build the knowledge and evidence base to support a carbon farming initiative.  In so doing, they stressed the importance of monitoring, reporting and verification of data to enable the proper functioning of a carbon accreditation scheme.  For example, the national soil sampling programme will provide valuable data.  Not only will it provide soil nutrient and pathogen analysis detail for up to 10,000 farmers but it will also provide nationwide soil carbon analysis and identify peat soils on farms across the country.</p> <p>  The European innovation partnership, EIP, re-wetting pilot projects will provide us with studies on locally-led, innovative and a results-based farm schemes, rewarding farmers for managing farmed peatlands and raised bogs.  The establishment of a national agricultural soil carbon observatory with supporting technology will provide measurement of greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions, as well as fluctuations in carbon levels from a range of different soil types under different farm management approaches.  A national soil moisture monitoring network will be established and will gather data that will be necessary for our understanding of the fluctuations in soil carbon.</p> <p>  Teagasc has also recently commenced a research project titled, Farm-Carbon - Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon.  This project will provide a deeper understanding of hedgerows and non-forest woodlands as carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes and will allow researchers to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution.  The forest carbon tool, developed by Teagasc in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also provides indicative data for potential carbon sequestration associated with new tree planting and includes data for specific tree species, both native and non-native.  All of these projects will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research, while allowing for the refinement of our reporting through the national inventory and further improving the sustainability of the agricultural sector.</p><p> A question often asked is who owns the carbon sequestered from the atmosphere in our forests, soils, grasslands and hedgerows.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has indicated that the State is not seeking to trade the carbon sequestered on Irish farms.  The State is, however, obliged to report and account for all national greenhouse gas emissions under Ireland's EU and international obligations.  That includes sequestration and emissions from forestry and land-use management practices.  That does not imply ownership but simply reflects the requirement for those reductions and emissions to be included in the national inventory reporting and accounting system.</p><p> Ireland's forests make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation and remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  They are also significant stores of carbon.  The Department's national forest inventory records that over 312 million tonnes of carbon are stored in our forests - in the soil and in the trees themselves.  This is a significant carbon store, and it is important we maintain and expand our forest area in the future.</p><p> The Government and the EU have provided over &euro;3 billion in funding since the 1980s to create over 300,000 ha of new forest.  These forests have been planted by more than 23,000 farmers, who benefit from annual premiums and the sale of timber products.  Continued afforestation is key to balancing emissions and removals in the land-use sector.  Forests also provide harvested wood products which continue to lock up and store carbon in the timber used in buildings.  Using timber instead of energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel also has a benefit in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  The Department recognises the importance of forests, the timber they produce and the use of sustainably produced biomass for energy.  We will continue to support the creation of new forests and fund research and innovation in the use of timber products.</p><p> I will now outline to the committee carbon storage and sequestration measures in the climate action plan 2021.  As members may be aware, there are an estimated 300,000 ha of carbon-rich peat soils under agricultural management in Ireland.  This accounts for between 7% and 9% of all agricultural land.  As a consequence of artificial drainage to improve the agricultural productivity of these soils, the rate of carbon dioxide emissions from this area is far above that which is observed from similar undrained peat soils, where natural moist conditions occur.  These emissions, when calculated over such a large area of land, represent a significant portion of overall greenhouse gas emissions from the land-use sector and, consequently, are a challenge for our overall efforts to combat climate change.  The Department recognises the important role peat soils and wetlands play as a carbon pool in the Irish landscape.  Action must be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from this source.  Through reduced management intensity, including the management of drainage systems and water table manipulation of these peat soil areas, it is possible to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also creating additional ecosystem benefits such as increasing biodiversity value and protecting water quality.</p><p> A key target under the climate action plan is to reduce the management intensity of 80,000 ha of these lands by 2030.  Improved management practices of at least 450,000 ha of grassland on mineral soils, which will increase the level of carbon sequestration in these soils, are also identified in the plan.  Improved management practices, such as increased time to reseeding, expanding the amount of legumes such as clover in the sward, thus avoiding soil compaction, and employing long-term pasture management plans, all contribute to a healthier soil and a healthier soil sequesters more carbon.</p><p> The plan sets out an ambition to increase the area of cover crops in tillage to at least 50,000 ha by 2030.  Introducing a cover crop over the winter period for spring sown cereals increases the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and made available for sequestration in the soil.  The incorporation of straw in the tillage area is a further action to remove carbon.  Chopping and incorporating straw back into the soil in cereal crop systems increases soil organic carbon matter by returning such matter directly back into the soil.  The climate action plan 2021 recognises the importance of the built environment and the timber produced from our forests, which will play an ever-increasing role.  While a lot of focus is on increasing levels of afforestation further, we must also recognise and promote the increased use of wood across all sectors of the economy.</p><p> I hope this opening statement has given members of the committee a good overview of the current activity in respect of carbon storage and sequestration on agricultural lands and within our forests and future activity in this area to ensure that farmers are recognised and rewarded for their environmental actions.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#B00200"><p>I thank Mr. Callanan, Mr. Moore and Ms Fay for their presence and for a comprehensive submission, which was very interesting and broad-reaching.  I have a couple of brief questions.</p> <p>  The first is based on almost the entirety of the Department's submission.  Can the witnesses be any more explicit on timelines, for instance, when we will be able to do individual farm inventories?  The committee has had a couple of meetings on this and we are all aware of the issue in forestry at the moment.  I do not want that to dominate the meeting.  When is forestry most advantageous?  At what stage of its maturity does it sequester the most carbon?  Given that we are now slipping behind in our afforestation and planting, when will that affect us most if we have been sowing 8,000 ha annually in recent years?  When would the greatest advantage and the greatest effect of that be seen?</p> <p>  As for ownership of the carbon, while Mr. Callanan says the State has now said it does not own it but has to include it in its national inventory, he does not specifically go as far as saying the landowner or individual farmer or the person who planted the forest owns it or will have access to it.  Does Mr. Callanan see coming the day when individual farmers will be able to trade carbon credits, will have ownership and will be able to reap the benefits of whatever sequestration is on their farm and, one would hope, balance their sequestration against their emissions by becoming more efficient?</p> <p>  As for the woodland environmental fund, I like the scheme whereby private businesses invest, but is there a view that, down the line, those businesses may have some claim over the carbon credits and be in a position to use them to balance against their emissions in whatever their business is?</p> <p>  Finally, I have a question for Ms Fay.  On the bioenergy side, are we working towards anaerobic digestion and, if so, how far away from it are we?  We all know the advantages of anaerobic digestion.  Energy aside, the big advantage of it that I see is that, where slurry is used, it is a far cleaner way of spreading the by-product of the slurry.  There are, however, a lot of anaerobic digesters in the North which are being fed a lot of grass.  How do the emissions from the grass used in an anaerobic digester fare?  Do they result in a net gain from the point of view of carbon emissions or are there a lot of emissions from repeatedly harvesting the grass and using it in the anaerobic digester?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#B00300"><p>I will refer a couple of the Senator's questions to my colleague, Mr. Moore, particularly those relating to forestry.</p> <p>  On the question of individual farm inventories, there is movement in that direction.  Bord Bia is doing carbon auditing at individual farm level, which is identifying whether there is opportunity to improve the overall carbon profile of farms.  In the context of this discussion, however, which is on carbon sequestration in soils, etc., and in response to the Senator's question about timelines, we have created a working group that includes quite a number of people to work out how one would structure the issue of the potential for carbon trading and farmers getting rewarded in that regard.  That requires identification of a baseline.  The national soil carbon observatory, the soil testing and so on will contribute to that.  It requires consideration of verification and how that should be validated.  I know that others will present to the committee and will have particular views on this.  There are issues of permanence as well and, from a Government point of view, the issue of how one oversees or referees, effectively, the process whereby carbon could be traded or counted at individual farm level.  That progression is at an early stage.</p><p>We have to give surety and certainty to people with regard to what they should expect in carbon accounting.  I have to caution the many farmers who are saying they need to be given credit for the carbon in the soil.  We have to remember that our land-use sector is emitting carbon, so we have to overcome that in its primacy.</p><p> In terms of the ownership piece, from the point of view of businesses, there is a lot of interest in this area and it is predominantly coming from corporate social responsibility.  While that is driving it, we must recognise this is about the voluntary carbon market as opposed to the structured market.  I am sure members have spoken to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications about this.  The structured market is the emissions trading system and the non-emissions trading system.  The former involves large energy users, etc.  The current structure does not provide for them to offset, for example, through afforestation.  It is an emissions trading structured system and afforestation is not countable under that mechanism.  The idea of offsetting is not where the current policy direction is.  It is more around the voluntary carbon market developing for industry.  We regular encounter advertisements on radio and television in which businesses state they are climate neutral because they are offsetting.  That is somewhat different from a formal emissions trading system.  A business will not have the capacity, through its involvement in the likes of the woodland environmental fund, to say it rather than the individual farmer owns the carbon credits.  That is important.</p><p> On the anaerobic digestion question, under the commitment in the climate action plan, 1.6 TW hours of anaerobic digestion is to be developed.  I am sure members are aware of the cost associated with biomethane production.  The actual feed stocks, as was pointed out, are the likes of manure, food waste and crops grown specially for it.  In the delivery of 1.6 TW hours, 30% to 50% would probably come from food waste or manures, with the remainder coming from the likes of grass.  That must, however, be delivered under the recast renewable energy directive, RED II, which means it must be sustainably produced.  The benefit of anaerobic digestion is that a significant number of businesses in the food processing industry are looking to decarbonise their energy system.  They see a value in it.  From an agriculture point of view, we would see the removal of methane associated with the manure that goes into it and the displacement of fertiliser, which is now being replaced with digestate from that plant.  If digestate is going out to reduce the amount of fertiliser used, the agricultural sector will benefit from that.</p><p> There is a contribution on the energy which is displacing heavy fuel oil or gas, in this case, biomethane.  I do not see it as a plus-and-minus scenario in terms of the grass because it must be produced in a sustainable way.  That is why work is going on in establishing multispecies as a feedstock, as well as a production system for animals, to make sure it can be compliant with that sustainability requirement.  If someone seeks to secure the credits associated with anaerobic digestion systems, only a very low fertiliser input system is allowed.  Perhaps Mr. Moore will speak about when forestry is most valuable in terms of carbon credits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#C00200"><p>It is important to note that forestry can be a source of sequestration but also a source of emissions, depending on the level of harvesting that takes place.</p> <p>  On the question of what the best age of trees in the context of sequestration rates, one can draw an analogy.  When a forest is first planted the ground is disturbed.  This disturbs the soil and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  When the trees are planted they are quite small and because of this they sequester very small amounts of carbon dioxide.  Over the following ten years, the trees become a bit bigger and gradually build in their sequestration capacity.  On the question of when they reach peak performance, when trees are 15, 20 or 25 years of age they are quite tall, have lots of leaves and pull in lots of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  As a rough indication of rates, a typical conifer forest throughout its rotation of 30 or 40 years probably will sequester on average about 6 or 7 tonnes of CO2 per annum.</p> <p>  In the context of broadleaves, over the same timeframe, they will sequester smaller amounts of CO2 amounting to about 2.3 or 2.4 tonnes.  At the end of the day, broadleaves will grow for much longer periods in the context of rotation lengths.  They also sequester roughly the same amounts of carbon eventually.  In hard figures, 1 ha of forest made up of 70% conifers and 30% broadleaves will sequester roughly 380 tonnes of CO2.  It is also important to make the point that once the forest sequesters that CO2, it reaches saturation point whereby it cannot absorb much more.  The notion that the forest will continually sequester for 100 years has to be dispelled.  It also depends on the soil types used for growing.  Certain species growing in productive soils will sequester a lot faster.  Trees growing on the top of mountains will grow a lot slower and will sequester CO2 at a slower rate.  In answer to the question, between 20 and 30 years of age is when the trees are at their peak performance.</p> <p>  In relation to afforestation targets, any afforestation that we plan now, up to 2030, will not make a significant impact on the total carbon sequestered because the trees are small.  Once we go beyond 2030, those trees will start to get bigger.  Therefore, afforestation is really important for our post-2030 targets.  On the climate action plan, the Climate Change Advisory Council asked how Ireland can benefit from the 2030 sequestration impact of these trees and it brought forward the notion of carrying forward those carbon removals.  The climate action plan provides a figure of 2.9 million tonnes of carbon, which we reckon our forests will sequester on 8,000 ha or thereabouts.</p> <p>  On calculating carbon at a farm level, we obviously calculate carbon on a national level based on our national forest inventory and the detailed monitoring that takes place.  To assess carbon at a farm level, I will draw a comparison with the UK woodland carbon code which is practised based against a UK carbon standard.  The forests are measured for farmers and the plantations then placed on a register.  That register can be offered for sale to a person or business who wants to enter a voluntary carbon market.  That is something we are looking at.  As Mr. Callanan said, we will find out next month what the Commission proposals are in relation to farm carbon.  They may give us a direction with regard to how far that process can be pushed in Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the guests.  Teagasc is due to tell us what to do in order to maintain the forest carbon sink autonomous management, including reducing the itinerary and increasing the rotation age.  However, it points out that the latter could lead to a short-term timber deficit of between 20% and 50% up to 2030.  This is likely to worry the sector overall, including those planting, those in the mills and the contractors, especially at a time when we are already underperforming in terms of afforestation licences.  I have a few questions on that.  Are we looking at a situation in which foresters may be required to leave trees unfelled for longer than they had originally planned when they were planted?  Will the prevalence of ash dieback be an additional hurdle, given the need to thin or fell trees earlier than the foresters had planned in the first place?  What are the witnesses' views on Teagasc's statement that there is a deficit in timber?</p> <p>  We met recently with Alan Moore of Hedgerows Ireland.  He told us that carbon sequestration could be vastly improved through proper management.  Is enough attention being given to hedgerow management?  Is there scope for more guidance on hedgerow management and for that to feature more prominently in the eco-schemes?  Mr. Moore also pointed out that only one third of hedgerows can be classed as being in good condition.  I would appreciate if the witnesses would answer those questions before I leave.</p></speech>

We have not heard its position so I would advise caution as to whether, technically, we can answer that question.</p></speech>

A lot of things can happen that make a forest either a sink or a source depending on the age distribution of forests.  As the Deputy points out, one thing we can do is order the management.  If we delay the felling of trees and reduce the harvesting, we reduce the emissions and we could then increase the carbon store in a forest.  There has also been discussion of a no-thin policy, where there would be no thinning, which would also increase the level of carbon stores in a forest.</p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, these are options to consider in the context of a voluntary carbon market and what additional measures a forest owner can take to improve the carbon stock in his forests.  That is something which can be explored further.  If a forest owner decides to fell his trees a bit later, for example, and delays the thinning or harvesting of most of the trees, he would build up a greater carbon store than he currently has.  There may be a possibility of him putting a value on that in a voluntary compliance market.</p> <p>  The Department issues a decision support tool for farmers on changing the felling regime in their forests.  For example, the Department's website has a felling decision support tool.  This allows people to ask what cash they would get from a timber sale where, for example, they fell their trees at 30 years of age.  If they leave them as they are and delay felling until they are 40 years of age, the trees will have grown bigger and become more valuable.  The felling decision support tool we have tells us what the optimum time is to fell trees, purely on a commercial basis.  That is an initiative the Department has taken to empower farmers to make those decisions themselves.  The Department does not foresee that it would restrict people's ability to fell trees at a certain age and, likewise, with thinning.  All sorts of issues are important.  Thinning produces timber for the sawmill sector, and it is important that it is kept supplied as well.  Reducing the harvesting age of trees also reduces the amount of timber that is going into the mills.  They are important points to take on board.</p> <p>  Ash dieback is very important.  I know the committee has discussed the matter several times with my colleagues.  When trees die or are blow down, there are emissions associated with that.  We do not see major impacts on our national inventory because we measure the carbon across 770,000 ha.  In the greater scheme, we are not seeing a massive difference because even when trees are dying or are dead, they are still storing carbon, so it does not come through in our figures that much at the moment.</p> <p>  There are different management options.  That was part of the discussion.  It is not all about afforestation.  Afforestation is great for putting in carbon dioxide, but adjusting management techniques can impact the carbon stocks and stores as well.  The suggestion from Teagasc and others was that there are other things besides afforestation that we should probably consider in terms of how we increase the level of carbon removals in the atmosphere.</p></speech>

This is a very important topic.  It is important to have this debate to improve knowledge of the issue among politicians and people in the agriculture sector.  The presentation was detailed and I will raise a few issues on which I would like the witnesses to elaborate.  Reference was made in the presentation to more than 30,000 ha of carbon-rich peat soils under agricultural management in Ireland.  That amounts to between 7% and 9% of the agricultural landholding.  It was stated that issues arise in terms of the land management of these soils, which are probably in every parish in the country depending on where we look.  How can we effectively change the management of these soils in a very practical way?  The farming in question might be beef, dairy or tillage.  It is a significant volume of land and a significant body of work is involved in changing the management of these soils.  What would be the appropriate management of these soils?  Would forestry be the solution or would it be long-term pasture?  What will be the long-term solution to ensure these carbon-rich peat soils can be managed in the short term between now and 2030 and in the longer term between 2030 and 2050?  They account for a significant amount of the overall land mass of the country.</p> <p>  Regarding high-mineral soils and reseeding, a normal farm pattern is seven to ten years but if it is silage ground, the period could be shorter.  How will the work being done by Teagasc on the derogation for farmers help in that regard?  At the moment, there are derogation courses in place.  From 2019 onwards, everyone must do a derogation course.  Overall, three courses must be done on derogation.  Is knowledge being imparted to farmers on the courses?  I have done them in recent months.  Must a body of work be done to ensure the learnings required can be incorporated into the courses and passed on?</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on how they believe we will measure carbon?  Will it be net-net or gross-net?  Do they believe the net-net model will be changed to a gross-net model?  If so, will that be done in 2026 or 2030?  What impact would a change from net-net to gross-net have on the national targets in terms of ensuring we meet our targets?  Will there be a difference in the amount?</p></speech>

The first step is to identify where they are and we have a project in that regard.</p> <p>  On the management of peat soils, we have two innovation projects that are being rolled out to effectively establish what are the best management practices to try to understand how we support farmers to reduce the emissions, as Senator Lombard suggested.</p> <p>  We have also invested significantly through Teagasc in the national agricultural soil carbon observatory to better understand what is involved.  A lot of the inventory data are based on book values that have been around for a while.  As they are international, Teagasc is doing some work to understand what the emissions from these soils are and to make them relevant to Irish circumstances.</p> <p>  On the planting of these soils with afforestation, we would not encourage that.  Mr. Moore might comment on the emission factors associated with forestry.  There is no real benefit.  If we disturb these soils to plant trees, we will lose carbon.  The carbon goes up in the air but it also goes out in the water in these soils.</p> <p>  The measurement of high-mineral soils going forward is based on a combination of the national agricultural soil carbon observatory and also the likes of the soil sampling scheme.  For the first time, the Department is supporting the measurement.  We had a very enthusiastic uptake from farmers in that regard.  Farmers are effectively getting free soil samples to establish the level of basis nutrients, such as phosphorus and potassium, and lime status.  Farmers are used to doing this but it also determines the carbon content of the soils.  We are starting to bring awareness in that regard.</p> <p>  We did a voluntary review of the derogation two years ago and introduced requirements.  The farmers involved are more intensive farmers who are generally quicker to take things up.  If somebody is reseeding, it includes a requirement to include clover.  The derogation is currently under review.  It is a joint process between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In that context, there is a proposal, although it has not been concluded, to reduce the nitrogen allowances that are available to farmers by approximately 10%.  That again is driving policy.</p> <p>  The Minister has made available &euro;1 million towards developing the introduction of multispecies grasses, which because they have legumes as part of the mix are less dependent on artificial nitrogen.  They are an important cohort in terms of being early adopters of actions that are generally positive as regards the direction of travel we are trying to encourage.</p><p> Similarly, derogation farmers are required to leave a certain number of hedgerow trees to grow, etc.  That is part of it.  Somebody from Teagasc told me that if it runs an event in any of the agricultural catchment areas where there are derogation farmers, one of which I visited last week, all the farmers will turn up to the discussion because they are quite involved in the environmental understanding of their impacts.  In other areas, Teagasc would not get that level of turnout.  As I said, we see derogation farmers as a cohort than can drive forward.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Ms Fay, to comment on the two research projects we have proposed to identify where some of these lands are located.</p></speech>

It will utilise image classification tools and high-resolution imagery to identify, with a high degree of precision, peatlands that are under agricultural management.  This will provide us with new baseline data on the cohort of farmed land on peat soils.</p> <p>  The second project, called the farm peat project, relates to farm payments for ecological and agricultural transitions.  This project is developing a locally led, innovative, results-based farm scheme for farmers who manage lands that surround some of Ireland's remaining raised bogs.  The programme will reward farmers for improved management of habitats on peat soils, along with other landscape features such as eskers, field boundaries and water courses.</p> <p>  In addition, under the forthcoming CAP strategic plan and the suite of agri-environmental and climate measures it contains, there will be a results-based action relating to the extensive management of wet grassland on peat soils.  It is targeted at grassland next to designated raised bog habitats.  Farmers will be incentivised to retain soil wetness, as measured through a set of wet grassland indicator species.  This will contribute to protecting soil carbon pools and reducing carbon loss.  These are some of the initiatives on peat soil.</p></speech>

My question, however, is whether the actions set out will be carried through.  We have a situation in this country at the moment whereby farmers have waited three years to do planting and the Department granted payment, followed by another year of appeal, at which point it was refused.  I have no worries at all about the farmers; my worry is in regard to the Department.  Do the witnesses believe they can carry their part through and not always be lecturing farmers and the country?  The Government has failed in every aspect of climate change and I have no doubt the Department will fail in regard to the woodland schemes and forestry schemes.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The whole thing is a mess and the question is who will clean it up.</p></speech>

There is a certain concern among farmers around all of this and understanding it.  We have to be open and honest.  I have been dealing with farmers for a long time and I think they appreciate our directness in terms of where we see this going.  The first challenge is in overcoming the fact our soils are emitting.  We must deal with that in the first instance.  The second point is that if we look to the longer term, including the EU's target of carbon neutrality by 2050, realistically, there will be residual emissions out there, whether from aviation or, as I outlined to farmers, vintage tractor runs or whatever else.  Wherever they are coming from, there will be residual emissions.  The only way we can see to offset them is through the likes of carbon capture, storage and land management.  We are seeing technology coming on board internationally to do that but it is at a very early stage.</p> <p>  We are looking at the management of peat soil in a situation where farmers are struggling to fatten cattle off it and so on.  Whether carbon is priced at &euro;20 or &euro;60 a tonne is one thing; there is a clear direction of travel in the price of carbon and it is upwards.  If these soils are removing carbon and it becomes valuable, the general view on how to maximise it will hit home because farmers certainly are driven by economic reality.  In the trajectory from here to 2050, although I am not saying it will be done by then, I see there being a greater understanding of the value of environmental services provided by agriculture.  Let us be honest about the fact we need to create some sort of economic model to support that.  It is fine to say somebody should do something but we are clear that we must work with farmers to ensure it is socially, environmentally and economically sustainable.</p> <p>  My ambition is certainly not to fail in this space.  However, we must recognise, in terms of the evolving landscape, that we need to work out how to create a market that works for farmers, etc.  That is why we have an internal group looking at the issues.  We cannot do it half-heartedly and it must be financially rewarding.  Equally, we need to have credibility about it.  We must be able to show a roadmap for farmers in terms of what needs to be done, setting out actions that are valid and verifiable, and we must ensure farmers are not led up the garden path as to what can and cannot be done.  The Deputy has put the challenge full square in front of us and we are happy to take it on.</p></speech>

I do not understand how we get to the point they have outlined unless we have a system whereby every farmer knows, and has an audit of, a baseline in terms of the carbon that is stored on his or her land, the carbon that is being sequestered on an annual basis and the carbon that is being emitted.  It is only by having this information that we can put in place a system that rewards those who shift the balance by emitting less and managing to store more.  Reading the references to an enabling framework in Mr. Callanan's opening statement and listening to all of the rhetoric about the carbon action plan, with all its lofty and important objectives, I do not know how any of that will be realised in a way that delivers on the rhetoric unless we have such a system.  However, I see no plan to put it in place.</p> <p>  My first question, then, is whether it is the Department's intention that we get to that point.  In the same way that every farmer knows his or her data on genomics, water quality and land eligibility, farmers should also know what their carbon audit is as a starting point and baseline.  I do not understand how people can be rewarded for reducing their emissions or capturing more carbon if we do not have a baseline audit showing where they started.</p></speech>

As I set out in my opening statement, it is very much a nascent discussion.  Internationally, there has been ongoing discussion around the idea of carbon trading, but there is a recognition that there is an amount of work to be done in terms of how that would be structured, how the baseline will be created and how improvements can be validated.  I will give an example of the challenge inherent in this.  Typically, dry mineral soil might have 200 tonnes of carbon stored in it and the farmer is potentially changing that by less than half a tonne per year or thereabouts.  We are talking about a 0.25% change and the question is around how that is measured.  I assure the Deputy that we are very open on this and we are at an early stage of discussion in terms of carbon trading.  We are considering and reflecting on all of this and taking everything on board.</p><p>Exploring a soil carbon bank has been suggested in America, but that comes with challenges regarding permanence.  For example, if people build carbon into the soil they own and are rewarded for it, and then they turn around and plough that land for a few years and start losing it, what responsibility flows from that?  New Zealand is considering a similar proposal.  The question there has been if carbon is to be valued, then how can those farmers reducing carbon be rewarded and those increasing it be charged.  That is the trajectory in New Zealand.  We are very much at an open stage in considering this issue.</p></speech>

We will have representatives in from Devenish later.  It has carried out this type of calculation on specific farms.  On a wholescale level, have we examined what it would cost to do what that company does on individual farms on every farm in Ireland?</p></speech>

We have just set up a group to look at this issue and it will take on board the views of people generally regarding what level of penetration is necessary.  To be clear, the Department is doing two things.  It is supporting actions that are helping to remove carbon, whether or not they are countable on an individual farm level.  Examples include the straw incorporation scheme, the drive towards multispecies swards and the soil sampling scheme, which I spoke about.  These are enablers in the development of low-carbon farming.  I refer as well to the national agricultural soil carbon observatory.</p></speech>

We need a big State-led and Department-led initiative that will give us the starting point in this regard.  My fear is that we will end up as we have with other schemes.  We will have the agri-environmental schemes and eco-schemes and all sorts of measures, but they will be short-term in the grand scheme of things.  They are five-year schemes.  A number of the objectives and policies of those schemes will directly contravene previous policies in this area.  Under earlier CAPs people were for draining peatlands, whereas the next CAP will ask people to consider re-wetting them.  We must therefore think in the long term about all of this.</p> <p>  How can we encourage a farmer of any size, be that a large-scale intensive dairy farm or a small-scale suckler farm - and we must encourage both types of farm because they can play two different roles in all of this - without actually telling those farmers where they will be starting from, if carbon trading will be available and whether there will be financial benefits from having reduced carbon?  Without that being quantified, the actual work done will count for nothing if we do get to the point where we are paying for carbon credits.</p></speech>

When we apply them to 125,000 farmers, however, that is when it all adds up.  That is the space we are in.  Regarding our internal considerations, the issues we are considering include the scope of carbon farming, the question of auditing and baseline development, the development of a voluntary carbon code for the sector, issues around finance and business models and also governance structures.  Therefore, we are at the beginning of a process in that regard.  We must be in step with what is happening at a European level, and we expect the paper in December to articulate some of the issues being seen at the European level.  We should align with that.</p> <p>  At a concept level and an individual farm level, as I said, Bord Bia is doing carbon auditing at individual farm level.  That is counting actions such as fertiliser usage, when animals are being let out, the use of manures and the output from a farm.  That information is quite detailed at the level of the individual farm and it is developing.  This is part of a process.  I want to be clear that we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good when we need to encourage people.  We are not there with carbon trading, which is slightly different.  We are certainly there in respect of the incentivisation of farmers towards carbon management, at whatever level.</p></speech>

It does, however, concern managing the water table and so forth to ensure these lands are not emitting carbon, and that they instead present an opportunity to remove carbon.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#F01500"><p>Absolutely, in parts.  By way of example, it seems to be a lot of land, but under the current GLAS, there is approximately 250,000 ha of low input permanent pasture, LIPP.  That land is subject to a relatively low application of manures and a low level of intensity.  The traditional hay meadow option in the scheme similarly accounts for about 120,000 ha or 130,000 ha.  It is that same type of management.  An added element here concerns how to manage the water table to secure the carbon.</p> <p>  I do not see continued use as being impossible.  If the prescription is right, it would be a voluntary scheme.  If the policy options are suitable for farms, if they are understandable and if farmers will be rewarded to offset the reduced production that will occur, then I cannot see why there would be a reluctance to participate.  It is a new system, it will take time and we will have to work in respect of advisory services to ensure people can understand what this is about.  I would be particularly cautious regarding a suggestion that this is about rewilding or anything like that.</p></speech>

Naturally, if there was a significant uptake, I do not see why it would not increase, but this is a realistic target in respect of something that is a new and different undertaking for farmers with this type of land in the context of the level of penetration we can secure.  That is where this figure comes from.  It is driven by what we know would be the associated reductions.  When we talk about reduced management intensity, we have a figure per hectare associated with that.  Just multiplying that by 80,000 ha generates what the overall contribution will be.</p></speech>

They effectively require that if a person proposes removing hedges over a certain length, which I think is 500 m, although I do not have the figures and can revert about it, screening or consent is required from the Department.  Under the environmental impact assessment regulations, if people receive approval to remove a hedge, they do not need to replant that hedge.  However, under the designation of agricultural features under the current basic payment scheme, because hedges are included for payments as designated features, as are drains, where farmers remove a length of hedgerow, they are required to replace that on the farm.  That is an added protection to hedges that currently exist.  There is a need for management of how we grow and build carbon stores within our hedges.  Teagasc has a project to try to analyse and understand the total volume of carbon in a hedge, both above and below ground.  Does Ms Fay want to comment?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Callanan for that answer.

I have a couple of questions, for whoever wants to take them.  What percentage of farmers are actively sampling soil?  How is the Department, through farm advisory boards and bodies such as Teagasc, encouraging farmers who are not doing soil sampling to do so?  In the same vein as Deputy Carthy was speaking about, I have a question about hedgerows.  The old rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, was set up some years ago and is over now.  Is there any agri-environment scheme that should be modelled on that?  There was great participation by many farmers.  Specifically on the matter of hedgerows, is there any specific tree or plant that is more suitable than others?  There are many hedgerows on farmlands that I believe are not beneficial with what we are looking for here.  I believe there should be some incentive to be part of the next scheme.  The witnesses said that it will be announced by the Minister shortly.  I think that is the way we should go, as we did with the old scheme.  There has not been the same amount of planting in recent years as there was previously.</p> <p>  The other issue relates to forestry.  This committee has done much work raising the issue of forestry and trying to sort it out.  I think we are going backwards rather than forwards.  I know there is a new appointment in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Hopefully that will make a difference.  I am not sure what sort of difference it would make in the short term.  Many farmers had considered planting forestry, of between 10 and 40 acres, but now they are not going ahead because they have seen the fiasco with licensing for felling, planting and everything else.  I do not blame them, with how the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is treating forestry.  How do the witnesses feel that they will encourage and entice farmers back into planting forests?  Part of its remit is to get farmers to plant forests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#G02700"><p>The first question was about soil sampling.  Approximately 120,000 soil samples are taken annually.  There are farmers with a derogation and farmers without a derogation, who are more intensive, going above 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare, who are required to take soil samples every four years.  They are required to have a nutrient management plan.  An element of nutrient management planning is having the soil sampling to accompany that.  I would describe it as a push factor.  The Minister has introduced a new scheme, the soil sampling scheme, which we anticipate will cover 100,000 samples.  It will not provide another 100,000 samples but it covers 100,000.  We want to have a spread across all types of farming and to achieve a regional balance.  Ensuring that is part of it is built into the scheme.</p> <p>  We certainly endorse encouraging farmers to plant hedges.  Under GLAS, approximately 7,500 farmers planted about 1,300 km.  We see the need to continue to incentivise the planting of hedges.</p><p>There is a prescription under the GLAS scheme in terms of looking at what is necessary for it to be a successful hedge.  The natural objective should be to maximise as much native species penetration in terms of hedgerow development.  </p><p> I am conscious that our forestry colleagues have appeared before the committee regarding afforestation so all I would do is reiterate the Department's position, which is threefold in terms of looking at forestry.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and her colleagues would be able to answer this better and I would leave it to them.  If we look at Project Woodland, it has three key elements.  One is the integration of forestry and agri-environment.  The second involves looking again at the entire forestry programme.  This is to kick off in the new year.  The third involves looking at the regulatory requirements associated with small-scale afforestation.  They are the three key elements.</p><p> I would really leave it to the Minister of State and the forestry side in terms of looking at encouraging farmers to increase.  What we are clear as part of the commitment under the climate action plan and what falls to us is the emission reduction requirements under land use, land-use change and management.  It effectively requires us to focus on issues like peatland management, which we know is a source, increasing the afforestation rate in line with the targets set, which is Government policy, and management of the opportunities associated with cover crops, straw incorporation and management of that 450,000 ha of dry mineral soils, which we know can maximise or increase the amount of carbon removal.  That is within our remit rather than the individual aspect of forestry.</p></speech>

I do not want him to comment on this but I will comment on it as I come from a different side.  I speak to farmers on a weekly basis who were considering forestry.  I really believe it is a significant missed opportunity for farmers, the Department and the targets it is trying to reach.  Is there any species of tree for hedgerows?  How do we compare with our European colleagues?  I know hedgerows and their maintenance constitute a major issue within the UK.  It is a trick we have missed over the years.  The UK has been at it for years.  How do we compare to other European countries?  I am not sure if Mr. Callanan is aware of the grants available in the UK to maintain hedgerows.  The UK has a significant incentivised scheme.  Could Mr. Callanan comment on that?</p></speech>

As regards species in general, hawthorn, blackthorn, whitethorn, whitebeam and mountain ash are probably the main species along with oak.  Obviously ash has had issues but we are hopeful that at some stage, ash will come back on to the menu of options when a lot of research from Teagasc kicks in.  They are probably the main species we would see being planted.</p></speech>

We can send on information on the penetration by agri-environment scheme in terms of those numbers if they are of any use.  Ms Fay might comment on the actual computed value of the chopping of straw, which is quite modest.  I think we chopped 0.03 of a megaton last year.  We had about 3,500 farmers, &euro;8.5 million and about 35,000 or 36,000 ha of chopping with the likes of oat straw being one of the main crops going into it but a lower rate was available for the likes of oilseed rape, etc.  There are two benefits in terms of chopping straw.  One is that you are incorporating carbon back into the soil while the other is that in these systems where you are doing the likes of minimum tillage with straw going in, the soil is much more friable and more easily tilled for future sowing.  The Minister had an engagement with farm bodies, which I left to come here.  I was talking to a tillage grower on the way out who said he has been minimum tillage for the past eight or nine years.  I said that I presumed that he was an applicant under the straw incorporation scheme and he said "Yes".  He told me that it was amazing.  He said he was sceptical in the beginning but that how quickly the land where straw was incorporated dried out and could be tilled and managed was something to behold.  He is a member of Irish Grain Growers and was a big advocate.  I said that I presumed that diesel prices made it attractive and he said "Yes".  He said he had taken a plough and tractor out of the system in terms of his tillage operation as a consequence of the better management of soils and how to improve the structure of soils through the likes of straw incorporation, etc.</p></speech>

It has calculated on a cost-per-tonne basis the value of straw incorporation.  I just do not have the figure to hand unless Ms Fay has it and can comment.

We have seen a 50,000 ha drop in overall arable production over the past six to eight years, primarily due to a transfer to dairy production on some of this land.  It has, therefore, dual impacts in terms of a support for the sector coupled with the carbon benefit and the opportunity for improving management practice on farms incorporating straw, which are generally moving towards minimum tillage systems reducing diesel usage and returning nutrient.  As we all know, fertiliser costs have gone up so straw is a more valuable product in terms of the nutrient content today than it was in previous years and was generally welcomed by the sector.</p></speech>

It is a pretty effective method.  In the North, they are using the system for soils and for all the mounted carbon that is stored in hedges and in the trees around the country.  Why have we not done that as a country, and tied up with what they are doing in Northern Ireland?  If we did so, we would have an accurate account of what we have sequestered.  We could do two trials.  One could be done now, and another could be done in a few years' time.  That way, we would know had been sequestered in between.  I saw the method being used when I visited the Devenish farm.  Why have we not done something like that?</p></speech>

The OPW does not have a big interest in it, to be honest.  It is the Departments Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Environment, Climate and Communications that are the big players here.

Looking at it from a climate point of view, we have to put it in perspective.  In respect of the additionality, as the Deputy said, we will look at measuring it now and measuring it in a few years' time, and importantly, whether that could be included in the inventory in terms of the credit.  That would be the potential benefit.  We also have to be conscious that we are losing hedges in places as well.  That is an issue that has to be addressed and is being addressed.

We are able to provide figures on that.  I do not know whether they are right or wrong.  We do not know, on the other side, what we are taking in in hedges nationwide, what is on the motorways, what is planted in different parts of the country, what is coming in in barley or other different cereal crops, what grasses are sequestering, and what is being sequestered by all the different things that are out there in the rural areas.  We have no clue.  One would imagine that that should be measured before we start off making an assumption.  It is not the Department that is making assumptions, but the media in general are trying to kick the daylights out of the farming sector.  Basically, no credit is being given to the sector for what it is doing.  At the same time, there does not seem to be any talk of what methane is coming out of the treatment plant in Dublin or what harm it is doing.  Why have we not done an accurate assessment and enough research on all the different types of farming and what is being sequestered on a constant basis by the crops, including barley, wheat, trees and grass, when they are eaten and grow again?  Why have we not done something like that?</p></speech>

Perhaps it is a question for the committee to put to the EPA.  As I understand it, over a thousand lines of various inventory data are used to populate our overall emissions.  There are emission factors associated with peat under agricultural usage.  If we talk about peat soils, many of the peat soils here are grass-covered.  Internationally, many of them are in horticulture production, because traditionally there are no stones or they are easily managed for that.  There are different emission factors for that.  There are emission factors associated with our grassland and what they remove, which are positive, that go into the national inventory.  I cannot accept that there is not a knowledge.</p> <p>  However, we are absolutely committed to growing that knowledge and investing in the development of that knowledge.  That is where the likes of the national soil carbon observatory will give us country-specific data for Ireland based on real research, which takes a number of years to put in place.  It is quite a different suggestion to assert that we do not have any knowledge in terms of what our lands are emitting or removing.  The data are part of the structure at EPA level on national inventories, including data on the number of livestock and the type of livestock.  There are standards in terms of that reporting.  There is tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3.  I will not claim to be an expert, but basically, the higher the level of data, the higher the tier of reporting.  We are continually  working towards increasing and improving the reporting levels.  I am sure it is the same in forestry with tiered reporting.</p></speech>

There have been 2.8 million tonnes of sequestration lost over the last four to five years because people could not get licences.  Looking at the targets that are put out there and the duration of the targets, the number that we have lost is like losing 8.6 million tonnes of carbon sequesters, because the licences are stuck in the system.  We have been dealing with the forestry issue for three or four years.  I know it is not a responsibility of Mr. Callanan's section, but it is a responsibility of the Department.  We have basically deflated a lot of farmers that do not want to go near forestry now because they have joined another scheme or have done something else with their land.  Is there a big concern in the Department that the appetite for forestry has reduced because of what has gone on and the number of licences granted?  Also, a bigger thing that is worrying farmers is the uncertainty of not knowing whether they will be able to cut down their trees in 30 years' time.  That is a huge problem.  Does Mr. Callanan agree with that?</p></speech>

We have agreed the targets.  I believe the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the forestry team are the right people to talk about it and to look the policy achievement in relation to that.  We are clear that within the climate action plan there is a requirement in terms of increasing our afforestation.  It is a Government policy objective.</p></speech>

We must remember that in the 1970s and 1980s, the EU and Irish Governments gave grants to put shores every 7 m or 8 m apart and to gravel tunnel them and put grass into them.  We need to be clear on this, from what Mr. Callanan has stated.  First, are we going to be telling those farmers that it would be better now if they did not have cattle in on that land?  Mr. Callanan talked about water tables.  At the same time, are going to be giving derogations to others to go over 170 kg, when 115,000 farmers can stay under the 170 kg threshold in derogations?</p><p>You can do a lot in life but you cannot do anything about where you are born.  If you have land where you are born, you farm it and families are brought up on it.  We need clarification from Mr. Callanan.  If a farmer wants to farm, 170 is the figure for the nitrates, be the farmer in Cork, Dublin or Donegal.  Is Mr. Callanan saying those farmers will be left at that if they wish or that there will be a scheme if they want to do something different with their land in the line of water tables?  I want to know what Mr. Callanan means by water tables.  Water tables were reduced when land was shored.  You would go into a swamp or wet piece of ground with rushes and grass was not growing, and grants were given for that.  You put in the shores, ploughed it, seeded it and brought it to a standard.  You make a good job of it and put sheep or cattle in it.  You had to mind it but it gave families a living from the top of Donegal to the bottom of Kerry.  The maps are there.  A lot of it is in the west and north west.  We will talk about those areas in general because they are most affected by the figure of 80,000 ha that is being talked about.  Members need clarification for our constituents.  Deputy Carthy is also in that area.  Will those farmers be allowed to farm the way they do under the same conditions as a farmer in any other part of the country or will they be restricted through nitrate levels or other restrictions under the new measures being spoken about?</p></speech>

It is out in the proposals currently to consider the management of derogation farms.  What do we mean by that?  In the management of derogation farms, which was over 170 kg, that was done on a whole-farm approach.  We had 300-odd farms which used or included commonage land as part of their derogation so, in theory, were suggestive, on a whole-farm approach, that that land was doctored up to 250 kg, which was a nonsense.  We moved to preclude that being available at stocking rates at that level.  I describe it as the dilution of the stocking rate by the inclusion of marginal land.  That is put out under the current proposals as well to avoid a situation of compliance through inordinate expectation on the chemical fertiliser allowance associated with this type of land, particularly commonage land, or the nitrate-carrying capacity of it because it is being calculated on a whole-farm basis.  If these farms, of which I do not have the individual details, had 40 ha very heavily stocked, they could be compliant because they had 20 ha of incredibly low stocked land.  I got an approach years ago from a number of farmers who wanted to avail of low-input agri-environment schemes in terms of that element and then being in derogation.  I said that does not make logical sense.</p></speech>

At the outset through my evidence to the committee I identified that, in my view, if you look at carbon neutrality at a European level, there is a huge role for support for agriculture for the ecosystem services including from carbon removal.  I believe that passionately and strongly.  If you look at corporate social responsibility by companies or the endorsement which has, I respectfully suggest, been strong under the woodland environment fund, there is an increasing expectation on industry to engage on this.  I cannot see why farmers should not benefit from the creation of that.  Agriculture, like everything else, deals with efficiency and some of these things almost require inefficiency at times.</p><p>Some of these things almost require inefficiency at times.

I know a small farmer who is proud of his hedgerows and has seen bigger farmers nearby remove their hedgerows.  The witnesses mentioned the EPA earlier.  The EPA did a study in 2014.  It was done by Dr. Kevin Black in conjunction with a then emerging company, Treemetrics, in Cork.  The research showed that the hedgerows and wooded areas of Ireland are a small but significant carbon shore.  That small farmer and many other small farmers take great offence that those hedgerows are classified as grassland.  Conservatively, the report estimated that hedgerows accounted for 4% of the Irish landscape.  One recommendation of that research was that a full hedgerow assessment is needed if Ireland is to use hedgerows as part of actions to address the causes of climate change.  This would need to be linked to appropriate incentives for better management of this important resource.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned the use of LiDAR in Northern Ireland.  The report also suggested that LiDAR technology could be used, since it would provide amazing detail about the volume of carbon stored in Ireland's hedgerows.  Was any action taken to follow up on that research?  Was a comprehensive assessment of hedgerows undertaken as suggested seven years ago, in 2014?</p></speech>

Earlier, we mentioned the work that Teagasc is doing on hedgerows and trees outside forests.  We will see much more detailed research in the next 12 months.  There was much destructive sampling of hedgerows recently, where hedgerows were cut down and all the carbon above and below ground was measured.  If we have more detailed information, it will allow us to make those assessments at a higher level.  LiDAR is excellent technology but there is a significant cost associated with it.  The researchers in the Department could make a call on the benefit and costs of doing those calculations about trees.</p></speech>

I have responsibility for research in the Department.  At times, we and the EPA co-fund research calls to research-performing organisations.  The Deputy is correct about 4% of the Irish landscape being hedgerows.  We support the research associated with them.  As I said, Teagasc recently commenced a project.  I am not certain if it is within its own grant and aid or the Department funding.  It is for the establishment of farm hedgerow, non-forest woodland carbon.  It is called the farm carbon project.

We have been here for nearly twice the time allotted for this.  It shows the significant concern about this debate.  There is a lack of research about this.  When we get our ducks in a row, we will have a good story to tell about this.  As we have said, when comparing the landscape of this country to that of other countries, we have a far different, greener landscape.  More research will portray our production in a better light.</p> <p>  There is significant necessity for afforestation.  Whatever environmental scheme is agreed under the next CAP, it is imperative that it is married into afforestation.  Under GLAS, there was a bar on afforestation.  If there is to be any attempt to meet our target for afforestation, the environmental scheme has to be married with forestry.  It is in all our interests to increase carbon sequestration to reduce emissions.  It is essentially to marry those two things together.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.

The Chairman has mentioned who is present, so I will pass over that.  The opening statement we sent in was very detailed so I will just give the committee an overview of it this evening.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the climate action plan has set ambitious emissions reductions targets for agriculture and for LULUCF.  The plan recognises that there are large scientific uncertainties associated with the measurement of agriculture and land use emissions and removals.  This due to their biological nature, which means they are very variable.  Land use in Ireland is a net emitter of greenhouse gases.  This is due to the relatively low land area under forestry and a large area of drained peat soils.  In the 2018 inventory, forests and associated harvested wood products sequestered 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, wetlands emitted 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent and grasslands were the largest emitter, emitting 7 million tonnes.  This runs counter to the expectation of most people, who assume grassland sequesters carbon.  However, while grassland on mineral soils sequestered 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, grassland on drained peat soils emitted 9 million tonnes, giving the net figure of 7 million tonnes.  The reason these soils emit so much CO2 is that peatlands form under waterlogged, low-oxygen conditions that promote low levels of decomposition, which leads to a build-up in organic matter, resulting in peaty soils having ten times the carbon storage capacity of mineral soils.  Once these soils are drained, oxygen levels increase and the peat breaks down.  </p> <p>  The emissions from LULUCF are projected to rise from 4.8 million tonnes in 2018 to 7 million tonnes in 2030.  This is driven by sustained emissions from grassland on peat soils and a reduction in the forest sink due to low rates of afforestation and the large proportion of existing forests ready for clear-felling.  This is situation is likely to be exacerbated when new national emission factors for forest peat soils are adopted by the EPA, increasing CO2 losses from afforested peat soils fourfold, reducing the forest sink and resulting in forestry becoming a net source of greenhouse gases by 2030.</p> <p>  The current carbon emissions and removals calculations are based on what are known as generic tier 1 emissions factors.  Recognising this, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has funded Teagasc to establish a national agricultural soil carbon observatory, NASCO, to quantify Irish-specific emissions factors in order to reduce uncertainty around these emissions from grasslands on mineral and peat soils.  This observatory is currently being deployed on approximately 30 sites across Ireland.  In addition, the soil organic carbon baseline levels are currently being measured across more than 100 signpost farms.  </p> <p>  Teagasc research, using projects such as NASCO and signpost farms, aims to improve the measurement of carbon sequestration and focuses on producing Irish-specific CO2 emission factors for drained and re-wetted peat soils; producing Irish-specific land management carbon sequestration factors for mineral and organomineral soils, which are mineral soils with higher levels of organic matter; improving the estimation of carbon sequestration in hedgerows and on farm trees and woodland; revising the carbon navigator and developing a new farm greenhouse gas calculator to estimate the impact of mitigation options on the farm greenhouse gas emissions and economic performance; and developing strategies for carbon farming.</p> <p>  There is considerable scope to both reduce land use emissions and enhance carbon sinks.  To achieve long-term net climate neutrality, the rate of afforestation will have to increase significantly.  In the short term, afforestation will only generate a small contribution towards the 2030 target but, if high rates of afforestation are achieved, this could make a large contribution to 2050 targets.  Alternative management of the current forest estate provides an opportunity to maintain the forest carbon sink.  Reduction in thinning rates would increase sequestration while increasing the rotation length could improve the forest greenhouse gas balance by up to 2 million tonnes.  While this would ultimately result in higher yields, an alteration in rotation length would have economic impacts for the forestry sector and could lead to a short-term deficit in timber supply. </p> <p>  Reducing the emissions from grassland on peat soils will be imperative for land use change and forestry mitigation as this is the largest source of greenhouse gases.  This will generally involve raising the water table.  In addition, the input of nutrients from animals, manures and mineral fertilisers further accelerates decomposition and CO2 emissions.  Research projects on these factors are currently commencing in Teagasc in addition to research on alternative uses for re-wetted areas.  We are also surveying the current state of drainage on these grasslands as it may no longer be effective on some of the area, meaning that emissions may be lower than currently estimated.</p> <p>  The impact of grassland management on mineral soils is also being explored at the VistaMilk SFI Centre.  This exploration seeks to quantify management impacts, such as the impacts of soil fertility, multispecies swards and grazing intensity, on soil carbon sequestration.  These data will be used in conjunction with earth observation data from satellites and drones to model carbon balance for forest, cropland and grassland ecosystems across the country as part of a Microsoft-Science Foundation Ireland co-funded project, Terrain AI, led by Maynooth University and involving Teagasc, UCD and others.</p> <p>  The carbon sequestration potential of hedgerows has been investigated in Teagasc for many years with Teagasc and Forest, Environmental Research and Services, FERS, Limited completing the first analysis of national hedgerow carbon removal using light detection and ranging, LiDAR, investigating new technologies for mapping hedgerow carbon and mapping of carbon storage on the Devenish Dowth farm.  Currently, Teagasc research is being carried out to improve the national estimation of hedgerow carbon sequestration in a project funded by the EPA and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, FarmCarbon.  Increasing hedge width and height can substantially increase carbon sequestration both above and below ground while also providing increased biodiversity. </p> <p>  Improved cropland management, via straw incorporation, the use of cover crops and targeted incorporation of manures or digestate, can also contribute significantly to improved farm carbon balance.  Research has also recently started in developing agroforestry for cattle to increase carbon capture by trees and mitigate emissions from cattle. </p> <p>  Farm Zero C is a collaboration between BiOrbic, Carbery, Teagasc and others to create an economically viable, climate-neutral dairy farm on Shinagh Farm in west Cork.  The project presents a holistic approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the health and resilience of the farm.  The project aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2027 and is also looking to improve biodiversity and water and air quality.  </p> <p>  Farm Zero C and other initiatives will assist in the development of a carbon farming framework, as proposed under actions 317 and 361 of the climate action plan.  This will have potential for trading and reward farmers for emissions reductions and removals, including through potential private sector investment.  Measurement, reporting and verification of these actions will be imperative for farmers who wish to gain credit for their actions.  This will take a concerted effort on behalf of the entire research, inventory and knowledge transfer community.  The climate action plan proposes, under action 323, to establish a centre of excellence to co-ordinate and focus the research needs of the sector.  In addition, Teagasc has several initiatives and projects under way to develop a new generation of greenhouse gas accounting and decision-support tools that will aid the farmer in making robust and sustainable management decisions.  We are also starting a new project to explore carbon farming options.</p> <p>  I hope this has given the committee a good overview of previous and ongoing activities.  We welcome any questions.</p></speech>

I do not know if they had an opportunity to listen to our discussion with the departmental officials but one of the areas I was trying to explore - and Mr. Spink touched on this quite a bit in his opening statement - was that of establishing a baseline to understand and audit the full carbon footprint of our land use.  I asked the officials whether he have the capacity to carry out this work on a farm-by-farm basis, although I did not really get an answer.  Can we deliver to each individual farmer a report on his or her farm's carbon storage, sequestration and emissions so that we could then put in place a framework through which to reward him or her for improving the overall balance?</p></speech>

We are currently using tier 1 figures and they are international averages for what the emissions or sequestration are for various practices or land uses.  There is a huge effort going on to get national emissions factors so that we know, for example, how much peat soils in Ireland emit rather than using these international averages.  There are a number of projects going on that are mapping the country so we will have much better data.  I do not think we will ever get to an individual farm level with measurements but certainly a combination of national emissions factors and data on what is actually happening on farms will get us close.</p></speech>

In a sense we actually have tens of thousands of individual farms and the only way we can make a difference is if people are making a difference on their individual farms.  The only way we can do that is if we can point to them and show them what the current situation is.  I cannot get my head around why we are talking about this national picture.  It is about how we bring that down to a local level and especially a local farm basis.</p></speech>

That would not be measured that on the individual farm but if it is known, for example, that changing hedge cutting from once a year to every other year would alter carbon sequestration and that has happened on a farm, it can be calculated for that farm and stated that it has increased its sequestration by X or Y.  I might pass over to Dr. Lanigan on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Flaherty talked about how he always took great pride and value in his hedgerows whereas his neighbours might not necessarily have done so.  Let us say a farmer decides to diversify to a more sustainable type of farming and to increase his or her hedgerows or carry out other carbon sequestration measures on their land.  Unless we can say there is going to be a direct benefit to them they will not give a damn, and rightly so, that it might assist Ireland in achieving its global climate action targets.  They want to know what benefit and value they are going to get for carrying out that work on behalf of society.  How can we get to that point if we are not carrying out a farm-by-farm analysis?  That is the question I am trying to get to the bottom of.</p></speech>

The elements that vary soil carbon are the soil type, especially the texture, the management and then the climate.  If we have a good handle on the range of carbon content and the relationship between carbon content and soil type and carbon content and management, we can model the carbon content for each individual farm.  We do not necessarily have to measure it.  We have to measure enough soils so we can do the modelling in a robust enough manner but after that we can model it.  We have fairly complex process-based biogeochemical models that basically mathematically simulate carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils.  Therefore, we can simulate that relatively robustly, but it takes a lot of input data.  We do not necessarily have to measure the carbon content on every farm.  It would be ideal if we could but if we have enough samples we can model it.  As to how we ground-truth the modelling, that is going to be done via the signpost farms where we will measure the carbon content of every field on every farm and then also the national-----</p></speech>

In addition, we have our national agricultural soil carbon observatory.  With that we are directly measuring the volume of CO2 being taken up and released by mineral grassland, peat grassland and under a variety of different soil types and a variety of different measurements.  We then use those measurements to train the models and then utilise the models in conjunction with satellite data to extrapolate across the whole country.</p></speech>

We are measuring soil samples on Shinagh Farm in County Cork.  Down the road there is going to be a need for certification.  While the model can give a certain level of data towards certification we think farmers will be required to, for example, actually take soil samples.  As Dr. Lanigan rightly pointed, out we will not measure every hedgerow.  That will be impossible, so we will need models to help with the analysis but with things like soil sampling we are working towards measuring soil.  Just as Dr. Lanigan mentioned about the signpost farms, we are also taking baseline levels at Shinagh Farm but we are also working on satellite imagery.  He talked about ground-truthing.  We will be using carbon flux towers like Dr. Lanigan is, and we collaborate with Teagasc on this.  We are also working from satellite imagery and, therefore, a farmer could get a satellite image that would tell him or her the quantity of emissions coming from the farm.  It is not there yet as it is not robust enough but that is part of the research.  We think this will also be an important tool.</p></speech>

We need to do a little bit of work on it.  I am conscious of the time.</p> <p>  We were talking about afforestation earlier.  The Teagasc opening statement mentions that " if afforestation rates were to continue at current rates (or up to 3,500 ha per annum) [which would actually be a big improvement on current rates], the forest sink sequestration rate would be less than 1 MtCO2e yr-1 by 2050".  It continues: "... in the short term, afforestation will only generate a small contribution".  I am taking it from that and other comments in that opening statement Mr. Spink does not believe the climate action plan target of a 0.8 Mt reduction per year by 2030 is even a prospect.</p></speech>

There are also emissions associated with establishing it in the first place.  It takes a number of years before the trees start growing rapidly and they are not absorbing much carbon until they are growing rapidly.  There is then a period when the forest is mature or reaching maturity when it is absorbing a huge volume of carbon.  If early harvesting of forests could be avoided or delayed, they would continue to accumulate carbon for a number of years.</p></speech>

This is obviously very serious because this is to make up a big part of our commitment under LULUCF and is part of the climate action plan.  Thus, in all reality, with the best management in place do the witnesses see a scenario given the current rates of planting - and even with a substantial improvement up to 3,500 ha per annum - whereby we could get up to 0.8 Mt per year by 2030, or more importantly 2.1 Mt post-2030, which is what the climate action plan states?</p></speech>

Therefore, it will not happen without a big economic cost.  That is the point I was trying to make.</p> <p>  We had a good discussion on the role of peatlands in carbon emissions, particularly the peatlands that have been brought into agricultural use.  Proportionately it might be a small amount of land, but in some parts of the country entire parishes or even larger areas could be involved.  The prospect of it being removed from agriculture entirely is not feasible.  This is accounted for under LULUCF and agricultural activity is under agriculture obviously.  Is there a comparison of emissions per hectare from peatlands that are in agricultural use versus, for example, intensive dairy?  Even though they are under two separate categories, can they be related in any way, if Dr. Lanigan understands my question?</p></speech>

On a dairy farm with two livestock units per hectare, each of cows produces approximately 3 tonnes of methane in CO2 equivalents.  That is 6 tonnes of CO2 equivalents and when the fertiliser is added in it comes to approximately 10 tonnes per hectare.  The problem we have with the peat soils is that we are using tier 1 emission factors at the moment, which are essentially these generic emission factors.</p></speech>

We are deploying our flux towers over farms that are on both blanket bog and raised bog.

We can come back to the Deputy with some figures.  There is a beef life project, which has a number of organic beef farms within it and they can be compared with conventional beef farms.  We are modelling that through life-cycle analysis to come up with the CO2 emissions per hectare for each of those farming types.</p></speech>

We need to look at economic models to support farmers.  Deputy Carthy spoke about entire parishes possibly being affected by not being allowed to farm peatlands anymore.  However, they then need to be rewarded for managing carbon.  The price of carbon is increasing and will not reduce in the foreseeable future.  We need to look at the economic models.  The Deputy earlier said that farmers would not be interested unless there is something in the economic sphere for them.  We need to consider how we can reward farmers to do the right thing.  It is an important point.</p> <p>  Much of the focus is on land being non-productive because a farmer cannot produce beef or milk from it.  However, we need to look at the farm as a whole and understand the parts that are contributing to biodiversity, the parts that are contributing to not emitting greenhouse gas emissions or are sequestering greenhouse gas emissions are of value and farmers need to be paid for it.</p></speech>

He looks at neighbouring farmers who have taken out all their hedgerows.  This is a question for Dr. Lanigan.  Under REPS, we probably planted approximately 10,000 km of new hedgerows.</p><p>It is likely that we rejuvenated another 3,000 km of hedgerows.  I am sure he was listening to the previous session when I referred to the work that was done by Dr. Kevin Black in 2014, when he suggested that a hedgerows assessment should have taken place.  Even though farmers are not getting the credit for it at present, what is Dr. Lanigan's estimation of the value of those hedgerows as a carbon sink given that they comprise 4%, conservatively, of the national landscape?</p><p> Second, he said he was going to do his sums based on soil sampling.  That suggests that he is probably ruling out using LiDAR technology to assess the value of hedgerows and then obviously the bigger picture of afforestation as well.  Is he ruling out using LiDAR?</p></speech>

It can be done in other ways but LiDAR is probably the best way to get a handle on the above-ground biomass.  In the project we are doing at present we are doing direct measurements of hedgerows in respect of the above-ground carbon stocks, the below-ground carbon stocks in terms of what is in the roots and also the extra carbon that is inputted into the soils.  Looking across the literature, the rate of sequestration, including the above-ground and below-ground stocks, is approximately 3.5 tonnes per hectare, although it can vary quite significantly depending on the management.  A hedgerow that is trimmed very tightly will sequester far less carbon than a hedgerow that is allowed to grow either in width or height.  The estimate for the per kilometre sequestration rate is anything from about 0.85 tonnes of CO2 per kilometre up to about 2 tonnes of CO2 per kilometre, depending on the management.  The 10,000 hectares mentioned by the Deputy will be sequestering anything from 10,000 tonnes of CO2 up to perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 tonnes of CO2.  It depends on how the hedgerow is managed.</p></speech>

Is there an awful danger that agriculture has been put into a spot with inaccurate figures on what is being sequestered and basically being beaten over the head because we did not have the machinery or perhaps the funding and the research put into it that would help scientifically to give it a better name?</p></speech>

The difficulty with soil carbon sequestration is that it is a decadal process if one wants to measure it.  I will use the example of a swimming pool.  If I have a tap dripping into a swimming pool and I say the only way to measure how much water is going into the pool is to measure its height, one measures the height at time A and one might need to wait ten years for the height to change measurably to actually see a demonstrable difference.  It is the same for soil carbon.  There are very large background levels of carbon - typically, in the order of 150 tonnes to 500 tonnes of carbon per hectare - and there is an input that might be half a tonne to a tonne of carbon per hectare, so there is a very low level going into a very large background.  That is why the other way we get at it is to measure directly the amounts of CO2 being sucked up by the grass and the amount that is being released.  The flux towers we use measure CO2 flux, the amount coming in and leaving, ten times per second, every second of the day and every day of the year at a field scale.  We are not measuring a small patch of land but entire fields.  That is what NASCO is.  We then get direct measurement annually on the amount of sequestration going on in our mineral soils and the amount of emissions coming out of the peat soils.</p></speech>

I worked on the raised bog, raised bog habitat and so forth.  Every area is different.  Dr. Lanigan said Teagasc is doing 30 areas in the country.  With the best will in the world, I know Teagasc cannot be everywhere to even trace where active raised bog habitat is in some bogs and even in the blanket bogs - and the witness is correct in saying that they regenerate much quicker - but we need to be careful about some of the things we say.  I have seen analyses done on 53 raised bogs and they were all different.  We need to be careful about what we say they are emitting because it might not be accurate.  It could be a totally different scale.</p> <p>  On top of that, we need to find scientific solutions.  One of the witnesses spoke about re-wetting and so forth.  It is a brave politician who will tell half of the west of Ireland, the northern part of the country or County Kerry to pull out the cows and re-wet the land.  Realistically, that is not going to happen, so we need to come up with solutions for how to ensure that people can earn their living and so forth.  When we were talking to the departmental officials earlier, in fairness to them they said the carrot is that they will offer things to people who want to take the road of re-wetting but they were absolutely clear that nobody was going to be pushed.</p><p>We would end up with two thirds of the country being able to farm properly while one third would basically be the sink for everyone else.  That is not going to happen.  We need to concentrate on solutions for working with those farmers, especially in peaty areas.  People cannot do much about where they are farming.</p><p> What is the story on marly or lochy land?  Do the witnesses consider such land?  This is poorish-quality land.  There is a layer in that where the permeability is totally different from peaty land.</p></speech>

These are clay soils with a heavy subsoil and quite a high organic matter topsoil.  It would quite be peaty but it would be a nice dark brown to black in colour.  That typically has carbon in the range of 10% to 20% and it needs above 20% to be called peat.  We are looking again at trying to improve our estimates of how much carbon is being emitted from that soil.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's earlier question, we are looking at other options.  It is not just wet, re-wet or drain.  There is an in-between and the water table can be varied at different times of the year.  We have a project under way considering re-wetting to different levels in the soil.  It may be there is a reduction in grazing capacity on the shoulders of the year but a farmer can still get to graze it in summer.  The question is what effect that would have the greenhouse gas balance.  We have other research under way considering the effect of a reduction in fertiliser input.  Again, decomposition in the soil relates not just to the carbon content but to nitrogen, as the microorganisms that break it down need nitrogen.  A reduction in nitrogen inputs would have an effect on productivity but would also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.  Again, we are trying to look at different management strategies that allow us to combine grazing with reducing emissions on those soils.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, it is about different options.  The target now is to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030 but we are seeking carbon neutrality by 2050 so these high-emitting soils or management practices must be offset by 2050 in order to meet those climate targets.</p></speech>

We have done some modelling and compared mineral soils, organomineral soils and peat soils.  As Dr. Lanigan outlined, the peat soils were emitting approximately between 8 Mt and 9 Mt of carbon in total.  Those organomineral soils were emitting between 1.8 Mt and 2 Mt of carbon, or a quarter of the amount.  The reason for the high figure is probably that there is much more of that soil in comparison with the 350,000 ha or 330,000 ha of peat soils.</p></speech>

Can these megatonne figures be put into normal figures?  There was mention of 8,000 ha over the next ten years.  We might hear the dairy herd is emitting X, Y and Z and transport emits so many tonnes.  How many tonnes could we sequester?  Am I correct that even if we planted the country with forestry, which will not happen, there is only a certain amount allowed for under the inventory.</p></speech>

However, that is being revised because there will now be a LULUCF target in itself under the Fit for 55 and the new 2030 LULUCF regulations that are coming in.  That limit will essentially be removed.</p> <p>  However, we count LULUCF now on what is called a net-net basis, so it is done relative to a baseline.  For example, I could say the baseline for grassland emissions is 7 million tonnes and the next year it is doing 6.8 million tonnes, it counts as a net gain of 200,000 tonnes.  That is relative to a baseline.  However, we are now moving to what is called gross-net accounting, where we account for all the emissions.  That is why our LULUCF sector is going from being a sink under the net-net basis to being a source.  We are now counting all the emissions and sequestration.</p></speech>

There is absolutely a benefit as they eliminate the need for much mineral fertiliser, which produces NOx emissions.  There is also nitrate leaching.  The species mixtures root to different depths.  Again, we have eddy covariance towers over mixed species swards and are comparing them to lollium perenne monocultures.  We are doing that with a few different soil types again to see what is the soil type effect times the management effect.  We think they will have a big benefit and they will certainly have a big benefit in the greenhouse gas balance as less mineral fertiliser will be required on those pastures.  There is also some indication the animals grazing them have reduced methane because of some of the chemicals produced by the plants.  The rooting depth varies, and some of them are quite deep-rooting, which should improve carbon sequestration.  We think multispecies swards are absolutely a win-win.</p> <p>  Biogas and biomethane probably contribute approximately 500,000 tonnes of CO2 reduction and that is mainly through the displacement of fossil fuels.  That benefit does not accrue to agriculture but rather the energy sector.  We can put slurry into it and this could mitigate agricultural emissions because there would not be as much ammonia or methane produced.  It is instead being put into an anaerobic digester or biomethane system.</p></speech>

There are also transaction costs because that needs to be certified by a certification body, be it VERA, the Carbon Trust or whoever.</p></speech>

This has been ongoing since 2013.<br/><br/>Forestry and agriculture are the only two industries that have the ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere biologically.  Our research since 2013 has shown there are many options within the farming enterprise to not only increase carbon but increase the rate and consistency of carbon sequestration in soil.  The first step in this process is to measure what carbon exists in our farms, that is, baseline individual farms.<br/><br/>Devenish is a research, development and innovation company.  Our nutritionists develop and deploy solutions that ensure the most effective and efficient utilisation of nutrients in the production of food.  Carbon is one of those nutrients.  We take a collaborative approach, working in partnership with researchers, institutions, government bodies, our customers and suppliers, throughout the food supply chain.  We utilise practical research and development, and have strength in delivering that in a commercially applicable manner in real time, thereby delivering sustainable food solutions in response to consumer demand for safe and nutritious food.  Ireland has been at the forefront of this for years.  We believe in a science-based approach to developing sustainable solutions for the agriculture and food industries.  Through our strategy, One Health: from Soil to Society, we look at how we can positively influence human health and the environment through the provision of high quality, nutritious solutions. <br/><br/>Devenish was established in 1952 and acquired by the current management in 1997.  We have grown the business over the years from 23 employees to 500.  We have a proactive approach to human health and sustainability.  We are particularly focused on improving human health throughout the food chain and have achieved this through collaborative R&amp;amp;D delivering innovative solutions. <br/><br/>This was evidenced in our omega-3 work, delivered in collaboration with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which has proven that the regular consumption of naturally enriched omega-3 chicken and eggs can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, dementia and depression.  That was proactive health research in these days of reactive health solutions.<br/><br/>Devenish places sustainability at the heart of our business and is focused on creating products and services that help reduce the agriculture sector&rsquo;s impact on the environment.  Through collaboration, research and development we can deliver proactive, positive solutions.  We believe a collective effort is required.  Supplementing our manufacturing facilities across the globe, we have invested in a range of performance houses that deliver commercially applicable research to the market in a timely manner. <br/><br/>Every year, we make a significant investment in R&amp;amp;D, and it is the basis of our commercial application.  It has developed solutions to the challenges faced by industry today and tomorrow.  We have a team of more than 40 PhDs and experts developing products and we regularly collaborate with universities and external centres of excellence, including Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, University College Dublin, UCD, Harper Adams University, Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research, Agri-Food and Biosciences, AFBI, and Teagasc. <br/><br/>In 2013, we established our global innovation centre at Dowth.  It is now an internationally recognised research farm dedicated to developing sustainable agricultural solutions and promoting human health through nutrition.  It acts as a platform for public engagement and has been designated aninternational lighthouse farm, one of only 12 across four continents, that is leading the way in sustainable food production, by Wageningen in the Netherlands.  <br/><br/>Our research farm at Dowth has been a platform for unique collaborations and we believe such collaborations are the future for agriculture in Ireland.  We have collaborated with partners such as Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and academic partners such as Wageningen, UCD, Queen&rsquo;s and AFBI.  We have used it to showcase the research we are doing on climate smart farming, biodiversity, economics, and human health to farmers and industry groups.</p><p>We have formed wider collaborations to explore solutions to climate change, including partnering with Gas Networks Ireland, KPMG and Teagasc on Project Clover.  We also recently signed a unique collaborative research initiative on climate action with the team at Teagasc, led by Professor Frank O&rsquo;Mara.  We have also used the platform to engage with the Government and recently hosted a joint ministerial visit with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, and the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots, alongside the Ulster Farmers' Union and the IFA.</p><p> Our research and development focus areas and on-farm innovations include carbon neutrality and annual whole-farm carbon balance sheets; managed soil improvement; water quality; silvopasture trials; and the benefits of multispecies grazing swards, such as increased biodiversity, soil health, water retention, animal performance and carbon sequestration, in addition to reduced fertilizer, parasitic burden and veterinary interventions.  These are all focused on driving farm profitability, while delivering for the environment.</p><p> The growing environmental challenges facing food producers require a collective effort.  We believe that we need to work together in new and unique collaborative networks, involving public, private and research organisations taking a research-led approach to assist farmers in making the necessary changes required to meet the climate challenge head-on.  Carbon sequestration and storage in agriculture has the potential to give Ireland&rsquo;s food and farming sector a significant competitive advantage in the global market, while delivering sustainable solutions. </p></speech>

I have had the privilege to be on the multispecies swards at Devenish lands in Dowth twice.  On both occasions, I acquired more information and knowledge.  Great credit is due to the research that is being conducted on the Dowth farm.  On grass measurement, has Devenish done any research on the number of kilograms of dry matter produced on the multispecies sward on a monthly basis?  There is a view that clover-based swards will not produce in March and October.  Does Devenish have monthly measurements of what is produced on the multispecies swards?</p> <p>  My second question is on the persistence of the sward.  What is the lifetime of it?  If it has to be resown, what effect will that have on the emissions scale?  If it has be resown far more frequently than a rye grass sward, does it have to ploughed or can it be direct drilled?  Has Devenish any plans to do research on multispecies swards on dairy farms to see how they would work in a very intensive grazing system?  The last time I was at Dowth, I thought about the rotation length that would be needed for multispecies swards.  Where is the research on that?</p></speech>

We have the largest multispecies grazing platform in Europe and have done research on an ongoing basis throughout the growing season.  That research included the use of live animals and live animal performance.  Not only have we measured that, we have also measured the performance of the animals.  I will defer to Mr. Hagan, who will give the Chairman the background specifically on measurement.  We will then talk about persistence, which Dr. Gilliland may speak about.  I will then speak about dairy farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#S00400"><p>On grass measurement, we have found that after two seasons of grazing in Dowth the multispecies sward will outyield the rye grass control by approximately 2 tonnes to 2.5 tonnes.  A multispecies sward is a composite of different species, including rye grasses, clovers and herbs.  The grass and herbs will grow in the spring.  We still use fertiliser on the multispecies swards; 170 kg on the swards instead of 170 kg on the rye grass.  By using nitrogen at the start of the season when the legumes are not growing as strongly, we encourage grass and herbs to grow.  They fill the period when the legumes are not yet growing as strongly.  The second aspect is that when we are closing our swards in the winter, we close them at a higher cover so there is more growth in the spring.  It is a slightly different management technique than that associated with perennial rye grass.  It is managed a little differently to overcome the differences in the sward.  That is one base.  We are measuring this on a monthly basis.</p> <p>  On the composition of the sward, Jane Shackleton, our PhD student who is working on this, does botanical surveys every month.  In the two and a half years that the multispecies sward has been growing, we are seeing a slight change in its composition, but its functionality in terms of growth rate and the performance of the animals is getting better.  We are not one bit worried about the changing of the composition of the sward.</p> <p>  On the issue of persistency, if we look at present management techniques for perennial rye grass, we see a five- to seven-year timeframe for reseeding it.  We see that multispecies swards would at least match that.  We are trying out different management techniques in Dowth, as we discussed with the Chairman when he was there, to prolong the persistency of that sward.  We are halfway through that and, at present, we do not see any reason the persistency will not be at least as good as perennial rye grass, if not better. </p></speech>

The multispecies sward will probably be a little less, but not much, probably in the 20 kg to 25 kg range.  That is per day.</p></speech>

We measure the herbage levels on a weekly basis.  We have very robust data that we can share with the committee, which our PhD student, Jane Shackleton, has led.  It is very comprehensive.  We find that even though the multispecies sward is slower to start in the spring, especially the legumes, we are seeing better livestock performance.  When we let out our heifers in March, their live weight gain is higher from the multispecies swards then from rye grass, even though we know the legumes are slower to kick in.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about reseeding.  Our multispecies swards were all established by discing.  We deliberately did not plough because we are a UNESCO world heritage site.  We were encouraged not to plough for fear of damaging the heritage we have, but we still got a very good establishment.  Running alongside our big grazing trials, we have small trials that we cut.  In those trials we looked at three different establishment methods, including the equivalent of plough-till, direct seeding on top and shallow cultivation through discing.  We saw that we had good establishment right across those methods, but the one benefit we got from direct seeding was far fewer weeds once the crop came through.  Ploughing actually brought a new crop of annual weeds up.</p><p>For us, we actually got a win.  There were fewer weeds and less disturbance to the carbon.  We are expecting that we would replant the multispecies swards at about the same time one would plant perennial ryegrass.  The sward is a dynamic thing and the diversity of the sward does change.  As the sward changes, the residue left is a ryegrass sward with a lot of clover in it.  It actually leaves us with what most farmers would have anyway.  The key point is when do we make the decision to go back and put more of the herbs back in again.  We have not got there yet.  We expect that we will get there.  We have done two full grazing seasons.  Key to this is the measurement of the quantity of herbage on a weekly basis.  The lambs are weighed every two weeks and the heifers are weighed once a month.</p></speech>

We must apply our research commercially.  The research must be commercially applicable.  We must be able to get that onto our customers' farms.  This is what we have done.  We have quite a few dairy farms that have integrated a number of paddocks into their rotation of a multispecies.  I am aware of quite a few, but there is one very progressive young supplier in the west who has had his multispecies sward in for the past year.  It has integrated perfectly into a system.  He did not see any challenges or issues with bloat.  His performance this year has been very good.  It is one year, but a number of customers have applied it.  While it might not look as attractive as perennial ryegrass, maybe it is just that we are not used to looking at.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021111700002#T00400"><p>In the summer, we are talking about a rotation length of 30 days.  With that 30 days we would start grazing covers of 2,000 kg or 2,200 kg dry matter per hectare, and then we would graze down to 6 cm.  We would have a different management technique on this compared to the perennial ryegrass.</p></speech>

With the predicted price for fertiliser this spring, there are a lot of people looking at multispecies swards to try to reduce what will be significant cost.  As people start to explore this, we would encourage them to take one particular grouping of animals on the farm and designate them to a multispecies area, and do rotational grass within the multispecies.  When chopping and changing one does not get the full animal performance.  We have had extraordinary animal performance off the multispecies, but we have not chopped and changed.  When an animal is designated multispecies, it stays on it.  We have found that where an animal stays on multispecies it absolutely thrives.  In a dairy situation when wanting to bring on in-calf heifers and getting them into calf, that is certainly a very good place to start.  We would never foresee that 100% of a grazing platform would be multispecies but we feel that it has a huge role to play.  It is particularly good in that regard.  That is how we would encourage people to go in first.  We would say put it on and see how it works but do not chop and change the whole time.  Take one group of animals and keep them on that platform.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of visiting the farm and I compliment them on the great work they are doing.  Mr. Kennedy almost answered my first question.  I must phrase this properly and I ask that the witnesses do not get me wrong.  What Devenish is doing up there, with the backing of a multinational or as part of a multinational, is being done in somewhat laboratory conditions, for want of a better phrase.  The representatives spoke of the other people and their customers who are integrating the same system.  Has Devenish seen much in the performance or the results from the standard average family working farm as opposed to the places where Devenish would have done more research?  Whereas the farmer was using the system to farm to make a profit, Devenish was using it as part of research.  Please do not get me wrong, but has Devenish noticed much difference in the productivity or the outcome from the day to day?  How many people following the system are in a real working situation as opposed to the research model?</p> <p>  Devenish is a multinational and is all over the world.  I presume it is doing similar types of work, depending on the climate, the soil and the geographical constraints of different countries around the world.  How does Ireland compare with what is happening elsewhere when it comes to all of this research?</p> <p>  The Department, Teagasc, and the representatives from Devenish have been in to the committee today.  The answer to nearly every question is "We are working on it or we researching that at the moment".  In simple terms, when are we going to start getting results of all the research everybody is doing that can be implemented into policy, to give us definitive readings on output and sequestration from a farming model so we can try to get a net-zero emissions?  Teagasc is doing its signpost programme farms.  At one stage we were told that some of the readings in soils are more than twice that predicted by the model they had based it on.  When are we going to get to definitive figures, models or crossbars, for want of a better word, that we can all work towards?  I understand that research will always be ongoing to develop things, but we seem to be researching a lot and there are a lot of conflicting answers and results coming out of the research.  When we get to a place where we can have a model to use in trying to get to net-zero emissions, and which will be acceptable by scientists who might not be as pro-agriculture as we all might be?</p></speech>

Like every marathon, however, we need to start.  As was referred to earlier, the end line is that by 2050 food will have to be produced sustainably because we will have a zero-carbon world.  That is as I see it and nobody can argue with that.  We must produce food sustainably.  I firmly believe that in Ireland we have all the tools required to lead the world on this.  I am absolutely convinced of that.  As I said, it will take unique and collaborative initiatives.  This means people working together but in different ways.  This is why we were very excited about the work with Teagasc.  We have the knowledge to start this journey.  We know the direction of travel.  Multispecies provides a part of this.  As we heard in some of the submissions earlier, it is very important that the first thing we must do is baseline every farm.  We must first see where we are before we go anywhere else.  We need to do that. That would put us in a very strong position because then we are at the start of the race and each farmer would have the potential to go from there.  That will take the industry coming together.  As I have said to various people, we should collaborate to accentuate what we have.  We tend to divide and diminish.  I call on all participants, whether it is the committee, the Department, Teagasc, or the Devenishs or Carberys or UCDs of this world, we have the potential to lead the world.  We have worked throughout the world and the reason we have been successful,and grown is the reputation of the UK and the island of Ireland in agriculture.  When we step into any other country and say that we are from this island it gives us a huge advantage because people look to Ireland to see the success in agriculture.  That was always the door opener for us.</p><p>We have that potential.  We also have the danger, and there is a big danger, that we will be left behind if we do not decide we are taking this road.  For me, it is not just the research bodies, the Government and the Department, it is also the financial institutions.  Environmental, social and governance, ESG, is a huge driver in this and the financial institutions must and should encourage this.  Every link in this supply chain must put its shoulder to the wheel.  This will happen in that the demands and expectations have been set, but it will be how quickly we, as a country and industry, decide to step into this challenge.  I absolutely believe that we are perfectly placed.  We must open our minds.  We must look at it as what is the art of the possible, and we believe the art of the possible is in front of us.  Baseline farms start the journey.  Give farmers direction and use the research and data we have. </p><p> Some of the people who have contributed to this meeting have shown the phenomenal knowledge and expertise we have in this industry, so we should use that.  That is the baseline and we start from there.  One then asks what direction we should travel in and how to answer all the challenges, because with every challenge there is an opportunity, including work around peatlands and work around biodiversity opportunity.  Today we are talking about sequestration, and Professor O'Connor previously spoke about the opportunity and necessity to deliver on biodiversity and water quality.  All these things can be met, I believe, as we look into this industry.  We have seen it from around the world.  We have seen where we stand on a global basis, but it is now a case of saying not what we cannot do but what we will do.</p></speech>

On sequestration rates and when we will have a scheme, it is fair to say that for the past 15 years the majority of public research went into measuring emissions, not measuring carbon sequestration.  It is only in the past 18 months that this has become a public priority.  When we bought Dowth in 2013, we saw a clear knowledge gap in respect of carbon stocks on-farm and the role that ruminant animals have in increasing carbon on a farm.  The first thing we did in 2014 was start our base-lining.  It was the first farm in the world to do aerial LiDAR surveys to measure every tree and hedge on the farm.  In 2017, we measured our soil carbon as forensically as well.  We have just revisited our LiDAR survey, but we have not done the compare and contrast yet.  We will repeat the soils next year.</p> <p>  One of things we saw very quickly is that there are several really helpful things farmers can do to accelerate their carbon sequestration.  We cannot tell exactly whether it is by 0.5 tonne or 0.8 tonne of carbon per hectare per year, but we can tell that it is improving and we will know better what it is.  We are focusing on three key areas in sequestration and increasing carbon storage in swards.  One is whether we can correct soil pH values in a mineral soil.  The Food Vision 2030 document calls out the fact that only 18% of soils in Ireland are adoptable fertility, in which low pH is the biggest problem.  We know that soil carbon is never permanent.  It is cyclic and it sits within the soil biology.  Soil biology churns better and locks up more carbon if it is more at an optimal pH in a mineral soil, at around 6.5.  When we bought Dowth it was sitting at 5.4.  Our first six years were to correct that deficiency, and we have improved it.</p></speech>

We have a policy of measuring our soil fertility every two years.  We do it with GPS and we go back to the same spots.

In our last lime application we took it one step further.  As we do our soil sampling with GPS, we can build up soil pH maps and we can put in that data.  The last time we spread lime, and the contractor who spread it for us has a variable rate lime spreader, we were able to put lime on where it was needed and not put it on where it was not needed.  That is why we are passionate about switching over to the digitilisation of the landscape.  It means using the right inputs where they are needed and not wasting them.  We also need to be careful.  We do not want to put large quantities of lime on highly organic soils and release carbon.<br/><br/>The second area we have looked at is multispecies.  Anecdotally, our evidence is showing that already there appears to be an improvement in soil carbon.  However, as Dr. Lanigan said in the previous session, measuring change in soil carbon is a slow process.  It is really a five-year window.  The initial results we are getting after year one and year two are looking positive, but we would prefer to tell the committee the result after year five.  It is not that we want to delay it but that if we want to get cast iron figures, we must give it a chance.  As we turn this supertanker we know there are certain things that will increase carbon.<br/><br/>As well as improving pH in mineral soils and multispecies swards, we are looking at silvopasture, which is putting trees, swards and animals together.  That is alien to 99% of farmers, but one must look at the data.  The longest trial in silvopasture in the European Union sits in Loughgall, County Armagh.  There are more than 30 years of data on that.  The carbon sequestration there has been trebled while still maintaining animal output.<br/><br/>In the case of economics, at the end of year one we had a 180% increase of profitability on the multispecies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the perennial ryegrass.  We are just finishing year two and we are seeing nothing in that journey to say it is any different.  We have reduced the greenhouse gas intensity per kilogram of beef and lamb by 26% in one year just by switching from the perennial ryegrass to the multispecies, dropping the nitrogen by 65% and improving average daily live weight gain.  That is quite stunning.<br/><br/>Finally, on the international side, as an island we export 80% of what we produce.  When we went on this journey we did not just partner with Teagasc and UCD.  We went to the Netherlands and partnered with the world's leading university in agriculture and environment, Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research.  The reason we did that is we wanted our science to be credible in the eyes of the international consumer who buys our product.  It is very important when we go on this journey that our international consumers see our journey as credible.  That is why we reached out to Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research as well as Teagasc and UCD.  We believe that as a global company we must be credible in the eyes of the global consumer.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on one area as I am conscious of the time.  It is the point I raised with the other two sets of witnesses.  Mr. Kennedy spoke about what Devenish has been doing with regard to measuring all the hedgerows and trees and quantifying the soil in respect of carbon storage.  My first question is to clarify a point that was made.  Is it correct that Devenish cannot yet tell or does not have a way of measuring the improvement of carbon storage within soils from one year to another or from one time period to another?</p></speech>

Our plan is to go back every five years.  That is no different from the plan of Teagasc.  We are just fortunate to have had the foresight to do it quite early.  The process is exactly the same.  All soil research groups are trying to find a magic digital wand that can be stuck in the ground and will tell one what the latest carbon is.  That has not been found yet.  LiDAR has been extraordinary for above-ground carbon but we do not yet have an equivalent digital tool for under the ground, so it is still rather laborious.  One has to go out and sample the soil.</p></speech>

What we have done in the first five years is to take a tier 2 sequestration factor from peer-reviewed published paper.  The chief agricultural inspector mentioned tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3.  Our ambition is to get to tier 3, which is exact measurements for exact farms.  As a farmer, I want to know what my carbon is and whether I am improving it or reducing it.  I do not like being made a pariah.  Our industry is being made a pariah by the media, who are saying we are the worst in the world.  However, our carbon stocks are significant.  We are custodians of the nation's carbon.  We are not the monsters we are being made out to be.   We in Devinish want to prove that ruminant farmers have a future and a significant role in maintaining and enhancing the amount of carbon while still producing nutritious food.  That has been at the core of our research at Dowth and beyond.</p></speech>

I refer to what I am trying to determine in the first instance.  Is it possible?  Absolutely, it is possible.  If you can do it on one farm, you can do it on all farms.  Is it practically possible and feasible to do it at such a cost that it can be carried out throughout the country?  That would be a game changer.  I agree with Dr. Gilliland because it is not just about the sector.  Agriculture is like every other sector - there are good players and bad players and those in between.  If we could get to a point whereby every farm had an audit of what is happening here and now, and knew that if they were in a position to improve those figures in terms of improving sequestration and lowering emissions, that would be of benefit not only to society - all farmers want to contribute to society - but, crucially, to farmers in terms of being able to trade carbon and be rewarded through schemes or whatever other measures are put in place, as well as being able to use it as a promotional tool for their product.  Across an array of areas, this could be a game changer that flips the entire environmental debate on its head.</p> <p>  I will finish this point and then let our guests reply.  Devinish is a company, so I am sure euro signs are flashing in our guests' heads while we are talking about this.  What would need to happen in a collaboration, as they have suggested?  Obviously, there would be a need for the private sector but it would need to be driven by the Department if this were to actually happen and every single farm provided with this type of an audit.  What steps would need to be put in place by our previous guests, namely, the Department and Teagasc, in order for that to happen?</p></speech>

We have invested a significant amount of money in this research because we believe this is the future of farming and food.  As I stated, there is no other game in town in the context of 2050.  Ireland is a food-producing island.  Senator Paul Daly stated that we are a multinational.  I am a small farmer - maybe not that small - but I am from a small farm in Sligo in the west where I live.  I do not see myself or us as being part of a multinational.  We are a company that is trying to build a business but the fundamental of that business is that there is a food supply chain.  As I stated, Ireland has been fundamental to our reputation in growing throughout the world.  We believe that Ireland was a leader in nutrition when we stepped off the island and it now needs to be a leader in sustainability.  I absolutely believe we can do that.  We can and we should get a baseline for farms by gathering the information using the best available technology we have at our fingertips to find out where we are.</p></speech>

We would suddenly differentiate ourselves and advance.  There are gains for farming, farmers, the food industry and the island.  For us, that is where we see the potential.

Dr. Gilliland spoke about the media.  He has a vision that agriculture in Ireland can sequester an awful lot more carbon while keeping the stock we have, and perhaps even having more.  He is putting that out there as basically a new way of going forward, compared to all the other stuff we hear out there.  How long does he believe it will take to attain this?</p></speech>

That being done will make it possible, for the first time, to get a true inventory at an individual farm business level of what carbon is on what farm.  That has never been done before.  When that is done, the result will be some extraordinary figures.  In soil, it can be anything from 50 tonnes to 300 tonnes per hectare.  It depends on whether the soil is mineral or organic.</p> <p>  One thing learned from doing that will be that an awful lot of carbon is sitting out on farms and farmers do not get credit for that.  We believe there is a need to bring that point to light.  What all farmers do is manage the nation's carbon, but that is not recognised now.  We ask farmers to produce good quality food and we reward them for doing that.  We are now asking them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to increase their carbon stocks.  That is not recognised now.  We must get to a policy and regulatory system, through some kind of public-private partnership, that allows us to determine the carbon content and, in the case of peat soils, to reduce what we lose, and with mineral soils, to determine how we can get more storage.  It must also include hedges and trees.  Could we, for example, have a campaign to remove electric fences and to put hedges back again?  It would involve looking at practical ways that are very visible and that will also deliver for biodiversity.  There is a collection of things.  We must, though, turn the dial on the narrative from one suggesting that farmers are the worst in the world and pariahs in this regard to one showing them as being the custodians of the nation's carbon.  The question is what we can do to get them to store more carbon.</p></speech>

When making silage out of multispecies swards, because the dry matter is lower in the herbs in the sward, it is necessary to just allow it to wilt that bit longer.  The standard wilt time would be anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours.  In this case, we recommend at least 30 hours, if not 36 hours, of wilting time to get the dry matter up as best as is possible.</p></speech>

Is it the case here that other plant species in the sward are eliminating that problem?  The aspect I am concerned with is the length of life of it in this regard.  In addition, does it accept lime in the same way as the ordinary grass that we grow now?</p></speech>

In our experiment, animals were assigned to their swards at the start and they were on it for their lifetimes.  Therefore, they are not changing their diet.  Bloat happens in animals when they go onto clover-rich swards after they have perhaps been on a bare sward.  Animals eating multispecies sward all the time do not suffer from that effect.  The other point in this regard is that there are standard management techniques that can get over this problem as well, such as using bloat oils and ensuring that hungry cattle are not put on the swards, etc.  We can manage the problem in that way.  As Dr. Gilliland said earlier, we recommend that groups be put on multispecies sward and be kept there, or at least have them there for some length of time.</p> <p>  Turning to the subject of lime-----</p></speech>

We were overrun with all the questions thrown at the departmental officials earlier regarding what was being done in this regard.  We will, with the good graces of the witnesses, be calling on their research in future as we try to formulate policy here.  As the witnesses articulated well, this area was neglected.  Representatives from Teagasc have admitted that it is not where it should be regarding technology in this area.</p> <p>  I am sorry we must adjourn, because we would have liked to have devoted more time to talking to the witnesses.  With their permission, however, we will use their resources in future.  This area is evolving at a fast rate.  We must be able to show that we are the most sustainable producers of food in the world and it will only be possible to do that with the benefit of their research.  We must modify our practices to reduce our emissions.  I thank the witnesses on behalf of the committee.</p></speech>

In line with the exceptional circumstances, we are taking measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and will notice that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge them not to move any chair from its current position.  Attendees should maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this matter.  Any member participating  remotely is required to do so from within the Leinster House complex.  We have received no apologies from members.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meetings is to discuss the impact of the withdrawal of incentives from enterprise.  The committee is mindful of the range of incentives put in place over the past 18 months or so relating to the Covid-19 pandemic.  These incentives have been instrumental in keeping many businesses operating during the pandemic with the prospect that they could recover following it.  Budget 2022 contained a number of measures that involve the setting or altering of expiry dates for incentives to tie in with the lifting of most of the pandemic-related restrictions.  However, the termination of these incentives will be a cause of concern for many businesses.</p> <p>  To discuss this issue with the committee, I welcome, from ISME, Mr. Neil McDonnell, who joins remotely, and from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Declan Hughes, who is in the chamber.</p> <p>  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative witnesses comply with any such directions.</p> <p>  The opening statements from ISME and the Department have been circulated to members.  To commence consideration of our matter, I invite Mr. McDonnell to make opening remarks on behalf of ISME.</p></speech>

I had indicated I would attend but I would be afraid I would pass on something nasty.  ISME thanks members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the impact of changes to Covid-19 and other incentives for business.</p> <p>  We wish to state how helpful the main employment supports have been in preserving the relationship between employer and employee during the pandemic.  Despite the size of the schemes, we understand abuse of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to have been relatively small.  However, we are aware of reported cases of abuse of PUP by a small number of employers paying workers for services on a cash basis when those workers were availing of PUP.</p> <p>  The commercial rates waiver and the warehousing of VAT and PAYE liabilities, which are not normally counted among the enterprise supports, have also provided a substantial boost to the liquidity of businesses which are starved of turnover.  We are aware of some members who have already started to discharge their liability as trading improves rather than leaving reconciliation out to the start of 2023.  The local authority restart grant, restart plus grant and small business assistance scheme for Covid were well received and highly successful in assisting businesses which remained closed.  After a poor start, the credit guarantee scheme has now made approvals of around &euro;500 million or 25% of the funds available.  The future growth loan scheme, which provides longer dated debt, has proven far more successful and been oversubscribed.  We are glad to see a revised version of this on offer.</p> <p>  We see some problems on the horizon as we exit the pandemic.  In terms of recruitment, general operatives for production seem to be very hard to recruit.  One member reports no applicants for two months.  They would previously have been processing approximately 20 applications per month.  Businesses are looking for guidance on recruiting directly from abroad.  We have directed them to the EU recruitment portal and are looking into other routes.  This has always been an issue for employers such as nursing homes, in particular.</p> <p>  Engineers are proving very difficult to recruit.  Employers are looking for guidance on the visa process for recruitment of persons from outside the EU, including processing times, appeal processes and so on.  It is likely that employers will press for more occupations to be taken off the ineligible occupations list.  Queries to date have been on issues including sourcing welders and metal workers, who are currently ineligible for visas.</p> <p>  There are ongoing issues with workers in the night-time economy, who remain concerned at the possibility of further lockdowns or restrictions.  Of course, this submission was sent to the committee before the restrictions announced by the Taoiseach, so this problem is likely to exacerbate.</p> <p>  Recruitment difficulties appear to be a widespread phenomenon in Europe and the US.  We believe it is a multifactor problem.  Factors include a general reluctance to return to workplace settings during the pandemic; a liquidity-induced consumer spending boom that has stretched supply chains everywhere; Brexit-induced administration that has increased back-office demands in import and export; improving economic prospects in eastern Europe that are attracting their emigrants, who have been a traditional source of labour here, home and driving wage growth in those economies; significant amounts of state and private sector capital expenditures drawing human resources; and the cost and scarcity of accommodation making even highly paid employment in Ireland, especially in the cities, more unattractive.</p> <p>  From a return to work perspective, some employers are reporting employees who are reluctant to return to a workplace setting.</p><p>In other cases, employees want to return to work but offices are not yet properly set up to accommodate them from a health and safety point of view.  We are also getting a lot of queries on the redundancy process, fair selection criteria, standard redundancy templates, levels of redundancy payments and so on.  We see this as indicative of the scarring effects of the pandemic which are going to hit us after Christmas.</p><p> We are also receiving queries on changing terms and conditions of employment to reflect reduced working hours or working from home.  We have ongoing reports of difficulties with unvaccinated workers and issues around the redesigning of work, objections from colleagues and so on.  Substantial numbers of personnel working from home on a semi-permanent basis will have implications for employers&rsquo; liability insurance and for capital expenditure where companies need to purchase laptops instead of desktops and to adequately equip employees for a working from home environment.</p><p> While we are grateful to the Oireachtas for the speedy enactment of the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021, it has yet to be commenced.  Since we are likely to see a significant number of SMEs becoming insolvent post pandemic in the first quarter of 2022, we would like to see the Act commenced as soon as possible.</p><p> Although this is slightly off-topic, I must register our concern at the rapid rate of inflation in wage and input costs, most especially energy costs.  This input inflation is running at rates not seen for more than a decade and will have to be passed on by SMEs to the end customer or to business.  It is also clear that insurance reform has stalled or, indeed, regressed.  The ink is barely dry on the revised awards levels set by the personal injuries guidance committee of the Judicial Council in March but they are already being ignored by some members of the Judiciary.  Thus, despite the fact that awards levels in the round are seen to be declining, employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance are increasingly difficult to secure and, in some sectors, quotations are not being provided for certain activities.  These sectors typically include businesses involving physical or sporting activity, especially for children.  The liability attached to operators is effectively strict liability and underwriters do not see them as an insurable risk at any price.  We can no longer kick the can of insurance reform down the road and this must be an area of urgent focus for 2022.</p></speech>

As we have discussed previously with the committee, the pandemic has represented a dramatic and unprecedented social and economic shock for Ireland and has required an immediate and swift response to help impacted businesses and workers.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has played, and continues to play, an integral role in the whole-of-government response to these generational challenges.</p> <p>  I will talk about Covid-19 specifically first.  The financial assistance provided to businesses and workers affected by the pandemic through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments is unprecedented, as the committee is aware.  We have worked closely with business representatives and worker stakeholders throughout the course of the pandemic to ensure that we have had the right range of advisory and funding initiatives at the right time and that these have been targeted and impactful.  </p> <p>  We continue to see strong take-up of the range of Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment-backed schemes available to businesses through the Department, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Microfinance Ireland, the credit guarantee scheme and our various agencies.  Many of these were approved as part of the EU temporary aid framework for Covid, which we worked on with the Commission in the early part of last year.  We expect that temporary aid framework to be extended into next year.  We stand ready to extend the various schemes should that be confirmed by the Commission.</p> <p>  I will recall some of the measures that have been introduced.  Mr. McDonnell of ISME has referred to some of them.  Some &euro;633 million was administered for us by the local authorities.  This was in the form of restart grants to almost 109,000 applicants and was a significant fillip to businesses last year.  There was &euro;200 million in grants and loans under an Enterprise Ireland-Industrial Development Authority strategic enterprise fund.  This is helping 1,600 businesses that are significant employers providing somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 jobs right across the country.  These businesses will also have received supports.  Some &euro;20 million has been allocated to 5,500 businesses under the small business assistance scheme for Covid.  As Mr. McDonnell mentioned, more than &euro;550 million has so far been sanctioned and drawn down by 8,000 businesses under the Government&rsquo;s credit guarantee scheme.  As I mentioned, we envisage this being extended into next year should we get approval from the Commission.  Under the future growth loan scheme, &euro;733 million has been allocated so far.  This is long-term low-cost funding for businesses.  Microfinance Ireland continues to work with businesses that cannot get access to finance from the banks.  It has approved almost &euro;34 million for 1,500 businesses.</p> <p>  In addition, the local enterprise offices were very quick off the mark, as members will recall, in working with businesses right across the country.  They have awarded over 17,000 trading online vouchers to a value of nearly &euro;40 million to businesses to help them to pivot, to change their business models and to respond.  They have also provided &euro;25 million in business continuity vouchers.  These are vouchers worth &euro;2,500 to &euro;5,000 to help businesses to reposition themselves.  They have been very successful.  In addition, we have worked with a range of businesses in the sectors that were specifically impacted, such as the retail sector.  More than 500 online retail awards of up to &euro;40,000 have been allocated to such businesses to help them to introduce new services and maintain employment, which is the key objective.</p> <p>  Throughout the pandemic, we have seen enterprise innovation right across the enterprise base in terms of changing business models and maintaining employment.  I will highlight the Covid products scheme in particular.  More than 15 projects were supported with funding to the value of &euro;16.8 million to develop Covid-related products and services.  An additional &euro;100 million was allocated to the Department under budget 2022 for once-off funding for businesses impacted by Covid-19.  This will maintain many of the schemes I have just mentioned.</p> <p>  For many businesses, budget 2022 provided clarity and certainty on the range of schemes and funding assistance which is to continue across government.  It is worth recalling that, to date, over &euro;17.5 billion has been provided to individuals and businesses through the PUP, the EWSS and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  I will recall some of those schemes, which were administered by other Departments and by Revenue.</p> <p>  The number of employees on the EWSS is steadily reducing as the economy reopens.  This figure is down from 345,000 in June to 288,400 last month.  Significant numbers of employees are still benefiting from the EWSS as businesses return to full capacity and as markets recover.  Over 40% of those on the EWSS are in the accommodation and food services sectors while some 9% are in wholesale and retail - a sector we work very closely with - and 6% are in transport.</p> <p>  CRSS, which was the successor to the restart scheme we initiated last year, has benefited more than 25,500 business premises with funding to the value of &euro;700 million.  The latest figures from Revenue indicate that approximately 110 businesses remain on that scheme.</p> <p>  The business resumption support scheme, BRSS, was launched in September.  To date, over 1,400 businesses have been approved for the scheme through Revenue with approved funding totalling &euro;5.2 million.  Approximately one third of these beneficiaries are wet pubs while another 26% are bars, restaurants and hotels.  Over 55% of BRSS applicants to date have been businesses in the accommodation and pubs sector.  That scheme is open for new applicants until the end of the year.</p> <p>  I will also mention the debt warehousing facilities Revenue has made available.  Over 98,000 businesses have benefited from this facility.  While the number of PUP claimants continues to reduce, it is worth recalling that the self-employed still have the option to earn up to &euro;960 over a period of eight weeks.  The &euro;1,000 enterprise support grant is also still available for businesses, even if they claimed it last year.</p> <p>  Mr. McDonnell mentioned the small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP.  We are in the process of completing the preparatory work with a view to commencing the Act at the end of November.  That is still very much on track, should it be needed in the first or second quarter of next year as some of these measures are unwound.</p> <p>  I will now cover some of the broader supports available and reiterate that we are dealing with a number of elements in respect of Covid and the challenges we face in terms of Brexit and in preparing for big future challenges.</p><p>The Department's budget for next year is &euro;898 million, which is an increase of 13% or &euro;103 million on our 2021 core allocation.</p><p> Brexit will remain a key focus over the coming weeks and months.  As we discussed with the committee, we have just launched the Brexit impact loan scheme to a value of &euro;330 million.  We will have funding from that for next year.  We will also be funding a &euro;70 million capital investment scheme for the agricultural sector.</p><p> On digitalisation, climate and the circular economy, we will be launching a number of new schemes next year.  We will have an extra &euro;10 million for digital industries and &euro;10 million for climate industries.  That money will be rolled out.  I am happy to talk about those transition schemes later in the meeting.</p><p> We have also increased the funding for the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  An additional &euro;26.5 million will be available to the IDA and there will also be additional funding for Enterprise Ireland across a range of areas, including regional development.  There will also be an additional &euro;2 million for the local enterprise offices.  Additional funding will be available for InterTradeIreland to support cross-Border trade and collaboration, in addition to significant additional funding for innovation.  Committee members will be aware of the &euro;90 million enterprise innovation fund, which we will be launching with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the European Investment Fund in the early part of next year.</p><p> There is more detail in the Department's submissions to the committee, but that is a quick overview of how we will maintain the existing supports and measures in response to Covid-19 and how we will keep focus on the challenges of Brexit, digitalisation and climate.  Remote working is also referred to in the paper.  We are focused on building capacity around the country.  Some of the fiscal measures in that regard are very supportive.  We will continue to engage with stakeholders and the committee on ensuring we have the right measures available at the right time.</p></speech>

Following yesterday's announcement, could Mr. Hughes advise what consideration the Department is giving to further supports for the hospitality sector?  I appreciate that both gentlemen outlined the supports that have been available over the past 18 months.  Those supports have been welcome but there are anomalies and issues in that area.  I am on the ground and have a fair bit of experience of the sector.</p> <p>  Under the current criteria, someone who took a restart grant was ineligible for further supports under the CRSS.  Many businesses impacted by yesterday's announcement will have received restart grants but are now being closed once more.  One of the issues for the hospitality sector is that it is losing experienced and qualified staff.  That is the biggest fear.  I was talking to business owners this morning and their biggest fear is that if further restrictions and measures are imposed, irreplaceable staff will leave the sector.  Qualified and experienced staff will not continue to work in this industry with such uncertainty.  The restoration of certain PUP rates needs to be looked at.  Yesterday's announcement has put a totally different perspective on the hospitality sector.  It is totally unacceptable for senior Ministers to be encouraging people to leave the hospitality sector and get another job.  I will be making that point again later.  It is not good enough.  Is the Department examining these issues?  Is there a change in mindset after yesterday's announcement?  I will wait for Mr. Hughes to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  Yesterday's announcement came very quickly on the back of advice and modelling from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, the previous day and discussions at Cabinet.  One of the features of recent months has been that the hospitality sector has recovered to some extent and we have seen an increase in employment and consumer spending on overnight accommodation and in the hospitality sector.  Credit is due to the sector for all the measures that were taken to implement Covid passes and check identification, etc.  We have been very involved with the sector in that regard through the work of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and that work continues.  However, I take the Senator's point about qualified staff.  There have seen staff shortages.  We are working with the sector through the work permit system, which is administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>  The supports and various measures which are available through the Department will continue.  Once we get temporary framework clearance from the European Commission, it is our intention to extend those supports and make them available.  There has been quite strong take-up from the accommodation and hospitality sectors.  We know those supports are attractive to those sectors.</p> <p>  The most recent advice we have from Revenue is from 21 or 22 October.  It has not yet updated its advice on the CRSS and we will wait and see what the outcome of that will be.  It is clear that businesses must be considered significantly restricted from operating for the purposes of the CRSS from 22 October onwards.  Yesterday's measures will have an impact on businesses and I am sure that is something Revenue will be considering.</p> <p>  While many businesses may have gained from the restart grant and come off the CRSS, others have yet to do that.  They may want to engage directly with Revenue about their own particular circumstances.  Revenue has supports available, including the EWSS, which is being extended to next year and will be available to businesses.  Our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media are working directly with the representative bodies across the sector.  Many of these venues provide outlets and employment opportunities, particularly for the live entertainment sector.  The live entertainment sector and night-time economy may be particularly impacted by the new restrictions.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, had &euro;50 million for a range of schemes this year and will have an additional &euro;25 million for next year.  I understand that was announced in budget 2022.  I am sure we will be working with our colleagues in that Department on the range of measures which might be needed or rolled out.</p> <p>  The key thing is to try to maintain the sector as open as possible through the coming weeks and months.  That may require some flattening in terms of activity and capacity, etc.  That is certainly some of the feedback we have been getting from operators in the business who have told us that bookings have reduced over the past week or two.  Some of those have been deferred until January or February.  What we faced earlier this year was a significant shock to the economy with 480,000 people availing of the PUP.  That is not a situation to which we want to return.  It is in all our interests to manage during the coming weeks by implementing the public health guidance, keeping businesses open in a safe way, and helping people to engage in the economy and to spend money.  That will be our common purpose.</p></speech>

I am a little confused because the Department has told us there is a significant shortage of experienced and qualified staff in the hospitality sector and yet Ministers came out yesterday and told that staff to move sectors and get another job.

The work permits and visas seem to be a pinch point.  I am hearing stories of it being impossible to get appointments for renewing visas.  There are an awful lot of sectors visibly struggling with recruitment.  Mr. McDonnell explained that a number of complex issues are coming to bear on this.  Is there scope for easing work permit terms to respond to some of these shortages, particularly those that look to be long term, such as in construction and retrofitting?  There seem to be definite long-term issues we need to address.</p> <p>  I welcome that SCARP will go live in November.  Is there any risk that it will not hit its start date?  This will be time-sensitive.  What are the sorts of things that are provoking companies that might go down?  Obviously there are some businesses that have had structural shifts and they will probably not go back to where they were.  Others may be struggling with landlords or banking issues.  Do we now have protocols for how SCARP will deal with some of these big institutional sources?</p> <p>  My next question relates to long-term structural shifts.  It seems that apprenticeships are going to be a crucial part of the long-term future.  To what extent is the Department building into its support schemes some conditionality, or at least an audit, around the extent to which the sectors it supports are taking up these apprenticeship opportunities that now carry grant support?  That has to be part of it.  I would say the same of the circular economy and climate issues.  The early moving companies that moved to get their houses in order will be the more competitive ones in five years' time.  To what extent does the Department build into its support audit an anticipation of those changes?</p> <p>  When the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, was before the committee, it highlighted the continuing issue of high legal and insurance costs, as has Mr. McDonnell.  Can the Department start to survey the experience of the client companies it supports so we can name and shame?  I know people are frustrated with the reform initiatives that are going on but they are happening.  There is the work of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, the change in the book of quantum and so on but these initiatives are not yet having the desired impact on premiums.  Can the Department do that?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses looking at the changing nature of town and city centres as a result of these structural shifts?  The Department always spoke about place-making.  To what extent is it putting its money behind that concept of rebuilding town and city centres to be more liveable and having new activities in them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#D00200"><p>On the work permits, in the last 18 months we have given huge priority to health sector workers.  We have prioritised them since March 2020 and have issued over 9,000 employment permits for medical personnel, including 4,700 for doctors, 4,000 for nurses and 168 for radiographers.  However, while this was not necessarily an issue in the first six months of the year, since reopening we have been trying to synchronise employers taking their employees off the PUP and taking on new employees and so on.  These things do not always work perfectly and there is quite a dynamic there.</p> <p>  Up to the end of October this year we had nearly 20,000 applications for work permits.  That is a 50% increase over 2020, when we had 13,000 applications, and a 30% increase on 2019 when we had 15,000.  It is a very significant increase.  As the committee will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy English, who has responsibility for retail and business, recently issued the latest review on this matter.  Every couple of months or two or three times a year we look at where the shortages are and where there are needs.  He issued the latest review on 27 October.  Most construction sector jobs are now eligible for the general employment permit.  We have also removed the quota for HGV driver work permits and 350 general employment permits are being provided for hospitality managers, bringing skills and expertise into the sector.  Social workers are now eligible for the critical skills permit and dispensing opticians were removed from the ineligible occupations list.  We have also increased the quotas for horticultural operatives by 1,000, meat deboners by 500, meat processing operatives by 1,500 and dairy farm assistants by 100.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that.  The team dealing with work permits is actively engaged in working both with trusted partners and general applicants to try to speed up the approval process.  There is a range of initiatives to which the Department and the Secretary General have agreed in order to clear the backlog quickly and we would expect to see progress over the coming weeks on that.</p> <p>  We do not handle visa appointments but we would be happy to follow up on that matter with the Deputy if we can.</p> <p>  A huge amount of work is going on to ensure that SCARP can be commenced at the end of November.  I again thank the committee for its own work on this issue.  As the committee will be aware, the small company administrative process is aimed at helping companies that are undergoing temporary difficulties.  ISME used to call it "examinership light".  It will be based on the existing rescue framework and mirrors many of those key elements but there is limited court involvement where creditors are engaged in the process.  It is intended to be simplified and effective.  As to making sure it can commence and will be easy to use, a lot of work is going on at the moment on finalising the types of forms that will be used, dealing with the Companies Registration Office, CRO, online forms, court rules, the draft commencement orders and the forms and fees.  We will also have a comprehensive information leaflet for businesses, online information content and a communications campaign.  We would hope to have all three elements, that is, policy, management and communications, on track for the end of November. </p> <p>  On the long-term structural shifts, we are very seized with those as regards climate action and digitalisation.  I mentioned in the brief the significant progress that has been made around digitalisation over the last 18 months in particular, with most businesses now having an online presence and 20% doing click and collect over the pandemic.  They are claiming back some market share in online retail and so on.  There have been significant increases in the number of businesses using cloud services, artificial intelligence, etc.  That is very much part of a similar approach we will be taking on climate and the circular economy.</p> <p>  It is great that we have the climate action plan.  The commitment to a reduction in carbon emissions has been set by the Government.  There are three big areas there for our Department.  The first is around cement and construction sites, the second is alumina and the third is the broad enterprise base.  There is a particular focus on the food and drinks sector, pharmaceutical engineering and electronics but also across the full base of business.  That will be a key element.  To the Deputy's specific point on the award of funding, I know from being on the board of Enterprise Ireland that our support from the enterprise agencies as regards assessment of climate impact and investment is about supporting environmental credentials and carbon reduction.  On the point around assessment and planning by businesses, one of the specific initiatives we will be rolling out shortly is a climate toolkit for businesses.  That will allow them to assess their current climate compliance and carbon footprint and identify measures they can take, as well as the range of supports or grants that might be available from Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices or the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p><p>We are also working across our agencies, including National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, around energy efficiency standards, carbon reduction and carbon labelling.  There are proposals before the Oireachtas on that.  Audit and anticipation are very much a key part of our focus in that area.  We have &euro;55 million under the recovery and resilience plan and will roll that out from January through the agencies.</p><p> On insurance costs, we have continued to see reductions in premiums, as recorded by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Central Bank.  There are other issues around legal costs etc. and I would be very interested in the proposal the Deputy mentioned around benchmarking or further analysis of legal costs over and above.  PIAB removes many of those elements but there is a broader issue there around the costs of business.  It is something the NCPCl has focused on.  The Competition Authority focused on it some years ago and made significant recommendations.</p><p> On the changing towns and villages, we get feedback directly from businesses as well as local enterprise offices, LEOs, and in the past 18 months we have seen a resurgence and regeneration of many of our towns and villages.  As the Deputy said himself, Dublin is a collection of villages.  We have seen it throughout the country.  The local enterprise officers are working with businesses in the towns and with chambers of commerce and other stakeholders try to develop those plans.  We have a town centre audit tool and we are also part of the town centre first strategy, which is particularly timely in its bottom-up approach to identifying the strengths and experience and the experience economy for towns and villages.</p><p> That will also be part of the work of the regional enterprise plans we are developing and completing.  It has a key focus on both.  Many of our regions are city regions and we need to ensure the cities themselves are attractive places in which to live, work and play but ensuring as well they are well connected with their hinterlands and towns.  It is something we will continue to work on with our LEOs and Enterprise Ireland and with other Departments, including Rural and Community Development, which runs its own schemes for rural funding and the urban development funds.  We are on both of those committees that are run by other Departments.</p><p> There is a lot of complementarity between what we do.  For example, with our regional enterprise development funds, we have allocated nearly &euro;117 million to developing digital hubs in towns and villages which create a centre and ecosystem.  We have had complementary funding from the urban and rural funds.  We anticipate that in future more of our money will probably go into the programmatic side in terms of helping small businesses to start, grow and prosper in those towns and to make best use of the infrastructure being developed by other bodies.  We hope to see that as part of the enterprise plans when they are launched in the coming weeks and that there might be additional funding to underpin that investment.</p></speech>

In the interim our laws have changed.  Personal insolvency has changed, as has bankruptcy, and we have Solvency II.  Therefore our banks are in a far better position to handle poor debtors.  This time, the biggest creditors of SMEs are other SMEs.  Typically, after bank debt, SME balance sheets will have between &euro;50,000 and &euro;75,000 of debts to other SMEs.

The losses that have inevitably arisen during the pandemic have to land on someone's balance sheet, unfortunately.  That is why we see some urgency in getting SCARP over the line because those issues will have to be resolved post pandemic.  In short, other SMEs will move to recover debt.</p></speech>

I will turn first to Mr. Hughes.  He spoke of how business supports are still available until the end of the year.  Businesses can apply for those supports until the end of December.  What explains the contrast between that and the PUP?  It is obviously fair enough that a nightclub owner is not expected to do something else if he or she cannot run a nightclub, but why is that different in the case of, say, a DJ or someone else who works in a nightclub?  Why is it expected that they should just go and work in a caf&eacute; or whatever?  Why has the PUP been closed to them?  Despite, say, nightclubs or taxi drivers and other sectors being affected by the latest actions, and there may be more actions coming, those who were on the PUP previously and came off it are now unable to go back on it.  What accounts for the very different approach to the supports for business and those for workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#E00800"><p>I would make a couple of points on the PUP which was introduced at very short order last year and has been very successful in helping to support incomes.  We have seen very good transitions from the PUP back to employment.  We know that 60% of those who have come off the PUP have returned to their previous employer.  Some 12% have stayed in the same sector and 20% have gone on to other areas.</p> <p>  The point worth bearing in mind, particularly for taxi drivers and others, is that many of those, and there are 74,000 who are still on the PUP and may not have come off in recent weeks, can continue to earn up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period.  Many of those in the sectors mentioned by the Deputy may not have come off the PUP and they can continue to earn.  We may well see that the numbers may not decrease as quickly as in the previous period.</p> <p>  For anyone operating a small business, the measures we have for self-employed, such as Microfinance Ireland, MFI, loans and short-term liquidity, are available to sole traders or individuals who may have a small business and are impacted.  There is zero-interest finance there.  We would encourage them to engage directly with the local enterprise offices of the Department that operate in every region.  Many in the entertainment sector have done so.  We have made available a range of measures and, as I said earlier, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has schemes for live performers and others.  I do not know the detail of those but I envisage there are measures there which may be helpful.  The policy issues might be more appropriate for the Minister and colleagues from the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

To be clear, I am not arguing against the business supports.  I am suggesting there is a contradiction, particularly at a time when sectors of the economy are beginning to be closed down.  Fair enough, the Department says some taxi drivers have never come off the PUP but some of them have.  They cannot go back on it now.  This is the case.  The PUP has been closed off.  It is being significantly reduced.  It is now down to &euro;203 or &euro;250.  People simply cannot go on it because the scheme has been closed whereas other schemes continue.  This seems to be a contradiction.</p></speech>

It will always be difficult to synchronise them in a situation where there are job openings and opportunities.  We see this in the retail and wholesale sector, for example, where employment is now above 2019 levels and we have shortages in that sector.  We know there will probably be demand over the Christmas period for between 5,000 and 10,000 people.  However, we still have significant numbers on the PUP.  As of 2 November, there were 12,000 in the wholesale and retail sector who remained on the PUP.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, there are options.  We need to work with businesses to ensure they can take back the people who were previous employees, and a total of 60% are going back to their previous employer.  A total of 12% have stayed in the sector.  People can also move to other sectors where there are other opportunities.  There are different glide paths and closure dates.  The EWSS, which is an employment support, will continue to the end of March.  There were 288,000 people in this scheme in October.  It is a key support for employers and individuals with regard to getting back to work.</p> <p>  With regard to people who have come off the PUP in recent weeks, the key point is to maintain what has been opened up and the jobs that were restored.  People went back to work in August, September, October and November and there was a particular level of activity.  It is about trying to sustain these jobs over the coming weeks and months.  We may not get the uplift that might have occurred in 2017, 2018 or 2019 in the Christmas period.  Many operators seem to be talking about trying to level it out so there is continued business into January and February.  I mentioned the prospect of going back to having 488,000 people in the scheme, which we had last spring.  It is something weighing heavily on us all.  We want to ensure we can keep the economy open and have job opportunities.  Certainly there are significant job openings and opportunities throughout the economy.</p></speech>

It is a bit like Groundhog Day, other than that, unfortunately, the business environment will probably get a lot more challenging for some sectors, especially smaller SMEs.  Like Deputy Bruton and others, I welcome SCARP.  Mr. McDonnell has outlined it very well.  Many businesses will be carrying debt, particularly those that have availed of warehousing.  It is interesting that local authorities were very fast off the mark in issuing rates bills to many companies that reopened in the past month.  They had been opened only two weeks when the rates bills came flooding back in the door.  There is a significant problem of indebtedness in the SME sector.  I speak to many businesses that are finding their cost base has increased, including for energy, and their service charges have increased.  Their turnover has dropped.  They may be charging a bit more than they were, and people are seeing this with regard to walking in the door and the cost being paid over the counter, but unfortunately there is no profit in the business.</p> <p>  At present, many businesses are very dependent on the Government supports that are there.  We will see a lot of real difficulty as they are unwound.  Mr. Hughes outlined quite a lot of the supports that have been given.  They have all been very welcome.  A couple of things have been mentioned.  With regard to the hospitality sector, is there any opportunity to make changes?  There is no discrimination between somebody employed for a couple of months and somebody employed for three or four years with regard to access to the PUP.  For staff retained by an employer for a number of years, the PUP is declining.  They will probably look for other jobs.  Those businesses will have no chance to retain them.  Is there any hope we might be able to give some kind of the tail end on the PUP for longer-term employees who are furloughed at present?  It is the same with the EWSS and those seeking supports.</p> <p>  With regard to the Government's planned capital spending, we have been speaking about retrofitting, solar and wind energy.  We are doing almost nothing in the economy that I can see to try to create training or work placement for people.  We are missing out quite a bit.  I ask Mr. McDonnell to comment on what he thinks are the two or three key challenges for the SME sector.  Foreign direct investment is doing well, as are manufacturing and construction.  For everybody else in the SME sector, especially services, what does Mr. McDonnell believe are the key challenges, particularly with a reduced Christmas in light of potential reductions or imminent lockdowns?</p></speech>

With regard to the recent lockdowns, what we saw last year in the lead-up to Christmas was that many town and city centre businesses did especially badly.  Ironically, this was mirrored by some suburban and outside town businesses doing extraordinarily well.  I have to acknowledge this.  If we have a second Christmas of very bad trading, it will exacerbate the situation.</p> <p>  The cost issues the Deputy referred to are significant.  It is not just an Irish issue.  European energy prices have increased on average by 20% this year.  This is on reduced trading in many areas.  Without taking over the meeting with a sundry list of problems, if we look at the big numbers for Ireland, our GDP is expanding at a rate that is not seen in any of the other developed economies.  Our GDP is on fire.  Last year, our GNI contracted but it is moving ahead this year.  It is forecast to move by 5%.  What we see is a continuing divergence between our multinational and domestic economies.  We are not satisfied there is sufficient political and economic focus on our SME sector.  To put it in simple terms, Israel has a population just about twice the size of ours and has 440 listed companies on its stock exchange.  I know we cannot make a direct comparison with Dublin because we have big stock exchanges nearby but we have 22 or 23 listed companies for a population of 5 million.  Our domestic economy is not in the health our foreign multinational economy is in.  This is where we would like to see the political focus.</p></speech>

We are very involved in the crafting of the national development plan because we have significant issues with priorities for infrastructure with regard to indigenous enterprise as well as the foreign direct investment sector.  Significant investment is needed in water services, energy infrastructure and road infrastructure.  All of these are significant issues for productivity, not just for multinationals but for all sectors of the economy.</p><p>We are very involved in that prioritisation process, as well as funding various parts of the capacity within the enterprise base, as I mentioned, whether that is hubs for remote working, regional centres or the capital investment programmes.  I mentioned some of the investments we are funding in, for example, the food and agricultural sectors so we can move to higher productivity activities, which means higher output using the same number of people by using automation, artificial intelligence etc.</p><p> The Department is also at the centre of the Housing for All strategy.  The Secretary General is represented on the overall steering committee as well as a number of subcommittees.  We realise that the broader SME base is key to delivering on the objectives and targets set out there, whether that is off-site or on-site construction.  Underpinning all of that, we have been doing significant work with the expert group on future skill needs, SOLAS and others to assess the skill needs for the sector as it evolves to deliver on the targets for housing, commercial and industrial building in the short term and the longer term.  That goes back to the point the Deputy made about energy efficiency and retrofitting on the residential and industrial sides.  Those are significant opportunities for us.  We have strong supply chains in those areas for materials, insulation and the technologies that will be needed for the future.  As I mentioned, as part of the most recent work permit review, we have increased the eligible areas on the construction side so we can fill some of those gaps.  We are also working with other Departments to attract back skills from abroad.  We have many graduates and apprentices who have gained experience internationally.  The key message to them is that we have a long-term capital investment plan.  There is certainty now as to what the investments, job opportunities and job openings will be.</p><p> Coupled with that, we still need the apprenticeship system to be attuned with the existing trades and new trades.   Such apprenticeships are coming through, especially in the areas of energy efficiency and climate technologies etc.  We are continually promoting those and, indeed, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science put a strong focus on apprenticeships as an option for the most recent cohort of leaving certificate students.  That will be a continuing focus for us and the expert group on future skill needs into the future.</p><p> I will come back to the work of the local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland later.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the first half hour or so of the meeting.  I was addressing a Topical Issue matter in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I have read the submissions and I am catching up now.  I will ask Mr. Hughes a question about a story that was carried in the <i>The Business Post</i>over the weekend.  It relates somewhat to the point Mr. McDonnell was making when he referred to the difference between the state of health of multinationals and foreign direct investment companies versus indigenous industry.  Is it common for a request to be made that notes are not taken at important meetings?  Was that a bit of a once-off or would that be par for the course?  Would Mr. Hughes, in the normal course of his work, be in receipt of such requests?  I found it quite unusual but perhaps I am a bit naive and that is, in fact, normal procedure and practice.  Will Mr. Hughes outline that for us?</p></speech>

We may come back to it again.  The management board had a significant discussion yesterday with our local enterprise offices about the pace and rate of entrepreneurship and the growth of the SME sector.  That has been particularly in evidence over the past year.  It has been phenomenal.  Credit is due to businesses across the country for their innovation and job creation.  We are looking at 400,000 additional jobs this year and next year, if we can keep the economy open.  Most of those jobs will be in SMEs and small businesses throughout the country.  Some 92% of businesses in the country are microenterprises that employ fewer than ten people.  While-----</p></speech>

The other point I would make is that we employ nearly as many people in Irish companies in the US as US companies employ here.  Those are the points I wanted to make.</p> <p>  In response to the question the Deputy asked, that practice is not something I have come across or of which I am aware.  That is my experience.  I was not involved in that particular meeting.  It is not something that would happen regularly.  Commercial negotiations happen on an ongoing basis in respect of particular projects and investments, etc.  That is part of the cut and thrust-----</p></speech>

There are ongoing engagements with a range of stakeholders.  The key thing about that is that multiple stakeholders were, as I understand it, involved.  We have a range of forums, whether the retail sector or enterprise forums, where there would be open exchanges and engagement across a whole range of stakeholders, including the foreign and indigenous sector.</p></speech>

I take it that would be the norm.  I have to say I find it quite disturbing that a junior or senior Minister would accede to requests from big companies not to take notes at meetings.  The article in the newspaper specifically referenced that the purpose was to avoid freedom of information requests.  I cannot think of any other reason, to be fair, a person would seek to ensure notes were not taken at important meetings.  I thank Mr. Hughes for his clarification.  It is a relief this is not the norm but it is regrettable that the practice happens at all.  We all must be grateful to the journalists who pursue these issues and shine a light into dark rooms where no notes are taken.</p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions.  I will raise the issues of Brexit and trade flows.  Has the Department conducted research into the trade voids in the Single Market, places where British companies would have been providing goods and which may now be open for competition?  Is the Department working with the enterprise agencies to help Irish companies to connect with these opportunities?  Could our guests give us an update on where that is at?  Mr. McDonnell might also comment on whether he sees a role in expanding out businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#G00900"><p>I thank the Deputy and will be sure to leave time for Mr. McDonnell to respond.  I assure the Deputy that, as we have discussed previously, the Department has been working since the vote on the referendum and through 2017 and 2018 to try to build resilience into the supply chains, addressing, in particular, areas where there might be vulnerabilities and a reliance on UK suppliers.  Our evidence so far is that Irish businesses and supply chains have remained relatively robust over the past ten or 11 months.  There have certainly been challenges over the level of preparedness of businesses based in Great Britain relating to their compliance with various requirements.  There have also been haulage and logistics challenges.  To a large extent, Irish businesses have worked through those challenges.</p> <p>  We did a lot of work on preparedness that related to the shifting of supply chains to allow for more options for local suppliers in Ireland.  I am aware, as I am sure the Deputy is, of many engineering businesses that have had to respond to requirements under free trade agreements and rules of origin, and have sourced materials within the EU.  They were shifting supplies to the Irish market, continental Europe and the rest of the eurozone.  Our focus is in sourcing from the eurozone and the EU, not only in the manufacturing and industrial sectors but also in the retail sector.  That was a key focus last year through our retail forum.  That resilience was also a focus of the early part of this year.</p><p>We have seen changes with some of the larger retailers.  They tried to maintain that continuity of supply from Great Britain, but it proved particularly difficult for them.  They are working on increasing their sourcing domestically.  Bord Bia is working with the retail multiples that are bringing products into the country, and with many others, on the availability of shipping directly into Rosslare from France and on the increase in services there.  The fact that continuity of supply has been sustained indicates the extent to which businesses have diverted and changed their supply chains.  In some cases, they have rerouted to avoid the UK land bridge where there may be risks.  We will continue that into the future.  As a result of campaigns such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s The Irish Advantage, we are seeing an increased level of sourcing from the Irish market to European counterparts and European businesses.  There is a strong focus on supply chain resilience, given all the disruptions with shipping and the strategic autonomy discussions at EU level.  We will continue to focus on that through the enterprise agencies and by working across government.</p></speech>

Is the strategy working?  Are people now picking up the business that was left in the wake of Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#H00300"><p>That is a tricky question to answer.  Part of the problem is that at the start of Brexit there was a huge focus on the export business, particularly in the food sector.  Many small businesses in Ireland are exposed to the UK from the import side.  Realistically, we are a small market.  Small businesses have been reliant on big UK distributors to take smaller imports.  While there was a huge focus on what tariffs would apply, in reality the vast majority of tariffs in sectors other than the food sector top out at about 8%.  Other issues such as standards and certification are much more intrusive.  A simple example is the warning, which Mr. Hughes will have seen, from the Department of Justice around Christmas crackers for this Christmas.  We buy most of those from the UK.  They are classified as fireworks and have to carry a CE mark.  However, British suppliers can no longer put a CE mark on Christmas crackers.  A huge number of our wholesalers and importers rely on British suppliers to do that for products like Christmas crackers and toys for small children.  Our people are not necessarily big enough to import them yet.  They have not yet identified a big French or German importer who will take over that certification function and then distribute here.  That work is yet to be done, unfortunately.</p></speech>

How is blended working working out?  Has he noticed a benefit in the smaller towns where people do not have to come into the city centre?  Where one is losing, is one picking up?  Have his members spoken to him about the potential benefits of blended working, not just for them but also for their workers?</p></speech>

When job inquiries are being made at the point of recruitment, the manner in which the work will be carried out is now up there with the remuneration discussion.  It is definitely an issue.  What we are looking to see settle down in particular is updated guidance from the Revenue Commissioners.  As the Deputy will know from her other job, what classifies a worker&rsquo;s contractual place of work is a significant issue.  If a contract of work specifies the home as a place of work, that has all sorts of implications.  Following on from that, we want to see a great deal more clarity from the HSA on how it is going to look at the workstation.  I am working from home at a workstation with a job-provided laptop and a job-provided chair.  That is all hunky-dory, but it is not necessarily like that for everyone.  Following on from that is the question of employer&rsquo;s liability insurance.  How big a circle insurers are going to draw around that employee is to be confirmed.  We would like a bit more comfort on that.  I appreciate that not all of this is legislative.  The courts and PIAB will have their say on some of this issue, but we need to see some of it settle down.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonnell meets regularly with Ministers and Ministers of State.  When he is meeting with them, does he routinely or otherwise request that no notes be taken?  Would he be happy that notes are taken?  Does he understand that the taking of notes is the norm?  Certainly, in my previous role whenever I met with Ministers we always understood that notes would be taken.  I am curious to know the circumstances under which this would happen.</p></speech>

It is specified at those briefings, especially when we get sensitive briefings on Brexit, that we operate under Chatham House rules.  Otherwise, people take notes.  There is quite a degree of clarity regarding what is on and off the record.</p></speech>

The first of them relates to the skilled staff shortages - for example, the shortage of chefs - that have been spoken about in the hospitality sector.  The two issues in this respect are the red tape for the employees themselves and the costs to the employer.  What is the Department doing to process this more quickly?  What help is the Department giving to both employees and employers?</p> <p>  As we are all aware, most European countries are using a 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  Our rate is due to go back up to 13.5%.  I am conscious that this in the remit of the Department of Finance, but I would still appreciate comments from Mr. Hughes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Such an increase would put us at a serious disadvantage by comparison with our competitors in these markets.</p> <p>  Finally, an increase of &euro;103 million has been provided for the budget for 2022.  What is the Department&rsquo;s intention in relation to the prioritisation of this significant increase in funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#H01000"><p>We have a range of skills areas on the list of eligible skills and chefs are certainly included on that list.  As I mentioned, we are working on a range of initiatives to try to accelerate the assessment and approval of applications.  We have had a 50% increase on the 2020 applications.  This is 30% up on 2019.  That is requiring additional resources and additional productivity, etc., but we are making progress on those applications.  Many people in the hospitality sector, in restaurants and bars etc., may not be trusted partners because of low volumes.  They may not be on the trusted partner list, which is a way for employers to go through a pre-approval process.  If particular businesses they think they will have issues or difficulties over the coming period - they may have expansion plans, etc. - I recommend that they should go through that process, which would enable them to go into a different pile rather than into one-off applications.</p><p>Similarly, in terms of apprenticeships, a balance must be struck between having a very quick response and brining in additional staff from EU and non-EU countries, and ensuring we have a pipeline of skilled and trained staff for the sectors of the future.</p><p> That is where the work of experts in future skills needs is very important.  We must use SOLAS working with the education providers, etc. and get the messages out about where the job openings are going to be over the period to 2030 and 2040.  The population will increase by about 1 million between now and 2040 so another 600,000 people will be at work and there will be job openings.  Therefore, we need to consider what jobs and occupations will be required in the future.  Certainly we will work with employers across the sectors where there are work permits and, indeed, Deputy Bruton referred to those.  We have done this previously with the meat and processing sectors.  Where there are short-term work permits there must also be a commitment to programmes of training, apprenticeship and upskilling.  I refer to the work of other agencies that are involved on the training side, particularly SOLAS in that regard.</p><p> The costs limits are at a reasonable level.  I do not have the details but the application costs would not be significant and compare favourably.</p><p> As the Senator mentioned, the VAT rate is an issue for the Minister for Finance.  The 9% rate will last until the autumn of next year.  We have had feedback that, for various reasons, many other countries and cities have local taxes that add to the bill.  While there are demands for the 9% rate to be maintained, in terms of the international market, the glide path is clear for the coming period.</p><p> We will have additional funding for next year and part of that is to sustain the current scheme in terms of Microfinance Ireland and the sustaining enterprise fund.  These are on Covid in addition to funding for Brexit.  We will launch under the climate transition fund and the digital transition fund.  These are broad-based funds to encourage businesses to go on or accelerate their digitalisation journey.  As many as 17,000 businesses have gone through the step up with the local enterprise offices.  Indeed, Enterprise Ireland now has a &euro;9,000 voucher to help businesses either to get started or to increase their sophistication of digitalisation.  We will step that up next year to build on such progress.  It is no longer about just getting businesses to have a website and do transactions.  It is now about sophistication and a substantial amount of that will concern the adoption of, for example, advanced manufacturing industry 4.0 at firm level, which requires training and investment.</p><p> On the climate side, we are a little bit further behind.  This year, we launched a green for micro initiative through the local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland.  A lot of that work is at the planning stage in terms of businesses having to develop their climate and circular economy strategies.  Then they must work out the step up that is needed regarding their own capabilities and business mode, and then make capital investments.  We would see that capital investment starting and commencing significantly next year.</p><p> The accelerated capital allowance is in the budget.  It is a help because it will incentivise investment in more energy efficient equipment etc.  There are also measures for the use of alternative energies.  They include green hydrogen, which we will see become significant for decarbonising the transport sector, and in parts of the cement and aluminous cement sector.</p><p> I mentioned in the brief the additional money - &euro;2 million - that will go to local enterprise offices.  There is also additional money for InterTradeIreland, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for their broad base of schemes to increase productivity and innovation.</p></speech>

I hope he will recover.  It is wise of him to work from home and it is good advice for people who feel unwell that they should not go to their office or place of work.</p> <p>  As many as 6,000 children tested positive in the first week of November.  Some of the parents of those children have contacted me to let me know they had to stay home to mind their children.  Will Mr. McDonnell tell me whether that situation has had an impact on small businesses?  One parent who contacted me told me she would not get paid while she stayed home to care for her child.  How do we deal with these situations, especially as the number of children becoming ill is increasing?</p></speech>

That fully vaccinated close contacts will have to restrict their movements is probably going to impact certain areas like child care, the medical sector and so on, and in ways we have not yet seen.  The new provision kicks in on Friday, but it has to have a non-negligible impact, assuming people do what they have been told to do and restrict their movements.  It has to have an impact.</p></speech>

Typically, anyone who works in the public service is paid for his or her time off.  An awful lot of people in the private sector are not so you have both a service absence issue and a pay issue for those who have to restrict because they are a close contact.  I do not suggest there is an easy answer to the problem and I appreciate there must be a public health response but we cannot assume there will not be a service impact on the economy.  It looks like we are going to have a significant number of close contacts among the people who are in the fully vaccinated community.</p></speech>

One of the things that repeatedly arises when I deal with small businesses is that the State supports are vital in keeping some of these companies and businesses in existence, and the supports have been really welcomed.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Hughes.  The employment wage subsidy scheme depends on a 30% reduction in turnover.  Could that act as a disincentive for some companies to grow?  In other words, if the 30% reduction is maintained, the employment wage subsidy scheme will continue.  Should we consider ensuring the scheme tapers off?  Was tapering ever examined rather than having a cliff edge of 30%?</p></speech>

That aspect was certainly a concern.  It can be seen why, from a business perspective, you might try to bed down the existing business, solidify positions and consolidate your balance sheet.  Certainly that may have been a position.  What we are seeing now is that the economy is recovering and opening up.  We have seen significant recruitment.  We have also seen a reduction in the number of employers who are in receipt of the EWSS.  Employers are coming off the scheme at a fairly healthy rate.  It has decreased from 35,000 down to 25,000 and the number is steadily reducing.  It is right for businesses to take a pragmatic approach.</p> <p>  As Mr. McDonnell has mentioned, it is acknowledged the scheme is a strong support.  However, businesses are in the business of doing business.  Once they can see there is sight of new contracts and certainty about reopening, they are getting on with additional recruitment.  Right across the board, with the exception of a small number of sectors, they are now ahead of their employment in 2019.  It is a key priority we maintain businesses and they remain open so that they can trade and trade internationally.  From the first part of this year, we have seen very strong results from both Enterprise Ireland clients exporting and the foreign companies that are here restoring markets.  There are businesses in education, aviation and other sectors that are not back to their 2019 levels and, indeed, recovery may take a little bit longer.</p><p>That is where supports such as the sustaining enterprise fund is important in terms of providing a fillip to their balance sheets and to help them to readjust.  Many of those businesses are looking at new markets or new ways of providing online services.</p></speech>

He might keep us informed on the changes that are being planned in the employment wage subsidy scheme as they come in, because a lot of people would be interested in them.</p> <p>  I note that approximately one fifth of apprentices across the board leave before their training is completed.  Has any research been done on why that is the case?  Mr. McDonnell or Mr. Hughes might like to comment on that.  The number of apprentices giving up the job, as it were, is quite worrying.  I accept there might be many reasons for it, but I would like to hear what they are and if any research has been done on it.</p></speech>

The key focus in a range of sectors, whether it is apprenticeships or traineeships, was that it was difficult during the recession.  Due to social distancing and other restrictions, some in the personal care areas, like hairdressing and others, might have let some of their trainees or apprentices go and the issue then was taking them back on and providing an attractive opportunity for them.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science did extend some of the supplements which were available.  It is something that is continuously managed to ensure that those who are on apprenticeships are being well looked after and are getting their protected time and their various other entitlements.  That is something we have to follow up on.</p></speech>

It concerns me when I see the number involved.  Several employers have corresponded with me who say the schemes need to be tweaked and also that before apprentices go into a job, they must have a realistic understanding of what is involved and what it entails.</p> <p>  I will move on to the regional enterprise support fund, digital hubs and working from home.  Am I correct in saying that most of the fund----- </p></speech>

I wish Mr. McDonnell well.  He is showing good leadership in terms of staying at home.  I hope he gets better soon.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Hughes.  A number of people raised employment permits.  A number of businesses and companies in Tipperary in particular in the agricultural and steel sectors are struggling to get approvals for employment permits.  Does he find that different sectors are being refused more than others?  We heard the news last week or the previous week about more permits being available and more groups being brought into the system, in particular for jockeys and other such positions.  Given that the demand has increased so much, has the number of staff dealing with the permits increased?  Is the percentage of refusals higher than it was previously?  As other speakers have said, there is a huge cost involved to the employer.  At the moment, it seems that although more permits are being sanctioned, more people are also being refused permits.  Do the refusals relate to different sectors or are they across the board?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#K00900"><p>I do not have the details across the sectors, and I am not aware generally of whether the refusal rate is higher or lower.  The key point is that there is a schedule of eligible occupations.  In October, the Minister of State, Deputy English, launched a revised list.  This was based on the third biannual review that was undertaken since the onset of Covid-19.  The increases were to address some of the areas Senator Ahearn mentioned, in particular on the agricultural side.  A total of 1,000 extra horticultural operatives were sanctioned, 500 meat deboners, 1,500 meat processing operatives, and 100 dairy farm assistants.  Those areas are very much linked to what we hear and get from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a seasonality element to it but it is also due to changes in work practices and activity.<br/><br/>I will make a couple of points that might be helpful.  First, there is the trusted partner scheme which I mentioned.  Businesses that might be seasonal, for example, rely on short-term key skills coming in from abroad.  They should really go through the process <i>ex ante</i>and be on the list of trusted partners.  It means then that when the applications come in they are essentially pre-approved.  If the business has done its market tests, etc, that helps with the approval process.<br/><br/>More generally, some of the feedback I heard is that when applications are being made that they are not always complete and fully assessed in terms of<i>ex ante</i>compliance with the schedule of occupations and that the full detail is filled in.  I can come back to the Senator with data on that.  I am aware that the level of completeness of the application forms themselves is an issue.  If any advice is needed, we can provide it to employers.  There are various information sources.  We have a very good website, which gets thousands of hits every week, but incomplete applications still come in and they are sent back.  There may also be applications that do not fit with the list.  First, is the job on the list and, second, if the application is complete, accurate and contains all the detail and that the applicant has gone through the various processes in terms of the market test, etc.?</p></speech>

It seems to me that some people struggle with the paperwork.  One or two other speakers referred to this earlier.  It is frustrating for some, especially in the agricultural sector, who find the level of paperwork quite demanding.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. McDonnell.  When I speak to businesses, especially in Tipperary, but also small businesses across the country, they are all very positive about the supports they have been given in the past 18 months to keep them afloat, but there is also a fear about what will happen when the supports end.  What is his sense about the long-term challenges businesses will have?  He referred in his contribution to the fact that the money will have to be repaid and some businesses will not have anything to fall back on.  Following the Government's announcement yesterday that the restrictions were changing, there is a sense in the hospitality sector in particular that it is starting to re-adjust up to Christmas time because there is a real fear that the sector might be going back to somewhere it does not want to go, but its members seem to be making decisions based on the possibility that they could be in trouble in a couple of weeks.  Does he sense from small businesses that there is a fear about where they will be in the coming weeks and that they are making strategic decisions based on that without knowing the facts?</p></speech>

Deputy Paul Murphy brought up something similar earlier.  The general comment I would make on that is that we understand that all the supports must taper &ndash; we are as keen for that to happen as anyone else &ndash; but when the rules on the ground change, as they did the other day, then the rules on the supports must change as well.  We have been on the record as saying that the PUP in some ways discouraged people from coming back into the workplace.  People were reluctant to give it up because the rule said they could not re-engage with it.  Having seen what has happened the night-time economy, we cannot blame some people who are on the PUP, who are breathing a sigh of relief and saying they are glad they did not come off it and that they are still in receipt of it.</p><p>We are going to have to show flexibility on qualification for the PUP, for example.  Perhaps that would include allowing workers to avail of some of the flexibilities that are there for the self-employed.  If we are going to face a prolonged period of uncertainty, we will need to be flexible on the rules.</p></speech>

If things work out well and there are no changes in circumstances in that sector, then things continue.  It would encourage people to come back at the start so they do not lose out.</p></speech>

Having a hard and fast rule that if you come off the payment you cannot go back on it is, perversely, an incentive to stay on it.  People have not spotted that until now and the recent restrictions.  Consideration of flexibility should be on the cards now.</p></speech>

On another point, over the last year or so many businesses in hospitality, shops and people who do takeaway sandwiches and so on are now struggling to source simple things like packaging, spoons and forks.  Is ISME finding that to be the case?  These are things that cash-and-carry outlets like Musgrave would normally have, but they do not seem to have them in the same bulk anymore.  I have been speaking to numerous shops, caf&eacute;s and places like that even this week.</p></speech>

I wish him a quick recovery.  I join with others in saying he is doing the right thing and leading by example.  As the adverts on the radio and television say, I thank him for not leaving the house today.</p> <p>  My question relates to the global corporation tax changes the Government has signed up to.  This is a reversal of the previous industrial strategy predicated on a low corporation tax rate.  We heard in the last month from the NCPC about the challenges we face, especially the cost of housing and the lack of supply, the lack of transport and so on.  These are all challenges.  Given the Government is now changing tack by signing up to a higher rate of corporation tax that indicates a change will be required to our previous industrial strategy, will Mr. Hughes outline what our current such strategy is to replace that and attract FDI, etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021111700002#L01000"><p>As the Deputy knows, at one level the changes to the corporation tax rate mean it is a level playing field right across the world.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has been very engaged at OECD level to ensure there is certainty for businesses on what the future regime will be with respect to the move to a 15% rate for all businesses.  That was a critical argument we made very strongly about how that would impact on our indigenous enterprise base.  Sustaining the rate at 12.5% for all but the very largest businesses, namely those with a turnover above &euro;750 million, is significant.  At one level we get absolute certainty on what the regime might be.  Obviously, there is a bit of a way to go with working through the detail and having that implemented.  Businesses in general look at locations around the world.  Ireland will continue to be attractive not because of the tax rate but because of a wide range of measures and the business environment we have.  When we look at the uncertainty around the world, the IDA would say there are a number of key elements to that.  The first is Ireland is a stable and certain business environment whether it is across the tax environment, the availability of skills and talent or the operating environment we have here in terms of the infrastructure and the access to the EU market, which is obviously a key advantage and something we fought very hard to sustain and which is indeed very much part of our offer.</p> <p>  The Deputy will have seen the IDA had a very good first half of the year in terms of new announcements of jobs etc.  Many of those companies are coming here because they have existing businesses or because of the ecosystem we provide in some of those key new sectors for the future.  Whether it is in financial services, medical technologies, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, ICT, or Internet services, we have a cluster and an ecosystem that is very attractive and very conducive to innovation, talent and getting access to international markets.  I am struck by the figures for even the first half of the year.  The IDA reported that of the projects in the first half of the year I think there were something like 62 names new to Ireland.  They are companies that are coming here for the first time.  Of the 142 investments won up to the end of the second quarter of the year, 62 were new-name investments.  That is a great achievement given the IDA was trying to convince these businesses to come to Ireland and come to Europe.  This is investment not just for Ireland but for Europe for the first time in a context where the authority was working with them remotely and digitally, so it is a great credit to it.  Businesses scan around the world and ask where they should be locating and Ireland is one of those locations.  You might want to be in the US or you might want to be in Asia but if you are coming to Europe, Ireland is the place to come, particularly in those frontier technology areas.</p> <p>  The other piece which is really impressive is the strong regional performance and indeed we had another announcement this morning of significant jobs for Waterford.  On the strong regional performance, our cities are now competing with other cities and our regions are competing with other regions around Europe for locations.  In the first half of the year, of the 142 investments, 68 were going to regional locations.  Regarding the future, I point in particular to how quickly we have adopted and adapted to blended and remote working.  That is something that will be an advantage in terms of winning new investments.  Over the years we have had companies that have come, and I can think of some that are expanding through remote working and blended working, to get access to skills.  The fact we now have a remote working policy and strategy and we have just done a consultation will further enhance our attractiveness for investment coming in.  Indeed, I have seen some recent analysis which would indicate that up to a third of investment will be in that space around remote working and connecting teams.  Overall, notwithstanding the uncertainty internationally, if we continue to focus on skills, innovation, developing our research system, the infrastructure, the ecosystems, the talent base and the policy environment, we are well positioned to attract the next waves of investment.  As I mentioned in the brief, we have stepped up investment for next year in our disruptive technologies innovation fund, in digital hubs and also in terms of our investment into enterprise innovation in climate and in other areas.  That will come both from FDI and also from Irish companies.  I point in particular to the significant recent investment by ICON.</p><p>That refers back to our earlier point on the strength of the indigenous enterprise base that has invested both in Dublin and in Limerick.  It is part of the development of the clinical trials infrastructure in Limerick, with Cook Medical and many other companies there.  There is that synergy and complementarity between our indigenous and overseas base.</p></speech>

I have one question for Mr. McDonnell.  As we know, the IDA has rolled out a welcome mat for Amazon.  What I hear about Amazon is the undermining of local businesses, bogus self-employment and mistreatment of workers, and these are things associated with these types of companies.  Does Mr. McDonnell think the IDA should be rolling out the welcome mat for these companies?  My last question related to a fundamental shift that is required in industrial policy that people just do not seem to be talking about.  In terms of where the focus is going to be, what is sustainable and how we build a strong domestic economy, does Mr. McDonnell see the advent of Amazon on these shores as contributing positively or negatively to that?</p></speech>

It might be the opening of a big factory with 1,000 people, and while smaller companies do that every day, it is just for two or three employees.</p> <p>  To segue backwards into what the Deputy was just saying with Mr. Hughes, on the one hand, we would have a view that Ireland was absolutely correct to take a stand on the issue of BEPS and corporation tax because that is an issue of national sovereignty.  Other countries could be deciding what our tax policy should be on something but I do not think they would like it if we decided what their VAT rates were, or whatever it might be.  It is an important issue.  We accept where we have gone on BEPS and pillar 2, which arrived very late in the day.</p> <p>  We spend an awful lot of time worrying about what rate some of these big companies pay in taxation without realising that some of these businesses are now larger in market valuation than a significant number of countries in the world, and they are exerting market power, political power and communications power that people really do not appreciate.  I think states need to be in the headspace that the US Government was in at the back of the last century, when it had to break up certain oil companies.  I am not picking on any particular one, but I think we are in a position now that some of these companies are so big that their impact and their mass of gravity in economies is something that legislators should be very worried about.</p></speech>

Although it has been discussed already, I ask the Department to consider putting in place a dedicated phone line for Oireachtas Members to deal with work permits only.  I know colleagues would find it very useful.  We have an email contact but it can be very hard to explain what the issue is.  The Department might consider that option.</p><p>Second, I want to ask Mr. Hughes about the regional enterprise development fund in the context of remote working hubs.  Am I correct that this can only be accessed by not-for-profits in regard to putting in place remote working hubs?  Has consideration been given to businesses getting support to set up remote working hubs?  We spoke about working from home.  What seems to be happening is that, for people living in a regional town, working from home is not as attractive as going to a hub and working there rather than driving a long distance into a city.  We also have the environmental issue, which is a positive as people do not have to travel a long distance, in addition to the issues of time saved, quality of life and so on.  The remote working hub is a good concept but it seems to be <i>ad hoc</i>and driven by the not-for-profit sector.  Has consideration been given to encouraging businesses to set up these facilities?</p><p>My third question, which is on insurance, is for Mr. Hughes but Mr. McDonnell might like to comment.  Has consideration been given to establishing a regulator for the insurance sector?  We have one in energy, one in transport and one in communications and so forth, but there is a need to regulate the insurance sector so it is allowed a certain amount of profit but, after that, the charges are controlled.  This pertains in some other jurisdictions.  It would mean that when outgoings and claims are reduced, the premiums should reduce as well for business.</p><p>Mr. McDonnell mentioned concerns about unvaccinated people coming to work.</p></speech>

With regard to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, many businesses are telling us they are finding it very difficult to get staff and they are blaming the PUP for it.  Mr. Hughes might comment on whether thought has been given to that.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly referred to bogus self-employment.  We recently discussed legislation on introducing sick pay for workers.  It has been put to me that such supports cannot be accessed because there is a lot of bogus self-employment out there.  What has been done to combat that?</p></speech>

On work permits, the email contact is there and I know there is a prioritisation process.  I can certainly consult colleagues and come back to the Deputy on that.  I was not aware there were particular issues with it as it was working well as a fast track.  I am certainly happy to come back to the Deputy on that.</p> <p>  With regard to not-for-profits, there are probably about 1,000 regional hubs around the country in various shapes and forms.  There are 117 community enterprise centres the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has funded, and many of those have developed into digital hubs, although some have not.  We have also funded a wide range of bottom-up and collaborative initiatives, and that is a very good model in the sense we get buy-in at a local level from business groups and from leaders who can serve on the board, drive that and provide advice.  From our perspective, we are very much focused not just on the physical infrastructure but also on the business development.  These are hubs where entrepreneurs can come in, mingle with other entrepreneurs or businesses and get advice, contacts and develop.  In general, that model has served us extremely well.  There are others which, for their own reasons, set up commercial activity, and that is absolutely right.  There are good rental models and we see those springing up, particularly in the past year.</p> <p>  I am aware there are various funding schemes.  The Department of Rural and Community Development recently had a call for its hubs and, although I stand to be corrected, I understand some &euro;8 million was awarded to nearly 100 different businesses.  That was open to not-for-profits in local communities but also to others which might have been more commercial.  Again, I can follow up with the detail on that for the Deputy.</p> <p>  In regard to insurance reform, the Deputy may have seen the Central Bank's most recent report which was published in the past day or two.  The Central Bank is continually monitoring and developing its oversight, data and engagement with the insurance sector.  As the Deputy knows, the programme for government has a very strong commitment on insurance reform.  It is being led by the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste.  We have the action plan for insurance reform, which was launched last year.  As of the middle of the year, 34 of the 66 actions had been delivered in the first six months of the year and 97% of the actions are scheduled for completion in 2021.</p> <p>  One of those actions refers particularly to the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the level of competition in the market, the level of profitability and the level of service, a point that was mentioned earlier in terms of the range of providers.</p><p>There is a specific item in the action plan to attract additional operators into Ireland.  Some might argue that where profitability is seen to increase there is a dynamic, and new operators are attracted in.  It is important for us to have certainty in the licensing regime, strong oversight and strong governance of the sector from the Central Bank along with a clear policy framework from the Government and the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is very involved in that.  A key message to the industry is that there is a significant Government commitment to reforms of PIAB, the book of quantum etc.  We are currently developing the general scheme to enhance and reform PIAB.</p><p> Regarding the PUP, it can be hard to get staff but the Intreo offices throughout the country and the Department of Social Protection are very engaged on the activation side, working with individuals to provide them with employment opportunities, hopefully for sustainable jobs.</p></speech>

We know that several underwriters have left the market, soft play outdoor adventure centres cannot get insurance and point-to-point racing is now out of insurance.  Mr. McDonnell mentioned that judges are walking away from the recently revised book of quantum.  Is there any opportunity for self-insurance?  Could Government help sectors in setting up self-insurance?</p> <p>  Mr. Hughes mentioned hydrogen.  Is he saying that Government will hopefully invest in that facility?  It is a large amount of money.  We have only one biomass facility in the country and that was mostly privately paid for.  Does the Department have any plans in that area?  </p> <p>  I am sure Mr. Hughes is aware the forestry sector is in trouble.  Is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine?  The dairy industry has the potential to immediately reduce emissions by 30%.  However, farmers will not go there until a benchmark is set for the actual carbon displacement.  This might be something to be taken up with those involved in climate action.</p></speech>

Drivers who tax their cars online will see approximately 100 companies offering motor insurance here.  A small business with a play centre or an adventure centre which is renting bikes will potentially be down to one insurance supplier.  On Monday, I went through an insurance policy with one of our members who is in a sporting business.  The terms and conditions being applied by the one remaining insurer to his business are extremely burdensome.  This is his only means to stay alive as a business.  He is basically operating on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.</p> <p>  Our duty of care is effectively strict.  If something happens on business premises, essentially our system of law does not care about the degree of care taken by the plaintiff.  If it happened on a business's premises, the owner is goosed; it is deemed to be the owner's fault and they will pay.</p> <p>  Despite what we understood would happen under the Judicial Council Act, we have seen some very impactful decisions where the judicial guidelines were not even referenced.  We have had one or two awards which not alone were higher than the judicial guidelines but were higher than the old book of quantum without any justification.  We have written to the Minister on that to ask what contingency plans the Department of Justice is making if the direction we have taken proves to be the wrong direction, as we have said for more than two years.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about self-insurance.  Self-insurance is not a solution to the cost of insurance.  Self-insurance or mutual insurance is potentially a way around the take-it-or-leave it, gun-to-the-head insurance available from British companies at the moment.  A mutual or self-insurance contract will typically be more expensive in the first three years because the mutual insurer needs to build up adequate reserves.  It is not the answer that some people think it will be.</p></speech>

I certainly welcome his questions because it is an area we are extremely focused on as we look to 2030 and 2050.  There are significant drivers on the regulatory and the policy side relating to climate change and the technologies in the market have developed quite markedly.  There has been aggressive investment across Europe and internationally in the area of hydrogen and green hydrogen.  Some of our main trading partners are looking at the opportunities for energy security and carbon reduction there.</p> <p>  We see the potential for an additional 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  We will probably be able to export some of that through interconnectors.  The significant opportunity for us is generating green hydrogen from electrolysers.  In the future, possibly by the end of this decade, this will present a significant opportunity to the transport sectors, replacing or as a supplement to fossil fuel and gas.  It also has potential for electricity generation and as a heat source.  Some of that is a little bit in the future and there are some technical challenges.  Certainly, where significant heat is needed, for example in cement and construction, there may be opportunities as well.</p> <p>  Obviously, the key is getting the regulatory authority in place and the legislation through.  The Maritime Area Planning Bill is going through the Oireachtas at the moment.  When that is complete, we can open up for further applications particularly on the west coast.  New technologies, such as offshore floating wind, may have potential in the Shannon Estuary, the south east etc.  Other parts of the country will also be well positioned for those.  We have a supply chain in offshore wind and the renewables area which can pivot and develop into the hydrogen space in addition to early adoption.  In budget 2022, the Minister for Finance signalled the Government's willingness to get behind the use of hydrogen in transport.  We also see an all-island opportunity.  As the Deputy will know, a significant number of hydrogen buses are produced on the island and that presents us with further opportunities.</p> <p>  There are also opportunities with biomass and anaerobic digestion, as well as in the forestry sector and agriculture.  The climate action plan will be an area for a cross-Government collaboration, particularly on the emissions side.  Our most recent &euro;70 million investment under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve is very much focused on carbon reduction throughout the supply chain, not just the production and processing at plant level but how we push that back to farm level.</p></speech>

They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacancy between them and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  We are actively encouraging members to attend remotely if possible.  I ask for their full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to the parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant both to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are aware of the note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside of the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Karina Doorley, Dr. Niall Farrell and Dr. Kieran McQuinn.  I thank the witnesses very much for attending today.  The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the topic of inflation.  This is the middle session of three sessions during which we will look at this very current issue.  The committee would like to discuss the drivers of inflation, policy responses and budget 2022, and the impact of inflation in that context.  I will now turn to our witnesses to give their opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Niall Farrell and Dr. Kieran McQuinn.  We are grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee today to provide our views on inflation.</p> <p>  The post-pandemic circumstances that we are currently facing are just as unprecedented as the pandemic itself.  Understanding the inflationary pressures currently being experienced across most western economies requires us first to recount the deflationary pressures of last year.  These base effects combined with the uneven responses of global supply and demand, along with the pressures in international energy markets, are the main drivers of the inflation currently being experienced.</p> <p>  At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and its accompanying public health restrictions, a significant portion of the economy came to a halt as households remained indoors and paused normal activities.  This disruption led to a sharp contraction in the demand for goods and services typically consumed by households and, consequently, prices declined in 2020 and early 2021.  These declines are key to understanding the magnitude of inflation now.  After a period of deflation, even a modest increase in prices due to increased demand can result in significant rates of inflation.</p> <p>  It is worth plotting the annual change in the consumer price index, CPI, of all products, as well as the CPI excluding energy products since 2017.  It is useful to see the effects energy products have had on the CPI throughout 2021.  Since March, the CPI excluding energy products has remained significantly lower than the overall CPI.  In October, the CPI excluding energy products stood at 3.4% compared with 5.1% for the overall CPI.</p> <p>  Prior to 2021, two issues which immediately stand out from the graph are the relatively low and stable rate of inflation over the period 2017 to 2020, at a time when the Irish economy was growing strongly, and the sharp deflation which took place during 2020.  The underlying strength and resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s domestic economy throughout the Covid-19 pandemic has made it uniquely vulnerable to inflationary pressures.  Ireland alone across the EU registered positive GDP growth in 2020, while the more indicative measure of Irish economic activity of modified domestic demand is set to grow at a faster pace than output growth across most other European countries.  The strength of the underlying economy means demand is growing more rapidly in Ireland, resulting in greater inflationary pressures.</p> <p>  Meanwhile, the rebound in demand is coinciding with a sluggishness in international supply.  For example, shipping firms, expecting a slowdown in trade during lockdown periods, idled the global fleet by more than 10%.  When households, especially in America, began to spend their pent-up savings and government-provided pandemic payments, shipping firms and manufacturers were ill-prepared to meet the global surge in demand.  Instead, producers have found themselves unable to keep up with orders, container ports have faced significant backlogs, and shipping rates have rocketed.  These strains on supply chains are another pandemic-induced pressure point on price inflation.</p> <p>  While these issues are being felt globally, one area in which inflationary pressures are particularly pronounced in Ireland is the property market.  After transport costs, housing and fuel costs were the second largest increase in the CPI according to the latest CSO data.  Much like other goods and services, the housing market has experienced robust demand along with a slowdown in supply during the pandemic.  Housing demand was largely unaffected during Covid-19 due to the provision of significant Government welfare assistance.  Indeed, the perceived increase observed in the savings rate of Irish households may have actually contributed to an increase in housing demand.  Consequently, house price inflation in August of this year is just under 11% per annum.  It should also be said that rental inflation is experiencing increases.  With more and more people expected to return to urban areas as workplaces reopen, it is likely that rental pressures will continue to grow over the next six to nine months.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, issues concerning the supply side of the housing market stem from pre-Covid vulnerabilities in the Irish economy as well as the effects of the pandemic.  Housing supply, already falling short of demand before 2020, suffered additional slowdowns as the public health measures contributed to a physical delay in housing construction.  The slowed pace of construction is further hampered by a marked increase in the costs of construction inputs due to supply chain disruptions.  These factors are constraining housing supply at a time when a significant imbalance already existed between supply and demand in the Irish market.</p> <p>  I now turn to energy.  European commodity prices have experienced unprecedented growth in recent months.  While oil prices have risen, primarily due to production lagging growth in demand, rising gas prices have been the primary driver.  Gas prices in October 2021 were 400% more expensive than April 2021, leading to European wholesale electricity prices rising by an average of 200%.</p><p>This growth has been driven by rapid increase in demand due to economic recovery, which has been met with constraints on supply.  A number of factors have contributed to European supply constraints.  International investments in oil and natural gas have declined in recent years as a result of two commodity price collapses, while policies to scale up clean energy sources and technologies to fill the gap have been lagging.  In addition, supply has been further constrained by maintenance work which was shifted from 2020 to 2021.  Large-scale storage facilities usually provide a buffer during tight market conditions.  However, a cold winter in 2020-21, and planned closure of certain storage facilities, resulted in depleted European stocks leading into autumn and winter 2021.</p><p> Finally, international competition for gas imports has further compounded fuel price growth in Europe.  International trends are likely to lead to sharp upward pressure on energy prices in Ireland.  For gas and electricity, current information suggests this will persist during winter 2021-22, and that prices may fall in spring 2022.  Oil prices will be primarily determined by the production decisions of international producers.</p><p> Budget 2022 can take measures directed at maintaining household standards of living.  On the taxation side, tax credits and bands were increased by more than forecast inflation.  While the standard rate band has been raised in some recent budgets, this marks the first increase in the personal and PAYE tax credits since 2008, and means that the after-income tax purchasing power of those earning enough to pay income tax will rise slightly in real terms, as long as the inflation outturn is similar to forecast levels.  Unlike income tax credits and bands, most of the corresponding thresholds for PRSI and the universal social charge, USC, were held fixed in nominal terms, amounting to an effective PRSI and increase for many taxpayers.  Although most excise duties were frozen in cash terms, amounting to an effective cut, given rising prices, tobacco products tax was increased.  There was also a well-flagged increase to the carbon tax.  A carbon tax is the most efficient way of incentivising carbon abatement, with the larger literature finding that such taxes would reduce emissions in Ireland, with few wider economic costs.  However, there is also widespread recognition that carbon taxes can have distributional consequences because lower income households spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on carbon-intensive goods, in particular, heat and fuel.  As a result, a carbon tax can have a regressive impact in the absence of an accompanying package of compensation measures.  One should, therefore, consider the impact of the carbon tax increase on households' income in conjunction with other changes to the tax and welfare system.</p><p> On the welfare side, budget 2022 saw increases to most social welfare payments.  There were significant, above-forecast inflation increases to the fuel allowance and the additional payments made to those living alone or with dependent children in receipt of social welfare payments.  Recipients of these benefits are more likely to be at risk of poverty and to spend a high share of their income on fuel than social welfare recipients living with other adults, making the measures well targeted to mitigate the adverse impacts of the carbon tax increase on vulnerable, low-income households.</p><p> There were smaller increase in the main social welfare payments for working age couples without children.  There was also a substantial increase in funding for the providers of registered childcare, accounting for around half of all childcare in Ireland, who commit to freezing their prices.  Changes to the national childcare scheme, NCS, which subsidises registered childcare, were also announced.  The universal subsidy, which currently pays 50 cent per hour for children under three, will be extended to cover children up to the age of 15, and the hours covered by the NCS for children in school or preschool will be increased.</p><p> In its post-budget analysis, the ESRI compared the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 to a price-adjusted set of policies, which would have kept household purchasing power constant in real terms.  Figure 2 illustrates the impact of budget 2022 across the distribution of household income, adjusted for family size, with the population divided into ten equally sized groups or deciles, ordered from lowest to highest income, left to right.  The effect of direct tax and welfare measures, indirect tax measures and changes to the NCS are shown separately, with the total effect represented by the solid blue line.  The overall effect of budget 2022, compared to price-adjusted policies, is that, on average, disposable income is virtually unchanged.  There are small and average gains in the lower two deciles and upper four deciles, which are counteracted by small income losses in the middle four deciles.  Although increases to the carbon tax and tobacco duty disproportionately affect lower-income households, these also gain from above-inflation increases to core social welfare payments and supplements for those living alone or with dependents.  These increases are sufficiently large to offset the impact of increases to indirect taxes for the lowest-income fifth of households and will leave poverty slightly lower than had all welfare payments and tax bands kept pace with inflation.  While the above-inflation indexation of income tax bands and credits will also compensate higher-income households for the increases in indirect taxation, most USC and PRSI bands were not changed.  The effect of that is to reduce the after-tax purchasing power of lower earners who do not earn enough to pay income tax, though some of those will gain from an increase to the minimum wage.</p><p> From a policy perspective, it is important to recognise that the current and forecast inflationary pressures are essentially of a temporary or transitory manner.  The surge in demand will abate as consumers unwind savings and slowly regress to their pre-pandemic savings ratio.  Firms will continue to improvise and navigate through the supply chain disruptions until global trade returns to normal levels.  While monitoring authorities and forecasters generally may underestimate these inflationary pressures, this does not mean that the same authorities should react in a somewhat hasty manner by prematurely increasing policy interest rates.  That, as noticed by Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, could result in monitoring authorities threatening the nascent economic recovery which is apparent across countries.</p><p> If inflation in 2022 is in line with forecasts, the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 will compensate most households for rising prices.  If inflation exceeds forecasts, the increases to some targeted welfare measures, such as the fuel allowance, living alone allowance and qualified child increases, may not be enough to insulate low-income households from rising prices.  The European Commission has published a toolbox discussing measures of support for consumers in the face of a temporary rise in energy prices.  Suggested interventions include the temporary deferral of bill payments, adjustments to VAT and levies and short-term adjustments to social payments to aid the vulnerable.  In an Irish context, short-term adjustments to social transfers and facilitating the deferral of bill payments are likely to be the most effective policy options, as taxes and levies comprise a lesser proportion of total electricity expenditure in Ireland relative to many EU countries and many social payments are already targeted towards vulnerable households.</p></speech>

The rising costs of everyday household budgets are putting pressure on many people I deal with.  An awful lot of people are going to be paying extra for diesel to get in and out of work where public transport is not available.  The costs of electricity bills and so on are also rising.  The carbon tax is a visible measure and people will see it coming through on a tank of diesel.  How much of an impact do our guests think that will have on the overall picture of inflation?  Dr. Doorley also pointed to external influences.  Energy and gas, in particular, have been identified as drivers of inflation.  Which will have the bigger influence and what extent of influence will the carbon tax and international prices have?</p> <p>  The ESRI examined the possibility of those prices levelling off, possibly by spring 2022.  Is that going to be enough to ease pressure here or is it already going to be driving other costs across the household budget at that stage?  How comfortable are our guests that this inflation pressure is temporary?  Is there a longer-term element to it?</p> <p>  Dr. Doorley pointed to housing, whether buying or renting.  We have seen a continued increase in pricing there.  Would our guests expect that to drive further pressure across the economy through increased wages and so on?</p><p>The witnesses highlighted that Ireland has been more resilient here than across the EU and that there is more of a bounce-back.  They suggest there is almost a mismatch.  Would they expect that such a mismatch would continue?  If it did, and there were measures taken across the EU to deal with inflation and we are already mismatched with Europe, how would that affect us here?  What would be the long-term outlook of something like that?</p></speech>

Our post-budget analysis included the carbon tax.  We looked at the effect of direct and indirect tax measures on household incomes.  That included the increase by the carbon tax.  Even accounting for the increase to the carbon tax next year, households are on average no worse off as a result of tax and welfare measures in budget 2022.  That is because the carbon tax disproportionately affects low-income households because their fuel bill is a larger share of their overall consumption but there were well targeted increases to some social welfare payments that manages to compensate those households for the extra expenditure that they will incur as a result of the carbon tax.  Taking the impact inflation on top of the carbon tax increase, if it does not exceed the forecasts which are around 2% or 3% next year, then low-income households should be reasonably well insulated from the impact of inflation and from the carbon tax increase.  In other parts of the income distribution, depending on how much inflation exceeds forecasts, some households may be left worse off.  However, for the lowest income households, the direct tax and welfare measures announced in budget 2022 should compensate them from carbon tax increases and forecast inflation.</p></speech>

On a litre of fuel, carbon tax accounts for around 10 cent per litre.  The vast majority of the increase comes from the international price increases.  Gas is similar.  On whether this will last forever, the current projection is that the price being paid on international markets for delivery of gas in spring tends to fall back to what one would expect outside the current increases in fuels.  Given what we know now, we would expect the prices the resolve around then.  What happens in the longer term is predicated on how European supply channels become resolved.</p></speech>

Those are the four ways that we look at it in overall terms.  The base effect issue will resolve itself over the next period.  Most people seem to think that supply chain issues will be resolved in the next six to nine months as economies come back on stream and normal economic activity begins to convene across most countries.  Dr. Farrell spoke of easing of pressures around energy costs.  The vast majority of the pressures there at present should begin to resolve themselves quite considerably over the next six to nine months.  The housing issue is where you could see a lingering effect beyond that.  Ireland is not the only country experiencing this phenomenon.  Housing costs are increasing across Europe and even in North America.  Those relate to a lot of factors, some of which are connected, such as the build-up of savings during the pandemic.  However, between house prices and rents you will see upward pressure over the next six to nine months and even beyond that.  We would be reasonably confident that the other pressures will begin to abate.  Initially, policymakers were quite confident in asserting that they felt it was a temporary transitory issue and giving dates for when they saw the inflationary pressures ease.  I think there is a little less confidence now and people are coming around to the view that the pressures will last a little longer than initially thought and that the inflation rates will be a little higher.  However, I think the basic core drivers of inflation are issues which should be resolved in the next six to nine months.</p></speech>

Very often we found over the last 25 years that the economic cycle in Ireland has been slightly different from that in other countries across Europe.  Interest rates and monetary policy are set at a euro area-wide level so it is what the euro area economy in general or in aggregate is doing, and very often we have been out of sync with that.  We grew very fast in the initial part of the 2000s and have grown very strongly over the past five or six years at a time when most euro area countries have had sluggish growth.  It is a phenomenon that we have had in the Irish economy.  We expect very strong growth next year as well as very strong growth this year.  That would put us at the higher end of the growth table, as far as most euro area countries are concerned.  The bounce-back effect will be somewhat stronger in Ireland than in most European countries.</p></speech>

The thing that I really want to get on top of is carbon tax.  I know that the ESRI factored that into its analysis, but the cost of living is going up.  The weekly shopping is going up as are travel costs.  How sustainable is that?  I know we say that there are international reasons for the fuel costs going up but fuel costs drive up every other cost.  There is a ricochet effect.  How will that be dealt with?  With carbon tax, it is costing some people more now because they do not have access to public transport.  They have no alternative methods of travelling to the car.  There does not seem to be any just transition for that.  People say that it is only a small fraction of the overall cost of the fuel but fuel is expensive anyway and this is just adding more cost to it.  People are paying the carbon tax but they are not realising any of the benefits.  How do we approach that?</p> <p>  I want to raise another thing.  I do not know if it is in the ESRI's remit.  There are discussions around fiscal restraints coming back in from the EU.  How does the ESRI see Ireland being positioned with the level of funding and debt that we have in the medium term?</p><p>My last question is on interest rates and the cost of borrowing from the point of view of the State and businesses.  Does the ESRI see any issues with that?  It said Ireland is in a very good position to bounce back and that is probably based on the prudent measures taken since the previous recession.  How do we create resilience and build capacity without driving inflation out of control?  That is my concern.  It is about overheating the economy, in other words.</p></speech>

There is a commitment to increase the carbon tax by a certain amount every year for very good reasons, namely, because we want to invoke behavioural change to help with the climate crisis.  The purpose of the carbon tax is to increase the price of carbon in certain fuels, diesel and petrol in order to invoke this behavioural response.  What we are seeing currently is a bit different from that.  Obviously, we have supply-side pressures driving fuel price growth.  With the two of these together, it is unfortunate there is a carbon price increase and then these other supply-side effects at the same time.  However, the European Commission has come out with a sort of toolbox to help with what it perceives to be transitory changes to fuel prices at the moment.  The steps policymakers can take to help with the current pressures involve allowing bill deferments, perhaps increasing some social welfare payments temporarily and other measures like that.  The Commission does not advocate rolling back on carbon taxes because that is a long-term policy with well-stated objectives.  I suppose the issue is how to deal with the current inflationary pressures that come on top of the increased carbon taxes.  Perhaps Dr. Farrell will say something on that.</p></speech>

If we think about carbon tax plus changes to the tax and welfare systems plus planning and other infrastructural changed, they all help each other.  In a scenario where we have a carbon tax that would help somebody to adopt a better alternative means of transport, for example, where one is available, that needs to work in conjunction with good development planning to help ensure those options are available.  In circumstances where people cannot change, vulnerable households will be left no worse off provided good distribution policies in place, and carbon taxes have been accompanied by such policies in the Irish context in many cases.  The ideal scenario is to adopt the policies and provide an option so that the policies work well together in combination.</p></speech>

They may believe that people living in rural Ireland who cannot access public transport are all on social welfare.  Many are working and paying their taxes and will not benefit from an increase in social welfare payments.  The people I am talking about are the working people who, through carbon tax, must pay more to go to work to support the economy and their families.  They have no alternative and will not have one for a good few years yet.  Where is the just transition for them?  It is argued that we should increase social welfare benefits but the people I know who are paying more in carbon tax to put fuel in their cars to go to work have no recourse.  Perhaps an additional tax credit could be provided to neutralise the additional carbon tax for those who have to use their cars.  They are the people who seem to be paying all the time.</p></speech>

We looked at the effect of the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures across the income distribution.  While the poorest households were well compensated, the highest income households were also well compensated because of the increases to tax bands and credits.  It was really about the middle income households who were earning too much to benefit from social welfare but not enough to benefit from the increase in the standard rate band.  Those households were not fully compensated for the increase in the carbon tax.</p></speech>

Most people believe that if reverted to the exact rules in place before the pandemic, many countries could be in difficulty over the next couple of years.  This idea of aiming for a 60% debt-to-GDP ratio when many countries have been increasing their debt would pose significant issues for countries such as Italy and others which have been increasing their spending.  In an Irish context, the strength of our recovery is such that we believe we will have double-digit GDP growth this year and very strong growth again next year.  We can talk about how valid the debt-to-GDP ratio is in an Irish context.  However, if we take it as the measure, and it is the measure used with the fiscal rules, the economy will probably be in a better position by the end of even this year than it was just before the pandemic.  Even though we increased our debt and borrowing, the economy actually grew by such an amount and is likely to grow by such an amount that we are in a better position than we were going into the pandemic.  I think that will be a surprise to many people but that is the nature of the strength of the recovery.  As I said, we could have a separate discussion on how accurate GDP is in this context but compared with most other countries in Europe, Ireland will be in a relatively good position going forward, from that perspective.  Again, the strength and pace of our recovery are the key issue there.</p> <p>  On interest rates, the Deputy raised a very interesting question.  Obviously, the interest rate is the key monetary policy tool used to curb inflation.  It is what the ECB would typically use if it were trying to actively reduce the rate of inflation.  The danger is that if interest rates were raised at this point, many countries are only beginning to recover and come back on track with respect to normal economic activity.  European authorities, especially the ECB and the European Commission, probably learned from the mistakes of the financial crisis where the large institutions, whether it was the ECB or the Commission, did not really help the initial phase of recovery countries were experiencing after the financial crisis.  There was too much of a focus on curbing expenditure and countries getting their fiscal policies back in shape.  Those lessons have been learned.  The major authorities are trying to accommodate the recovery as much as possible and that has been reflected in much of the commentary, even from the ECB in recent times.  It notes the higher inflation, believes it will work itself out over the next six to nine months and will not start raising interests any time soon because of the dangers that could pose to the recovery across the euro area.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of overheating.  It is a valid point in the sense that we would have been talking about the potential for the Irish economy to overheat just before the pandemic.  Obviously, the pandemic has had its impact.  As we come out of the pandemic and the economy grows very strongly, that will raise certain issues for us as well.  The ESRI has, for instance, called for greater capital investment in areas such as housing.  Climate change is another area.  That is important and necessary going forward but it means that when increasing expenditure, particularly on capital, in the context of an economy that is growing very strongly, it will require showing discipline on the current expenditure side to ensure the economy does not overheat.  That will become a key fiscal and broader macro challenge for the authorities over the next period.</p></speech>

We appreciate very much their considered opinions on all these matters.  I have great concerns, as I am sure all those in the ESRI do, regarding where exactly we are going from an economic point of view in the context of small to medium-sized businesses and the effect of the ever-increasing cost of the basics and the knock-on effects that will have on those businesses.  By basics, I mean energy and fuel costs, which relate to everything.  As I continuously say, from the moment you get up in the morning, whether it is brushing your teeth or anything that follows, everything that you need comes on wheels.  It does not fall out of the sky.</p> <p>  The majority of things in this country are imported in containers.  I am acutely aware of the cost of containers.  Not so long ago, you could get a container for between &euro;1,800, and &euro;3,500, whereas now you can pay &euro;8,000, &euro;9,000 or &euro;10,000 for the same container.  That is a startling fact.  What is more, when you go looking for that container, there is a wait and a buy-in time that was not there before, which affects supply, of the basic necessities we get in or anything else.</p> <p>  I run a small shop and I see simple changes happening.  It is not just in my shop, it is in every shop.  To take a random example, you cannot at certain times get either grapefruit or grapefruit juice of any type or description in any shop in the country.  That can go on for a week, ten days or two weeks, and then all of a sudden they will come in again.  That is just one item out of what might be 10,000 items in a large shop or 2,500 items in an ordinary, small shop.  We are going through these phases of not having items.  Some of them we can do without and, to be blunt about it, there is a fear of us, but there are other staples we need from the building supplies point of view.  We all know about the price of steel and timber and other basics.</p> <p>  I have to say this all the time because it is not as though I am somebody who has his head stuck in the sand.  I am not a person who looks around me and says I am a climate change denier, that this is all a load of rubbish or that I do not agree with that.  I am not for one moment saying that, and I hate it when people try to paint me as a character who says that because I do not.  It is the exact opposite.  What I am arguing against is the way in which we are driving this.  For instance, we talk about it as a given that we have to tax carbon-related fossil fuels because we have to discourage people.  I have never in my life voted for an increase in the price of tobacco at budget time because I do not think the right way to stop people smoking is by heavily taxing someone who feels he or she has to smoke, or who smokes for different reasons such as psychiatric problems.  I do not agree with the idea of taxing and taxing certain items.</p> <p>  The Government has got it so wrong on certain issues.  We are bringing in 4,000 tonnes of peat at the time - it is a well-known fact - but the carbon footprint of that is coming in from Latvia because we shut Bord na M&oacute;na.  Our peat is staying in the ground but we are bringing in peat from Latvia.  We are bringing in briquettes by the thousands of tonnes from Germany - they are selling very well - while we are closing our own Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquette factory.  The Government does not have a monopoly on getting it right.</p> <p>  Some might say I am pointing out the things that are wrong and ask me what should be done.  There are actions the Government could take.  For example, it could waive the increase in VAT from the carbon tax to alleviate fuel poverty.  Similarly, because insulation products are so expensive, it could remove the VAT take on them.  It is rubbish for the Government and the people who support it to say grants are available.  I challenge them to apply for the grants and see how they get on.  If they are an older person looking for the full, 100% grant, I challenge them to see how they get on.  I deal with this every day.  They will be faced with a wait of up to two years.  Imagine if anybody at this meeting was told that he or she had to wait two years for assistance for anything.  It might not be the end of the world to us but I ask members to think of one thing.  They are all diligent and thoughtful people.  I challenge them to let on they are almost 80 years old and want to insulate their home.  Some bright spark will come along and say, "Oh yes, you can have this grant, but you know you must wait two years for it."  Two years is a fairly long time when you are an older, perhaps vulnerable and cold person.  Two years is a lifetime.  The Government is ignoring that fact and blowing about how it is putting so much into grants.  It should do something immediate that will reduce the cost of the insulation product immediately.  It should do away with much of the tax take on it.</p> <p>  Those types of measures are sensible moves we could make straight away that would give credibility to what the Government is trying to do.  People are only now starting to realise because it is hitting home when they see the increases in the cost of energy and how difficult it will be for them to heat their homes.  People are told to change from using fossil fuels to, say, an air-to-water system, but does anybody know how much such a system costs?  I do, and I know what it should cost.  It should cost between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,500 for the equipment, but &euro;18,000, &euro;20,000, &euro;22,000 and &euro;24,000 is being charged for an average house.  Why?  That is wrong.  It should not cost so much.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, the Government is not examining that or doing anything about it.  It just tells us this is what we should do.  How can people afford to do it?  They are told to change from using a petrol or diesel car to an electric car.  What is the Government doing about giving us the provision such that we will have all this electricity?  It is doing nothing.  Our energy supply nationally is going into the red in a way it never did before in that we are bordering on facing power cuts.  We will not have power cuts this winter, please God, but we will have them next year.  That will concentrate people's minds.  People who are very involved in the provision of energy in this country, who have been at this for a lifetime, have told me it is inevitable that there will be outages.  They will be planned and organised outages, but we will have them next winter if we survive this one, yet the Government is not making any provisions.</p> <p>  I am talking about this in the context of our guests' presentation because I believe it has everything to do with it.  When we talk about how we plan our finances, we do not know where we are going unless we know where we are coming from and what we are doing right now.  I am afraid the Government is unsure about what it is doing.  It is clamouring and trying to position us on the world stage.  Last week, the Taoiseach went over and gave away a couple of hundred million euro as if it had been lying around on the ground to be kicked around the place.  We are not thinking this through.  I acknowledge that our guests cannot comment on this but, with the way the Government is hanging, between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, they are all holding on to one another and everyone is afraid to kick to touch on anything.  All the people supporting them are tied in to this thing together.  It is a case of them keeping peddling this as hard as they can to keep it afloat.  At the end of the day, we are charged with representing voters, the people, whether they are vulnerable people, young couples or older people, and we are supposed to take care of their welfare.  I refer to their financial matters, their health, their education and all the other aspects of their life.  We are supposed to take care of that but we are not doing so.  The Government is doing nothing to curb inflation and everything to increase it.</p><p>They are doing everything to increase inflation because they are hitting all the basics.</p></speech>

Something that we have noted even during the pandemic is the varied impact that the pandemic has had on the economy.  In general terms, we make the point that the economy has come through the pandemic well and is set to grow strongly next year and the year after.  That masks substantial differences beneath the surface.  Some sectors of the economy have been completely unaffected.  Some have benefited, considering some of the exports last year.  Other sectors of the economy have been practically wiped out and have experienced significant difficulties, including the hospitality and tourism sectors.  There has been a different effect on different sectors of the economy.  This also applies from a regional perspective.  Some parts of the country have fared reasonably well and others have been badly affected.  There are significant differences in how the pandemic has affected the country and as we hopefully come out of the pandemic, there will be significant differences regarding areas of the economy that will be impacted and other areas that may fare more robustly.</p> <p>  The supply chain is a relevant issue.  Interesting work has been done internationally to look at the effect of the supply chain issue on inflation.  The Bank for International Settlements looked at the effect of inflation in the eurozone and the USA.  It is clear that the supply chain and difficulties associated with it are a significant factor which influences inflation rates in both the eurozone and the USA.  Most people would expect that, but it is interesting to see it borne out by the figures and analysis.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned building supplies and steel.  We have often talked about the housing issue in the institute.  Housing is one of the main areas that has been adversely impacted by the pandemic because the demand has remained strong, and was almost bolstered by the increase in savings witnessed over the last year or so.  As those savings begin to come back into the economy, much seems to be going into the housing market.  The supply side of the market was especially adversely impacted through the restrictions and the building sites being shut down for a period, and through the increase in costs in key areas, including steel and labour.  That will have effects that last for a time.  As I said in response to an earlier question, the one area where I expect lingering inflationary costs for the economy in the medium term is the housing market, because of the specific nature of the difficulties for the economy at present.</p> <p>  Dr. Doorley might want to talk about the carbon tax again.  I am not an environmental economist.  My colleagues in the institute make the point about carbon taxes that to impact behaviour, it appears, insofar as there is ever unanimity in economic literature, increasing and levying carbon taxes is an important conclusion from much of the analysis and results, domestically and internationally.  That is a fairly unanimous conclusion.  It is a cornerstone of the Government's approach to meeting our emissions targets.  I do not know if Dr. Doorley or Dr. Farrell want to add to that.</p></speech>

An interesting international analysis was to look at the effect of a subsidy on its own compared with a carbon tax.  When there is a subsidy to make renewable energy cheaper, that is fine, but then everybody switches to renewable energy and the price of the unused carbon-emitting technology goes down again and people switch back.  In order to make the change stick, carbon emitting things have to be made more expensive.  One thing arising from the previous comment is that the middle-income cohort can be constrained or negatively affected.  There are available redistribution options to target whoever is expected.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned supply constraints with regard to retrofitting.  We need to have a lot of retrofitting and housing.  Asking whether we will have the necessary capacity in the construction sector is a valid comment.</p> <p>  Regarding EirGrid and supply constraints in the electricity market, one thing to take into account is that tighter constraints are projected in the future.  There is perhaps an increased risk of something happening but it does not necessarily mean that something will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#F00700"><p>I thank the ESRI.  I apologise for not being here at the beginning.  We are discussing many of the same issues with regard to the Finance Bill as we speak.  Quite a few of us are double jobbing this evening.  I read the witnesses' paper.</p> <p>  I wanted to ask about the carbon tax and the commitment that people seem to have to it.  Perhaps there is a failure to distinguish between different types of carbon taxes.  I am in favour of carbon taxes on people who are profiting from polluting the environment with carbon dioxide.  I do not accept that it changes behaviour if financial penalties are imposed on people for using fossil fuels where they have no choice.  There has to be a distinction.  If the witnesses suggested taxing the profits of the aviation sector and companies such as Ryanair, or Larry Goodman and the big beef processors, I would say to load it on.  If the tax is going to be applied to the small farmer or the family living in social housing, it is a different matter.  For example, if the council will not insulate a family's home for the next decade and they have to increase the heat.  People who are well-paid do not have to because their homes are well-insulated or they can afford to make up the difference between grants and the cost of retrofitting, while a family in private rented accommodation or social housing would not be allowed to do it even if they could get the money.  Those people will not change their behaviour because they cannot.  They are prohibited at every level from changing their behaviour and they are being punished in a situation where they are doing nothing wrong.  That is the misapplication of carbon taxes.  We have to speak out strongly about it.</p> <p>  If we do not challenge that type of carbon tax, there is a danger that we will make the least well off, the most vulnerable and the people who are least guilty of carbon pollution, hostile to the climate action agenda.  There is no doubt in any study, globally, domestically, or anywhere else, that the rich emit far more carbon than the poor.  This will punish the least guilty.</p><p>They will be made hostile to it and pushed into the hands of climate sceptics.  I therefore appeal to the economists in the ESRI to distinguish between carbon taxes that punish people who are not in a position to change their behaviour because of price signals and those who essentially make money from polluting, carbon-heavy industry.</p><p> The witnesses say some of the inflationary pressures we see at the moment are specific to Covid, with people saving money and then starting to spend it again because things reopen, if I understand correctly, and are specific to slowdowns in particular sectors in which demand fell off during Covid.  Are there any lessons to be learnt about our vulnerability to these kinds of inflationary pressures from Covid?  To me, the lesson that has to be learnt from it, particularly when looking at energy but also in any other area, is that the more you plan and the less you depend on the swings and roundabouts of markets responding in particular ways to particular situations, the more you are able to cope with these kinds of situations.  I ask the witnesses for their opinion on that.  You are more vulnerable to these swings or moments of inflationary surge if there are areas which are completely dependent on private market actors to determine supply at critical moments, particularly when that supply is of things that are critical to the sustaining of the economy.</p><p> I have one last question.  I want to give the witnesses time to come back in.  Dr. McQuinn said we need to ramp up capital investment in a whole range of areas - and I agree with him - such as housing, retrofit, public transport, forestry, to mention another thing that has come up a lot this week, and many other areas.  I would add third level education because if we do not have the skilled, trained workforce to do a lot of the things we need done, apprenticeships and so on, that will create bottlenecks and inflation.  Dr. McQuinn says, however, that if we are to do that, we have to be careful about current spending.  Could he identify where we should cut back on current spending?  I worry about that.  It sounds a little like austerity.  Should we not at least point to the other possibility rather than cut back?  Often even the distinction between current and capital is lost on me a little in certain areas.  With increased investment in education, where does capital and current begin and end?  I am not quite sure.  We need more teachers and more school buildings.  Maybe the witnesses could comment on that.  It seems to me that there is an alternative, which is to look at the distribution of income and wealth in our society and tax policies that will give us more revenue by redistributing wealth and profits, which we have seen grow very significantly over the Covid period but which tend to be concentrated among small groups at the top of business and the top of our society.</p></speech>

Then I will comment on vulnerabilities to swings and roundabouts and international markets.  Dr. Farrell might jump in on the energy side, and I will deal with the capital expenditure issue.  Then, in the absence of our environmental colleagues, maybe we will all talk a little about the carbon tax issues the Deputy raised.</p> <p>  Earlier I made the point that the way I look at this is that there are four different factors influencing the inflationary pressures we are experiencing now.  Some of them are specific to Covid, some may be less so and some involve existing issues we have in the economy being exacerbated by Covid.  Energy costs are clearly an international phenomenon.  The supply chain issues are very much an international post-Covid situation.  As for the base effects, prices were very low last year and there was deflation in some sectors.  Clearly, any increase in prices this year will result in fairly large swings in inflation.  Again, that is Covid-related.</p> <p>  Housing issues are a classic example of Covid compounding difficulties that were already in the market in terms of the imbalance between supply and demand.  If anything, Covid seems to have provided almost a stimulus to the demand side of the housing market in the form of the increase in savings we have seen.  There seems to be preliminary evidence to suggest that some of those savings will come back into the property market rather than into other areas of consumer expenditure.  That will stimulate to a certain extent the demand side of the market.  The supply side of the market was particularly impacted by Covid between the lockdowns and then the sharp increase in costs in certain sectors of the supply side of the market.</p> <p>  That is our overall viewpoint.  As I said, some of these issues are more Covid-specific, some are international and some involve the interaction between Covid and existing vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the domestic economy.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Farrell wish to talk about energy?  Then I will come back to the capital issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#G00300"><p>Sure.  A lot of our energy, in terms of electricity generation and heating, is sourced from gas.  Exposure to international gas prices is a function of what the price is and how much gas is used.  At the moment we use quite an amount.  To reduce that exposure, accelerating renewables and the environmental transition is perhaps the greatest long-term solution.  Regardless of any way to shield people from these prices, if we are still dependent on gas, we will still face this issue.  The renewables transition is perhaps the long-term solution in reducing our exposure to fluctuations in gas prices.  When it comes to households and carbon taxes, Dr. Doorley is probably more familiar with this, but I suggest thinking about it in terms of a combination of policies - not only with regard to carbon tax but also with regard to compensation in the form of changes to the welfare system that may help the vulnerable households the Deputy discussed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#G00400"><p>On the point about capital expenditure, the broad point is that we agree and we have put forward the case for significant investment in areas such as housing.  It is clear now that the carbon and environment area will require a significant increase in expenditure as well.  In investment terms we see big increases, or certainly sizeable increases, in capital expenditure coming over the next few years.  The issue from a macro point of view is that the economy is set to grow quite strongly.  Our expectation is that it will grow very strongly this year, next year and probably for a year or so afterwards.  The danger in that context is that we see a significant increase in capital expenditure, or expenditure generally, at a time when the economy is performing very strongly.  That can lead to overheating pressures.  I take Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that at times there is a blurred distinction between capital and current.  We are certainly not calling for any reduction in current expenditure.  What we are talking about is being disciplined about the rate of increases in current expenditure we see going forward.  As to which areas we would look at - and this may chime a little with what the Deputy says - I do not think there is much scope for any significant reductions in, for example, taxation such as personal income tax.  Greater taxation may even be called for as a way of taking the heat out of the economy.  That is the point about current expenditure.  If we see significant increases in current expenditure on top of significant increases in capital expenditure, the danger, in the context of a very strongly growing economy, is that there will be an overheating problem.  As I said, sometimes our economic cycle is not quite the same as the European one.  That has implications for monetary policy and the kinds of actions of the European authorities to control inflation.  It may well be that our inflation will be out of whack with what is going on in Europe.</p><p>That is a kind of by-product of our membership of the euro area.  That is the broader point.</p><p> On the carbon tax, I do not know if Dr. Doorley would like to jump in.  Again, going back to the earlier point, we do not have our environmental colleagues with us.  If they were here, I am sure they would echo the point we made in respect of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae&rsquo;s questions.  The evidence seems to suggest that carbon taxes are an important way of changing behaviour.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the distributional issues.  Clearly, if people do not have an alternative, then that is that is a major issue.  The research seems to point fairly conclusively to the fact that if you want to change behaviour in this area, carbon taxes are the way in which to do that.</p></speech>

I was listening to him while dining at the same time.  First, I thank the Chair.  I also thank our witnesses for their presentation.  I listened to as much of it as I could.  I was trying to do two things at the same time.</p> <p>  There are two things that come to mind.  I had agreed all day almost with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I worry about my ideological trends when that happens.  However, he wandered off anyway so I am glad to say I am back on track again now.  The Deputy is suggesting one thing that I strongly disagree with, namely, dividing society.  In the battle that is ahead, we cannot afford to divide society between rich and poor and urban and rural.  We have to include everybody.  Climate change affects everybody.  If we all stay together, we will succeed.</p> <p>  On carbon tax, it is hard to say to people that it is in their own interests and that they should swallow their medicine and it will be okay.  Carbon tax is not an end in itself.  It is a means to an end, and we have to realise that.  However, we need to have alternatives in the intervening period.  We have just spoken about that.  We cannot afford to say to people that this is it for the good of society and for the good of humanity.  We need to be able to show them graphically that we are on their side on this and that we are aware of the difficulties that this creates for some people.  The Government is trying to do that.  It is trying to address those issues through the medium of social welfare and other measures.  That is being done.  Whether it will be done sufficiently to meet the needs of the people remains to be seen.  I referred to this at another committee just a short while ago.  There is a necessity to have a plan B, should there be a sharp deterioration in weather conditions, for example, this coming winter or in the spring.  We should have some way of showing the people how we can get to where we need to go, for example, in the context of keeping them in some degree of comfort and ensuring that they have the ability to heat their homes and so forth.  At the same time, we should not create a further burden in the context of emissions.  That can be done.</p> <p>  I do not know if this matter has been debated, but I suspect it has.  Everybody believes that the farming community is totally responsible.  That is not true.  People believe that climate change only affects the farming community and that if they make the sacrifices, everything would be all over.  That is not true either.  This affects all of our society, urban and rural.  When distribution issues arise - they have already begun to do so - it will fall to us to find some other way of bringing everybody on board.  Incidentally, the jobs in the agrifood sector are not all rural based.  Many of those jobs are urban based.  If, for instance, we were to lose the jobs at the scale that has been suggested, we would have a serious breach to our economy that we could not afford.</p> <p>  What we need to do now in order to ameliorate the problem is no far as we can is sequestration.  We can do that straight away.  We can start next week, next month or next year, or we can avoid it all together, do nothing and say "It&rsquo;s not going to happen.  I do not agree with it.  It is a conspiracy." and all that kind of stuff.  If we follow that course, then in five or ten years we will have achieved nothing.  We need to concentrate now on sequestration in respect of forestry, the means by which we heat our homes, the way we drive our cars and so on.  We must also consider the degree to which modern science can come to our aid as well.  For instance, the use of hydrogen has not been pursued to any great extent.  Insofar as I am aware, an internal combustion engine can be fairly readily converted to run on hydrogen.  That is not big task at all.  It just requires the will among the scientists and the engine manufactures globally.  That matter needs to be examined.</p> <p>  I apologise to the Chair for going off on a rant.  I want to highlight the fact that we will achieve what we are seeking to do if we proceed together.  We should examine all the aspects regarding how we can deal with the sequestration; how we can change over to electric or hydrogen cars; and how we can change over to hydrogen trucks and hydrogen transport.  We cannot get on without transport.  We have to transport.  We cannot do it all on rail.  If we were to do that, we would end up having more rail infrastructure than roads.  That would not serve any useful purpose.  We need to proceed in the right fashion and keep in mind the need to ensure the maximum return on our every move.  Let us not forget this: we are lucky to have been able to come Covid-19.  Covid-19 has been very expensive.  The disease is not unique to Ireland.  The manner in which Covid-19 was dealt with in countries across the globe has been no different.  Everything has been tried but, so far, a magic bullet has not been found.</p> <p>  To go back to the original issue, I am of the view that we are on the right track.  We need to make sure that it happens.  I made the point in the past that if we had started 15 years ago to manufacture the alternatives, we would not have a problem now.  That is the issue.  We would not have a problem now.  If we continue to blame each other for what is happening - whether it is rich blaming the poor or those in urban areas blaming their rural counterparts - we will not achieve anything.  We will arrive at stalemate.  Stalemate is easy to produce and difficult to sequester, no pun intended.  We should follow the instructions.  We should also do that in the context of Covid-19 as well of course.</p> <p>  I want to finish with this point.  I mentioned it at another committee.  In the 1970s, in my constituency we built many houses without chimneys because we were told at that time that the climate was getting warmer and that we would not need as much heat in the future.  That was one of the reasons that no chimneys were put into houses.  The Government of the day had to give a grant, I think it amounted to &pound;750 or &pound;1,000, to householders to put chimneys into their houses on foot of an increase in fuel prices rising across the globe.  Everybody affected had to avail of the grant because, otherwise, they would have had no heat.  Needs must, as we say.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for allowing me in at this stage.  I am sorry that my contribution happened to take the form of a rant.  However, I look forward to the odd rant now and again.</p></speech>

When we think about the impact of carbon tax on rich households versus poor households, the recommendation is that in order to achieve behavioural change, carbon tax must be applied across the board.  However, there are obvious distributional impacts.  Poorer households spend more of their income on fuel and, as a result, they are disproportionately affected by carbon tax increases.</p><p>Poor households are also less able to switch.  They do not have the disposable income available to buy an electric car, retrofit their houses or even delay consumption if there is a temporary increase in fuel prices.  The idea is to compensate the households who cannot switch and make sure they are at least no worse off.  That was done in last year's budget and this year's budget at least for the poorest households but maybe not so much for the middle income households.  This year, there has been a slight reduction in the disposable income for middle income households compared with a price index budget, which does not quite compensate them for the carbon tax increase and something similar happened in last year's budget.  There are ways to compensate middle income households.  They might not receive social welfare but indexing the universal social charge, USC, or PRSI rates can go a long way to alleviating some pressures on those households due to an increase in carbon tax.</p></speech>

Hydrogen will be a very important resource in the long term.  It could be a very important resource in Ireland because if we get a lot of offshore wind and things like that, so have more energy than we can use, then that can be combined with hydrogen production facilities as a form of storage.  That aspect is on the horizon if the technology develops.</p></speech>

The big question for macroeconomists in the aftermath of the pandemic has been, in terms of the strength of the likely recovery and bounce-back in economies, what will happen to the savings levels that people have accumulated.  There is no doubt that savings levels did increase significantly during the pandemic for a number of reasons.  At this stage it is hard to say definitively because we do not have the actual data.  We are still forecasting and it is a very unprecedented situation that we have this kind of increase in savings to the extent that we have had.  Preliminary evidence at an international level seems to suggest that people are looking at the housing market as an area to increase their expenditure levels and, possibly, to divest some of their savings into.  We would see that as being something that is likely to occur in the domestic market for a number of obvious reasons.  We have talked about the imbalance between supply and demand and the market.  This was an issue before Covid and Covid has clearly had an impact on the supply side of the housing market.  There is a danger going forward.  I mean that people will now feel that there is a bigger imbalance but people are also aware of that.  I will not say that there will be frenzied behaviour but the expectations that people have in this regard are important.  I mean if people think there is going to be a shortage of housing then people will start to try to buy housing today because they are afraid that in six months or 12 months time that housing will be even more expensive.  That is where one could see a considerable amount of these savings going into the housing market.</p> <p>  In terms of what to do about that, like everything to do with the housing market, the ultimate solution to the problem is to increase supply.  The bottom line is that we need to significantly increase the supply of housing over the coming years as a way of dealing with the problems; in particular we must provide more social and affordable housing.  We have extensively talked about the big problem that is the high cost of housing here when compared with other jurisdictions. </p> <p>  Capital expenditure is the flipside of the increased expenditure on housing.  Again, the points that I made to Deputy Boyd Barrett are relevant.  The Government has committed to increased capital expenditure on housing.  I think there will be increased capital expenditure to do with the environmental challenge and also possibly in other areas such as Sl&aacute;intecare and the like.  One needs to maintain discipline on the current expenditure side because, without doubt, the economy will grow quite strongly over the coming years.  The employment rate has fallen quicker than any of us would have imagined so one will get to a stage where the unemployment rate could become very low again, which would indicate there is very little slack in the economy, and the danger of overheating could come into play.  It is important the Government is relatively disciplined when it comes to current expenditure.  That means taxation cuts would be very hard to justify in that context and it would need to maintain a certain discipline in terms of areas around public sector pay.  Those are the kinds of challenges that we face from a macro point of view.  If we are going to increase capital expenditure then we must ensure we do not overheat the economy.     </p></speech>

On average, the components that are attributable to taxes and levies in Ireland are much less than the EU average so there was less headroom to compensate this effect.  I have my ESB bill with me and the public service obligation or PSO levy, which is used for subsidies, comes to around &euro;13 for two months or more than &euro;6 for on month but recently the ESB announced an increase and that amounts to &euro;9.  Therefore, one hits the threshold so perhaps there is less leeway there.</p> <p>  If we changed the taxes and welfare systems then we can target those who are more vulnerable.  That comes down to deciding whether we want to help those who are most vulnerable because that might perhaps give us more bang for our buck.   </p></speech>

It can suggest that member states should consider whether the situation merits such action.  Reducing tax on fuel prices certainly is an option that might be worth looking at.  Given that we expect this to be a temporary increase then we should think in terms of temporary measures.  During the pandemic older people were asked to cocoon so the fuel allowance was increased for an extra month and a measure like that could go a long way.  A fuel allowance is only targeted at those who receive social welfare.  Other measures might be needed to target middle income earners, around the middle of income distribution, who are still constrained from switching subject to these higher fuel prices.</p></speech>

While they give that consideration I will ask a few questions.</p> <p>  I would like to return to discussing budget 2022.  We have talked a great deal about the carbon tax and the impact on people's take home and discretionary income or money in their pockets.  I would like to return to the middle income earners we discussed earlier.  The average gains were counteracted by small income losses in the middle four deciles and I ask the witnesses to expand on that effect.</p><p>Is it that the people in question are receiving no welfare payments and were not earning enough to see any impact from those tax changes?  Would a change to the working family payment have had any impact on those groups?  Do the witnesses have a suggestion on how those particular groups could be targeted if there was a wish to do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#K00200"><p>The Chair is referring to those in the middle four deciles slightly losing out due to budget 2022 compared with price index policies.  I stress that the magnitude of those effects are small.  They range from -0.2% of disposable income to 0.2% of disposable income.  What I say next should be taken in light of the fact that there is error in any sort of statistical procedure like that.  They are not terribly different from one another but the pattern is clear.  Those in the middle income deciles lose out compared with those in lower and higher income deciles.  The reason for that is twofold.  The lower income households benefited from above inflation increases to certain payments such as the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and increases for qualified children.  Households in the upper half of income distribution are benefiting from tax cuts.  The standard rate band was increased by more than forecast inflation while tax credits were also increased by more than forecast inflation.  The typical household in the middle income deciles is probably earning too much to be receiving much or anything in social welfare but it might not be earning enough to benefit from an increase in the standard rate band.  These households are not in the top tax rate so they do not benefit from a change to the standard rate band.  Sometimes they receive the working family payment, which was increased by less than inflation in the budget so that is a real income loss for those families.  Child benefit was also frozen in cash terms.  Many of those middle income families have children so that amounts to a real income loss for them as well.  The last major contributor is the fact that USC and PRSI payments were mostly frozen in nominal terms.  That means there was a real increase in the USC and PRSI burden for most households.  If they were located in the middle four deciles, those households were not benefiting from tax cuts that would have counteracted that burden.  That is what is behind that pattern.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that addressing that issue would require something like an increase in child benefit or the working family payment to target those particular households?  While I accept that the losses might be relatively low, is it correct that this is having a more significant impact on particular groups like lone parents than on other families?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#K00400"><p>An increase in the working family payment or child benefit will benefit households with children, primarily those located in the middle of the income distribution because that is where working family payment households tend to be located but it will not benefit households without children.  To target those households as well would require USC and PRSI rates to be indexed in the same way the tax bands were indexed.  After the budget, we made the point that the budget was framed around maintaining the standard of living for households in the face of rising prices.  One way to do that is to index tax bands and credits but PRSI and USC also fall into that category.  If they are not indexed, it amounts to a real increase in USC and PRSI payments for many households.  If we want to specifically target households with children, then child benefit and working family payments are good instruments to do so.  If we want to target families without children, PRSI and USC bands also need to be indexed.</p></speech>

I must admit to not being fully aware of this aspect.  Is it possible for somebody to unpack that a little?  What are the base effects as we are reading through the latter half of 2020 and to what extent is current inflation a result of those base effects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#K00600"><p>That is why we included a graph with our opening statement.  We wanted to show that there was disinflation or price falls last year for a number of goods and services.  The base effects idea concerns price levels versus growth rates.  We always focus on the growth rate when we talk about inflation but if looking at the price levels we see that even if we have a strong increase in prices this year, the level may not be much different from where the long-term price level would be for those goods and services.  The fact that there was a fall in prices last year means that even if there is a small increase in prices in those goods and services this year, it can show up a big increase in inflation and the price change.  In the analysis that has been done, more internationally than domestically, to break down the current components of inflation, a certain element of it is the base effect and then the supply chains are another element.  That is the work I referred to and the Bank for International Settlements has done a lot of work trying to break out the impact of the supply chain disruptions on inflation.  The energy cost increases then come in on top of that.  Those are the three major components in an international context but we have them in Ireland as well.  The housing element mainly comes through in higher rents on the cost side.</p></speech>

It is a bit like the impact of the pandemic generally.  Certain sectors of the economy were completely unaffected by the pandemic and some sectors did better during the pandemic than they normally would have, for example, medicinal exports and the like.  Those areas would not have experienced any deflation or disinflation and prices in them would have continued to do whatever they normally would have done.  It is in other areas such as the hospitality sector, tourism and certain elements of the retail sector that price falls would have been experienced in past year and as a result, those are the areas that will be most prone to the base effects this year when the demand picks up.  When the demand surges and people come back into shops and normal economic activity resumes, it will cause the prices of those goods to surge as well.</p></speech>

Is it likely that the ECB will increase rates in the coming months or year?  What mechanisms does our Central Bank have to control or mitigate the rate of inflation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran McQuinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021111700002#K01000"><p>Our Central Bank is limited as inflation and monetary policy are conducted at the level of the euro area.  The base rates or key policy rates are determined at the level of the euro area and, for good or ill, they are determined on the basis of what is happening across the euro area economy.  I made the point earlier that since we joined the euro area, we sometimes have a disconnect between how our economy is performing and how the euro area as a whole is performing.  That issue can have implications for the impacts of monetary policy because it is set at a euro area level and is not always specific to the problems of individual countries like Ireland.</p> <p>  If we look at the commentary of the European Central Bank, from its president to its chief economist who gave a significant speech recently, it is evident that the ECB will not raise rates over the next six to nine months.  It is cognisant that the recovery across the euro area is still at a nascent or early stage.  The ECB is afraid that if it were to raise rates, it would choke off the recovery and have a negative impact on it generally.  It is also probably cognisant that if it does anything on policy rates, there is a danger that it could have a knock-on effect on the rates that the sovereigns face when it comes to borrowing.</p><p>Obviously, a lot of sovereigns and individual countries have been increasing their borrowing quite significantly over the past year.  We do not want any tremors as far as sovereign rates are concerned because that could have quite an adverse impact on sentiment and the perceived sustainability of the increase in borrowing that many countries have engaged in.  I do not think the ECB is going to engage in any policy increases or make changes to its policy rates over the next six to nine months.  Of course, there is the issue of the other policy which it has at present, namely, the asset-purchasing schemes.  There may be some pressure brought to bear on the ECB to taper or start to reduce those asset purchases.  However, I do not envisage any immediate effect on policy rates until the summer of next year at the very earliest.</p></speech>

What policies do they, as experts in the field, think the Government should consider due to the increased level of inflation we are seeing?</p></speech>

On the housing side, there is always pressure in terms of dealing with the issues there.  To go back to the point I made in response to an earlier question, the only thing the Government can do that will have a sustainable and long-lasting impact in that area is to try to achieve as great an increase in supply as possible.  That is the ultimate solution to the housing difficulties, particularly in the provision of cheaper social and affordable housing.  That is the key policy conclusion in that area.  Those are the kinds of changes that can help to reduce housing costs in the economy which are long-term costs.  A lot of the increasing costs we are talking about at present are relatively short term and are related to the pandemic.  The real long-term high costs in the Irish economy when we benchmark ourselves against other countries are in housing.  House prices and rents are very high compared to other countries.  This has been identified by the National Competitiveness Council and international agencies as something that we really need to tackle.</p></speech>

When it comes to budget 2023, it might be wise to take a retrospective look at how well the changes announced in budget 2022 worked in compensating households for rising prices.  Government should keep that in mind when formulating policy for budget 2023 and ask if indexation of the entire system is an appropriate response.  The answer may be "Yes" or "No".  It should ask whether there are certain groups who need to see increases in their welfare payments or whether there should be increases in the PRSI bands or the USC bands.  Government must be conscious of what happens in terms of inflation over the course of 2022 and look ahead to 2023 to make sure that purchasing power is maintained as far as possible while still allowing policy makers scope to target particular groups that they feel need additional policy instruments, for whatever reason.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to the member in the Leinster House complex or its vicinity, or another location in Leinster House 2000.  I ask the members to note that members may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed earlier as privilege to their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division in committee, members must be physically present.</p></speech>

To be clear, we are talking about affordablity.  I was talking about affordable housing all day yesterday.  I am sure the Minister will have seen the report in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>that a major Australian pension fund is investing in these types of vehicles.  As a matter of interest, I checked the CSO database this morning.  It notes in respect of pension coverage among renters that just 8.6% of renters in the State have a voluntary pension, with a medium value of &euro;24,000.  It seems our high rents are subsidising Australian pensioners.  We are helping to build a better Australia but creating a worse Ireland.  That is a deep concern.  As I said yesterday, these amendments are practical and can be taken on board.  The committee must be constructive when we discuss Finance Bills.  I would like the Minister to reconsider his position on the amendments.</p></speech>

I will pick up on some of his comments and his presentation on the tax paid in relation to these funds.  The two Sinn F&eacute;in amendments deal with the need for a report on the taxation of these funds.  The second amendment, No. 36, also relates to their exemption from capital gains tax.  Yesterday, the Minister spoke about a difference of opinion between Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael and the Government on this, and there is no doubt that there is a difference of opinion.  I would definitely not be jetting off to London to tell investors at a roadshow to continue to invest in apartments here that are beyond the reach of ordinary people.  I would have a different set of priorities.  Maybe the Minister will clarify whether he will attend this roadshow given that his colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has said he is not going.  If not, maybe the Minister will find time to meet the families affected by mica, which was the subject of another amendment we discussed yesterday.  The Minister still refuses to meet these families, despite what we believe to be the Department of Finance's opposition to a 100% redress scheme.</p> <p>  On some of the statistics the Minister placed on record yesterday, he indicated these funds paid 17.9% tax in relation to taxable events in the previous year.  That is the crucial point.  If the Government legislates to provide that certain things are not taxable events, it means no tax is paid on such events.  For instance, in the case of the disposal of a multimillion euro apartment block, a company or individual would have to pay capital gains tax at 33% and, therefore, the disposal would be a taxable event.  However, the Minister for Finance has decided that is not a taxable event and so they do not have to pay tax in relation to that.</p> <p> In relation to funds, we also know that a taxable event does not include circumstances in which there is a rent roll in one year of in excess of &euro;100 million.  That is also not a taxable event.  For a small company or a landlord with one, two or three properties, that would be a taxable event but for these funds it is not and, therefore, they do not pay any tax on that income.  The only time they pay tax is when dividends are paid to shareholders.  The Minister and members will be well aware that I and my party argued strongly for the need to introduce a dividend withholding tax to ensure these funds paid at least some tax.  Thankfully, that has been legislated for in previous Finance Bills.</p><p>However, the reality is that because of double taxation agreements those tax amounts can be written down.  We can see, even with the dividend withholding tax at 20%, that is not what the funds are paying on the disbursement of proceeds.  This goes to the core of this amendment.  It is the fact these funds are able to sell off billions of euro of Irish assets like properties and not pay CGT.</p><p> I will give the Minister an example.  In 2019 there was &euro;7 billion worth of property transactions in this State, mainly by these funds.  Despite the fact Covid-19 impacted on sales in 2020 there was more than &euro;3 billion worth of these type of transactions.  We can see it is the large funds which are involved in many of these.  I will give an example.  Kennedy Wilson sold Baggot Plaza for $165 million.  It avoided paying CGT of &euro;26 million as a result of what is in these Finance Bills.  Any other type of company or individual would have to pay the &euro;26 million.  What of Kennedy Wilson?  The Minister would say we will capture that tax when it pays dividends to its shareholders.  However, there is a game companies are at now.  Kennedy Wilson said the proceeds of the deal "... will be recycled into new opportunities, including European acquisitions and developments as part of Kennedy Wilson&rsquo;s investment management platforms".  Therefore dividends are not going to be paid out and there will be no taxable event.  What will happen is the asset pool of Kennedy Wilson will continue to increase with no tax being paid.  That is what has been facilitated here by this Minister for Finance over the last number of years.  Ireland is being sold off bit by bit, tax-free, under our noses.  It is worse than that.</p><p> It is not just that we are not getting taxes.  We know that because of the tax structure of these funds, they have the firepower to outbid other buyers on the market, be they an individual who wants to purchase a house in Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere, or a housing agency.  One such agency came out publicly over the summer to talk about these funds being able to outbid it to the tune of, I think, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 per unit price.  This is due simply to the taxation arrangements the Minister for Finance has facilitated time and again.  He has done so to the point where last year, when we were considering the Finance Bill, I argued for a surcharge on these funds in relation to buying up domestic property and the Minister flatly refused to introduce that.  This happened not just last year but in previous years, until he was embarrassed by the public and had to, overnight, rush through legislation that gave an appearance he was doing something but which in reality did not go far enough.  The question is: does the Minister accept that under the finance code he stands over funds are able to dispose of multi-million euro property portfolios without paying CGT and are able to reinvest those gains into their companies through new acquisitions, thus being completely tax-free?</p></speech>

As I said yesterday, notwithstanding the Minister's replies the decision to invite these vulture funds, investment vehicles and property speculators into this country, supposedly to assist the housing sector, will, when the history books are written, turn out to be the most disastrous decision ever taken.  Frankly, it is the biggest heist on the Irish people and has contributed to one of the worst housing crises we have ever faced.</p> <p>  The Minister maintains they are necessary because the State cannot do it all.  That was essentially the tenor of his response.  He contends that if we do not have them, we will not have the capital.  I still completely fail to see what benefit they have added.  We are talking about the big investment firms, wealth asset management companies or whatever they like to call themselves.  What they deliver is mostly apartments nobody can afford.  These are developments where the rents or prices are absolutely astronomical and completely beyond the reach of the vast majority of people.  Take Cherrywood for example.  I think &euro;15 million from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, went into putting in the infrastructure there.  It is one of the biggest residential developments in the State, if not the biggest.  Years on from that we still do not know what affordable housing we are going to get back in Cherrywood.  We are getting nothing from these people.  What we do get, we get at a vast cost, far in excess of anything we would have paid if we had provided this directly on lands, taking Cherrywood as an example, which we actually had in our possession.  These were NAMA lands.  We gave them to the funds.  They built completely overpriced stuff.  They lease a little bit back to us at astronomical cost.  We still do not know how much affordable housing we are going to get and the stuff they are selling or renting on the open market will be completely beyond affordable for the vast majority of people.  Where is the benefit from this?  There is none.  They control the market and charge astronomical rents.</p> <p>  I will give another example.  It is one I have been banging on about for four years.  It is a multi-unit complex across the road from me.  It was originally bought out by Apollo Global Management, a wealth asset management company based in the US.  Its first move was to try to increase the rent by 60%.  Its next move was to try to mass-evict everybody in the place when it could not get away with that.  Then it flipped the complex to another vulture fund, a domestic one, which has now succeeded in mass-evicting the tenants.  That fund has left quite a lot of the property empty because it has slowly and through attrition driven out the tenants.  It has sat on those empty properties, of which there are now 13, for more than two years.  Other tenants, all of whom paid their rent and who have lived there for years are all being driven out, facing homelessness and so on.  What is the fund doing?  It is driving up the value of the asset.  Then when it shifts the asset without the tenants - the only way it could finally shift the tenants and mass-evict them was by saying it was on grounds of sale - the value of that complex will have increased.  The new owner will now be able to charge rents far in excess of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, increases.  There will be no tax paid on the capital gain made on that flipping of a property and tax paid on the rental revenue derived from the fund being able to charge absolutely extortionate rent which has, by the way, resulted in people knocking on the door of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and saying they are homeless.  These are good, decent, ordinary working people.  That is what this is facilitating.</p> <p>  The Minister said there is no alternative to that.  I can think of one example.  The credit unions have been screaming at the Government for the last six or seven years saying they have &euro;5 billion they would like to use to assist the State in delivering social and affordable housing.  Credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions, beloved of the people, which are not about making money but have instead social objectives.  They are saying they would like to assist the State in the delivery of social and affordable housing.  They are being completely frustrated in their efforts to do that.  The Government would rather team up with vulture funds because apparently we need them.</p> <p>  I have one last point.  I asked the Minister about it yesterday.  We do not even know how much tax is being forgone.  The Minister said they pay this much tax.  That is a meaningless figure to trot out if we do not know how much tax is forgone.  How much money would they have paid in tax if they were subject to CGT and tax on their rental roll?  Until we know the answer to that, we cannot in any way assess the supposed benefit the Minister is imputing to these funds.  He will not convince me under any circumstances but at the very least, surely the finance and budget scrutiny committees of these Houses are entitled to know.  We do this with other tax expenditures.  Certainly this is something the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, has been pursuing very vigorously.</p><p>We believe a light needs to be shone on tax expenditures.  They need to be discussed.  This is a real cost to the Exchequer in the same way as direct public expenditure is a cost, and yet we do not know how much money is being lost from the extension of these tax breaks to these ruthless profit-hungry vulture funds.</p></speech>

We will invest &euro;2.6 billion directly through the Exchequer and a further &euro;1.5 billion through the Land Development Agency.  The funding we have, in current terms alone, for responding to our housing needs is &euro;1.4 billion.</p> <p>  What is that leading to?  This year, it is leading to the building of more than 3,600 more social homes in our country.  It is leading to 8,750 social homes in the pipeline that will be delivered.  In the context of more homes being delivered through the private sector for private ownership and for private rental than were delivered last year, it is a figure that is growing and one that will grow again next years.  The reason those figures are relevant to the debate is they show the strong role the agencies of the Government are playing in responding to the housing needs we know are there, are growing and are the cause of anxiety and frustration for so many.</p> <p>  If I created at any point last night the sense that I was tired by Opposition views on this, to respond to Deputy Farrell, that was far from my intention.  I am absolutely up for a debate on this, for this year and the years to come, but I was making the point that the contribution of real estate investment trusts, REITs, to our housing market has to be seen in the context of all the other things the Government is doing to respond to all of the housing needs in society.  Of course, I am aware of the great challenges so many face with affordability and rising prices, but I would make the point it is not only Ireland that is confronting this.  It is not only this jurisdiction and this Government.  In Northern Ireland, for example, the published figures show that, up to quarter 3 of this year, prices rose by 10.7%, year on year.  Prices are now up 13% since the start of the pandemic.  That is happening in Northern Ireland where Deputy Doherty's party is in power, where it has responsibility for housing in the Department for Communities, and it is facing into the same kind of challenges with house price inflation that are developing here and the same pressures with affordability.  That is what is happening with the price of homes - houses and apartments - there.</p> <p>  On the performance of REITs and Irish real estate funds, IREFs, and what they bring, I have made significant changes in recent Finance Bills to deal with concerns that existed and I acknowledge the role of Deputy Doherty in dealing with issues relating to their taxation.  It is worth noting that institutional investors here in Ireland own 19,500 properties, according to the Central Statistics Office, which is less than 1% of the total housing stock of our country, and information from the CSO from 2020 shows that first-time buyers purchased more than nine times the total number of properties that were purchased by property funds, real estate firms and REITs.  That is as it should be.  First-time buyers purchase multiples of the houses and apartments that were either forward funded or purchased by these entities.</p> <p>  It goes back to a point that I made last night, which is, do we want there to be any role for private savings in other countries in the delivery of more homes here in Ireland?  The contention being made by the Opposition is that it does not.  The argument it is developing overall here is that more supply, more apartments and more homes being built will not help with bringing down prices and will not help with affordability.  The argument being made is that the role of REITs and IREFs in adding to supply in Ireland in some way is contributing to the challenges we have in getting more homes built.  This debate is heading in a direction where, at a time when we need more apartments and more homes of all kinds being built, increasingly the Opposition does not see more supply playing a role in fixing the huge challenges we have with regard to the supply of housing here in Ireland.</p> <p>  If I look at the charges that have been made here in this debate up to this point, on the issue of tax, it is the case that the taxable incident happens when income leaves these funds.  It is where tax is calculated.  As that is calculated, it means that IREFs last year paid &euro;71.9 million of tax in Ireland, which is not the same as saying they do not pay any tax at all.  They do.  That is the figure for how much tax they paid last year.  The tax is paid when the income is distributed from these funds.  For example, with regard to REITs, they are legally required to distribute 85% of the proceeds or, if they do not do that, they have to reinvest either all of the proceeds of a sale, not only a gain, or pay down their debt or pay a dividend, which at that point would be subject to dividend withholding tax.</p> <p>  On the role of pensions, maybe Deputy Farrell, as the debate goes on, could clarify whether Sinn F&eacute;in is saying it is now against any pension funds, including, I assume, Irish pension funds, playing a role in the delivery of either commercial property or homes here in Ireland.  Maybe the Deputy could clarify that as the debate goes on.</p> <p>  On the role of credit unions, I continue to be open to see what role credit unions can play in the delivery of more social housing and public housing here in Ireland.  We did some work on that, in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, to try to meet some of the needs and issues they described.  It has not, as of yet, led to the delivery of the kind of housing output I was hoping would happen.</p> <p>  Overall I continue to believe the primary responsibility for the delivery of social housing here in our country rests with the Government.  We are doing that.  We have 8,700 homes now in the pipeline and we are trying to enable the private sector to build more homes for either outright purchase or rental by those who rely on the private sector to see more homes being built.</p></speech>

The Minister did not inform the committee whether he will travel to London for the roadshow to the investors and whether he has a different opinion than the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, on that.</p> <p>  Has the Minister reconsidered meeting with the families of those whose homes are literally crumbling?  The Government has not made a decision.  They want to meet the Minister.  They have appealed for the Minister to meet them online or in person.</p> <p>  There is no comparison between the North and the South in relation to house prices.  Consider anybody who is watching this debate, if he or she is living in this city.  The highest house price in the North is in Lisburn.  It is &pound;180,000.  The average house price is approximately &pound;150,000.  For Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Finance, to try to compare house prices which are out of control here with those in the North is bizarre.  I am sure, as Minister, Deputy Donohoe would also know the limitations a finance minister, regardless of which party he or she is from in the Executive, has.  They do not have the power to increase taxation on funds.  Neither do they have the power to decrease taxation on funds.  Maybe Deputy Donohoe is not aware of that but a call to the Department in the North or a call to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Conor Murphy MLA, would clarify that for him.</p><p> The Minister referred to the overall number of homes held by institutional investors.  I do not dispute his figures, but we can use figures to make any argument we want and present them in a way that suits our agendas.  I will give the Minister a different figure.  In 2019, 57% of all new homes purchased in Dublin were private rental sales, that is, build-to-rents.  These were institutional investors.  There is a higher concentration in respect of apartments.  This is a matter of affordability as well as availability.  These apartments are costing prices that are way beyond what ordinary people are able to afford.</p><p> The other point that the Minister continues to gloss over relates to a question that has been raised by us and Deputy Boyd Barrett, that is, the role of these funds.  It is an easy and simplistic presentation from the Minister to suggest that these funds are financing the development of homes.  Were that the case, would it not be welcome?  However, the vast majority of private rental sale agreements between funds and developers were forward purchase, not forward funding.  I am sure the Minister knows the difference between forward purchase and forward funding.  Forwarding funding is where the funds enter into a relationship or agreement with the developer to develop and fund a certain development and they own it or have a share in it at the end of the process.  Forward purchase is where the developer secures its own finance from banks or internationally with an agreement that the fund will purchase those apartments or homes at an agreed market price at the end.  That is what is happening in Ireland.  One could argue that, by having this agreement, the homes will eventually be sold and it makes providing finance easier for the banks, but we must be clear - funds are not funding the developments.  They are only agreeing to purchase them.  In a time when there is a limited amount of supply, there is a market for these homes.  It is important that the Minister for Finance makes it clear that funds are not funding these developments and are only agreeing to purchase them at the end.</p><p> This has to do with fairness.  We have companies, for example, Cairn and Glenbeigh.  If they dispose of assets, they have to pay capital gains tax because they are not IREFs.  An IREF does not pay any capital gains tax.  IREFs had &euro;7.2 billion of transactions in 2019 and &euro;3 billion last year, and 2021 will probably be a bumper year, given some of the transactions that went through in quarters 1 and 2, but they are not paying any capital gains tax on them.  They are taking in the highest rents in the State, yet they do not pay any tax on their rental income.  This is definitely ideological.  The Minister believes that IREFs play a vital role, but I would argue that they do not.  Even if they are playing a role, surely they should pay a fair amount of tax.  These structures are about tax efficiencies and paying as little tax as possible for rental and commercial properties and should not be tolerated by the Minister for Finance or this committee.</p></speech>

They play a role in purchasing apartments up front.  The Deputy said that.  What that enables developers to do is to have confidence that they have already pre-sold a certain share of the apartments they are going to build.  That gives them the confidence they need to build the overall development.  This is not an ideological view.  Rather, it is the reality of what is happening.  If someone is building a large set of apartments, knowing that he or she will be able to sell a share of them to a single buyer, which would then use those for rental purposes, that gives the confidence for certain projects to go ahead.  This is the reality of what is happening for those who are looking to fund a large number of homes in a small open economy that will in future have two banks-----</p></speech>

If I decide to meet those who have been affected by this awful plight, it will not be because of the political points that the Deputy is making at this meeting.  It will not be because of the cheap juxtaposition that he is making between what I may do when I am travelling or not, whichever the case may be.  Those families are facing stress, anxiety and worry.  I hope that, if they are tuning in to see the Deputy make that point, they will allow me to say to them that I will not respond to those kinds of political points where the Deputy is trying to compare my meeting businesses who may be looking to build homes with the plight of those who have homes that are falling down.  If I decide to meet them, and I am aware of the requests, I will do it because I recognise their anguish and anxiety.</p> <p>  I have been reluctant to do it to this point for a simple reason.  As Minister for Finance, I am pretty much involved in every Government decision that involves the expenditure of Government money that may confer a responsibility on us in future.  I always have groups that want to meet me that are affected by the decisions I make.  I have to respect that those groups have other Ministers that deal with them first.  If I accept an approach that means I will be meeting all who are directly affected by decisions in which I am involved, it will inevitably mean that the role of other Ministers is undermined.  This is the simple reason.  It is not because I am diminishing or devaluing the experience that they are going through.  It is because I respect the fact that they have engaged considerably with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I respect the work that he does and I respect the fact that he is the lead Minister in this regard.  I am working with him closely on it.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point on taxation, I reiterate that, when it comes to the role of IREFs, they paid just over &euro;86 million in tax in our jurisdiction in 2019.  Excuse me - it was &euro;72 million.  It is fair enough to get into a debate on whether that was enough tax and whether they should be paying more, but to indicate that they are not paying any tax at all belies the fact that they have been.  Where the tax is paid is where the income is returned.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty also made a point about the difference between forward purchase and forward funding.  Of course I know the difference, but I contend that, when it comes to forward purchase, the role of pension funds, for example, in giving certainty that an apartment complex is going to go ahead through the purchasing decision it makes enables those homes to be built.</p><p>What Sinn F&eacute;in currently alleging and what it alleges day after day in accusations it makes about REITs is that building fewer homes will help in fixing our housing challenge and I reject that entirely.</p><p> On the final point the Deputy made on Northern Ireland-----</p></speech>

The majority of the amendments I am proposing to the section are technical adjustments to ensure the correct operation of the legislation as intended.  The remaining amendments correct cross-referencing and typographical errors in the Bill as initiated.  I commend these amendments to the committee.</p><p>As the amendments are all technical in nature, with the agreement of committee members I will read the note giving an overview of section 31 to facilitate debate on both the amendments and the section.  Because of the highly technical nature of this section, if members wish to put questions to me on the section, I may ask my officials with the consent of the Chairman to respond back to some of them and I may ask that we go into private session to do that.  This is because this is exceptionally technical and I do not want to give an answer to any question from a member that may prove to be technically incorrect at a later point.</p><p>Section 31 is very lengthy and introduces highly complex new requirements to the corporation tax code.  With the permission of the committee, I will speak a little longer on this than I normally would so the Oireachtas is fully informed of what I am doing and why.</p><p>Section 31 introduces a new interest-limitation rules as required by the EU anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD, by inserting a new part 35D into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Interest-limitation rules form part of the recommendations of the OECD base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, project, with the ATAD providing the basis for co-ordinating implementation of anti-BEPS measures by EU member states.  Following enactment of this Bill, Ireland will have completed transposition of the directive.</p><p>The interest-limitation rule is intended to limit base erosion through the use of excessive interest deductions.  These rules are complex.  Deputies will be aware that my Department held an initial public consultation on these rules and the anti-hybrid rules in November 2018.  This was followed by two feedback statements that were publicly made available by my Department in December 2020 and at the start of this summer, in July.</p><p>Ireland has pre-existing rules to prevent excessive interest deductions that operate in a different manner from the ATAD rule.  The current Irish approach can best be summarised as one which limits interest deductions to be available only in specific scenarios largely based on the purpose of the borrowing.  This is combined with targeted anti-avoidance rules which have evolved over time to combat abusive arrangements.  The new ATAD rule will impose a new additional limit which links a taxpayer's allowable net interest deductions directly to its earnings.  It limits the maximum net deduction to 30% for earnings before tax and before deductions for net interest expense, depreciation and amortisation.  When this threshold is breached, interest deductibility is deferred until there is sufficient interest capacity to allow deduction.</p><p>The key features of the provision are as follows.  The interest limitation rules apply to all corporation taxpayers but with certain erosions and reliefs as provided for in ATAD where the risk of base erosion and profit sharing is thought to be minimal.  There is a <i>de minimis</i>exemption for companies with interest of not more than &euro;3 million in a year.  Stand-alone companies, in other words companies with no associates, group companies or permanent establishments outside Ireland, are outside the scope of the rule.  Interest on borrowings in respect of long-term public infrastructure projects and interest on legacy debt, the terms of which were agreed before 17 June 2016, are also outside the scope.  A group of Irish companies may, where certain conditions are met, be treated as a single taxpayer for the purposes of the restriction.  The rules also take into account the debt provision of a multinational group when assessing whether interest deductions are being taken in Ireland.  Finally, disallowed interest may be carried forward to the succeeding accounting periods where it may qualify for deduction if the company has sufficient interest capacity to deduct interest on its earnings before the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA, limit.  Where a company has spare capacity in a year, this may be carried forward for up to five years.  The new interest-limitation legislation applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister to clarify if a company using the orphan structure would meet this exemption criterion?  I am sure he was expecting that question.  One of the things that professional service companies like to talk about is the orphan structure because it is considered a stand-alone company even though, effectively, it will be under the control of another company or companies.  I ask the Minister to clarify if this structure would meet the definition of a stand-alone company.</p> <p>  Another exception to the interest limitation rule as set out in section 31 is a long-term public infrastructure project, that is, a project to provide, upgrade, operate or maintain a large-scale asset in the general public interest.  Would a public private partnership engaged in such public infrastructure projects meet this criterion?</p> <p>  A further exception to the interest limitations rule as set out in section 31 is interest on legacy debt, that is, debt, the terms of which were agreed before the terms of the interest limitation rules were agreed on 17 June 2016.  For example, would profit participating notes issued before the date of 17 June 2016 meet this criterion and how would instruments such as perpetual bonds that have no maturity date and are not redeemable, but pay a steady stream of interest forever, meet the criteria of this exemption?</p> <p>  It is also stated that where the Irish taxpayer is part of a consolidated worldwide group for accounting purposes, the indebtedness of the overall group at worldwide level may be considered for the purposes of providing additional relief, and that if the Irish taxpayer has debtor interest ratios lower than the worldwide group, its interest expense may not be restricted or a lower restriction may apply under the ILR.  I would welcome a working example of what that would look like in practice.  I am aware that these are quite technical questions.  It is interesting to tease out these issues.</p></speech>

On the question regarding the orphan structure and the stand-alone company, as the committee will be aware, an orphan company is a company that is bankruptcy remote.  This means that in the event of a bankruptcy, the assets of the securitisation company are ring-fenced against the liabilities of that company.  The orphaning of securitisation companies is standard practice in large public capital market transactions.  There are circumstances in which a company may be orphaned and not included in any consolidated financial statements, but may not meet the very strict criteria to qualify as a stand-alone entity.  In those situations, the orphaned company may be considered to be part of a single company worldwide group.  In such a scenario, the company is subject to the interest limitation rule but may be able to avail of group relief, subject to it not having any transactions with associated companies which give rise to interest expense.</p> <p>  To summarise, in a situation where an orphan company is considered to be part of a single company worldwide group, it is subject to these rules and the criteria I have just mentioned.  Beyond that, if the stand-alone entity is not part of a worldwide group, it would not be covered by these rules.  The reason is that in the development of the work that led up to this point, the view was formed that stand-alone entities pose significantly less risk, if any, to base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, through interest deductions as they are generally financed by third party debt from unconnected entities.  For that reason, a stand-alone entity in those circumstances would be exempt from the operation of the interest limitation rule.  In circumstances where the standalone company is outside of a worldwide group and financed by third party debt from an entity that is unconnected to it, it will be exempt from the operation of this rule.</p> <p>  On public private partnerships, the answer is likely to be that they will be exempt from this, but it will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the funding arrangement for the public private partnership in question.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question with regard to legacy debt.

Is that the directive that was agreed in 2016 and the same directive that we were supposed to have transposed into domestic law by the end of 2018 and operational in January 2019?  It may not be.  I am genuinely seeking clarification on this.  Is it the same directive in respect of which we were threatened with infringement proceedings for delaying its transposition?  If it is, can the Minister explain why Ireland delayed for so long in regard to what is a part of the BEPS process, of which the Minister is such a fan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#G00800"><p>Yes, it is that directive.  The anti-tax avoidance directive, or ATAD, provided for a general transposition date of 1 January 2019, but it was also specified that where member states had pre-existing rules relating to interest deductibility that were equally effective at preventing BEPS risks, implementation could take place up to 1 January 2024.  My view, which is supported by the analysis and case study data, is that our current interest deductibility rules are at least as effective as the interest limitation rule set out in Article 4 of ATAD in terms of preventing BEPS and allowing deduction for interest expense, where appropriate.</p><p>We engaged with the Commission in this regard.  Yes, infringement proceedings were issued against us and they were commenced in 2019, but over 20 infringement proceedings have been issued to date against member states in regard to various aspects of ATAD transposition.  Following discussions that my officials had with the Commission, we then gave further indications as to how we were going to transpose this, work on which is under way in this Bill.  As a result, infringement proceedings were paused pending the transposition.</p><p> I understood the Deputy was a fan of BEPS 2.</p></speech>

I just want to know why the Minister and his predecessor, Michael Noonan, decided to not implement and transpose the directive, which we were supposed to have in place at the end of 2018.  The Minister and his predecessor argued that our existing rules were just as effective.  If that was the case, we would not have to transpose it until 2024 but that is not the case because, as the Minister rightly acknowledged, in 2019 formal notice was served on Ireland because of our refusal to transpose this agreement into Irish domestic law.</p> <p>  It is not the first time we have dragged our heels as a State in regard to these issues but we are now in this position.  It is unfortunate that Europe had to take that action against the State to make the Government and the Minister, who was in charge at the time, change tack and implement this legislation, which is about the profit shifting of large profitable entities that are resident in the State.</p> <p>  That being said, I would like to ask on which sectors, in the Minister's view, this will have the greatest impact in terms of increasing their taxation burden through the introduction of these limits.  Does the Minister see any impact, for example, in regard to the aircraft leasing sector, given how this will apply to it and with Dublin being a global centre for that type of activity?  Are there other sectors that the Minister is concerned about?  In the transposition of this directive, given there is scope in regard to how it is transposed, has the Minister taken any decisions that have in mind particular sectors and how they would be impacted?</p> <p>  If the Minister can submit to us the detailed note he has on each of the amendments before Report Stage, that would be appreciated.</p></speech>

There were many other elements of the ATAD that were equally important and that Ireland fully delivered on time, for example, changes with regard to exit tax, control of foreign companies, hybrids and the work we have under way in this Finance Bill with regard to reverse hybrids.  It is the case that while we delivered all of those other expectations on time, there was a particular issue that we had in regard to interest limitation.  The stance I took was driven by my view that the existing rules we had were effective.  The Commission took a different view in this regard.  We were not on our own within the European Union on this particular issue and other countries were also subject to proceedings from the Commission.  While I never want to be in the position where we are subject to that kind of action by the Commission of the European Union, I would still make the point to the committee that it has paused what it is doing in recognition of the action we are now taking in this Finance Bill.</p> <p>  In regard to the sectors that could be affected by this, they are ones that tend to have very valuable assets and very high levels of borrowing, and, therefore, the sector likely to be most affected by this here in Ireland will be the aircraft leasing sector because of the value of the aeroplanes leased and the role of borrowing in this regard.  The Deputy asks whether they have looked to engage with us on this.  Through the public statements we published in regard to how we are going to implement this and the public consultation we have had under way on the general implementation of this change and other changes in corporate tax, they have given us their views in regard to it.  As best as we can, we have tried to deal with the different issues they have raised but, overall, this is a fundamental change that we believe is necessary to fulfil the commitments we have both to the OECD and to the EU.  Any public consultation response that we have made or received is published on the Department of Finance website.  I understand one of the key issues that matters to the aircraft leasing trade is the difference between operating lessors and lessees.</p> <p>  In regard to the more detailed note I have with me, I will of course make it available to the committee.</p></speech>

It relates to section 481 tax relief for investment in films and the question of whether the condition of quality employment and training, which is a condition of the granting of this relief to film producer companies, is actually being met.  The Minister has been helpful in responding to our concerns on this issue over the last number of years.</p><p>He has attempted to tighten the conditionality regarding the quality employment and training provisions of the relief, most notably requiring an undertaking in respect of quality employment for the recipients of the relief, on foot of the concerns raised by film workers and by me and others over the years.  However, the problem is that there is very good reason to believe that this has not been enough to deal with the practice of getting around the requirements for quality employment and training by recipients of the section 481 relief.</p><p> The Minister will be aware that when this question is raised, whether it is in this committee, in arts committees, in debates in the D&aacute;il or between the different players in the debate about the section 481 relief, the film producers who are the recipients and their representatives in Screen Producers Ireland, in particular, will say that it is a project-to-project thing so one cannot really expect security of employment and income because that is just the nature of the industry.  They say they will do their best to comply with the law and so forth, but that one cannot expect security of employment.  I do not accept the case that just because something is project-to-project, the workers who work in an industry for decades are basically, due to the way the industry works, only as good as not even their last job but only as good as the producer deems them to be at the moment in which they apply for their next job, even though they may have worked in the industry for decades.  That is not fair.  I do not believe it is in line with the working time directive and I certainly do not believe it is in line with the requirement under section 481 to have quality employment and training.  It is not quality employment and training.</p><p> A person can be a painter, stage crew or somebody who is below the line, as they are sometimes referred to patronisingly by some elements in the film industry.  The "below the line" workforce is the terribly insulting term that is often trotted out in these discussions.  There are the above-the-line people, the flashy people perhaps, and there are the below-the-line people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#J00300"><p>I stand with the workers, whether they are deemed to be above or below the line.  The Minister understands my point.  It is an insulting notion because they are all equally important in the production of a film - everybody from the painter, costume designer, stagehand and transport drivers to the actors, directors and so forth.</p> <p>  It is the case that if one is a painter who paints the stages, a very specialised thing, or somebody who works in props, again a very specialised thing, one might have worked in the industry for up to four decades and for the same group of producers.  It is a group, and I have spoken to the Minister's officials about this.  It is not necessarily the same producer every time, but in Ireland there is a relatively small group of producer companies.  They are the overwhelming beneficiaries of section 481, and everybody knows who they are.  There are smaller producer companies that may be set up on a much smaller scale, but everybody knows the big producer companies and everybody knows they are the largest recipients, year in and year out.  They also have representatives and friends on Screen Ireland, which is the official State body and which is, in my opinion, just looking after their interests.  I believe there is a conflict of interest in many cases in the way in which Screen Ireland, which is also dishing out grants, has such a close relationship to one particular group in the film industry, the film producers.  That is an issue that must be addressed.  It is not particularly in the Minister's remit, but part of the problem here is that there are a number of different Departments dealing with this, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>  My point is that somebody can have worked for three or four decades for the same group of producers, but when a film is being done by a producer the person has worked with previously and when the person asks to work on it the producer can just say: "No, we do not like you.  You spoke up about conditions on the job and you spoke publicly in a way that was critical of us, so you are not getting a job here".  There is nothing in the law to prevent that from happening.  They seem to be able to get away with it.  I am somewhat nonplussed as to how they are doing this, given that the Minister has made genuine efforts and I acknowledge them.  When the worker who is a victim of that goes to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court, a representative of the film producer is standing across from him or her.  The worker has worked with that film producer on a section 481 production.  The film producer knows it, the worker knows it and they have often done it time and again, yet the film producer can say that the worker was never his or her employee.  Often the producer will send a representative to say it because he or she does not even turn up.  Recently at one of these hearings the producer sent in somebody from IBEC, which is quite extraordinary.  I do not understand how IBEC is able to represent somebody in such a situation.  That is what is happening.</p> <p>  Why is that?  It is because the worker is an employee of the designated activity company, DAC.  The film producer company gets section 481.  The film producer sets up the DAC for the specific film project, but when the worker asserts his or her rights and says those rights are being breached in terms of a collective agreement - the WRC found in favour of the workers recently for breach of a collective agreement - or in terms of unfair dismissal because the worker had previously worked for the film producer and the worker is dismissed, the film producer who is getting the relief, and I remind the Minister that it is conditional on quality employment and training, says he is not the employer, even though he self-evidently is the employer because the DAC he set up is the employer.  The DAC no longer exists and, therefore, the producer has no responsibility to the worker.  That is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>  I also believe that if the EU Commission, and it is getting to that level, was aware that the scale of the relief that is being distributed through section 481 was being abused in this way, it would ask serious questions about state aid.  Do not get me wrong, the State's aid to the arts is absolutely necessary and justified.  I always have to reiterate that I want more money to go into film, arts, culture and so forth, and I have actively campaigned for that, but I want it to be conditional on decent employment conditions for the people who work in the sector.  The specific state aid that is allowed in the area of arts, culture and film requires an effort to build up companies of scale and a permanent pool of skills.  As I discussed with one of the Minister's officials yesterday, it cannot be the case, and nobody is asking for it, that a particular film producer company employs the workers for 52 weeks of the year on a permanent basis.  Let us dispense with that red herring in case it is thrown out.  Nobody is asking for that.</p><p>Everybody knows that is not possible.  Personally, I think it is possible at some point in the future but I will leave that for another day.  There used to be film studios that did that kind of thing and, arguably, film was better then, but I will leave that aside.  Even without that argument, that production can be a bit more episodic does not absolve the film producer companies that get this money again and again, particularly at the moment when there is a lot of film production happening and there is no real shortage of work.  The film producer can say they work in a precarious industry, from film to film, and claim that, therefore, they have no obligation to the worker.  They can say that if the worker ever tries to assert any obligations on the producer's part to the worker, they will simply deny they have any employment relationship with him or her.</p><p> That is still not being addressed and it means people are wide open to and have been victims of straight-up blacklisting.  If they rock the boat, they can become victims of blacklisting.  People from the acting fraternity have even appeared before Oireachtas committees and said they are afraid.  Let us think about Harvey Weinstein and all that stuff.  He was doing this for years.  If you did not do what he wanted you to do, sometimes awful things, he had the power to put you out of the industry and say you will never work again.  That can happen above the line - it does happen there - and it can also happen to the below-the-line people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#K00200"><p>I tabled amendment No. 73.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  As long as we have been members of the committee, he has raised these issues.  Our amendment seeks the production of a report on film relief in the context of the pay, conditions and training of employees within the sector and options to enhance the scheme with respect to employee pay, conditions and training.</p> <p>  Earlier we drew comparisons, or perhaps non-comparisons, between North and South in respect of housing.  One area where we could look to the North, and where the minister there does have powers, relates to the terms and conditions of contracts.  The Northern Executive has just been accredited as a living wage employer, something this State has not achieved.  It is wrong that those working within the public service or the Civil Service would not automatically earn the living wage.  Perhaps the Minister will update on us whether there is an intention to move there.  Crucially, in the North, that includes those who provide services such as catering, cleaning and others.  More important, as the Minister of Finance in the North, Conor Murphy, has informed me, is that from June of next year, the Executive will use the &pound;3 billion it spends on goods and services for a greater public good.  This will ensure any contract that bids for and is granted those services, whether in construction or supplying to the Departments of Education, Health or whatever, will have to abide by the living wage.  Nobody will be able to be employed at a rate under the living wage.</p> <p>  That is an example we should follow here, and that is the spirit of our amendment.  It is not about the granting of a contract of State money to a private sector employee, which is what the Executive will commence doing from June of next year, whereby in the case of every private sector contract that is awarded, all the staff will have to be paid at least the living wage.  Rather, given that the section seeks to grant a benefit on companies here through tax relief, we are saying we should insist on decent pay and conditions and opportunities for those working within the sector.</p> <p>  It is timely to have a review of this, not just of the section I mentioned but the wider section, to examine how the State uses the vast sums it spends on contracts and to ensure it will not only be of benefit in the case of contracts awarded for the provision of, say, healthcare or education, but also that there will be the enhanced benefit whereby employees within the sector will be paid fairly.</p> <p>  I strongly urge the Minister to examine this issue next year with a wider lens, bringing this sector in particular, about which concerns have been raised for many years, under that microscope.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#K00300"><p>Section 481 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.  The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of Irish culture.  The audiovisual sector has largely continued to function through the most challenging period of the pandemic.  It has provided quality employment at a time when so many other elements of the culture sector were severely impacted.  The protocols put in place by the sector have meant workers have been in high demand.</p> <p>  It is expected that in the provision of such opportunities there will be compliance with all applicable employment obligations, including legislative obligations and policies and procedures to ensure dignity at work.  To grow the industry in Ireland, we want quality and sustained employment and training opportunities in the sector.  This is reflected in the undertaking of quality employment, which is required to be signed as part of the application process for section 481.  This undertaking applies not only to the producer company but also to the designated activity company.  In addition to the requirement to sign an undertaking of quality employment, an applicant company is required also to submit a skills development plan as part of its section 481 application if the relevant project is worth more than &euro;2 million.</p> <p>  There has been good progress over the past year in respect of negotiations between employer and worker representative bodies in the sector.  For example, from January 2021, a modernised crew agreement was introduced that promotes good practice, regularises evolving work practices and provides for an industry pension scheme operating under the construction workers pension scheme.  A monitoring structure to oversee the operation of the agreement is included, as is a commitment to develop the first work-life balance policy for the film and television industry.  The agreement acts as a framework for the industry, covering all grades except film construction.</p> <p>  I understand, however, that a proposed construction crew agreement is also under negotiation, and my officials will continue to monitor progress in this regard.  In respect of any specific workplace disputes, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court are the organs of the State tasked with the resolution of disputes relating to workplace matters and employment rights, and it is appropriate that any relevant claims be referred to these bodies for adjudication.  As a result, I am not able to comment on those matters.</p> <p>  In light of these points with regard to the undertaking of quality employment, the skills development plan and the progress with regard to employment relations within the industry, I do not believe it is necessary to undertake a report in line with what has been requested by the Deputies.</p> <p>  To respond specifically to Deputy Boyd Barrett on continuity of employment issues, they need to be ruled on by the WRC but this has not yet happened.  My understanding is the issue at stake relates to the fact an individual has worked for a different producer between the projects for which they are claiming continuity.</p><p>That is an industrial relations matter that the WRC needs to form a view and make a ruling on, as opposed to it being a matter for tax policy.</p><p> To respond to the broad issue the Deputy raised about continuity, many parts of our economy have different employers within a particular sector and employees move between those different employers.  However, that does not give the employee the ability to make the case for continuity of employment if he or she has moved from one employer to another.  I have said to the Deputy in the past - and I know we disagree on it - that film is a sector of the economy, both here in Ireland and across the world, in which employment takes place project to project, film to film.  The progress made by the different bodies in the sector in respect of the regulation of the industry, representation and the agreement on crew means it is in a very different place from where it was a few years ago, when the Deputy began to raise issues about the sector.  Work is under way on a modernised crew agreement, there is a requirement for a skills development plan and work is under way with regard to a construction crew agreement.  None of this was happening a few years ago.  The Deputies, the Department and I have made an input and played a role in that.  That is the way in which we can make progress on the issues Deputies Boyd Barrett and Doherty have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#L00200"><p>As I have acknowledged previously, the Minister, more than any other Minister - there are a few Ministers who potentially should have been involved in this - and his officials have responded and there have been changes and improvements.</p><p>The awful irony in all of this is that the people who brought the issue to the attention of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2018 and gave evidence to the committee have not worked in the industry again.  They are people who had worked in the industry for decades.  There is no doubt that they have been blacklisted out of the industry and subjected to horrendous vilification.  I am sure the people who vilified them will say they are awful people but normally when someone is vilified in an employment relationship, there is a process in place.  If an employer has a problem with an employee, or <i>vice versa</i>, there is a process involving disciplinary action, cautions, hearings and so on.  The problem is that these workers have never had the opportunity to have their case heard in a fair way because there is nothing currently to prevent a film producer from simply telling a worker they are not being employed again because they do not like that worker, what he or she said or the criticism he or she made.  The reason there is nothing to stop that is because of the acceptance of this narrative of employees working project to project and the relationship of the DAC to the producer company.</p><p>I am nonplussed, as I said.  I know the Minister stated the requirement for equality, employment and training applies to both the DAC and the producer company.  The problem is the relationship between the producer company, which is the recipient, and the DAC, because the DAC is short-lived.  For example, if an employee works for the DAC, while that DAC is in existence, it is required to comply.  However, if it does not comply and the employee later takes a case, the producer company, the only entity that still exists - it is above the project to project work and is the continuous factor in all of this - will argue that the DAC is gone.  The producer company will assert that it does not have an obligation and cannot be held responsible because the DAC, which had an obligation, no longer exists.  However, the person who set up the DAC still exists and that person is the producer company, which is in receipt of the relief.</p><p>The Minister has stated that it is up to the WRC to give a direction on this matter, but I do not think that is the case.  I am asking the Minister and his officials to look at the detail.  An instruction should come from the Government, clearly stating that where a film producer tells a worker that they do not have an employment relationship with that worker because the DAC had the relationship with the worker, it is not an acceptable case to make and film producers should not be allowed to make such a case because, in fact, the DAC and film producer are one and the same.  If that instruction went to the WRC or the legislation was tweaked as required to say that that is not an acceptable position to adopt or case to make when employees worked on productions funded under section 481 or, for that matter, by Screen Ireland, it would make a big difference.  It would clarify the position.</p><p>Such a direction should apply to the pool of people who have worked in the industry for the past ten years, 15 years or 20 years.  I know of a man, who had worked on the first season of &quot;Vikings&quot; and stood outside Ardmore Studios or Ashford Studios - I am not sure which - a few weeks ago.  He has since died.  He fully expected to work on the next season of the show but he was considered to be associated with the wrong people, was not re-employed and he is now longer alive.  Shortly before he ended his life, he stood outside a place where he had worked for years, wondering why he was not taken back in.  It is brutal stuff, and there is nothing to stop it happening.  For many of the people involved, it is far too late by the time they get through the WRC process, the Labour Court and all the rest of it.  The Minister knows what a rigmarole that is.  The film producer companies have resources, whereas the individuals who have worked in the industry for years and are trying to make their own case do not.  It is just not right.  </p><p>The Minister argued that because there are sectors in which there are a number of different operators and people move between these operators, if someone moves from employer A to employer B and then back to employer A, that is just what happens and that is life.  However, I put it to him that there are two big differences in this case.  The first is that none of these film productions - and I mean none - would exist without public money.  The State has a big responsibility here.  The film industry is not like the music industry in this country, for example, because the music industry never got State money until Covid.  The film industry is utterly reliant on public money.  No films would be made without it and, therefore, the State has a particular responsibility in that regard.  Second, if it was just a case of lots of different actors in a particular sector moving from employer A to employer B or from employer B to employer C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and so on, perhaps that case could be made.  However, as I said, we know there is actually a relatively small group who are the beneficiaries.  Workers will perhaps move from employer A to employer B, and then to employer C, but they are only moving between those three employers.</p><p>The film industry is a publicly-funded sector in which the various players would not exist without public money and where, generally speaking, the workers are bouncing between the big three or four players.</p><p>That is not being addressed.  Ultimately, unless it is addressed, it will operate to the detriment of the quality of film and to the sector as a whole.<br/><br/>Deputy Doherty referred to the North.  I agree absolutely about what he said about the living wage although when one is working on a film, one is quite well paid and generally receives more than the living wage.  The problem is what happens afterwards, especially if the industry decides it does not like you.  It certainly seems to me that in other jurisdictions there is far greater rights for the pool of people to be seen as part of that pool and not to be arbitrarily excluded from the pool because somebody does not like them.  That is what I am looking for.<br/><br/>To use an analogy, in the worst-case scenarios of the <i>Strumpet City</i>days, dockers would turn up and there were opportunities to load ships for different companies.  The scenario was that a company would either take a worker or not, on a completely arbitrary basis.  One of the ways that was addressed was through the establishment of a stevedore company where dockers became part of a pool.  They might be loading different companies' ships but there was a sort of registered pool of people and, therefore, a bit of fairness in the allocation of work, even though different companies were operating within that pool of dockers.  Something like that could and should be done so that we know who is in the pool of employees and who is in the pool of trainees.  Even commitments on training mean very little if we cannot track the journey of the trainee.  Is the person who was trained on film A still around for film D that is being made by the same producer or group of producers?  Has that trainee qualified?  Is he or she now accepted as part of a pool of people with skills in the film sector?Is he or she, at any point, excluded from that pool?  That issue is not being addressed.<br/><br/>I appeal to the Minister and his officials to look at this again to try to tighten it up.  If there is uncertainty as to precisely how the working time directive and the relationship between DACs and production companies are playing out and being represented by different groups in the Labour Court, I believe it would be entirely right and legitimate for the Minister to intervene and state what the Government wants and how it wants these things interpreted.  If that requires now statutory instruments or legislative change, so be it.  I am not even sure it does require those things.  The situation needs to be clarified and the Government needs to crack the whip, as it were.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#M00300"><p>I thank the Deputy and will deal with the different points he has made.  I will make a point I think is relevant to the concern the Deputy raised about the role and operation of DACs.  A DAC is required to exist for a year after the cessation of a project in order to receive that tax benefits of section 481.  That may not have been relevant a few years ago because we did not have the kind of framework, from an industrial relations perspective, that now exists.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has played an important role in making that happen.  There is a framework in place within the sector to deal with issues relating to pensions and how people are treated.  The DAC must exist for a year after the project has ceased.  We now have a framework through which issues such as this can be dealt with.  Surely the space is there within the WRC or the Labour Court to hear issues relevant to the agreements that have now been brokered within a year after a project has concluded.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's point that a DAC does not exist after a period of time and someone can feel like they are going from DAC to DAC even though the group of people in these DACs may well be the same.  However, the difference between now and the past is that we now have agreements against which the conduct of employers needs to be evaluated.  I would be surprised if the Labour Court or the WRC was unable to deal with the issues within a year.  During that year, the DAC is still required to be in existence as a condition of receiving the section 481 relief.  That is a big difference when compared with where we have been in the past.  I do not mean that in the sense of what has happened from a tax point of view, as we debated last time, but simply from the perspective of the kind of work that has happened from a labour relations point of view within the sector.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that many of these films or television series would not be made without them.  To be more specific, they would not be made in Ireland without it.  The content would still be made because the demand for films and television series that are all over streaming channels is hotter than it ever has been.  They would still be made but the question is where they would be made.  We want them to be made in Ireland to benefit all who work in the sector.  I do not like to refer to people who work above and below the line.  I want jobs for all those who work in the sector.  I have met a few such people recently and it appears the sector is extraordinarily busy at the moment and doing very well.</p> <p>  In response to the different issues the Deputy has raised, I will say a word about progress that has been made.  The WRC, in August 2020, made four different recommendations.  It recognised the importance of good industrial relations and anticipated or was looking for an agreement that would deal with issues relating to pay, terms and conditions, travel time, overtime, sick leave, pensions and all of the issues one would expect to be dealt with in any good workplace.  That is now in place for those involved in shooting films or television series.  That was agreed between SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland.  That includes within it an industry pension screen, an agreement about how this will be monitored and a commitment to a work-life balance policy.</p> <p>  The Deputy also made a point about skills and training.  An agreement is now in place between Screen Ireland and Screen Skills Ireland to put a greater focus on training and upskilling.  Screen Skills Ireland has in the past two years, I am informed, completely changed the operation of the upskilling requirement of section 481 relief to provide far more skill opportunities and training opportunities, regardless of whether a worker is joining the industry for the first time or has been at it for a little while.  There is also more recognition of the role of guilds within the industry and on how HR can be improved within that sector.  I imagine that is critical for dealing with many of the different issues the Deputy has raised.</p> <p>  I will continue to take an active role in what goes on here.  My officials and I accept the importance of points the Deputy raised two finance bills ago.  We are making progress.  We could always make more, but I think we are making progress.  I met representatives from SIPTU and Screen Producers Ireland to indicate my interest in this subject.  The account they gave me of what was going on in the sector was pretty positive.  They talked about the good change that is happening and I was encouraged by that.  We will continue to keep at this.</p><p>I do not believe that the Finance Bill is the way in which reports on this issue should be provided and that is why I am not accepting these amendments.  I will continue to monitor this issue and see how we can support gradual positive change within a sector that is important to Ireland but within which there are issues that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

I will come back to this on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister and his officials to further consider what I have said.</p> <p>  It is unfair that the people who brought this matter to my attention and to the attention of the Oireachtas have, in effect, been blacklisted.  While one union may be happy and, indeed, may have benefited from the actions of others in bringing certain issues forward and putting pressure on in terms of those issues, it would be a cruel and unfair irony if the whistleblowers end up being the victims even though they are ones who helped to move the goalposts and to which the Minister has responded.  I think that injustice must be addressed but questions remain beyond that particular group.  I have recently talked to actors.  The dancers who worked on a film called "Disenchanted" made the point that their employment conditions here were much less favourable than similar film situations in the UK.  There remains a problem in that people who raise questions are vulnerable.  Certain people can make agreements but other people should have the right to question those agreements, at least.  They should not be punished and penalised if they question things that others say are fine with nothing to see.  We must protect people, give them the right to question things and ensure they are not victimised if they ask questions. </p></speech>

I have read the notes and the memorandum and I have tabled a parliamentary question.  I want to understand what is meant by the change in the terms and the extension of the eligibility for section 481 to cover labour-only services.  I am sure the Department officials know that I am concerned about bogus self-employment.  I missed the discussion yesterday but Deputy Nash mentioned bogus self-employment in a well-aimed amendment.  In my opinion, bogus self-employment must be defined objectively and not left to be defined by the employer, for example in circumstances in which the employer says a job is not bogus self-employment and the particular contractor is happy with the arrangement.  Others who work in the industry, or might want to work in the industry, think this is an abuse that effectively excludes them and are concerned about the lack of objective criteria for what constitutes quality employment and training and is thereby eligible for the benefits of the relief.  That is my concern.  I am not saying I am right to be concerned; I am saying I am concerned.  Therefore, I seek an assurance and certainty from the Minister that the relief is not, potentially, going to be abused.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#N01300"><p>I will begin by briefly explaining why this does not represent a change of policy by the Government in this area.  Section 32 amends the definition of "eligible expenditure" in section 481 to confirm the current practice that payments made directly by a qualifying company, in respect of the provision of labour-only services by an individual, for the purposes of the production of a qualifying film qualify as eligible expenditure.  Eligible expenditure is the portion of the total cost of production of a qualifying film that is expended on the production of the film in the State.</p> <p>  Deputies may recall that in the Finance Act 2018, the film tax credit was moved to a self-assessment basis.  This involved the introduction of a substantial body of new legislation to govern matters previously dealt with by regulation.  It was subsequently discovered that the new legislation unintentionally created a discrepancy between the definition of eligible expenditure and the long-standing practice in the industry.  Payments in respect of self-employed individuals providing a labour-only service had always been treated as qualifying for section 481 relief and this treatment was expressly stated in previous Revenue guidance.  This amendment confirms that the meaning of "eligible expenditure" includes labour-only services as described, and in addition to expenditure incurred directly by the qualifying company in the employment of eligible individuals on the production of the film and expenditure incurred directly or indirectly by the qualifying company in the provision of certain goods, services and facilities by a person who is carrying out their business from a fixed base of business in Ireland.  This recognises that self-employed services may be provided in the sector but it is not intended to create a bias either towards or for self-employment.  The characterisation of a worker as employed or self-employed will continue to be governed by the code of practice on employment status having regard to the specific circumstances of each individual case.</p> <p>  This change does not change our policy.  It is policy-neutral towards the question of self-employment.  It does not change the policy with regard to that.  To be clear, if it subsequently comes to light that we have done anything here that changes the balance in any direction, we will look at it again but it is not our intention to do so.  We are simply putting on a statutory footing the guidance that currently exists.</p></speech>

The aim of the measure is to provide an incentive to digital games developers to produce digital games that contribute to the promotion and expression of Irish and European culture.  Subsequent to the publication of the Finance Bill, the requirement for a number of technical amendments to the legislation, as published, was identified to ensure the provisions operate as intended.  I, therefore, commend the amendments to the committee.  What I will do, in speaking to these amendments, is give a broader perspective on the Bill and the section itself.</p><p>The relief will take the form of a corporation tax credit, the beneficiaries of which will be digital games development companies.  The rate of the credit will be 32%, available on eligible expenditure of up to &euro;25 million per game.  The credit will be available on expenditure incurred in the design, production and testing stages of the development of qualifying digital games, provided certain conditions are met.</p><p>In order to be eligible, the qualifying expenditure must be not less than &euro;100,000.  Games produced solely or mainly for the purposes of gambling or advertising will not be eligible for the relief.</p><p> The relief will be a cultural one for state aid purposes and, therefore, a cultural test will also apply.  In order to claim the credit, a company must first apply for cultural certification as a qualifying digital game to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  An interim cultural certificate may be applied for at any point before or during the development of the digital game and will only allow relief to be claimed annually in respect of qualifying expenditure.  On completion of a digital game, the company must apply for a final cultural certification and claim any balance of the credit due.  As part of the certification process, a digital games development company will be required to sign an undertaking of quality employment.  As already stated, the relief will constitute a state aid and, accordingly, must be notified to and approved by the European Commission prior to commencement.  Accordingly, it is being introduced subject to a commencement order.  The scheme will run until 31 December 2025.</p></speech>

They are technical in nature.  In order to support the flow on Report Stage, it would be helpful for the Minister to email a note to members in advance.  He mentioned that the relief is subject to a commencement order and will be subject to state aid rules.  Ireland has fallen foul of those rules in the past, with changes in the Finance Act not having been approved or requiring changes or alterations at a later stage.  Has there been any indication from or discussion with the Commission regarding the likelihood of the relief being approved?  Has there been any feedback on that?</p></speech>

As we developed the relief, we looked closely at equivalent reliefs in other EU jurisdictions and we modelled it on our own section 481, so we are hopeful of a positive response on it.  Obviously, that cannot be guaranteed.  We expect that the overall procedure for gaining that approval could take nine to 12 months.  We have indicated to those in the sector that this process could take that duration.  I am hopeful, but I cannot give a guarantee.</p></speech>

That is really worrying because it is an area in which we want Ireland to be a leader.  There is broad agreement on that.  We want it to be an area of significant growth.  There has been a lot of success here in the context of some of the companies in the sector.  Does the Minister believe this relief is what the sector requires to increase employment and grab some of the opportunities that are evident across Europe or are there other issues he has identified that need to be considered?  I assume he or his officials have met with several of these companies and had dialogue with them.  Are they seeking any other supports or changes?</p></speech>

If you look at the strengths we have in animation and, more broadly, in the digital sector, the ingredients are there for Ireland to do far better than it is doing.  We have engaged with the sector.  The measure we have brought forward has received a very positive response from the sector.  We have dealt in particular with Imirt, a representative body that has a variety of different companies included within it.  It has given a positive response to the measure.  The key issue we are likely to face is the supply of workers and graduates the companies need.  I know there are a few universities that are doing great work in this area, namely, the Technological University Dublin, what will become the technological university of Munster and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.  I understand from people who know a lot more about this than I do that they are doing really good work in training and educating students who will be able to work in this sector.  I hope that in a few years when this relief is evaluated by the Department, we will be able to point to many new gains and people employed here as a result of it.</p></speech>

Have the provisions in those countries been considered?  Is the relief proposed by the Minister more advantageous than what is on offer there or is it similar?</p></speech>

France has a rate of 30%, while ours is 32%.  The rates in the UK are between 19% and 25% but it does not have a maximum claim.  Our 32% rate compares really well to our fellow EU member but it also has the quality of being the same rate that we charge under section 481.  I thought it important that there be consistency between it and the rate for the audiovisual sector.  I think it is competitive and I hope it will yield gains and employment here in Ireland.</p></speech>

I was trying to bilocate again, unsuccessfully this time.  We had an amendment that, unfortunately, I was not present for.  It relates to the extension of the section 481-type relief to the digital gaming sector.  We have a concern about this.  We want to support things that will create employment in this area, which is one where there could potentially be jobs and so on.  We welcome those jobs.  I know the Minister sometimes thinks we do not, but we very much do.  Any relief should, however, be strictly tied to ensuring quality employment conditions and avoiding bogus self-employment.  We are looking for assurances that that will be case.  We have expressed some concerns about section 481 as it is currently applied in other areas.  We do not want to have the same concerns regarding the extension of the relief to this newly growing sector.</p></speech>

We will debate an amendment later regarding that relief and how it applies to pay and conditions in the training of employees in the sector.  We do not want to repeat the earlier conversation on film relief, but it is a similar area.  As I said, this is a sector we need to support and to grow.  There is major potential in it if we get this right, but we need to ensure that, as the sector is expanding, the pay and conditions of workers are fair.</p> <p>  Game Workers Unite Ireland, a branch of the Financial Services Union, have raised concerns about employment conditions in the industry with the Minister.  He mentioned that there will be a condition of quality employment.  I know Game Workers Unite Ireland sought to engage with the Minister and wrote to him and to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding discussion of the definition of "quality employment" in the context of this relief.  We do not have that definition.  Has that meeting with Game Workers Unite Ireland taken place?  Has the Minister he engaged with the group on this?  Is there now an understanding of what that definition will be and when it will be in place?</p></speech>

As part of the certification process, a digital games development company will be required to complete an undertaking in respect of quality employment in order to qualify for the relief.  This is similar to the requirements in place under section 481.  The undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation.  It is crucial that employee rights are upheld in all industries.  The inclusion of this provision reinforces the importance of adhering to employment legislation in the digital gaming sector.  Should a digital games development company fail to adhere to a condition or obligation specified in the undertaking, the conditions of certification will not have been met, which means that any credit claimed pursuant to an interim or final certificate may be subject to recoupment by Revenue and an application for a final certificate may be refused.</p> <p>  The issue of bogus self-employment is relevant to all sectors and, as such, needs to be treated in that way.  I am advised that Revenue carries out a comprehensive programme of compliance operation each year across a broad range of economic sectors, including the digital games development industry.  Many of the operations are carried out on a multi-agency basis, which can include officials from the Department of Social Protection and the WRC.  The primary role of these joint investigation units is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, which includes non-operation of the PAYE system on foot of bogus self-employment.  This led Revenue, together with the Department of Social Protection and the WRC, to update the code of conduct for determining employment status in July 2021.  The code aims to be to the benefit of employers, employees, independent contractors and those involved in the sector.</p> <p>  On the particular point regarding the representative union, we have corresponded with it but have not met with its representatives.  My officials are very much open to meeting them.</p></speech>

Controlled foreign company, CFC, rules are an anti-abuse measure, designed to prevent the artificial diversion of profits from controlling companies in the State to offshore subsidiaries located in low- or no-tax jurisdictions.</p><p>The controlled foreign company, CFC, rules operate by attributing to the controlling company the undistributed income of the subsidiary which has arisen from non-genuine arrangements put in place for the essential purpose of attaining the tax advantage.  A number of exemptions are provided for, including exemptions for CFCs with low accounting profits or a low profit margin in which the CFC pays a comparatively higher amount of tax in its territory than it would have paid in the State.<br/><br/>Section 835 applies the aforementioned exemptions where the CFC is located in the territory which is listed in the EU list of non-co-operative jurisdictions.  The list is compiled by Economic and Financial Affairs Council, ECOFIN.  Territories that constructively engage with the EU and which meet certain standards are removed from the list.  It was anticipated the application of these exemptions for CFCs resident in a non-listed territory would have a twofold effect.  First, it would encourage companies to relocate their CFCs from those territories.  Second, it would encourage those listed territories to take such actions as are required to remove themselves from the list.  The list is kept under review.  Countries may be added or taken off the list, depending on circumstances.  In that regard, I have amended the section so that the list of 12 countries, which was published on 20 October, applies to CFCs resident in non-co-operative jurisdictions, with accounting periods beginning during the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.<br/><br/>The amendment also provides that the list, as updated in October and which now lists nine countries, takes effect for CFCs<b></b>resident and non-co-operative jurisdictions, with accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January.  I want to update the Deputy on the list of the nine countries and where that stands at the moment.  Currently, the nine jurisdictions are American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.  As of the October update, three jurisdictions were removed.  These were Anguilla, Barbados and the Seychelles.<br/><br/>To deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s point about my view on the impact of this measure, it is a powerful way of dealing with this issue.  One of the ways it is having an effect is when our ECOFIN meetings are taking place.  Jurisdictions that are being moving onto or fear they may be moved onto this list are vocal in describing the effect a listing will have on them.  Those jurisdictions that move onto the list do their best to try to move off the list and meet the requirements that are laid down by the European Commission.  On the question as to whether I think it deals with the issue of shell companies, I do, because of the procedures the European Commission is now using to deal with issues in the jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I think this a good section, but that is not the point.  My point is to ask if there is any concern in relation to the list.  I totally understand that countries have fears of being put on this list and that they would raise the impact that would have.  I wonder specifically about the Minister&rsquo;s own views.  He said himself the list in flux.  Countries can be added and removed.  Would the Minister be concerned about the fact the list can be in flux?  Obviously, it needs to be in flux to certain extent.  However, does the Minister have concerns whereby shell companies can be opened up in different jurisdictions and can move with the list?  Does he have concerns that is happening or could happen?  Does the Minister think it needs to be strengthened in that regard?</p></speech>

The way I think something like this should work is that if standards are agreed and if countries meet those standards, they should not be on this list.  If they do not meet those standards, they should be on the list, but if they take action to remedy the issue the Commission raised, they should get the opportunity to come off the list.  For me, the fact some countries come off the list and it is therefore not a fixed list is the way I believe it should work.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of shell companies.  Of course, it would be a concern if things like that are put in place to engage in extremely aggressive tax planning.  However, the Commission takes this very seriously.  I have full confidence in it scrutinising whether countries deserve to come off the list.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, 92 jurisdictions are evaluated to see whether they should be on or off this list.  To put it in rough terms, if 92 are evaluated and there are currently nine on the list, this shows the Commission is taking the work seriously in this area.</p></speech>

I will deal in a moment with the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding how we define &ldquo;connected&rdquo;.  It was designed to prevent companies from selling assets, such as plant or machinery, between group companies and funding the sales with intra-group debt to create tax deductible interest expenses.  Revenue has been aware of cases where the provisions of section 840A were being circumvented by the use of promissory notes and replacement borrowings.  Section 840A is therefore being amended to bring promissory notes and other agreements or arrangements having similar effect within the scope of the anti-avoidance provision.  The amendment will also ensure any form of refinancing of a loan, as defined in this section, is within the scope of the jurisdiction.  There is, therefore, no change here in how we define whether one is connected or not.  The change here is to bring promissory notes and replacement borrowings into scope.  I am informed there is a definition as to what the connected company is.  My officials will send that on to the Deputy on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It calls on the Minister to produce a report within six months to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the research and development tax credit, its operation, its use among small and medium enterprises and options to enhance and simplify its use for indigenous enterprises and in the context of environmental research and innovation.  This is timely.  The Minister knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for an enhanced research and development tax credit regime for small and micro businesses.  In fairness, the Minister brought it forward in budget 2019.  We wanted to see the rate increased to 30% for small and micro enterprises.  It is disappointing it had not taken effect despite it being legislated for two years after it was announced.  The Minister said in response to me that it had not received state aid approval and that for it to receive state aid approval would require overly burdensome changes on businesses and revenue.  This is very disappointing.</p><p>I am strongly of the view that we need to ensure more small, medium and micro businesses are involved in research and development.  I would like to hear from the Minister on whether he has an update on this measure, which we called for and supported.  In fairness, the Minister legislated for it.  Is it now a dead duck or will we go back to the Commission and look for a way to introduce it without being too burdensome so it would not be a drain on small and medium enterprises or micro businesses?</p><p>There is no doubt that we need to support research and innovation among small businesses.  We need to help them to scale up.  We want to see changes to the research and development tax credits regime that would provide it.  One was the idea of a higher rate for these companies.  The second proposal we have been putting forward, and I ask the Minister to look at it, is that under the current system companies whose research and development tax credits exceed their tax liability receive the credits in three instalments over 33 months.  We believe this acts as a disincentive for take-up among small and medium enterprises.  We would like to see it changed for small and micro-companies, with credits paid out in one instalment in one year.  It would only be a cash flow issue because the companies would still be entitled to it over a longer period of time.  The estimate we received from Revenue on the cost of the first year of operation is &euro;25 million.  As I have said, this is primarily a cash flow issue.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on this type of proposal.  I believe it would improve the cash flow position of indigenous businesses that would engage in research and innovation and increase the uptake of the tax credit to support companies that are crucial to our economic future and the success of our economy.</p><p>The amendment calls for a report.  We will go through the motions in terms of the restrictions on the Opposition with regard to the Finance Bill.  At the heart of the amendment, as with previous amendments, is the view that we need to do more to encourage research and development in small and micro-enterprises.  Are we giving up on the higher rate for small and micro businesses?  This is already legislated for.  Is there a way around it in the Minister's view?  The other proposal we are putting forward is that those companies with research and development credits that exceed their tax liability would be able to be paid in one instalment in one year instead of three instalments over 33 months.</p></speech>

There are two criteria for it laid down in the Finance Act of 2019.  To quickly summarise, the first is that if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one company and is connected with the first-mentioned person, or the first-mentioned person and persons connected with the first-mentioned person have control of the other company.  The second criteria is if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating a member of either group as replaced by a person with whom such a member is connected.  This is the definition.  I have made a dreadful mistake; I have managed to confuse the Finance Act 2019 with the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That is where the definition is.</p> <p>  With regard to the questions Deputy Doherty has put to me, I will deal with the amendment before the two other matters he put to me.  The Irish corporate tax regime contains a small number of tax reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.  The focus of these reliefs is on the creation of additional employment and on promoting innovation and inward investment, with a view to generating high value economic activity in the country.</p> <p>  I note that Revenue annually publishes a report entitled &ldquo;Research &amp;amp; Development (&ldquo;R&amp;D&rdquo;) Tax Credit Statistics&rdquo;.  The report contains a significant volume of data.  The report also provides further statistical information regarding the number of claimants and the value of their claims across a broad range of categories such as the business sector, the size of the claimant and the size of the claimant, based on whether in Revenue&rsquo;s large corporates division, which manages the tax affairs of the largest taxpayer and those claimants not dealt with by the large corporates division, which is a reasonable proxy for SME companies.  The report also shows a breakdown of the research and development tax credit by value of the credit claimed as profiled against the corporation tax liability of the claimant.  As the information sought by the Deputy is already available I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  The primary focus of the Government over the past 20 months has been to support businesses during the pandemic.  Revenue advises that the companies using the extensive Covid-19 supports were primarily SME companies.  These interventions were designed primarily to deliver immediate cash support to enable affected businesses to maintain a level of trade and retain their staff in employment.  However, as Deputy Doherty has noted I gave a commitment to look at measures to continue to encourage greater take-up of the research and development tax credit by small domestic companies and to examine certain aspects, such as the pre-approval procedures and record-keeping requirements.</p> <p>  As I stated at the time when I introduced measures in budget 2020 for micro and small companies, they were subject to a commencement order pending state aid approval from the European Commission.  Following initial engagement with the Commission it was determined it would be necessary to introduce some changes to the enhancements for micro and small companies to secure state aid approval.  However, as the measures in their current form are enhancements to the existing general research and development tax credit this could pose a significant administrative challenge to taxpayers and Revenue if different criteria were to apply to two elements of a claim for the same research and development cost.  Adding complexity and an administrative burden would be counter-productive to the aim of assisting small and micro companies.  To answer the Deputy's question on whether this is something I will progress further, at this point it will be difficult for me to fulfil the original commitment I gave on enhancing the research and development regime for micro and small companies given the issues I have just acknowledged.</p><p>I am now looking at other ways in which we might support innovation for small, innovative companies.  This is why we have moved ahead with the innovation fund, which I hope we will be able to launch over the next couple of months.  We are putting in place supports through Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to make new forms of funding available to smaller companies to help them with innovation.  It is also why I tried to move ahead with changes regarding the employment investment incentive scheme, EIIS, to find new forms of capital to support smaller and younger companies that are looking to start up.  I will have better chances trying to support those companies in those ways than I will have through changes in the research and development machine.</p><p> The Deputy made a point about the cashflow issue.  The information that I have is that 69% of companies avail of it within the current accounting period and 12% look to convert it into a payable credit, with a smaller number looking for a second payable credit, and an even smaller number looking for a third payable credit.  The majority of companies in 2019 used the credit within the current accounting period.  I would be happy to look at this again if the Deputy thinks there is a case to look at how it could be managed in a different way so that it would be more beneficial to companies that access it.</p></speech>

I would like some detail about how onerous it would be to apply a rate.  It appears that the Minister has suggested that it can happen but that it would be a significant burden on both Revenue and the company.  If it is not possible then it is not possible, but we should continue to look at how we can support more research and development, which is important.  The Minister said he is willing to look at the other suggestion that I put forward, which comes from the engagement that we are having with business.  It is good to see that nearly 70% are able to use that in year 1, but the other 30% are not.  We are told that it is a disincentive in the first place, so it is not just about the 31%.  I ask the Minister to look at this as part of the Tax Strategy Group papers in the summer, to see if this needs enhancement with regard to how it is paid out to small and medium enterprises.  Our suggestion is that it would be paid out in one instalment in one year as opposed to three instalments over 33 months for those that do not have a tax liability.</p></speech>

The draw-down of the research and development credit for small and medium enterprises for 2019 stood at &euro;801 million.  I know that does not give a break down into microcompanies and the smallest companies that are starting up.  From the figures that I have here, it looks as if the research and development credit continues to be heavily used by companies that are not the big companies that tend to be associated with this.  We will look at this as part of the Tax Strategy Group process.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about adopting the research and development regime for smaller companies, my view is that it would end up creating something so complex that, when I am here for next year's Finance Bill, the Deputy would be asking me why no or very few companies are accessing it.  I do not think it is worth being in that position.  We will instead try to skin the cat differently with the changes that we have made in the EIIS and the changes that we are making by launching a new innovation fund of approximately &euro;90 million, which I believe will yield a different way to support innovation and microcompanies.</p></speech>

As we know, the late Brian Lenihan brought forward changes to the Finance Act at the time of the bank bailouts to ensure that when banks became profitable again, they would begin to pay tax at an earlier stage.  He limited the amount of losses that could be carried forward to 50% for those who received the injection of capital from the State.  This continued for a period until Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided to get rid of it and banks were allowed to carry forward 100% of their losses into the future.  This is probably more relevant now than ever before.  One could argue it by asking if it really matters, since at the end of the day, they will end up paying the tax at some point.  The late Brian Lenihan made the point that they needed to start paying tax at the earliest stage possible, which is important.</p><p>We have seen a number of banks leave the Irish market.  Those banks will not be in a position to pay taxes.  We need to be careful with this.  It means that banks which are now profitable, having recovered from the impacts of the pandemic, will not pay any corporation tax on their profits in Ireland this year, including AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will pay corporation tax on their profits in England but they will not pay taxes on the profit they make in Ireland.  This amendment is about going back to what Brian Lenihan introduced, which reduced the amount of losses that can be carried forward in any given year and ensuring that they cannot carry forward those losses indefinitely.  Ireland is one of the outliers in the European Union since it allows the carrying forward of 100% of losses for an unlimited time.  Countries usually have percentages that can be carried forward or a period of time like ten or 15 years.</p></speech>

This technical note was published online and is still available.  It considered in some detail the potential implications of restricting the use of losses carried forward, or the introduction of a specific time limit or sunset clause on loss relief, for Irish banks, the wider banking sector or the corporate sector as a whole.  Among other considerations, it examined the possible effect of such a restriction on consumers, with the probability an increased cost base for the banks would be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fees, higher interest rates on loans or lower deposit rates.  It also noted potential negative consequences for the valuation of the State&rsquo;s banking investments and for capital levels in the banks, with possible resulting regulatory impacts.  It considered potential effects on competition within the banking sector in Ireland, a factor of increasing relevance as banks have since left the market.</p> <p>  Taking all these factors into account, it is my view it would be detrimental to Irish consumers and taxpayers if a restriction were placed on the use of losses carried forward by the banks.  As each of the three pillar banks posted losses in its 2020 financial statements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is likely limited corporation tax liabilities would have arisen for 2020 regardless of the banks&rsquo; historical losses.  However, notwithstanding the trading losses forward, the Irish banks have been paying Irish corporation tax in recent years, as the tax losses forward are restricted in their use and do not shelter profits made in all their corporate entities.  Given the level of analysis that has been published, I do not believe a further review on the matter is merited and I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I want the Minister to take action and revert the measure.  I want the banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, which will make significant profits, to pay tax on those profits by limiting the volume of losses that can be carried forward in a given year, but he is not going to do that.  I have read the report but I still do not understand why he will not do that.  An argument was made at the time it was important to allow the banks to carry forward losses of 100% because of its potential in respect of capital ratio but those arguments no longer wash.  In simple terms, why should our tax code provide that AIB will not pay tax on billions of euro in profit, cumulatively, for the next two decades?</p></speech>

I see the banks as entities not just to be taxed but as ones that also have to provide credit, investment and employment to lead to the availability of more homes, jobs and investment in all parts of our country.  While I can understand the attractiveness, politically, of a change in tax policy such as that which the Deputy supports, it would, ultimately, undermine the ability of those banks to contribute to more lending for more homes and more attractive and lower rates for customers and would undermine the growth I believe it is in the interests of the economy for them to make.</p></speech>

It does not make sense.  He stated we treat them the same as any other bank but we do not.  In regard to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, there is a relationship framework with the Minister and there are restrictions on what they can do in making certain types of investment or disposing of assets.  There are restrictions on the CEO remuneration and bonuses they can pay.</p> <p>  Those restrictions are all there for a reason.  The then Minister, Brian Lenihan, brought forward another restriction, namely, that they could carry forward only 50% of losses, and that was there for a reason as well.  While the then Government pumped tens of billions of euro into those banks, there was a recognition those losses would mean that when the banks were profitable, they would not pay taxes for decades, and that should be avoided.</p> <p>  That is what is at the heart of this.  Anybody could argue the banks should be let go tax free and they might reduce interest rates or whatever.  That is not a solid argument, particularly in the case of Bank of Ireland.  The Government is disposing of the State's interest in that bank ,although I do not think it is the appropriate time, given the share price.  The paper the Minister referred to discussed dividends back to the State but with Bank of Ireland that is not applicable in any meaningful way any more, yet that bank will continue to be able not to pay tax on its Irish profits, whereas it will pay tax on its profits recorded in Britain.</p></speech>

Given that ours is an economy two banks have decided to leave, the ability of the banks that remain to lend more in the future, and to avoid their mortgages becoming even more expensive, matters to me as Minister for Finance.  Moreover, one of the three banks, Permanent TSB, is in the middle of an exceptionally important transaction, given the exit of a bank from Ireland.</p> <p>  For all those reasons, while I can understand the attractiveness to those who will listen of the case the Deputy is making, my view is making that change will lead to other things happening that will also matter to people.  It will, ultimately, affect the capital status of some of those banks, which in turn will undermine their ability to provide other functions I want them to be able to provide, offer cheaper mortgages in future and be able to lend for more homes to be built.</p></speech>

It is a ridiculous, crazy argument for a Minister for Finance to put forward.  There is no rational defence of why we would allow banks, that between them have recorded more than &euro;1 billion in profits, not to pay the corporation tax rate of 12.5% that every other company, no matter how big or small, pays on its profits.</p></speech>

All efforts need to be made to ensure nothing distracts the banks or gives them an opportunity or excuse for not doing what is required most at this time, which is that pillar banks must lend to people who want to buy and build houses.  If they do not lend, where will the money come from?  We will become more dependent on the investment funds.  That would not be a good idea.</p><p> Incidentally, some banks have repaid the bailout they received from a previous Government.  Some, admittedly, have not and that is something to which we need to look forward.  We need to encourage the banks to lend in the way that is required at this important time for those who are seeking to build homes or buy a house on the marketplace.  They banks need to do this consistently for a period and the Government should not distract them by intervening to punish them a little more, on the basis that this would be the normal course of events.  The Minister is right in this case.  I ask him to carefully monitor the extent to which the pillar banks are preparing to lend to those who are trying to buy their own house.  It is not a condition, but there should and needs to be a recognition that this is what they will do.</p><p> Two banks have left the country but have retained an interest in it.  For what purpose I do not know, and I have put questions down on the matter.  I hope the existing remaining banks are not in any way disadvantaged by any competition that might come from the banks that have decided to leave.</p><p> It is crucial to the Irish economy that we have an open, transparent, working banking system, one that is available to its customers in a way that has not been shown over the past ten years or so.  The banks, without exception, must be committed to putting their shoulders to the wheel in order to ensure the Irish people have available to them opportunities to have their banking requirements met.</p></speech>

It is a well-proven technique from Deputy Doherty and Sinn F&eacute;in to put words in my mouth that I did not say and then attack me for making an argument I did not make.  At no point in my argument did I say the banks should never pay tax at any point in the future.  I have never said that.  However, I did say that, given Deputy Doherty's acknowledged criticism and his point that mortgage interest rates in Ireland are too high and banks need to do more to lead to more homes being built, given my point, which he did not acknowledge, that a massive change is under way in the Irish banking system and the three banks that would be subject to this amendment will have to go through considerable change in the future to deal with the exit of two other banks from the country, and given the need for those banks to be able to lend to deliver more homes and, I hope, reach a point where they will lend more cheaply, the acceptance of this amendment would be counter-productive to realising those goals.  That is not an irrational argument.  It is one based on trying to make progress on other matters that are important to the people I represent.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, where an individual disposes of an interest in a property that qualifies for principal private residence relief by way of a lottery or game with prizes and the proceeds of such lottery or game exceed the market value of that property, the maximum amount of the gain to which principal private residence relief may apply is that computed by reference to the market value of the property at the date of disposal and not by reference to the full proceeds received on foot of the lottery or game.  The costs of disposal are similarly apportioned for the purpose of claiming the relief.  In this way, the relief is restricted to the amount that the individual disposing of the property would have received if he or she had sold the property on the open market rather than by lottery or game with prizes, and any amount that the individual receives over and above the market value is subject to capital gains tax in the normal way.</p></speech>

Let us say that, in my example, there are no incidental costs.  We would be left with a value of &euro;300,000.  Is that now deemed the chargeable gain?

Actually, as opposed to me saying what has just been said to me by my officials and risking getting a point of detail wrong, I would like to invite one of them to give the Deputy the accurate answer in private session.</p></speech>

This is a new trend that is happening in the State.  It is happening on a professional level through the use of an online platform that is based in the UK, which charges a 10% commission fee.  I believe there are serious reasons the Minister should legislate for this.  I understand and agree with the principle, but it is illegal to promote gaming or lottery in the State without a licence.  That is very clearly stated in section 3 of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019.  It is open to any private individual or company to get a gaming or lottery permit, but the value of the prize cannot be in excess of &euro;5,000.  Only a charity or philanthropic body can allow people to win prizes up to &euro;360,000.  I have concerns because people are selling their homes using this method.  The company they are engaging with says it does not need a licence and that it is a prize competition.  British law is obviously very different to Irish law in this regard.  There are loopholes in British law that ensure that it would not fall under the definition of a lottery if one asks a skill-based question.  For example, how it gets around it not being a lottery to have a raffle competition for a house in Ireland is by asking which of these countries is home to the kangaroo.  A multiple choice of four answers is provided.  That question exempts them from having a lottery licence or coming under regulation from the lottery legislation in Britain.</p> <p>  The problem is that people who sell their houses through this means put a lot of their own resources behind it.  They have to advertise heavily online, and they could be out by tens of thousands of euro.  If the option is closed to them, they will be out of pocket.  I have concerns in that regard.  Before Report Stage we should look at how this interacts with the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019 and check the situation with the Department of Justice.  I am mindful as well that we have new heads of a Bill coming forward on online gaming in particular, as much of our legislation is catching up with where things are at.  I would encourage the Minister to consider that.  However, this section does capture the scenario whereby, hypothetically speaking, somebody in Ireland could use that platform and not promote the raffle in Ireland.  If it was only promoted in England it would be completely in compliance with the law.  Therefore, the intention is to ensure that those games would be captured.  I understand that.  I will move on to that kind of scenario, but I do not think it is what is happening in practice.</p> <p>  In the definitions on amendment No. 75, it states: "This subsection applies where an individual disposes of or of an interest in an asset (being an asset within subsection (2) or (11)) by way of a lottery or game with prizes and the proceeds of the lottery or game exceed the market value of the asset."  The key words I use are "lottery" and "games".  In this State, we have the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019, so if one wants to organise a game, one must have a gaming permit or licence, depending on the value of the tickets and the prize fund.  However, in Britain, they have different definitions.  Raffall, which is the main company that is raffling properties in Ireland, makes clear that this is neither a lottery nor a game, that it is a prize competition and it falls under that definition by asking questions.  Will this amendment capture that definition in relation to those prizes?  I am conscious that the Minister may not have the answers.</p> <p>  In the last part of the amendment, the incidental costs that can be offset include the fees that would be charged by the online platform.  The most dominant company in the market currently charges 10%, but there are other fees such as paid advertisements.  It is not about paid advertisements to sell the house for &euro;300,000, but to say that there are 20,000 tickets available at &euro;20 a ticket.  The paid advertisements are sometimes in the print media or on radio but predominantly on online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube or whatever.</p><p>They could impose a sizeable cost on the individual.</p><p> I have a number of issues in this regard.  I know that this deals with one part of it but there is probably a wider conversation required as to how this is happening, how our laws are interacting with England, how online activity muddies all of that and how one polices that.  I am concerned.  No individual in this State is legally entitled to raffle off their house.  This is not accommodated under Irish law.  It is illegal, it is an offence and it cannot be done.  The only way that a house can be raffled, as we see being done by the GAA, the credit unions and so on, is because they are allowed to apply to the court for a licence to raffle a one-off prize to the upper value of &euro;360,000, but no individual or company is allowed to do that.  These are things that are developing quite quickly but this section should be examined by the Department of Justice as to how it interacts with the Gaming and Lotteries Act, in particular, and the new Bill, the heads of which are before us.  I support the concept of this.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

To summarise, he is concerned that by the application of an intent he supports, it might in some way legitimise or regularise an activity that he has policy concerns about.  As I understand it from what he has said, this is about the intersection between how we are taxing this activity and how it is regulated by current or future legislation.  I am not fully across the gaming or licensing law on raffles in the way he has just described.  I will commit to him that before we get to Report Stage, I will go through the issues that he has raised with the Department of Justice and will revert before that Stage on this legislation to try to satisfy and answer the questions he has raised.  I can why there would be issues of legitimate concern.  While, with my officials, I can answer the tax aspect of what he is raising, he is also raising other matters that deserve a better answer than I can give now.</p></speech>

I will finish on this point.  Any gain in excess of what one would receive from selling privately should be taxed and that is what is being considered here.  My concern is that we would not introduce in the Bill the ability to collect revenue from what would be potentially an illegal activity.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is captured in what we have but it would need to be clarified because that is the only place that it could happen legally.  This is going to grow in size because there have been successful lotteries and I understand this.  It is great to see somebody who has won and one such person won a house just last week for &euro;20 in Wicklow, I believe, and fair play to them.  </p> <p>   It would be horrible to see a situation where, because this is not regulated, it will come to a point where it will be closed down.  Many of these online platforms such as Facebook ask people to have Internet protocol, IP, blockers, which means that if these are imposed, someone will not be able to sell tickets in this jurisdiction and could, therefore, be out a significant amount in an unregulated environment.  This is completely unregulated because it does not fall under the Gaming and Lotteries Act or the commissioner in Britain.</p></speech>

Can the Minister outline to us please what this technical amendment does?  While we are dealing with cross-Border mergers, I am aware that the Minister had a lengthy discussion yesterday on cross-Border workers.  Arising from last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill the Minister agreed to look at this in a tax strategy paper and that, I believe, has been done and there is further work to be done on that area.</p> <p>  I do not want to go into that because it was dealt with yesterday and I will revisit that on Report Stage but I want to make one point.  The relief that is available at this point in time for cross-Border workers during the pandemic runs out at the end of this year.  That means that they will be double taxed if they are working from home.  The guidance, as announced last night, to take effect this weekend is for those workers to work at home.  Therefore, if they are still in a position where the Government, as a result of the pandemic, is asking them to work from home, they will be subject to double taxation.  This again highlights the need for this having to be at least extended.  We need to find a wider all-island solution to this issue where workers, for different reasons such as a sick child or whatever, are working from home.  Can I ask the Minister to respond to that specific question?  Will he ensure that the provisions that are in place for cross-Border workers to be able to work from home and not to be subject to double taxation will continue into 2022? </p></speech>

This is a technical amendment to ensure that the meaning of the term &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; as used in section 633D is distinguished from the current definition of &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; in section 630.  The current definition in section 630 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 only refers to transfers of the whole or part of a company&rsquo;s trade, whereas the mergers directive applies to transfers of all of the assets and liabilities of a company.</p> <p>  Accordingly, in line with the requirements of the mergers directive, the amendment confirms that the term &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; in section 633D refers to the transfer of all the assets and liabilities of a company and is not limited to the transfer of a trade.  In summary, for the Deputy, it is a broader definition of transfer than is currently in the legislation.</p></speech>

It looks for a report to be brought forward on that concept.  I was brought forward with a view to build a better, more responsive State in order to improve our public services and strengthen our social safety net.  While some work is ongoing on that with the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, this is a proposal that the Department of Finance should examine.  It seeks to introduce a CGT rate equivalent to the higher rate of income tax, including income derived from gains.</p><p>The basis for the proposal was stolen from President Biden's American families plan and tax agenda.  A White House press release stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The President&rsquo;s tax reform will end one of the most unfair aspects of our tax system: that the tax rate the wealthy pay on capital gains and dividends is less than the tax rate that many middle-class families pay on their wages.  Households making over $1 million&mdash;the top 0.3 percent of all households&mdash;will pay the same 39.6 percent rate on all their income, equalizing the rate paid on investment returns and wages. </blockquote> <p>He brought forward reforms whereby gains in excess of $1 million would not benefit from the lower rate of capital gains tax, but would be paid at the same rate of income tax at that band.  That is similar to my proposal, which I believe is worthy of merit.  It would ensure the rate of tax paid on gains for the wealth in this society is the same as the top marginal tax rate levied on income for so many middle-income workers.  This would introduce a CGT rate of 40% on the disposal of an assets made by persons in cases where the gains accrued are in excess of individual incomes, including incomes generated by gains.  If the Minister were to introduce that, for example, on amounts in excess of &euro;500,000, it would yield &euro;28 million and individuals could still avail of the reliefs legislated for in our tax code.</p></speech>

Revenue has advised the estimated additional revenue that could be generated by introducing such a rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of assets by individuals with income in excess of &euro;200,000, is &euro;305 million.  This estimate is based on income and CGT returns for the 2018 tax year, the latest year for which full income information is available and does not include any yield in respect of companies.  It assumes no change in behaviour by individuals resulting from the increase in the tax rate.</p> <p>  Increases in rates, such as are contemplated for the purposes of the proposed report, may have a significant behavioural impact.  Capital gains tax is dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions, any estimate of additional yield must be treated with a high level of caution.  The realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.  In addition, therefore, the increase in the rate could, in theory, not lead to such a significant change in the yield from the tax.</p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, CGT, in line with all taxes, is subject to ongoing review, and this forms part of the consideration of the Tax Strategy Group and its paper on CGT which it publishes every year.  Given this matter is covered through the TSG process, I do not propose to engage in a separate reporting process on this issue.  Therefore, I do not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister has not said that this idea would be subject to the tax strategy group paper's, work that will be ongoing this summer.  I believe it should.  I take the Minister's point on estimates.  We can only go on what the Department has provided to us.  There is a significant yield from this measure.  Is the Minister saying that capital gains tax on individual gains should be charged at the same rate as the top rate of income tax?  Would he be open to the proposal of having that considered at the tax strategy group?</p></speech>

If it helps the Deputy, I will consider that idea in next year's TSG process.</p></speech>

The concept behind this is ensuring that we can support worker-owned co-operatives.  This amendment requires the Minister to publish a report on CGT in instances where a company or shares in a company are purchased by a worker co-operative and to consider options to amend the CGT regime, including exempting such purchases from CGT in order to promote employee ownership.  This is consistent with section 7 of my colleague, Senator Gavan's, Worker Co-Operatives and Right To Buy Bill 2021, introduced on 28 June this year.  We are committed to developing an economy in which workers have a greater share of ownership through work co-operatives.  These are businesses in which workers of the enterprises own at least 51% of the enterprise shares.  In this structure, ownership and labour work together: by giving workers control, more is given to the communities and so on.  It helps retain wealth at local and regional level.  It is a more sustainable way.  They perform well at meeting local employment needs and there are numerous advantages for them.  Work co-operatives are more likely to pay the living wage, have lower pay differentials and so on.</p><p>In 2005, the Scottish Government established the state agency, Co-operative Development Scotland, which is a subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise.  It was tasked with the responsibility of developing Scotland's co-operative sector.  Between 2005, when this agency was established, and 2012, the sector experienced modest growth.  This was, however, followed by a substantial 300% increase in the number of worker co-operatives in Scotland.  The number of businesses has gone from 30 to 100.  Among the measures introduced was an exemption from CGT up to a certain threshold where the sale of the controlling interest in the company was made to an employee ownership trust or worker co-operative.</p><p>This will not change the way we do business here or change enterprises dramatically.  It is a model worthy of being looked at.  A jurisdiction not far from us has looked at this issue and brought forward a taxation proposal to encourage worker co-operatives.  Not only is it certainly worthy of consideration, but it should be introduced and monitored to see if this would indeed have a positive impact on the retention and growth of companies.</p></speech>

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is now close to finalising the general scheme of a co-operative societies Bill, which sets out proposals for the reform of the legislation relating to co-operatives for the first time in almost 130 years.  This will enshrine the co-operative model in legislation for the first time.  In the context of that enactment of that Bill, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to examine the range of supports that could accompany the modernising legislation, thus ensuring co-operatives are an attractive co-operative option for doing business.  In the context of the work that Department is doing, it will examine the supports for and taxation of co-operatives once we are fully clear on the type of change the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment wants to make.  On the basis of our intention to examine the matter in that context, I do not believe it is appropriate that I, therefore, commit to a report on the matter.</p></speech>

Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's Bill on lobbying kick-started the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to produce a Bill in that area.  My Bill in regard to moneylenders, which has been kicking around for a number of years, kick-started the Minister for Finance to deal with that issue.  There are number other examples from insurance to other issues.</p> <p>  If an idea is a good one, then we should grab it regardless of where it comes from.  This amendment seeks only that the Minister would examine this issue in terms of a report.  There is no need for a restructuring of the sector.  As I said, this is not going to rock the system.  It is about exempting from CGT the proceeds from the sale of shares to co-operative structures.  I recall that during an engagement I had with the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Noonan, on the introduction of some type of incentive that I thought went too far, his response was that it was okay to introduce and monitor these and, if they do not have the right effect, they can always be amended.  That is what we do every year in the finance Bill.  This is something that should be considered.  As I said, one our nearest jurisdictions, that is, Scotland, is operating an exemption up to a certain threshold.  I encourage the Minister to examine that and to get his officials to examine it.  We have a tax strategy paper every year.  A commitment to look at it in that context would be fair enough.  I am disappointed with the response.  </p> <p>  Senator Gavan has been championing this issue for many years on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I mentioned Scotland.  In Spain and elsewhere, there are good examples of how co-operative models can be successful in terms of enterprise and benefits to the local and regional economy, but the model needs help.</p></speech>

This is based on the Government decision of 19 October 2021 to waive the court fees and associated excise duty in respect of applications for special exemption orders.  The decision was in response to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the hospitality sector and temporarily waived the court fees and excise duty on special exemption orders granted to holders of on-licences permitting the sale of alcohol beyond normal trading hours.</p><p>The waiver covered a court fee of &euro;300, which goes to the Department of Justice, and an excise duty of &euro;110, which is collected by the courts on behalf of Revenue and will apply until the end of December 2021.

This is a question about a report on the projected tax revenue generated by increases in carbon tax in each year from 2021 to 2030, its resultant impact on household carbon emissions and its interaction with the national development plan.  We have made it clear time and again that we are not opposed to behavioural taxes in principle.  We supported sugar taxes, plastic taxes and tobacco taxes earlier, in section 39, and we have supported many other such measures, but they have to work.  In the case of carbon tax, we must ensure the alternatives exist for everybody - workers, families and households.  Otherwise, all the carbon taxes will do is generate revenue for the State and make households poorer.</p><p>We know from the work that has been done that that impact falls on poorer households, lone parent households and rural households in particular.  The Government has not implemented the 100% dividend model in respect of carbon taxes as other jurisdictions have done.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are opposed to the further increase in carbon tax that has been planned.  Some of it has already taken effect in respect of motor fuel, and we can see the impact increased prices are having on individuals.  It is not the case they are jumping onto the train or getting out to buy electric cars.  This is just leaving many people poorer.  There are planned increases on home heating oil later next year, and we know where that has gone to.</p><p>There is a need for a focus on energy policy.  However, the Government's 2021 climate action plan states:</p> <blockquote> 	The planned carbon tax increases are expected to raise an additional &euro;9.5 billion in revenue over that period.  This revenue will be allocated ... [in the following ways] ... </blockquote> <p>This reliance on carbon tax revenue is repeated in the national development plan, which makes clear that &euro;5 billion in additional carbon tax over the period of the NDP has been allocated to increase capital investment in energy efficiency levels.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me the additional carbon tax revenue yield estimate of &euro;9.5 billion was based on an increase in the rate of carbon tax to &euro;100 per tonne by 2030, above the &euro;20 per tonne rate that existed until 2019.  Crucially, he said this additional total yield was calculated on a static basis, so it is estimated at an additional &euro;9.2 billion over the period 2021 to 2030 rather than &euro;9.5 billion.</p><p>The problem here is that the Government is baking into its assumptions that it will get &euro;9.5 billion in carbon tax revenue and no one will reduce their consumption of carbon between now and 2030.  The estimate is on a static basis.  The Government has put that estimate into the national development plan and the climate action plan, while we are told the Government's point of view is this is supposed to be about changing behaviour.  If it were to be successful, we would be looking at a diminishing return on carbon tax, but that is not what is planned here in numerical terms.  Will the Minister clarify that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.782" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#HH03500"><p>I will boil down to the human level the question Deputy Doherty has outlined very well about the rationale for carbon tax and what it is intended to achieve.  I got a call this week from somebody who lives in a council house in which the windows and doors are completely inadequate to insulate the house against the cold weather.  She moved into the house just a while ago.  The whole row of houses is in that condition, and the residents have to blast the heat to keep themselves warm at a level at which somebody who has a well-insulated home and the right to insulate his or her home does not have to do.  Tenants in the private rented sector and council tenants have no right to do that.  It is not allowed.  Also, in many cases they would not be able to afford to do so even if they did have that right.  They must, therefore, expend far more money to heat their homes.  The woman who contacted me described how, as the cold weather begins to set in, the cost of keeping the heat on in her house has already completely outstripped her weekly budget.</p> <p>  In my area 1% of the social housing stock will be retrofitted next year and approximately 1% was retrofitted last year.  That is about 40 houses, and there is no indication at all that retrofitting will ramp up much beyond that.  It is worth saying that in the Government's announcements on upscaling the retrofitting of homes, it anticipates, I think I am right in saying, only just over 35,000 homes by 2030.  That is out of a total social housing stock of 137,000.  The likelihood, therefore, is that many people in either social housing that will not be retrofitted for years or private rented accommodation, where it is up to the landlord, will be pumping money into keeping their homes warm, which they have absolutely no choice about doing, for their own health and well-being, and they will suffer the consequences.</p><p>Some of those people will get fuel allowances but many of them will not.  The woman I spoke to described the draught coming through the door and windows.  In that situation, one is just throwing good money after bad to try to keep the place warm.  The heat is going straight out under the door or through the windows, which need to be fixed.  The fuel allowance increases will not cover the cost and many people will not get the fuel allowance anyway.  People who are working and have an income above a certain threshold will not be entitled to the fuel allowance.  That is not just transition.  Let us be honest about it.  It is unfair to penalise that group of people or to imagine that by increasing the price via carbon tax, they will be forced to change their behaviour when they simply cannot do it.  </p><p> One could give many other examples.  Public transport in particular areas is an obvious example.  I do not mean rural areas in particular, although they are particularly badly hit by a lack of public transport, but so too are suburbs.  It is a significant issue.  Certain areas are not well served by public transport.  Indeed, there is often pressure to cut back on public transport services in those areas because they are not considered commercially viable and so on.  Therefore, the opportunity for people who are elderly or have mobility problems to get out of their cars is not there.  They are unable to get to hospital or the shops without their cars.  It is in that context we are saying this tax is unfair and the Minister needs to look at it again, particularly given the massive hikes in energy prices that are currently taking place.  I would be interested to hear how the Minister responds.  What would he say to the woman who phoned me up in that situation?  She is now going to face excessive bills because the Government thinks it is acceptable to increase carbon tax this year.</p></speech>

The logistics of bringing relief to people who want to insulate their homes to the extent required within a short space of time is definitely going to be difficult.  I am thinking aloud, which I know is a dangerous thing to do, especially in politics.  One must do it, from time to time.  I wonder is there a possibility to arrange a system whereby the grant or grants available can be used as a guarantee with lending institutions in order to enable the household to make the application forthwith and allow the retrofitting to proceed.  When the work is done to the required specifications, the lending institution will get its money out of the grant and arrangements can be made to make up any amount that remains outstanding.  Something similar was done in the 1980s, relating to the extension of dwellings.  It worked very well.  Costs were lower at the time but everything is relative.  I wonder if that might be a possibility.  It would certainly resolve the problems for many people who have homes that are not energy efficient at all and who have no possibility of meeting the deadline within a reasonable time.  The State would benefit from reduced energy provision.  The householder would also benefit.  The difference is fairly substantial.</p> <p>  I was a member of a committee which dealt with energy and transport issues in 2007.  A considerable amount of research was done at the time.  In my own humble way, I decided I would practise some of the suggestions of that research, and I did.  I introduced double glazing all round.  I ceased burning coal and introduced a wood-burning stove.  There was a considerable difference.  There was no real recognition of what was done.  Nobody recognised it.  Nobody said, "Well done" and told me that was a move in the right direction.  Nobody commented at all.  As a matter of fact, there was a review done by a television programme.  I think one had to be trendy, which is an awful phrase, to qualify for mention in it.  I happened to be the only person on that committee who was not mentioned although I was the only one who made any major improvement to the insulation of my house with a view to reducing carbon emissions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.785" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#JJ00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It is important to put in context the impact that carbon taxation is having on changes in energy prices that I know are having an impact on the living standards of many commuters and families at the moment.  In January of this year, the price of a litre of petrol stood at &euro;1.31.  According to AA Ireland, for the month of October the price for a litre of petrol stood at &euro;1.65.  That is an increase of 33 cent across the year which, for a tank of petrol or diesel, is having a large effect on the commuting costs many are facing at the moment.  However, if one looks at the change across the period from January to October, carbon taxation accounted for 2 cent of that change.  Those who appreciate and understand these things as well as I do will say that carbon tax is only one of the taxes levied on petrol and diesel, but if one looks at the movement on the price of a litre of petrol between January and October, 76% of it was due to changes that were not tax-related.  While many are facing increases in the cost of energy and fuel at the moment, the majority of the reasons for that are not related to carbon tax.  They are driven by the fact that the price of energy globally is going up for many reasons.  While I accept that here in Ireland the change we are making in carbon taxation is adding to the cost of energy for many, and commuters felt those increases from budget night onwards, it is a small share of the increase in total cost that many are facing at the moment.  If somebody was going to make the argument that carbon taxation is the reason we are seeing an increase in the price of a tank of diesel or petrol, I would reply that it is a contributory factor but it is the smallest of the factors at the moment.  There are many other forces at play that are driving the inflation of the cost here and elsewhere.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty talked about the effect that an increase in carbon pricing can have on the most vulnerable.  I understand that, but that is why it is important to read into the record of the committee all of the things that the Government is doing from a budgetary point of view to help support those who might be most affected by such a change.  There has been an increase of &euro;2 per week in the qualified child payment for a child under the age of 12 and &euro;3 per week for a child over the age of 12.  There has been an increase of &euro;3 per week in the living alone allowance.  There has been a &euro;5 increase per week in the fuel allowance.  There has also been an increase of &euro;10 per week to the income threshold of the working family payment.  The cumulative effect of those increases is that those who have the least are protected the most from the changes we have made in carbon taxation.  The ESRI and others would state that carbon taxation has the ability, in the absence of measures that can offer compensation, to be a regressive tax because it is based on how much carbon people use with no regard to their income.</p><p>That is why the Government has come forward with a package of measures that are cofunded by the increase in carbon tax to protect those who could be impacted most by a rise in energy pricing and the cost of fuel to which the carbon tax is only a contributory factor but not the cause.</p><p> Deputy Doherty said we should not move forward with a measure like this unless options are available to more who face the rising cost of commuting.  This is the reason, for example, the Government is involved in the roll-out of the ConnectIreland programme, which tries to expand the bus network available to towns and villages across the country.  It is why the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Government have sought to make additional funding available to CI&Eacute; to support the availability of bus services around the country and to put routes in place, through ConnectIreland, that will provide public transport options, particularly for those in our rural towns and villages who do not have the kind of public transport options that they want to have.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett's asked what I would say to the older constituent who contacted him.  I get those calls myself.  I would tell that person that we are making funding available to local authorities to accelerate their retrofitting programmes for local authority housing.  That programme is working.  I can see it in my own constituency.  I can see the homes that are owned and run by Dublin City Council gradually being upgraded.  That is happening.  Those in the most need of upgrading should be prioritised.  I would tell that person that I will do all I can to try to ensure that the local authority prioritises those most affected by having poor energy efficiency in their homes.  For those who do not live in local authority housing, we are supporting Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, with grant programmes.  As the Deputy is aware, at other points there has been a higher demand for grants than there has been money available to SEI to make grants available.  That is why as we move into next year and beyond, we are making more money available to fund those grant programmes.  At the moment the cost of retrofitting is prohibitively expensive for many.  The Deputy will tell me that because it is expensive at the moment, we should not go ahead with these types of changes, or I think he might make that argument to me.  I will not put words in his mouth.  The Deputy spoke about the older person who contacted him, and I am also contacted, but he will also be aware of all the contact we have from teenagers, children and younger adults who are convinced, and they are right to be convinced, that they will not have the environment and ecology that the Deputy and I grew up with and enjoyed.  They are scared about what that will mean for their lives and for their children.  They are right to be worried because our environment and world is changing.  I do not believe it is honest to argue that we can deal with that scale of change, try to mitigate it and reduce the harm that is coming without saying that we will not put up the price of the ingredient that is the cause of that change.  That is what carbon tax is.  The vast majority of scientists and economists who are advising governments and policymakers about what to do to deal with this say that carbon taxation is not all the answer but a vital and necessary component.  That is one reason this type of change, which is probably the most difficult move in carbon taxing we have made in the last three years, is still on balance the right thing to do.  I appreciate all the arguments that the cost of electric vehicles or retrofitting homes is too high.  However, we know that where there is consumer demand for technologies the price will fall over time.  Take technologies that have become commonplace in our homes, such as televisions or phones.  The price of technologies that were prohibitively expensive not too long ago have fallen as demand increased and as the private sector, enabled by governments, responds to that demand.  I accept that electric vehicles and hybrids are too expensive for many but they are falling in price and they are cheaper than they were some years ago.  There are more vehicles available which have that technology.  </p><p> That is part of the answer to Deputy Durkan's point.  He asked how to make those technologies more readily affordable to more people.  There are two ways.  The first is that the Government does more to bring the cost down through grants and low-cost loans.  We already do good work on that through SEI, for example.  The second is that over time the cost of those technologies should fall.</p><p> This section is contentious and will be opposed by many on  Committee and Report Stages.  I appreciate the difficulty that an increase in carbon taxing creates for many now.  However, it is a low share of the total reasons for the increases in energy prices.  Some 76% of the cost increase in petrol and 71% in diesel is not related to what has happened in tax.  Global forces are at play.  If we accept that the climate crisis is a crisis that can threaten our civilisation, which are big words to use but I believe that is the prospect we face, then moves such as carbon taxation, as tough as they are, is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I was on local radio this morning, not my local radio but Shannonside, on this matter which I have raised with the Minister's Government colleagues for the last month.  The number 30 bus which provides connection between Donegal and Dublin, particularly the airport, and goes through Cavan, left people standing on the side of the road at 3 a.m. on Monday morning, missing flights to Germany and other places to go to work, because it did not turn up.  Forget about all these glossy brochures that the Government keeps launching, if the Minister lived in rural Ireland he would know that it was the 75th time this year that bus did not turn up in the middle of the night leaving people on the side of the road.  He might also be conscious that it was the 109th time in the last year that it did not turn up.  That is the reality.  Those are the realities for people living in my community and all the rest.  The first day I came here, I laughed when someone asked me if I had taken the train.</p><p>The last time there was a train in Donegal was in the early 1960s and that is the reality for a lot of people.  The reality is that a carbon tax will increase the price of diesel and petrol when their price is at an all time high.  Another reality is that for every litre of petrol as much as 95 cent is tax.  We know that behavioural taxes work but there must be alternatives.  When a bus does not turn up in the dead of night or when people do not have money under their mattresses but the Minister for Finance says that sometime in the future prices will reduce and people will be able to afford the price of an electric car so suck it up in between because we are pushing up the price of heating and petrol.  The reality is that a carbon tax makes people poor.  I ask the Minister to answer my question.  The Government has baked in &euro;9.5 billion of carbon taxes that does not factor in a reduction in consumption.  Is this a revenue raising generator?  Will there be a 10% reduction in carbon consumption as outlined in the climate action plan?  If so, does that leave a hole in the financing of the national development plan so the allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for agriculture and the billions of euro for just transition?</p></speech>

At all times when I responded I was at pains to acknowledge the difficulty that people face who do not have regular public transport or who are let down by public transport in the way that Deputy Doherty has just said.  The people to whom he refers are also those citizens who face a change in nature and change in the future of our country.  The generations to come will look back at us and ask why we did not do more but they will think of the Deputy-----</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty has laid out very clearly what side of the debate he is on.

I think that is his view.</p></speech>

When the generations to come look back on a world that is going to be marked by the movement of people due to environmental reasons such as flooding, and summers that are hotter than we can imagine, they will ask which side of the great debate one was on.  Deputy Doherty is on the side of the debate that says it does not want to take any decisions that are capable of delivering change even when that change is difficult.</p></speech>

He is correct to say that I did not answer due to the variety of other issues with which I had to deal.  Apologies for that.</p> <p>  The most recent projection provided by my Department for the period 2021 to 2030 is &euro;9.2 billion in additional carbon tax revenues.  Projections are point-in-time exercises and the reviews are reviewed periodically to take account of factors such as changes in the macroeconomic environment, policy decisions by Government and other factors.  My Department's carbon tax receipts projection for the period 2021 to 2030, in a declining carbon tax base, reflects a change in behaviour in response to the tax among other things.  This estimate uses a base of 21.5 metric tonnes of CO2, which reflects the estimated carbon tax base in 2019 informed by carbon tax receipts for that year.</p> <p>  This carbon tax base projections for the period 2020 to 2030 reflect a trajectory of official Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, emissions projections.  Specifically, this adjustment reflects the EPA's non-ETS with additional measures and projections for annual equivalent emissions of CO2.  The particular scenarios used to inform my Department's projections as it identifies non-ETS emissions are reflective of emissions subject to the carbon tax while ETS submissions are not subject to the carbon tax.  It also reflects a with-additional measures scenario, which includes the Government's commitment to a &euro;100 per tonne carbon tax by 2030.</p></speech>

For administrative convenience where a number of persons, including at least one taxable person, are established in the State and are closely bound by financial, economic and organisational links, Revenue may deem them to be a single taxable person referred to as a group.</p> <p>  Under these arrangements one person or company in the group is responsible for complying with the group's VAT requirements such as lodging returns and payments with Revenue, but each member of the group is jointly and separately liable in the event of non-compliance.  The legislation is amended to require that the Revenue Commissioners are notified of a significant change in the organisational links between the persons in a VAT group and to apply a penalty for each taxable period in which Revenue was not notified of that change.  The existing legislation does not require that Revenue is informed of any change to the VAT group such as a group person ceasing to trade, although this normally happens in practice in line with published guidance.  However, there have been occasions when Revenue has been notified of significant changes to a group's structure and this has led to legal and administrative difficulties as well as a potential loss of revenue.  This amendment has been made to put the administrative requirement to notify Revenue on a legislative footing and to apply a penalty where this is not done.  </p> <p>  In summary, this refers to where there are changes in the nature of a group and when Revenue is dealing with issues on how the VAT law should be applied to a group that has changed.  Revenue has dealt with this on an administrative basis up to this point and now we are looking to put it on a legislative footing.</p></speech>

This is in a context of rising energy prices and their impact on low- and middle-income households.  Let me be clear we are looking for a temporary waiver which recognises there is a major issue with energy prices.  The Minister may wish to hit back and ask me what side I am on in the great debate but next time he is talking to Secretary Yellen, or maybe President Biden, he might tell them they are on the wrong side of that debate as well because I do not think any carbon taxes are being introduced at a federal level at the minute.  They have a different policy which is supply-side.  That is what is needed.  We need real investment to ensure we can allow for people to change their behaviour away from fossil fuels and carbon.</p><p>There have been 35 hikes in energy prices over the last period.  The Minister has acknowledged to me in the D&aacute;il that two European countries are engaging with the Commission on a temporary reduction of their VAT levels on energy.  The Minister has made the point, and rightly so, that Spain, for example, was moving from a higher rate than we have.  Ours is 13.5% while Spain's was over 20%.  However, Spain has reduced energy bills by 11%.  The Czech Republic has moved further and zero-rated energy bills.  It is engaging with the Commission on this.  What the Minister did not acknowledge in the D&aacute;il debate is we have the highest level of energy bills.  While other countries might have a higher rate of tax, when we compare the household in Spain, France or Italy to the Irish one we pay a higher cost in terms of our energy bill.  Therefore, this pressure on families across the State is quite significant.  It is probably felt in different ways in different places.  We can see from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures that energy prices are increasing.  Electricity has gone up.  Gas has gone up.  Home heating oil has gone up.  Significantly, home heating oil has gone up the most.  Indeed, in some cases it is more than two or three times more expensive than other ways of heating a home.  Home heating oil is the dominant means of heating a home in more rural communities, especially those in the west, north west and Border areas.  Unfortunately, these are also communities with lower disposable incomes and houses which are more likely to be energy-poor.  This is a real pressure on people facing into this winter.</p><p>We are not arguing for reducing VAT on this forever.  We are asking if the State can do something at this point in time to take the pressure off families who are at the pin of their collars as a result of these energy price hikes over the winter months.  There are two ways to do that.  The Government can do as other European countries have done by reducing VAT or follow the Czech Republic and zero-rate it.  Alternatively, it can use the toolbox provided to members states whereby a refund is also possible.  However, the Minister has decided on an alternative strategy, that is, to actually increase the price of these energy Bills come next year by increasing the carbon tax.  That is not the great debate.  I am serious.  If the Minister thinks that is the great debate we are in serious trouble.  The real debate is how to make the necessary investment across broad sectors of society to ensure people have the opportunity to make the transition.  The Minister should also remember the biggest polluters are not individuals but large companies.  Everybody has their role to play.  I will say this again and he can brand me whatever way he wants.  We believe in taxes that change behaviour.  We have called for them in the past.  However, we do not support taxes which are just going to make houses poorer for the sake of it when the Government is not providing alternatives.  Thus what is missing in this Finance Bill are the type of initiatives we suggested.  Examples of this include additional support for second-hand electric vehicles, additional support for those on lower incomes to purchase electric vehicles, additional support for households for retrofitting, the expansion of our public transport fleet and so on.  These are not included.</p><p>Returning to the amendment, this is a temporary issue.  It is what I would be doing in if I sat in the Minister's seat.  I would be looking at introducing a temporary VAT rate of 0% over the winter months to help people with what are unprecedented and unexpected rises in their energy prices.  Many households may be able to sail through but others simply were not budgeting for this and in the run-up to Christmas it is putting them to the pin of their collars.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.838" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#MM02000"><p>Yes.  Was it the Garrett FitzGerald Government that fell over VAT on children's shoes?  I am not sure about the Minister's take on the historical debate around climate change and the issues around addressing it or failing to address it and whether he is right that it is a carbon tax.  However, if the energy price crisis now unfolding for people continues at the current pace because they cannot do anything to opt for alternatives as those alternatives do not exist then he may have a very serious political problem.  Ultimately, the answer is to move away from dependence on fossil fuels, which me must do rapidly to address the climate crisis, and ideally to have more sustainable sources of energy that do not damage the environment and which are not vulnerable to the swings and roundabouts of the market.  We need to have the ability to produce our own energy that is in stable supply, is not too expensive and does not pollute and destroy the environment for the future.  However, in the meantime, if the policy pursued by the Government is one that ends up punishing the least well-off and those least capable of dealing with the transition, due to the tenure of their homes, their income levels, how the transport issue impacts on them or whatever, I tell the Minister the Government will sabotage efforts to deal with the climate.</p><p> We know that some of the more dark political forces in this world have actively tried to turn people against the climate action agenda.  Pretty much everyone in here agrees that we need to pursue climate action vigorously in order to address this existential crisis.  The biggest danger for us in trying to address the climate crisis - I really mean this and it is not rhetorical flourish - is the fear that fairly dark and dangerous political forces might turn people against the climate agenda and use the fact that it is economically punishing them in order to gain traction for climate scepticism.  This should not be a surprise to us.</p><p>The Minister has to do something about the energy price hikes.  I accept what he said to the effect that the carbon tax is only part of it, but it does add insult to injury in a situation where people are seeing price hikes of hundreds of euros.  There is a big distinction between discretionary spending and non-discretionary spending.  It seems as if the Government's approach to carbon taxes does not really see this distinction.  It is not discretionary for people to heat their homes.  Earlier, the Minister told me to tell the woman I spoke about that we are putting money into retrofitting her home.  In fact, I did say that to her.  I told here there was a retrofit programme but that I had absolutely no idea when her home would be retrofitted.  I can take a pretty damn good guess that it will not be for a few years.  I hope I am wrong and that when I speak to the council this week I will be told it will go straight down and do the windows and doors.  I strongly suspect that this is not the answer I will get, however.</p><p> The promise is that at some time it will happen.  In our area, 1% of the relevant properties are being done per year.  It seems to be the pattern in the Dublin councils that 1% of the social housing stock is being done each year.  This is just not good enough.  Potentially, the woman to whom I refer could be waiting ten or 15 years at this rate.  It will be cold comfort to her, to use a really bad pun, that her doors and windows will be insulated in ten or 15 years' time but that, in the meantime, she has to suck up shockingly high energy costs and, perhaps, get blamed for being a climate laggard because she is not reducing her CO2 emissions.  Others who can afford to do this have done it.</p><p> It is about the level of comfort.  I find that ironic.  This is why I am not sure about price signals when it comes to these kinds of usages of CO2.  In our budget submissions, we proactively proposed carbon-type taxes on aviation, some of the polluting sectors in the economy and the profits of those sectors that make money from pollution.  When we are speaking about expenditures that people have no choice but to make in order to live their lives, and stating that putting a price signal on them will change their behaviour, I do not buy it unless there are alternatives.  I suggest the Minister takes seriously the warning that if we get this wrong and do not have a just transition, then we may turn off the climate action agenda significant sections of the population and the people we need on our side to make the necessary climate changes and to carry through the climate action we need to deal with the climate crisis.  This would be very dangerous.</p></speech>

I should mention that the Government that fell did not do so as a result of a tax on children's shoes.  It fell over VAT chargeable on all clothing and footwear.  The Opposition of the day selected the children's bits and that is how it has been tagged ever since.  These are the type of things that happen in politics.</p> <p>  I remember back in the 1970s when we built a lot of houses.  They were built, in anticipation of the future, with no chimneys.  A grant had to be given in order that chimneys could be put in place in countless houses throughout the country.  At the time, everyone had been saying it was going to be warm because there was climate change at that time as well, but it went in the opposite direction.  There is a pitfall we need to be wary of.  I mentioned what I have done in my own small way to address the issues involved.  The action we took reduced, by approximately 65%, fossil fuel consumption in the house.  When the really savage winter came, which drove temperatures way down, we were able to control the heat and keep 14 or 15 radiators going while at the same time never touching fossil fuels.  It was a practical experiment I carried out to prove it could be done.  We need to do a few more things.</p> <p>  I am afraid that we could have a cold snap that lasts two or three months, particularly because the weather has been more extreme in recent times.  We see this from looking at our televisions.  It might be beneficial to consider how it could be dealt with.  LPG biogas is one option.  It seems to reduce emissions by more than 90%.  It may be a step in the right direction in the meantime.  It would help to keep people with a reasonable degree of comfort in some shape or form while we stride towards the targets we have to achieve in any event.</p> <p>  I have had many arguments and debates about this in recent years, particularly those who have said it will never happen, that we will never need to adapt our lifestyles in this fashion and that it was all a scare and part of an international scam to scare people.  We have to get away from that.  I fully accept that the Government is doing what it needs to do as quickly as possible, but it might not be quick enough for the people who will be caught in the meantime.  I ask that some provision be made or a plan put in place to address the issues that might arise in the event of a sharp severe cold winter or cold spell during the winter that would affect the people we are speaking about.  It affects all walks of society, including the wealthy, the not so wealthy and the poor.  Everybody is affected by the extremes of temperatures when they come.  Those extremes will come again.  I ask that we look at this and not take panic measures but, rather, take steps that will have an impact and to place in the hands of the people the ways and means of working their way out of this particular situation until we reach the position to which we aspire.</p></speech>

It will cost a household &euro;800 on average.  There have already been 30 hikes since 1 January.  People are already hard pressed with the cost of childminding, cr&egrave;che facilities and rent and now they are faced with this.  It is an issue of life or death.  There is the concept of excess winter deaths.  I have been trying to get my head around it recently.  My understanding of it is that it measures the number of people who die over the winter months over and above the number of people who die, on average, over a similar period at other times of the year.</p><p>My understanding is that the State, fairly consistently, is at the top of the European table for the highest number of excess winter deaths - 2,000 or 2,500 per annum.  Those people do not die simply of the cold; they die of a combination of the cold and fuel poverty.  Now that we have this huge surge in energy prices on top of that.</p><p> What is the Government doing?  The Minister is doing little or nothing, I would suggest.  In some European countries, governments have taken significant action, not off their own bat but under extreme pressure from below in society.  We have seen that in Spain, Greece and Italy, but there has been little or nothing here.  There are things the Government could do.  There is a 30% increase in the carbon tax.  The Minister does not have to agree and say that the carbon tax should be abolished and replaced, by the way, with a serious tax on the big polluters in big business.  He could just say, "Freeze the increase for this year", but the Government will not do that.  The Minister could say that we will go down the road of price controls, with a tough maximum per-unit price for electricity and gas for home heating, etc.  The Government will not do that.  The Minister could say that the ESB should be run on a not-for-profit basis.  The ESB made &euro;363 million in the first six months of this year.  Up until 2001, the ESB was allowed to operate on a break-even basis.  Legislation was introduced and changes were made, and the company cannot do that anymore.  It operates on a for-profit basis.  It should operate on a not-for-profit basis whereby it would be allowed to break even and give back some of those huge profits to protect householders' living standards and, in some cases, lives this winter.</p><p> Deputy Doherty's proposal is a good one.  It does all that we, as a committee, can do to suggest that a report be made.  The State is charging VAT on these energy bills.  The idea of waiving or reducing that is a positive step that could be taken to protect people, but the Minister will not do that.</p><p> Briefly, on the idea that this hits the wealthy, the not-so-wealthy and the poor, it may do so.  If you are wealthy, you can absorb it.  If you are not so wealthy, you will struggle to absorb it, to make ends meet and to heat your home.  What many people are doing is rationing and only heating their homes to a fraction of what they really need.  If you are poor, and particularly if you are poor and old, you could pay a very heavy price this winter.  The policy could and should be changed.  I support the proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.843" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#OO00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for the different points that they have raised.  I will begin with the points put forward by Deputy Doherty.  He is correct in stating that two countries within the European Union are pursuing the action that he has described, but 25 are not doing so.  As for what those other countries are doing, they are doing the kind of things that we are looking at doing, which is putting in place social welfare measures to support those who are affected the most by it and putting in place other things to try to support families and workers at a time of big challenge.</p> <p>  Of course, the most significant thing we are doing to try to help families with the rising cost of living is to increase tax credits and reduce the amount of income at which somebody pays the higher rate of income tax in Ireland, something  which Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Doherty are opposed to.  If the Deputy looks at the Sinn F&eacute;in budget submission, which, incidentally, does not include the VAT measure he is now championing, there are no measures that talk about how the Deputy will significantly reduce the cost of living in the way that, for example, the changes that we are making to tax credits and to the standard rate cut-off point are capable of doing.  The measure that the Deputy is championing in respect of VAT is not included in the Sinn F&eacute;in budget submission.  Somebody on a middle income who is experiencing a rising cost of living should benefit from the tax changes that the Government is making from 1 January that are about trying to support workers at a time in which costs are going up, which Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to doing.</p> <p>  I have also taken the opportunity to look at the measures that Deputy Doherty is proposing here to try to make public transport more available.  The Deputy is proposing an increase of &euro;49 million in funding for the Department of Transport on current terms, of which &euro;25 million would be a grant for taxi drivers.  The Deputy is proposing a change in the Department of Transport funding of &euro;119 million, of which &euro;40 million is for roads improvements - something I would support.  However, of that &euro;119 million, only &euro;32 million is increased investment in the public transport fleet.  Deputy Doherty is talking about wanting to increase and improve options for those who use public transport but in his alternative budget, which I am sure the Deputy would want to implement if he was Minister for Finance, there is no evidence that he has the thinking, the solutions or the vision to make that happen.  This is derived from the document the Deputy has that he has championed.</p> <p>  At a time when we will be approaching a point where we will see families under pressure from energy prices that are going up for reasons that are far bigger than the change in carbon taxes, we will be making a change in personal taxes that is targeted at helping them, which, I accept, everybody will benefit from, and Deputy Doherty is against doing that.  The Deputy does not believe that should happen.  While I understand why Deputy Doherty is championing this idea, the fact that the majority of countries in the European Union are not doing it points to the fact that there are different ways of doing it.  Those are different ways and different policies that the Government is pursuing and implementing, particularly through what we are looking to do with changes in personal taxation.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett said something very important about darker forces at work that would seek to introduce further division at a time in which we need to make a change in how we use carbon and how we organise our economies and even our societies in view of the imminence of the climate crisis.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to challenge ourselves about how we can maintain public consent for what we are doing at a time when there are already so many pressures evident on building.  That is why we are using the money that we are receiving from a higher level of carbon tax to reinvest in things that can be meaningful to help our society cope with the changes that we will have to make and that may be imminent to deal with the climate crisis, such as what we are looking to do with the retrofitting of local authority homes.</p><p>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that we need to do more and do it quicker.  Ultimately, however, we need to pay for how we are going to do it.  That is why we are putting so much of the money back into social welfare measures to maintain that consent.</p><p> In the change in carbon tax that is often pointed to as an example of the potential to galvanise public support against this, which is the change in fuel taxation that happened in France, my understanding is that the additional revenue just went into the general coffers of the French state.  In Ireland, we have made a very different decision so that we are, in effect, hypothecating the additional tax revenue that comes in from the higher taxes to try to win and maintain public support for the changes we are making at a time in which things are tough enough.</p><p> I do not want to rehash the debate we had earlier.  I would say to the Deputy, however, that there is another danger here, which is the danger of not being open and honest with those we serve regarding the kind of change that we will have to make.  The kind of change that we will have to make will involve using lower amounts of carbon and engaging completely with our environment but in a fundamentally different way.  Deputy Doherty is right that this something that states are not in a position to do at the moment.  However, it does not take away from the fact that, again, the overwhelming majority of scientists and economists who are experts on this topic say that carbon taxation is part of what we have to do if we are to have any hope of bringing about change in our society in advance of nature completely changing in front of our eyes.  I accept it is a difficult argument to make at this point but it is an argument that is worth making, and it is worth making in this Finance Bill and in the months to come as we have to make the case for this measure.</p><p> In regard to the points made by Deputy Barry on excess winter capacity, I will definitely look at the data sets to which he referred to understand this a bit more.  In the short time in which he made his point to me, I have taken a look to try to understand the issue and the data set to which he referred.  Any death that happens in Ireland at any point in the year is a death we are trying to avoid, particularly if it is for reasons we can control or influence.  From the quick look I have had at the data to which the Deputy refers, he is correct that, across the winter period, there appear to be pointers of excess winter mortality in the country.  However, the same data also indicated there has been a decline in Ireland since 2009, when the recording may first have begun.  This is only a provisional point from me and I will study this further before Report Stage.  Nonetheless, the data suggest excess winter mortality has declined and that there is a broad set of factors that lead to that.</p><p> On the carbon tax point in particular, I go back to what I said earlier, namely, out of all of the reasons the price of energy is going up at the moment, carbon tax accounts for a small share of the total increase in energy prices during this year.  It is a small share and there are other reasons behind it.  The Deputy made the point we should be taxing the big companies and the big users of energy more but they will be paying carbon tax.  Anybody who is consuming the forms of energy covered by this carbon tax will be paying it.  They will pay more because they use more energy; they can afford to pay more and they will.  Many of those companies are now making commitments to move to net zero and to reduce their use of carbon by 2030.  That is the contribution they will have to make to play their part in how we get ready for the change that is coming as we try to reduce harm.</p></speech>

As the Minister pointed out, the amendment was not included in the alternative budget, and asked why that is the case.  I think he should be afforded an opportunity to hear why it was not in our alternative budget.  Indeed, he is the reason for it.  The Minister informed us, through a reply to a parliamentary question, that it would not be possible to zero-rate energy prices.  That question was raised with the Minister by my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, in seeking clarification as to whether that would be allowed by the European Commission.  The Minister did not respond to Deputy Farrell's request at that time.  The day after the budget, the commission published its toolbox to tackle rising energy prices, which allows for a rebate of energy prices, of which the Minister will be aware.  On 25 October, the Czech finance minister wrote to the European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, asking for a temporary waiving of VAT.  The reason that we did not argue for this prior to the budget is because the Minister told us it was not possible.  However, when we looked at what the Minister's colleagues in the Czech Republic were doing and what the Commission agreed the day after the budget, we called for this support to be introduced for families at this point in time.

However, what I do acknowledge, and it is why we have called for it, is that we have seen a finance minister stand up for their constituents and engage with the Commission.  We understand, from public announcements, that the Commission is going to facilitate that request for the winter months.  While it may not have been possible previously, it now appears, with the engagement between a finance minister and the Commission, that it will be possible.  However, there is another way to skin the same cat, which is to ensure that we offer a refund or a rebate to the same individuals.  That is allowed under the toolbox that was announced by the Commission on 13 October.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty has just acknowledged that.  As for the rebate, how you would organise a rebate to every energy user in the country, with the urgency that Deputy Doherty is describing, remains to be seen.  I stand by what I said.  The Deputy is referencing two countries; 25 others did not take such measures.  Those other 25 countries are not standing idly by when their citizens are suffering from higher energy costs.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 112, which is coming up, relates to the same issue.  The Minister has decided that the amount of money that will be accrued by the State in relation to the banking levy will be reduced by &euro;63 million.  The levy is being extended, but the revenue will be reduced by &euro;63 million.  The Minister has indicated that this is a result of KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank leaving the market.  However, they have not left the market yet.  They are still servicing their loans and they will have a footprint here.  Crucially, what will happen is that the loans will be transferred to the other banks, and therefore, the other banks will get larger and will have bigger capacity to make a contribution.</p><p>Despite that, the levy will be reduced.  I think that is the wrong decision in the context of the discussion we had earlier where the Minister has facilitated, through the Finance Bill and not accepting amendments, that these same institutions will not pay tax on their profits for the guts of two decades.  The levy we were getting from the banking sector will be reduced even though these deposits will go to these large banks, in the main.  The levy was originally introduced in line with the DIRT tax which was in relation to the level of deposits that the institutions held.  We understand the Minister is one of those who is resistant to the idea of 100% redress for the families whose homes are crumbling around them.  It probably speaks to why he has not met them.  I will not open that again but the reason he should meet them is not because I have asked him many times or that the families have but because it is the decent thing to do.  In the context of the Bill that will come in from the State in relation to this, I put it to the Minister about a month ago about the motion that was passed, which, indeed, the Minister voted for on 100% redress and a contribution from the banks.  Last week, the Minister confirmed to me in a response to a Parliamentary Question that he has not had any engagement with the banks about a contribution to the mica redress despite the fact that whatever scheme comes forward will improve the balance sheets of those banks substantially.  I do not know what it takes.  I would really encourage the Minister to go and see the families.  I have spoken to them many times and told them that despite the differences of opinion between the Minster and I on politics and those between our parties that he is a decent person.  I think that any person who goes into those houses and looks at what is happening to those homes and those families will be impacted.  You cannot really learn or read about this, you need to see it and feel it for yourself.  I think then that the Minister would have a different approach to some of these measures because the financial institutions need to make a contribution on this.  Maybe he has something up his sleeve, such as a levy.  This was one way of ensuring that a contribution would be made over the coming years by retaining the levy for a substantial period where the financial institutions would pay a significant price towards the final cost of the scheme. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#WW00200"><p>I was in the Chair yesterday when this was being discussed and I could not contribute, although I wanted to.  I dealt with the pyrite situation several years ago when it became obvious at the very beginning.  I agree entirely that this is something that the homebuyers or home builders could do nothing about.  They were victims of circumstances outside their control.  Prior to that, we had the house builders guarantee scheme in this country, which was very effective.  It was a simple way by which the construction industry, through self-regulation that worked, tried to ensure that the quality of materials going into the construction of houses was such as not to leave them liable to claims in the future.  The insurance companies and local authorities were involved in it.  It worked well until somebody decided it was no longer necessary.  With pyrite, the guarantee was up to &euro;30,000 and after that there was a serious problem.  After &euro;30,000, the problem was still the same for the individual householders.  I suggest that whatever arrangement is arrived at that it be done in such a way to ensure that all the constituent bodies are involved.  That means the Construction Federation of Ireland, Engineers Ireland, local authorities, insurance companies and the banks all have a contribution to make, and can do so.  I am not sure that punishing the banks beforehand will encourage them to do anything like that.  The primary aim now should be to address the issues of the appalling disintegration of people's houses.</p> <p>  I walked into those houses back then and it was appalling.  I walked into the trenches that were dug in the middle of the houses, in some cases by the people themselves, in an effort to remedy the faults.  That was before there was a remediation programme.</p> <p>  This is a serious issue and will become serious for all parts of the country as time goes on.  I fully appreciate that people are directly effected by it now and the extent of that.  We must all stand in solidarity with the public representatives of all parties in those areas who are united in doing everything possible to try to ensure that the issues are dealt with in a way that does not mean that the people have to live in penury for the rest of their lives.  Something along the lines of what was a solid reliable scheme should be put in place.  If it has to be done retrospectively, then so be it, but the constituent bodies should be brought into it.</p> <p>  There used to be a clerk of works in local authorities which was dispatched.  That was not a good idea.  With the banks, there was a system where someone building a one-off house could not draw down the loan unless there was some certification on the quality and condition of the houses.  Why would they?  They were going to be liable afterwards.  All these issues need to be wound into a scheme that will deal with the issue and assuage the concerns of the public, particularly the householders whose quality of life has been seriously threatened by something that was totally and absolutely outside their control.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#WW00300"><p>Unless the Minister can persuade me otherwise, this section should be opposed.  I apologise if I am repeating points made earlier.  This is effectively a &euro;63 million tax cut for the banking sector.  The Minister is planning to exempt KBC and Ulster Bank, which are exiting the market, from the bank levy.  The business that KBC and Ulster Bank do will remain and will be taken over by other entities.  The projected revenue for the bank levy goes from &euro;150 million to &euro;87 million.  We will get &euro;63 million less, even though the amount of banking business that will be conducted in the State will remain exactly the same.  The beneficiaries of this will be the remaining pillar banks which will have less tax imposed on them, in terms of the bank levy, than they should for the amount of business they have.  Maybe it is Ulster Bank and KBC which are the beneficiaries.  The Minister can enlighten us on that.  As I understand it, and I am open to hearing what the Minister has to say, this amounts to a &euro;63 million cut in the levy that would otherwise accrue from the banks.  It also points to something else, namely, the problem with the banking sector in this country.  Given the huge suffering and hardship endured by people in this country in order to bail these people out because of their systemic importance to maintain this banking system.</p><p>That is the way I want to put it.  People will say that some of those banks were not beneficiaries, Ulster Bank, for example, although it was bailed out elsewhere.</p><p> I question the system.  We suffered greatly and are still suffering the consequences of the approach that was taken to the banking and financial crash.  The banking sector is still in disarray.  Let us not forget that it also charges the highest interest rates of any banking sector anywhere in Europe.  It has not exactly done us many favours since we bailed it out.  Should the lesson that we take from the financial and banking crash, and indeed from the departure of many players in the Irish banking system, not be that we need to fundamentally revise our attitude to how banking operates and look for a different model of banking?</p><p> Deputy Barry or Deputy Doherty may well have said this before me but it will not surprise anyone to hear me say that we need to think about a not-for-profit banking model, essentially a bigger version of what credit union banking is about.  Credit unions pursue social and societal objectives rather than the bottom line, which is what banks do.  That approach leads banks to do certain things or just depart when it does not suit them to do certain things, leaving customers in the lurch, flogging off their mortgages and creating great uncertainty, fear and anxiety.  That is a bigger point arising from this.</p><p> I ask the Minister to explain how this is justified.  It seems to be more pandering to the banks when we need to look at radically reforming the banking sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.884" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#XX00200"><p>I thank the Deputies.  There are three points here.  One is about how we respond to the great harm done by mica.  I am faced with calls all the time to meet groups about every issue the Government is dealing with that involves the use of money.  I am inevitably called on to meet those affected by mica.  If I decide to meet residents and homeowners who have had such an awful time with this trauma, it will not be because of public calls for me to do so but because I either feel it is the right thing to do or decide that it can help me with inputting into the decision the Government will make.</p> <p>  On the issue before the committee, it is worth noting that this revenue stream was due to come to an end this year.  We had not included in any of our forecasts for 2022 the extension of a bank levy and assumed the continuation of revenues from it.  From a budgeting point of view, any decision made about the extension of the bank levy was going to bring in additional revenue versus our budgetary forecasts for 2022.</p> <p>  I made the decision to do this because we have two banks that are either closing down for new business or have closed down.  Next year, we will need to see 1.4 million customer accounts transition from the two banks that are leaving Ireland to the three banks we still have.  That is a massive change in the loans, savings, business and personal lives of well over 1 million business owners and workers in the State.  My view was that any change in how the bank levy was applied could make that more difficult.  As to whether we are giving a tax reduction to any bank, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB will continue to pay the same bank levy they paid this year.  No bank will receive a reduction in the bank levy.  Two banks are in the process of leaving Ireland and since they are leaving this economy, my view was that it was not appropriate that they pay the levy.</p></speech>

I do not quite understand, from the Minister's response, how the decision was reached and what precisely he is trying to effect.  I am one of the account holders affected by this and it is of extreme concern, as it is for 1 million other people too.  It is a major hassle.</p> <p>  All the account holders and their business will stay here and be transferred over.  My point is that all the business stays here.  It is just that Ulster Bank and KBC will leave.  I cannot figure out who is benefiting from that.  As far as I understand, the levy is linked to the amount of business and the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, obligations of the banks.  Do the DIRT obligations change?  If they are calculated as they were previously and applied to all the banks, then the DIRT obligation remains the same because there is the same amount of deposits and so on.  All of that remains the same.  The only difference is that KBC and Ulster Bank have moved out because it suits them.  Either they are being rewarded for essentially doing the dirt on a 1 million customers for commercial reasons or the banks that remain, which will now have all of that business and accounts transferred to them, will escape the levy that they would have paid if those people were all their customers to begin with.  The amount would remain at &euro;150 million.  I take the Minister's explanation that he had not projected it and this is an extension, but assuming the extension was applied to everybody as if all those account holders and business had been in just three banks before, we would be getting &euro;150 million, but now we will get &euro;63 million less.  That is how I understand it.</p><p>We are looking for a report on all this, reviewing the implications of the banks' departure from the market and whether the levy should now be increased for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as a result, including consideration of the deferred tax assets these banks hold.  I would like to hear the Minister explain a little more convincingly why he has made the decision.  It seems to me somebody is benefiting from an action that will cause a lot of hardship, difficulty, stress and anxiety for 1 million bank customers, who are the same people who helped bail out many of these banks, with the exception of Ulster Bank.  They bailed the banking system out and are not getting much thanks for it.  </p></speech>

I am not sure I understand this, but I think I do.  A &euro;150 million bank levy was paid by five banks last year that between them controlled 100%, or at least the vast lion's share, of the Irish banking industry.  This year, &euro;87 million will be paid by three banks that between them control 100%, or the vast lion's share, of the Irish banking industry.  If I am wrong, correct me, but it seems to me that is broadly correct.  In other words, the banks that control the entire banking industry paid &euro;150 million last year and will pay &euro;87 million this year.  I am not an expert on banking or mathematics, as Lieutenant Columbo might say, but that is, in effect, a gift of &euro;63 million to the Irish banking sector.</p> <p>  That is bad enough as a stand-alone fact, but it is worse when coupled with the kind of examples given by Deputy Doherty at the start of this discussion of householders in Donegal, whose houses are crumbling around them, being told they cannot get 100% redress for something that is no fault of theirs.  A factor in that situation is the various vested interests that are not being made to pay, one of which is the banking sector.  There is something wrong about that whole equation.  There should be an increase of &euro;63 million in the levy paid by the remaining banks that control the Irish banking market.  Maybe that needs to be teased out a little and a report would be useful in that regard. </p></speech>

We will get it over and done with because the Minister will not move on these amendments.  Whatever way it is presented, at the end of the day, the banking sector and the same number of deposits and loans will remain in the State, but the levy that is charged will be reduced.  It is only being extended for another year but it should be extended for a lot longer than that.  We have discussed this earlier and have dealt with this section.</p> <p>  My question is on the mica redress scheme.  Does the Minister envisage an additional levy on, or contribution from, the banking sector above and beyond what he is now legislating for?  Or is he saying, sin &eacute;, that is it and this is the contribution?  It appears he is not serious about a contribution from the financial sector because he has not done anything about it.  He has not lifted the phone, written to or met representatives from the sector regarding discussion of this issue.  I have raised it more times with the CEOs of the banks than the Minister has, which would not be hard because he has raised it zero times.  Is this it or is the Minister saying he will consider an additional contribution to the overall sum of the mica redress scheme for those affected homeowners?</p></speech>

It is not a reduction in forecast revenue.  We were not expecting to collect it because the tax was due to come to an end this year before I made the decision to extend it.  I am doing this to minimise the considerable disruption that I believe will happen, from a consumer perspective, throughout 2022.  It was my view that if I overlaid the large amount of change that will happen in Irish banking throughout next year with the extension of this levy, it could create further challenges that could be disadvantageous to customers.  That is why I have made the decision.</p></speech>

It is up to the Acting Chairman then as to whether he wants to accept the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  On charging and funding options above and beyond what we are discussing in the Finance Bill, I am considering different ways of delivering the money we will need to meet the needs of those who have been afflicted by the awful experience of mica.  I cannot at this point confirm what they are.</p></speech>

When we tabled this amendment, we thought we had either got this issue wrong and missed something or we had actually stumbled upon something.  The more I hear the lack of a real rationale other than there will be disruption in the sector, which there will be for 1 million people, as the Minister rightly said, the more I think it is the latter.  How, precisely, does not extending the levy to the two institutions that are the cause of that disruption and anxiety benefit the 1 million people who will be seriously disrupted by their action?</p> <p>  If it is a goodbye reward for the two banks that have just deserted those 1 million people, it is bizarre in the extreme.  I do not see how it lessens the difficulty, hardship and anxiety one iota.  One would have to assume that it is not that, and this is where I would like clarification, but a kind of boon to the three remaining banks.  It is saying that given all of this, and the fact they will be getting all these extra customers, we are not going to charge the levy to the same extent we might in the situation where we made the decision to extend it.  Otherwise, I just do not see how this lessens or, to use the Minister's phrase, "add to", the difficulty, hardship and so on he is anticipating as a result of these changes.</p><p>If it were decided to distribute the &euro;63 million evenly among the 1 million people who had just been disrupted, I could understand the rationale, but that is not what is happening from what I can see.  Frankly, I would keep the bank levy going for decades.  I take the Minister's point that he had not projected the money so it is not a loss of money to the Exchequer.  He decided to extend it by a year.  By only levying it on the three remaining banks, less money comes in.  However, when there is the same amount of business and it is calculated based on the DIRT payment requirements, which are related to the amount of business, I do not understand why it is less.  Does it not mean that the amount of levy being paid as a proportion of the number of accounts is now less?</p><p> I do not get why is he doing that.  Who is benefiting from this?  However the Minister might explain it, I do not see how the customers are benefiting.  I do not see how not imposing this levy on the institutions is benefiting the customers.  Arguably by getting in additional revenue, which he would if he still collected the &euro;150 million, that would be extra money to the public which he could possibly use to alleviate difficulties, hardship and distress.  He has some way to go to convince us that it is beneficial to anybody.  </p></speech>

Mention has been made of the disruption to the banking sector in the State next year.  However, the beneficiaries of that disruption will be the three remaining banks.  They will gobble up the customer base of the two that are heading out the door.  The Minister claims he is not increasing the levy on banks because they will suffer disruption, but they will be beneficiaries of the disruption.  That does not add up for me.  It could be flipped the other way around.  The two banks that are exiting keep a footprint here when we owe them nothing.  It is a scandal that they are on the way out the door.  We appear to be saying we do not think it is fair to have the levy on them despite the fact that they have betrayed the people of the country, have betrayed the country and have a footprint here next year.  Whatever way we flip the coin, it does not add up.  As I have said, it is a head-scratcher.</p> <p>  Who benefits and who loses?  The two that are leaving benefit because they are out the gap.  The three that remain benefit because they increase their customer base.  The people who do not benefit are the customers.  Despite this, the customers lose out because as taxpayers, they are down.  I accept that the Minister did not budget it for next year, but year on year, the taxpayers are down &euro;63 million and the banks, as usual, do very well.  I would like to hear a bit more about this.  </p></speech>

Given the very different views the Deputies and I have on the economy and our banking system, if I were successful in convincing them that I was doing the right thing with a significant policy decision, I would need to assess the policy and decide whether the decision was right.  The starting points the two Deputies across the table have and mine on the banking sector and our economy are radically different.  If either of them were to enthusiastically endorse any decision I made regarding our banks, it would probably give me food for thought as to what I was doing.</p></speech>

I do not recall ever hearing him utter a word recognising the role of these banks as employers, investors or lenders.  Now that they are out the door, to use his language, he describes it as scandalous and a betrayal.  If he feels like that now, why did he not utter some recognition of the role they played when they were here-----</p></speech>

I thought we had put that behind us.  I thought that debate had been won.</p> <p>  Both Deputies asked me about the decision on the banking levy and Ulster Bank and KBC.  I wish to emphasise my thinking behind it.  The levy is calculated and comes due to be paid in October of next year.  At that point we will have two banks that are getting ready to go.  That will create further incentives for them to look at how they might reduce the number of current accounts they have.  I am eager to avoid that happening.  I want to see an orderly transfer of a very large number of current accounts to the remaining banks that we have.  I believe if we had left the bank levy in place as it is now, it would have created incentives to accelerate an exit from the Irish market, which would have had consequences that I want to avoid.  </p> <p>  The only upheaval I am now interested in is not the upheaval of the banks, because they have decided to go; but is the upheaval that will be involved in more than 1 million people seeing their bank accounts change.  While I am concerned about Deputy Boyd Barrett and the choices he will need to make, I am sure many banks are enthusiastic and wondering how they will get his business.  I am a bit more concerned about the 1.2 million other accounts that will be changing and the fact that if that is not advanced by the time we get to the point where this levy is calculated, it creates further incentives to minimise the levy and exit the market.  </p></speech>

The first concerns the application of a 17% duty surcharge on bulk purchases of all residential property by institutional investment funds, including the bulk purchase of apartments.  The second amendment concerns the application of stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property by non-residents.  The third amendment concerns the increase in the rate of stamp duty in the commercial property sector.</p><p>With regard to the first amendment, and consistent with earlier discussions, we in Sinn F&eacute;in are of the view and have argued for some time that a stamp duty surcharge should apply to the purchase of all residential property of investment funds without exception.  This amendment will also allow for an assessment of the success or, indeed, failure of the stamp duty measures the Minister introduced in May, with a rate which is too low.</p><p>The second amendment calls for an examination of a stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property by non-residents.  This was examined in the tax strategy group papers.  In the North, a 2% surcharge on acquisitions by non-residents came into effect on 1 April 2021.  The stated objective of this surcharge is to help control house price inflation and support residents to get onto and move up the housing ladder.  We propose such a measure be examined in the pursuit of a similar objective here on this part of the island.</p><p>The third amendment is to examine the increase in the rate of stamp duty in the commercial property sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed an increase to 12.5% in the context of budget 2022.  This would have an advantage of dampening activity in the market and directing labour resources towards the residential housing sector, where it is most needed.  Furthermore, it could review the impact of Covid-19 and the move to remote working on this tax head.  As noted in its tax strategy group paper, the Department believes the rebound in commercial property activity and occupancy this year may be more of a reflection of how low demand was during the height of the pandemic and long term, it anticipates lower office demand than pre-Covid levels, due to the implementation of a more permanent remote hybrid working policy.</p><p>These three amendments all concern property and stamp duty.  The second one is a mirror of what is happening on another part of our island.  The application of the 17% on investment funds would apply to all homes, including apartments, and the amendment is about rediverting resources away from commercial property and into house building.</p></speech>

The 10% being charged on some residential property, where it is over nine properties, is completely inadequate to deal with the phenomena of the big property investment vehicles coming in here and bulk buying property.  No measure has been taken by the Government to prevent them bulk buying apartments.  If the levy is imposed on some parts of the housing sector in terms of homes of ten or more, rather than apartment homes, is the Government concerned these vehicles will simply start to set up entities that will do nine?</p> <p>  I have certainly seen vulture funds behave in that way in my constituency in trying to get around other regulations, including thresholds such as the Tyrrelstown amendment and they have succeeded.  If they cannot evict ten tenants, they will evict seven, even though their intention to evict all tenants is clear.  However, they do it over a period of time.  I do not see why it is not possible for them to do the same, but that is an aside.</p> <p>  These entities are pretty ruthless and profit driven and the last people in whom they have an interest are those who need affordable housing.  That is not their interest, at all.  They are just here to make money.  Indeed, the advertisements on many of their websites to the people who might invest in these entities say they will maximise the value of people's investment.  That is how they promote themselves as businesses.  They do not say they are trying to do good for housing around the world.  They say to people who are thinking of investing that they will maximise the value of their investment.</p> <p>  That is the business they are in and they are not the sort of people on whom we should be relying to resolve a housing crisis, which is about human beings accessing a basic human need.  I would exclude them completely from the market.  Some 17% certainly goes much further than the Minister is proposing.  In some ways, I would be inclined to put it at 90%.  I just do not see the value of these people.  They should be driven out of the market.</p> <p>  The direction of amendment No. 110 is correct.  I highlighted some time ago on Leaders' Questions the issue of hotels being built, while we have a desperate need of housing and a shortage of construction labour.  This amendment tries to get at the same issue.  The Taoiseach replied that we needed hotels and told me not to counterpose the two.  However, there is a shortage of construction labour in this country.  If loads of construction workers are building hotels, they are not building houses.</p> <p>  If there is a priority at present, it is to build houses for people to live in, rather than more hotels, which are littering and in some cases destroying this city, because so many of them are being built.  They are destroying the city's heritage, as well as directing labour resources which are in short supply and are needed to build homes for people.  The objective of these amendments by Deputy Doherty is absolutely right.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister really believes the Government's current policies will deter the sort of objectionable activities being conducted by these profit-driven investment vehicles and the damage they are doing.</p><p>Does the Minister have measures that prioritise the construction of homes as against less essential construction of the hotel kind?  Indeed, is he interested in such measures?  I know less about the commercial office sector and whether there is an oversupply.  It gets my goat when I see the Seamark Building while travelling on the Merrion Road.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever passed it.  One of the NAMA developers, Bernard McNamara, built the big blocks beside St. Vincent's University Hospital.  They are huge impressive looking buildings.  There are about seven or eight of them.  At least one, which has been advertised for office space, has been sitting empty for ten years.  Do we need those kinds of developments or do we need homes?  In some areas, there is clearly an oversupply of office space, such that it cannot be rented.  I support the thrust of these amendments and am interested in hearing the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.928" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#BBB00200"><p>Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 are grouped together and I will speak to each of them in turn.</p> <p>  Turning first to amendment No. 109, as the Deputy is aware, earlier this year I introduced a special 10% rate of stamp duty to apply to the purchase of ten of more houses in any 12-month period by any person or corporate entity.  This rate came into effect from 20 May 2021.  The new rate does not apply to the bulk purchase of apartments and is subject to a number of other exemptions for social housing purposes.</p> <p>  This measure was complemented by guidelines introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that own-door houses and duplex units in housing developments are not bulk-purchased by commercial institutional investors in a manner that causes the displacement of individual purchasers and-or social and affordable housing, including cost-rental housing.</p> <p>  It is too early to evaluate how effective the stamp duty has been as a deterrent to institutional investors.  However, on the planning front, there have been a number of instances where An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for the developments of new housing estates in Dublin and Galway, subject to conditions that houses and duplexes can only be occupied by individual purchasers and cannot be first owned by a corporate entity.  This is a significant development in response to the problem of housing estates being bought in bulk by investors.</p> <p>  As was acknowledged, I excluded apartments from the 10% stamp duty charge.  The reason for this was that a key objective of this tax was to achieve a balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, while at the same time ensuring that the supply of financing is not undermined, particularly in the construction of new apartment developments.  The rationale for this exemption was twofold.  In order for apartment complexes to be built, it is necessary in virtually all cases for an institutional investor to commit, through a binding contract, to purchase all or part of an apartment complex on completion.  This is a forward-purchase model and is usually entered into once planning permission has been obtained.  The benefit of this approach is that it allows a developer to obtain the necessary funds through bank lending to finance the project.  This financing could be unobtainable or more expensive in the absence of such a contract and there is, therefore, a risk that these apartments would not be built.</p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has indicated that institutional investors are only likely to commit to such arrangements if they can be certain that, at a later stage, they will be able to sell these apartments.  They are concerned that a 10% stamp duty levy would inhibit such a sale and, in turn, discourage such investors from participating in the financing of apartment complexes in this country.  Therefore, this is an important distinction as in its absence there is a significant risk that developers might not participate in and might exit the apartment building market because such projects might no longer be viable, and an important element of our future housing strategy would be undermined.</p> <p>  The Government has done a lot to discourage the bulk purchase of houses this year through the tax and planning systems.  It will be necessary to afford these measures time in order to evaluate their effectiveness.  That is why I do not agree to the amendment that seeks to introduce a 17% stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of all residential property by corporate structures, including real estate investment trusts, REITs, and Irish regulated funds, IREFs.</p> <p>  Moving to amendment No. 110 and the issue of purchases of residential property here by non-residents.  Deputy Doherty raised this issue with me last year during the passage of Finance Act 2020 through the House in the context of the UK having announced its intention to apply a similar surcharge from 1 April.  The matter was considered by the TSG this year in its stamp duty paper.  It included an examination of the potential benefits and drawbacks of introducing such a surcharge here.  It found that it was not possible for Revenue to provide an estimate of the revenue that such a measure would generate, due to the fact that there is not a difference of treatment of non&ndash;resident taxpayers compared with resident taxpayers for stamp duty purposes when they purchase residential property.  The report noted that additional, albeit unquantifiable, revenue could be generated from such a measure.  It indicated that such revenue would probably be of small amount.  It also suggested that such a disincentive to residential properties being bought as holiday homes by people not resident in Ireland could play a role in releasing housing supply for Irish purchasers, although those purchasers may themselves be acquiring a holiday home or investment property.</p> <p>  The TSG paper acknowledged some potential drawbacks, specifically a possible conflict with free movement regulations if a surcharge were applied to EU residents; a possibly negligible revenue gain if numbers of such acquisitions are low, particularly in light of the potential increased regulatory burden on Revenue and others involved; and the possibility of it acting as a disincentive for workers with valuable skills seeking to relocate to Ireland, while still maintaining tax residency in another country.  The UK introduced the 2% stamp duty tax surcharge on 1 April, and I will certainly follow the effect of this.  At present, I do not have any relevant data to allow me to form a view in that regard.</p> <p>  Given that the matter has just been considered by the TSG, a report is merited, which is why I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 111, there are a number of distinct components to the report being sought and I will speak to each of them.  First, we all acknowledge that remote working has become a feature of this pandemic and is likely to remain, in some form at least, a part of working life into the future.  However, at present, we are still in the midst of the pandemic and it is too early to get a clear perspective on how remote working patterns will impact on the commercial property sector over the longer term.  More time is needed for this to become clear.  However, I acknowledge that stamp duty receipts over the coming years are likely to give insight into how changing work patterns are affecting the sector.  In this regard, the committee should note that such receipts fell from &euro;537.64 million in 2019 to &euro;407.6 million in 2020 &ndash; a fall of 24.2% in spite of an increase in the rate from 6% to 7.5%.</p> <p>  Second, regarding the impact of activity in commercial property on labour supply, this matter has been raised in the past and I have acknowledged the merit in this as a rationale for changing the rate.  While undoubtedly there are some construction roles and skill sets that can transfer smoothly between both residential and commercial property construction, many specialist roles exist for the various construction property types such as house, industrial and office.  Even if the non-residential sector experiences a prolonged post-pandemic slowdown, putting aside the highly mobile nature of the workers involved, to get such workers to switch to the residential sector will likely require some retraining over time.</p><p>Therefore it is at least possible that a reduction in labour demand in the non-residential property sector may not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in the availability of workers for the residential sector, at least in the short term.</p><p> Third, the impact of increasing commercial stamp duty has been examined a number of times in recent years and has resulted in commercial stamp duty increasing from 2% to 7.5% between budget 2018 and budget 2020.  In the current economic environment, there will be no guarantee that increasing non-residential rates will generate additional revenue.</p><p> However, this area will be looked at as part of next year&rsquo;s tax strategy group, TSG.  I will have a better sense of the direction of travel of such stamp duty receipts at that time and will be in a better position to form a view on this matter.  Given we are going to look at that issue through the TSG, I do not, therefore, propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.930" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#CCC00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his comments.  I note the TSG will look at this stamp duty issue in the commercial property sector.  We talk about the role of taxes in respect of revenue raising or behaviour changing, and this measure is very much to try to divert activity away from one sector.  I am not a person who believes there should be no commercial property.  Of course we need commercial property and that type of development, but at this time we need our workforce to be directed as much as possible towards housebuilding in dealing with the existing crisis.  If there was ever an opportune time to try to divert people, it would be now.  I strongly urge us to look at that.  The success in this measure would be a reduction in taxation and a flow of investment and workers into that other channel.</p> <p>  On the stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property, I understand there may be no data and that Revenue has identified there may be some benefits to it and so on.  I think the Minister may be going to some extreme lengths to suggest why it could not happen in that there would be more properties for people to buy in this State but they could be bought as holiday homes.  That was a good stretch by whoever was writing the Minister&rsquo;s notes.</p> <p>  We focus again on this issue.  We have many cash sales, non-resident sales and institutions buying up property in bulk, and all that restricts the amount of property that is available for first-time purchasers or those who are scaling up or down.  That is seriously problematic so we have to look, therefore, at measures we might not look at in other times.  We had a discussion earlier today on house price inflation, and this is one of the issues we are trying to deal with.</p> <p>  My county has seen increases in rental income of about 19%.  Roscommon was 20%, and we know in terms of rents that house prices are coming very close to the peak of the pre-crisis era.  That is no surprise.  We were told at the time that house prices would go back to those levels and it was very clear it would happen when it was decided to turn off the tap.  It was the Government before Fine Gael were in government, when Fianna F&aacute;il adopted that policy of long-term leasing.</p> <p>  This is, however, about trying to ensure we support home ownership.  We hear the Taoiseach always saying in the D&aacute;il that Sinn F&eacute;in does not support home ownership.  We do but we do not want the investment funds to own the homes.  We do not want the non-residents to be snapping them up.  We want ordinary people who want to live here and to be part of building their communities to have home ownership at an affordable price and that we are not weighing them down with very significant levels of debt which will have, in the main, to be mortgage-financed.</p> <p>  On the first amendment, which relates to investment funds bulk-buying properties, I know the Minister will dispute this, but it was quite embarrassing for him to have sat here for the past number of years, voting consistently against amendments we brought forward to deal with this issue, only then, thankfully, because of the role played by the media and the public anger at what was happening in Maynooth, for him to be forced into a complete tailspin where he and his officials had to cancel everything and draft emergency legislation within a fortnight that introduced a levy on these funds, but only in the case of the bulk-buying of homes.  I argue the rate is too low and can be absorbed.</p> <p>  The biggest problem here is this, and the Minister knows or should know this better than I do.  I am from Gweedore in west Donegal but a large number of completions in Dublin are apartments.  That is what is happening in this city.  In Donegal where I come from, I do not have the figures with me but I would say that over 99% of homes there are houses, not apartments.  In Dublin a large number of completions are apartments.  Some 47% of all new homes built in Dublin from January to September 2020 were apartments.  In the city of Dublin, 85% of homes were apartments.  The Minister has handed these over to the vulture funds, the investment funds, which are not financing the construction of them but are entering into, as the Minister acknowledged in his script, purchasing arrangements.  No money passes from the funds to the developer until they are completed and these funds then purchase them from the developer, off the market, and they are not available to anybody in this city or elsewhere to be purchased.</p> <p>  I will make the point again where 85% of homes in the city of Dublin are apartments and are being bought by the funds, not by people from Coolock, Drumcondra or Finglas.  That is not just the end of the madness.  As a result of the tax structure that applies to these funds, these apartments are bought at high costs and push prices up.  These funds can do that because they are bought to rent.  They are rented out then at high prices and rent rolls but not paying any tax on the rental income.  That is a privilege that is not available to any other company or individual in this State bar Irish real estate funds, IREFs and real estate investment trusts, REITs.</p> <p>  When they sell these assets in years to come they will pay no capital gains tax on the uplift.  On an asset that may have increased in value by &euro;100 million, they will not pay the 33% capital gains tax on that that any individual or any other company structure would have to pay.  It is for those reasons, because there is no taxation within the fund and only dividend withholding tax at a maximum of 20% on disbursement of dividends, that they are able to outbid, push and jack up the prices for these apartments and put prices up across the board.  That is what is happening.</p> <p>  I am sick and tired of saying this every single time at this committee.  I say to the Minister, surely to God if it is simply not working year after year and he is sitting in the driving seat, maybe it is time to look in the mirror to see if there is another path we can go down.  If he continues on this road, it is not good.  It is not good for the footprint of Dublin or that he is surrendering Dublin to these funds.  It is not good for home ownership or for prices of property across the board.</p> <p>  It is not just I who is saying this and I am sure the Minister will try to dismiss what I am saying.  The Department of Finance the Minister leads published a paper in 2019 entitled Institutional Investment in the Housing Market.</p><p>The paper noted:</p><blockquote>	There is a risk that, should ... [buy-to-rent] investment continue at current growth rates, market forces would over the long-term create socio-economic polarisation in some urban areas.  Under such a scenario average income earners would be priced-out of purchasing or renting from the private market ... </blockquote><p>It also stated: &quot;... there is a risk that at sufficient scale an institutional investor or group of investors could, over time, develop monopolistic ... pricing power&quot;.  That is happening under the Minister's nose.  Not only that, but the Minister is facilitating it.  This is eyes-wide-open stuff.  Crazy stuff is happening.  These are things which cannot be reversed easily overnight because they are going to have a long-term impact on property prices, the shape of Dublin and how people live and are able to go about their lives.  It is also wider than just apartments.  This amendment is about calling that out.  It is about ending that practice.  It is about saying, &quot;No, we need to stop this&quot;.  That is what it is about.<br/><br/>As I said, I know the Minister is not going to budge on this.  He has no current plans to do the investor roadshow but his Department is planning the investor roadshow and I am sure he has not told it to stop.  That is the reality of it.  What has happened is heartbreaking.  This is not a natural disaster.  It is not a  pandemic.  It is not what we are facing with Covid-19.  It is not climate change and the challenges that will bring.  This is a direct consequence of policies he and his predecessor have implemented and which people at this and previous finance committees continue to cheerlead and vote through.</p></speech>

These policies and the decisions which are taken here in the bowels of Leinster House have real and long-term consequences for people.  Over a series of years I have sat in this committee and policy after policy has resulted in this.  It has pushed house prices beyond the reach of ordinary people.  It has led to a situation where houses are not available for ordinary people.  It has led us to a point where we have the highest rents in all of Europe in this city of Dublin.  That is the reality.  The people who have the luxury or the benefit of being able to get a house are then saddled, because of the prices, with having to take out a mortgage, which doubles the amount one must pay back in the long term, at the highest rates.  This is where it happens.  When we are talking to our constituents next year and prices continue to go up, this is where it happened.  This is where the decision is made and this is who made the decision.  That is the problem.  I will leave it at that.  I will be pressing these amendments.</p></speech>

Sometimes we repeat phrases so much that they begin to lose their value and we forget what we are talking about when we talk about these vulture funds.  If anybody wants to remind themselves, they should go on the websites of the funds.  Those are the best places to find out what they are about.  They tell you, in very stark, frankly ruthless, terms, what they are about and none of what they are about is the provision of housing to people who need it.  There is none of that.  I am looking at Lone Star at the moment.  I was looking at Kennedy Wilson before that.  I have looked at Hines and at Apollo Asset Management.  You can go through the whole list of these funds and you will not find a single word on their websites about trying to help people into homes.  Not a word.  Lone Star, for example, says it specifically seeks to capitalize on market conditions &quot;... in markets that have suffered an economic and/or banking crisis, resulting in a dislocation in asset pricing and value opportunities&quot;.  That is the literal definition of a vulture.  We move in on a situation in distress where assets are undervalued and we gobble them up.  Then we unlock value.  That is another expression.  We do value creation.  None of that is about trying to build new houses for people who need them.  It is absolutely about literally circling the world looking for undervalued assets in economies in distress and trying to maximise the value.  Alternatively, the funds look to where there are specific shortages which mean that they can maximise the value.  It is not about addressing the supply; it is about maximising the value they can get from having an asset in a market where there is a shortage.</p><p>I would argue that these entities have no interest in increasing supply, or at least not in doing so to the point where rents or prices would actually fall.  Why would they ever do that?  They want to ensure that the value going back to their investors stays up and that they get the maximum possible return.  Thus, it is not in their interests that the problem the Minister says the Government wants to solve, namely, the housing crisis, be solved.  It cannot possibly be solved by people who have no interest in solving it but who actually benefit from rents and house prices being obscenely high.  In other words, the value of their assets is obscenely high because that is how the funds look at them.  That is the language that litters their websites.  It is the language with which those involved try to entice people to invest in their vulture funds.  They say come to us because we can make you a lot of money by circling and looking for opportunities to do so.  That is their agenda, their objective and what they succeed in doing.  The consequences of that are unpayable rents, unaffordable house prices and the domination of the housing sector by people who have no interest in resolving the problem we as a society believe it is important to solve.</p><p>I do not know whether this is just ideological or whether it is just a mistake the Government has made, but it has got it wrong on this one.  Anything we can do, here or anywhere else, to try to make the Government and the Minister reconsider is worth doing because this is a dire mistake.  If you want to solve a problem about the basic human need to have an affordable, secure roof over your head, you do not go to entities which, quite literally and unashamedly, are operating as vultures and the objective and <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of which is to be profit-hungry vultures.</p></speech>

Just across from the estate I live in a build-to-rent apartment block is going up.  We had street meetings organised by residents to discuss the proposals for what is going to be put in place.  I must tell the Minister people in my estate were devastated when they heard it was more than likely going be build-to-rent.  I come from an estate that was built in the 1950s and that is home to a very strong and proud community.  The residents knew that their children and grandchildren would obviously not be able to buy apartments there and that they would more than likely not be able to afford to rent them either.  They were left with two choices.  We have had the discussion about affordability.  We had a good, long discussion yesterday about the whole issue of the affordability crisis.  The reality for the people in my area is they do not really have the choice of staying in the community their parents or grandparents live in and helped build because of that affordability crisis.</p> <p>   Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett: We discussed this earlier but it is such and important subject we must put as much pressure as possibly can on the Minister and the Government to rethink their attitude towards these investment vehicles.

That is the literal definition of a vulture.  We move in on a situation in distress where assets are undervalued and we gobble them up.  Then we unlock value.  That is another expression.  We do value creation.  None of that is about trying to build new houses for people who need them.  It is absolutely about literally circling the world looking for undervalued assets in economies in distress and trying to maximise the value.  Alternatively the funds look to where there are specific shortages which mean they can maximise the value.  It is not to address the supply but to maximise the value they can get from having an asset in a market where there is a shortage.  I would argue these entities have no interest in increasing supply or at least not doing so to the point where rents or prices would actually fall.  Why would they ever do that?  They want to ensure the value going back to the investors in those funds stays up and that they get the maximum possible return.  Thus it is not in their interests that the problem the Minister says the Government wants to solve, namely, the housing crisis can possibly be solved by people who have no interest in solving it but actually benefit from rents and house prices being obscenely high.  In other words, the value of their is obscenely high, because that is how the funds look at them.  That is the language that litters their websites.  It is the language with which they try to entice people to invest in their vulture funds.  They say come to us because we can make you a lot of money by circling and looking for opportunities to do so.  That is their agenda, their objective and what they succeed in doing.  The consequences of that are unpayable rents, unaffordable house prices</p><p>They either have the option of moving extremely far from where they are originally from or, of course, they have to move into the box room in their parents' house, which is, sadly, the reality for many people, as I described to the Minister yesterday when speaking about a constituent who had come in to meet me.  We have gone through a huge number of amendments over yesterday and today and, more than likely, we will go through more tomorrow.  Sometimes it is important when we discuss these things that we sit back and think about the impact they have on communities because sometimes we can be that little bit removed from that.  As I have seen this in my community, I thought it would be important to mention.</p></speech>

Some of us are coming late to the table on this argument.  Some of us were here before, a long time ago, and raised again and again the question of the danger of growing the rental property sector in Dublin and the surrounding towns and cities.  Nobody raised a finger.  Nobody was willing to stand up and be counted then, despite the fact that I tabled countless parliamentary questions drawing attention to that growth, which occurred for no reason at all other than for certain parties to get a hold of the market.  That was long before the crises started.  It was the wrong development at the wrong time, and people stood by and looked at it and never said a word about it.  It went on from there because the argument in favour of this growth at that time was that it was much cheaper to rent a house.  What a load of crazy nonsense.  The point I made at the time was that it would soon become more expensive to rent a house than to buy it, and that is what happened.  No disrespect at all to our friends in the Opposition, but, despite all these arguments, nobody said anything about this at the time.  A couple of us were on our own pointing out what would happen, that is, that the market would be concentrated in a particular area, which would lead to a housing shortage for people who wanted to buy their own homes or to get local authority houses from the local authority.  Every kind of turn was put upon it at the time.  Now this has become obvious to everybody.  Everybody is pointing out what went wrong.  Some of us pointed out all these things before they happened.  That is one thing about politics.  We need to learn to identify the dangers before they occur.  We are not good at that and we are not improving either.  We need to concentrate on that and do it because, if we do not, we will have calamity after calamity and we will not be able to comment until after, when we will say, "My God, how did this happen?  Somebody is to blame for this."  "Ourselves" is the answer to that question.  I was a strong opponent of this policy at the time.  My arguments were proven correct.  I do not at all expect anybody to jump up and down and say, "You were very wise to say those things at the time."  It was, however, unpopular to say them and to speak in that fashion.  I am now repeating what I have said before, as did a number of other people.  The core of the argument at the time was that people had a natural inclination to own their own homes, and means should have been found at all times to accommodate them.  It does not matter where they come from or what their background is; they are entitled to aspire to that, and we need to help them all the time.</p> <p>  Whatever happens from here on in, let us do the best we can.  The die was cast a long time ago but we have to deal with this now.  I know things will come around.  Wheels turn and come back to where they started, usually, and that will happen again.  How soon it will happen I do not know, but I do know one thing: young people - this affects everybody but young people more than anybody else - who are anxious to own their own homes or willing to accept local authority houses or affordable houses they can purchase, or whatever way it comes, want to do that all the time.  That is part and parcel of their upbringing.  They have always wanted to do that.  It is part of their independence.  It is also part of the taxation system because, obviously, the fewer affordable houses available to people and the higher the rent goes, the more they have to be paid.  It is an economic issue as well, not only for the potential homeowners but for the whole State.  It is therefore in everybody's interest to deal with the issues before they occur, preferably, but still we have to deal with them now and we will.</p> <p>  Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.943" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111700002#EEE00300"><p>I will deal with each of the questions in turn.</p> <p>  To begin in the order in which Deputy Doherty addressed the issues he raised, I refer to the issue of commercial stamp duty, the latitude for it to be increased further and the role it might play in not only raising revenue but also, more importantly, shifting capital into the delivery of more homes.  That is one of the reasons I have over recent years increased stamp duty on commercial property.  Further evaluation and examination are required as to whether that policy could be used further in the future.  I will say a couple of things about this.  The rate has gone from 2% to 7.5%, a very large increase, over a few budgets.  It has more than tripled at a time when we can see uncertainty surrounding the demand for commercial property in the future.  How structural that uncertainty will be and how long it will last I do not know at this point, but the reason I decided not to introduce a further change to stamp duty on commercial property in this budget was that I felt there is enough change going on in that sector at the moment and I did not believe a further change would yield significant additional revenue.  The fact that we had seen tax receipts in that tax head decline points to the fact that it is a tax rate that may have a bit less utility at the moment than it has had in the past.  As I said, however, this will be looked at through the tax strategy group, TSG, next year.</p> <p>  I outlined a number of different reasons I believe there could be a difficulty with an additional surcharge for non-resident purchasers in Ireland.  One reason was that I raised the point as to what could be the use of the home that might be bought for an Irish purchaser.  It is not the strongest argument there is.  I think there are other reasons that might point to the drawbacks of that measure.  Again, that can be reviewed through the TSG and I will be able to consider it in future budgets.  We can evaluate the impact it will have in the UK, and I hope information from that becomes clear enough soon.</p> <p>  As for the broader discussion about the role of institutional investors, specifically REITs and IREFs, and to go back to arguments that have been made and will continue to be made again, it is in this committee and in the D&aacute;il that decisions are made that have very significant effects on our economy, on how homes are built, on the cost of those homes and on who is in a position to buy or rent them.  Again, however, it is vital to put this discussion about institutional investors into the context of the other things the Government is doing to respond to the housing needs that we know are there, are really significant and are growing for many.  I can put the human faces on those cases as well and on constituents I meet who are equally worried about whether they will be able to live in their local community or whether they will find themselves living in the spare room in a few years' time, worried that they might not be able to afford rent tomorrow or afford a home in the future.  I meet similar constituents, experience the same feedback and see the same concern that many people have about this.  That is why in our budget we have &euro;4.1 billion allocated to make progress on housing.</p><p> Contrary to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, we are not relying on institutional investors to solve our housing needs and the great housing difficulties we have at the moment.  They are one of elements that can make a difference to the delivery of more apartments in particular, but they are also why, across next year, we are aiming to build 9,000 social homes and 4,100 affordable and cost-rental units.  We want to see the private sector delivering 11,500 homes for private rental and private purchase.  In addition to whatever work these investors and entities are doing in building or enabling the supply of more apartments is a Government that is actively involved in building more homes directly or enabling their building through cost-rental and affordable models of delivery, which I hope will deliver even more homes next year, and acknowledges that we need the private sector to build more homes for people who want to own their homes in their entirety without a role for the State.  We also acknowledge that the private sector in particular has a role to play in the provision of apartments at scale, that is, to build lots of them.  Particularly within Dublin and some of our other cities, we need more apartments to be built across the coming years to respond to the demand for those apartments.</p><p> This brings us back to the role of institutional investors.  I contend that these funds play a role in apartments being built that would otherwise not be built.  The apartments that are the subject of such criticism would not exist at all if we did not have investors like these channelling savings from other parts of the world into the purchase or co-funding of homes that allows them to be built.  This is something that happens in many other countries and forms a part of how apartment development in cities takes place.  While these apartments are the subject of such criticism, what would be the subject of even more criticism would be if apartments were not being built at all.  In a city like Dublin and a number of our other larger cities, we need apartments being built in scale in a way that people will be able to afford.  I know that is tough at the moment, but without apartments being built in numbers, we will not be able to respond to the rental needs that so many people have.  Institutional investors play a role in the funding and delivery of apartments that, in their absence, would not be built.</p><p> I am looking at the alternatives that are being proposed here and the charge that is being made regarding our intentions.  The role of these funds is being played beside a State and a Government that, in the first six months of 2021, delivered 2,433 new build social homes and 3,600 social homes in total.  The Government has a further 8,750 social homes in the pipeline and another 9,000 at design or tender stage.  This is the overall record of what the Government is doing - building homes directly at scale for social and public use, as well as for affordable and cost-rental.  Our ambition is to deliver 4,100 of those next year.  At the same time, apartments are being built by these organisations that are the subject of such criticism.  In the absence of their role, the apartments that they are building would not be built.</p><p> Turning to the alternatives, I have looked at what Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing as well as its draft budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in says that it would build 20,000 social homes next year at a cost of &euro;3 billion.  That is an average cost per home of &euro;150,000.  The question that Sinn F&eacute;in will need to answer, just as I answer questions on our housing policy, is how on earth does it believe it can build a home for &euro;150,000.  In its alternative budget, it is putting less money into housing next year than the Government is yet it is promising to deliver more homes.  The only way it can make that work is at a cost per home that is a fraction of the cost of building homes.</p><p> Last night, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against a measure that was concerned with trying to increase the supply of rental accommodation.  It was the tax code measure, which I have extended, to allow unused rental properties to be renovated by landlords, with some of the costs being defrayed by the tax code.  Over the past two years, this measure has been responsible for 3,335 properties coming back onto the rental market.  Sinn F&eacute;in is planning to build homes at a cost of &euro;150,000, yet it votes against any measure we have that tries to increase the supply of rental accommodation.  It is a party that makes much of its claim that it understands the rental crisis, but it opposes any measure that leads to new rental homes being built and, in its own policies, advocates the building of homes at a fraction of the actual cost of building them.</p><p> Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, his view is that he does not want these entities in Ireland at all.  As always, he is at least clear in his policy.  However, who does he want to build all of the accommodation - houses and apartments - that we will need?  He appears to be against profit playing any role in the delivery of anything in our economy.  It is a fact that those involved in building homes want to make a profit on their return.  In many cases, that profit is reinvested in the delivery of more homes.</p></speech>

Maybe they will give him some ideas on how to change direction.  The Minister has been in the driving seat and this is only going one direction, which is that house prices and rents are going up and up while availability is going down and down.  That is the reality and no one else is to blame.  The Minister is right: this is where we make the decisions.  He has made the wrong ones time and again.  It was only when the public called him out and asked how under God he was allowing these funds to come in and snap up homes from ordinary families that were trying to get homes and start their lives that he was embarrassed into scrambling his officials.  Within a fortnight, he had to introduce emergency legislation that he had voted against six months prior.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister knows how the financing of homebuilding occurs.  He will understand that there is Exchequer expenditure and non-Exchequer expenditure.  That is why the figures he has misrepresented to the committee are wrong.  The &euro;3 billion he mentioned is Exchequer expenditure.  I encourage the Minister not to embarrass himself any further and to examine the policy and start implementing the delivery of 20,000 social, affordable and cost-rental homes.  But, no.  He has spent the past half hour defending the fact that he will continue to support institutional investors coming to Ireland and purchasing apartments in bulk.  Some 85% of completions in this city are apartments.  They are not available to ordinary buyers and do not even go on the market.</p><p>Of those apartments that do go on the market, they cost &euro;450,000 or &euro;500,000.  That is what the Minister is defending.  Deputy Durkan spoke about how he called this out, and fair play to him if he did, but one did not need be a genius to call out what was happening in the housing sector.  I mean the Deputy no offence.</p></speech>

I remember him giving a speech.  Someone drew my attention to it on YouTube a number of months ago.  Well over a decade ago, I spoke about how crazy it was of Government policy to stop building homes and to enter into long-term leasing arrangements, the nonsense of knocking down derelict or ghost estates, and how we would have a housing crisis, the prices of homes within ten years would revert to where they were prior to the crash and people would be evicted from their homes because landlords would sell up.  This was not crystal ball stuff and someone did not need to be a genius.  The then Government decided on a course of action just as the Minister before us is deciding on a course of action.  He has pursued a policy that can only result in house prices and rents increasing and the profits of the funds increasing.  That is what has happened.  It is not crystal ball stuff.  If one does A, one will get B.</p> <p>  As the Minister is flicking through our alternative budget, I will offer him a novel idea.  Let us ramp up investment in social, affordable and cost-rental homes.  Let the State step in with the appropriate response and build houses.  It has not built houses for years.  I have no doubt that the Minister's constituents are giving him the same messages mine are giving me.  The difference is that he very much is responsible for the hardships facing many families across the State.  I say this not as a personal attack on him but in terms of him being the person occupying the role of Minister for Finance who has continually pursued a policy that has been detrimental to ordinary families across the State.  That is the reality.  This is where it happens and the Minister is the guy who makes it happen.  He is also the person who, if he changes direction, allows us to start to change the narrative.  We would start making house prices affordable.  I look at the Minister's record, though, which is something from which he cannot shy away.  From a taxation point of view, his record on housing has been appalling.  How can he stand over it?  Prices have only gone in one direction.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke on RT&Eacute; a year and a half ago - I watched it recently - and said that there was good news, in that house prices had peaked and were starting to decrease, as were rents, and that it would be two years before people started to feel it.  That was a year and a half ago.  In that time, the same thing happened as happened in the years prior, that being, house prices and rents increased and ordinary people were pushed to the pin of their collar.  There is tea and sympathy for the funds but no help for ordinary people.</p></speech>

These are the figures in Sinn F&eacute;in's calculation.</p></speech>

This is not just a promise for the future.  Rather, it is the reality of what is happening now.  It is the reality of this Government, despite our construction sector being closed for so long due to a pandemic, now having 8,750 social and public homes on site.  That is our track record.  That is what we are doing.</p> <p>  Any debate on the role of funds in developing more apartments has to acknowledge that the Government is investing directly in more homes being built across the country by local authorities.</p> <p>  Regarding the great challenges in the rental sector, apart from Sinn F&eacute;in being a party that last night voted against a measure that, as we speak, has put 3,300 more properties into the rental sector than would otherwise be the case, with 3,300 renters and their families in accommodation, it is yet to outline how it would deliver a supply of rental accommodation.  That would not happen without the forward funding and forward purchase by funds that play a role in the delivery of apartments.</p> <p>  As to what we will do in the coming period to respond to renters' needs, the Government has committed to building 4,100 affordable and cost-rental homes next year.  Over the next 12 to 18 months, there will be more than 6,000 homes built.  That is what we will do.  The Deputy appears to have neglected the fact that, in the 18 months since the T&aacute;naiste made that comment, we have had a pandemic in which the construction sector has been closed and countries all over the world have seen house prices increase.  All over the world is a matter for other people, though.  What I am focused on is how we do a better job in Ireland.  We will do a better job through the &euro;4 billion of funding that I have included in the budget to build more homes directly, deliver affordable and cost-rental homes and enable the private sector to ramp up over time to building 20,000 homes per year.</p></speech>

For the record and just in case anybody does not understand, when an approved housing body delivers a home through, for example, the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, it utilises Exchequer funding with its own financing, for example, through the European Investment Bank, EIB, or the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  The Minister knows this, but he has used that argument because he cannot defend his own record.  Indeed, he has used the same language as his officials used against the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and Professor Kieran McQuinn in this regard.  It is beneath him because he knows very well how housing is financed.  It is how the Department itself provides financing.  It is Exchequer funding, yet all of it is dealt with as general government expenditure.</p><p>The Minister knows this well.</p></speech>

What I would say to that is the State cannot rely on funds, investment entities and property and real estate firms - whatever we want to call the vultures, as they are often described these days - to solve our problem, and we have a problem.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to say that the decisions of the period 2011, 2012 and 2013, which have been followed through pretty consistently, have not landed us in a massive crisis.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to suggest the decisions made when Michael Noonan was the Minister have not landed us in this situation.  Have we learned nothing from what the experience has been of those entities coming in here and landing us in this situation?</p> <p>  By the way, while we did have a housing crisis then, it was not a disaster.  Some of us did warn about this in those years 2011, 2012 and 2013.  When these things were in play, when the big decisions were being made, we said the decision of the State to stop the direct construction of social and affordable housing at that time was going to have disastrous consequences.</p></speech>

There was a policy choice or a decision made at that time which was to bring these entities in.  At least the Government is remaining consistent because it still thinks they should be here.  It is defending the decision to invite them in, it is defending the decision to keep them here, and it is suggesting they are going to contribute even now to resolving the housing crisis.  I put it to the Minister that every serious assessment of what has happened since these entities came in makes it clear they are contributing nothing.  It is worse than that.  They have made a bad situation worse because their intention was not to solve the crisis; their intention was to benefit from the crisis.  In the process, they have made it worse.</p> <p>  What is the alternative?

However, it is necessary to answer the questions the Minister put, so that there is no suggestion that there is a lack of internal logic in the arguments that socialists are putting forward on this point.  Our argument was and remains that the assets and the means by which one can produce the housing that is necessary, both financial and otherwise, were effectively in the possession of the State at that time.  These were in the banks, because we bailed them out, and in the land assets and property assets necessary to deliver the housing.  We made a decision in both cases to work towards handing those back to interests that were not primarily interested in solving the housing crisis but in maintaining their financial position or in benefiting from that.</p> <p>  I still think that argument remains the same.  The Minister asks who has the capital and says that the State does not have all the capital.  First, the State has fairly unlimited access to capital at the moment because of the interest rate situation.  There is also huge scope for redistributional taxes in our opinion, as the Minister knows, although I will not go over that argument.  Redistribution of taxes would help find the capital.  We mentioned the credit unions but let us not forget the banks as well.  Where are the savings?  One refers to the savings of other countries as being manifest in these vulture funds in coming over here and supposedly helping us with the housing sector.  We have our own savings here.  Where are they?  The are in credit unions and in the banks.  The people who hold those savings have a bit more interest in solving the housing crisis than the venture funds, vulture funds or whatever you want to call them in New York.  To me, that is self-evident.  </p> <p>  There was a time when these funds did not exist.  It was the case that 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when this country was much poorer, it was able to deliver social housing.  It was able to do so far more effectively than it has been proven to be able to do in the past few decades, when the country has been much wealthier.  That is our argument.  There are alternative sources for the capital investment.  These are the savings that exist in this country in our own banking system.  We could access these savings if were to take control of that banking system, which we bailed out, and use them for societal objectives and for social objectives.  To be honest, I do not think most people in this country would object to their savings being used for or directed towards solving problems like that.  </p> <p>  On the costing of houses, Deputy Doherty has defended Sinn F&eacute;in's own position.  However, the costings we put in our pre-budget submission were costed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  We used the prices for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom, based on estimates provided by the Department, as to how much it would cost to deliver those houses.  As for our proposal for more than 20,000 housing units, the pricing for them in our budget submission was based on estimates given to us by the Government.</p><p>I want to say that for the record.</p></speech>

I am happy to say that I am no longer bored because I am shocked.  I am shocked at the loss of memory, the collective amnesia among the Opposition.  Looking back ten years is one thing, but I cannot even rely on them to look back five years and to recall with any kind of accuracy what the situation was.</p> <p>  I am very fond of Deputy Boyd Barrett because he has some good ideas.  It is just that when he puts them into operation it is like flying a kite upside down.  It does not work that way, so you have to go the opposite route.  The thing that takes me to the fair most of all is the point that the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, the subsequent Government and the present Government should have done more, but I ask the question, with what?  Does nobody recall that there was no money in the banks and no money to be got out of the banks?  There was no credit.  We had no credit rating.  Mr. Modi was in Government Buildings working out a way to salvage the country, if it could be salvaged.  The problem is that nobody seems to remember that now.</p> <p>  I worry about the philosophy behind the thinking when we come to that.  You cannot go into a bank and say you are from People Before Profit and that you should get money because you want to spend it.  Any cause is a good cause, but they are never going to pay it back, because there is no substance to the argument.  I am sorry to have to say that, but it is a fact.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that himself because he is a reasonable and shrewd guy.  I give him full credit for that.  It takes a little bit of doing to be able to say that with a straight face.</p> <p>  I want to remind people that some of us were talking about the crash long before it came.  The crash is what left us where we are.  We got one hell of a belt and we had to drag ourselves up by the bootlaces and struggle on.  Then Covid came on top of that again, just to remind us that we were not going to be left alone for too long.  When I think back, I used to wake up every morning and wonder if the people in Government Buildings were going to come to any kind of a conclusion that would be to our advantage.  We waited, and every time we switched on the television, there were one or two of these guys walking across the street with large, bulging bags, and it was not money that was in them, it was documents.  We had failed to run our economy because we did not do what should have been done at the time.  We did not manage it.  I remember the Minister for Finance saying at the time to somebody across the House that the economy was like a bank, you had to manage it.  It was ironic.  They needed the banks to be managed, not the economy.</p> <p>  I am not blaming the politicians.  I have pointed this out on several occasions.  A number of us put down questions to find out what the hell was going wrong.  I got one answer to a question in about four years that clearly indicated to me that the fat was in the fire and we were in deep trouble.  What I cannot understand is why some of the Opposition in here now do not remember that far back.  It is only seven or eight years ago.  Why did they not raise those questions?  It was to the advantage of the people of the country to be able to raise those questions and say we cannot dig a hole any deeper than it is now.</p> <p>  It is on that point that I want to turn the argument to the future.  If some of the philosophies now being put forward are carried through, if the people give an opportunity to our colleagues here to put them into operation, there will be desolation.  Venezuela will be like the garden of paradise.  There will be nothing like it.  It will be an absolute economic desert.  That is not going to come until such time as the lending institutions, the international financiers and the people in this country suddenly realise this thing is not what it was made out to be at all.  These people do not have an economic plan and they do not have the superior knowledge that they claim to have.  They have ideology.  It does not count.  It is hard facts, brass tacks, that count.  We must have a debate that relates to how the economy is managed, how we can spend money that we can afford and how we cannot just go around to people on a door-to-door basis and say we want their money, we have a good idea and we will tell them all about it later.  Look at what happened before.  Do we want to repeat that?  Does anyone in this room want to repeat that and to suffer the indignity of the position we were in?</p> <p>  I remember being called to a meeting in Brussels at that time along with a number of other people. I do not know why I was called.  They probably felt that I needed to be beaten up.  All of the member states were there, and they castigated this country for what we did and the implications for the rest of the European Union.  They were angry.  Many people, some who were near neighbours, despised us and ridiculed us on the basis that we were not able to manage the economy, yet here we are going back the same route again.  Have we learned nothing at all?  Surely, we should have learned something and that it is not that far away that we cannot remember 2007.  In 2007 the country was flat broke, and nobody wanted to accept it.  In 2005 the country was flat broke, and it still went on.  I despair at the debate that we have had for the last half an hour or so.  If it is that bad, that we cannot remember what went wrong and we cannot accept it, then we are quite liable to do the same daft things again.  It would be stupid if we go down that route.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that Deputy Boyd Barrett put together his party's housing budget on the basis of housing figures that were developed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Finance.  The figure from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the cost of building a social house nationally is &euro;240,000.  It should be familiar to Deputy Doherty because this figure comes from a question that Deputy &Oacute; Broin himself asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

In the normal course of events, the receipt by a person of an asset which he or she has not paid for is a gift for the purposes of CAT.  However, section 82 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides for a CAT exemption for certain types of receipts.  These include the receipt of compensation payments for personal injuries and the receipt by an incapacitated person of certain trust funds.</p><p>Where a person wins a sum of money from betting, a lottery, a sweepstake or a game with prizes, he or she benefits from this exemption by virtue of section 82(1)(c).  Only sums received bona fide qualify.  In the absence of this provision, a person could seek to avoid CAT by arranging with the disponer to bet on some event the outcome of which was certain, or which could be controlled by the disponer and donee.</p><p>Where a person participates in raffle or draw and wins a non-cash prize, however, the person is deemed to have received a gift for the purposes of CAT.  As they are not cash prizes, they do not come within the scope of the exemption for certain receipts provided for by section 82.  This means that, strictly speaking, a charge to gift tax arises on the value of the non-cash prize taken by the person in the raffle or draw.  Notwithstanding this treatment of non-cash prizes in the legislation, non-cash prizes have, in practice, been given the benefit of the CAT exemption which applies to winnings from betting, lotteries, sweepstakes and games with prizes.  This treatment is considered to be in line with the original intent of the exemption, if not the actual wording.</p><p>When section 82 was introduced in 1976, it would have been very unusual to see property such as a house or a car being offered as a prize from a game of chance, far more usual was the offer of a cash prize.  In recent times, however, the increasingly popular use of raffles and draws for assets such as houses and cars as a means of fund-raising by community-based organisations such as GAA clubs and local schools has highlighted the difference between the legislation and the practice on the ground.  This amendment brings the legislation up to date, so that it reflects the current practice whereby non-cash prizes from bona fide raffles and draws are also exempt from CAT.</p></speech>

Is it the words "bona fide"?  It exempts from capital acquisitions tax winnings from bona fide lotteries, sweepstakes and betting, which I support.  What is the change that is taking place?  What is to prevent somebody from organising a lottery with a limited number of beneficiaries or entrants, such as somebody with a property they want to leave to one of their nephews are nieces and allows only five nephews and nieces to enter the lottery?</p></speech>

Given where we are at present with case numbers, will the Minister give a commitment that this can be reviewed and changed in advance if it looks like we will face more restrictions in January?

As a Cabinet member he agreed to impose restrictions as a result of public health guidance which mean people will lose their jobs.  Last night, he said the pandemic unemployment payment was also cut.  This is unfair.  When the Government restricts even for the right reasons the ability of somebody to earn a living there is a responsibility on the Government to support them in the sector which it has restricted.  This needs to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>in how we implement the public health guidance over this rocky period.  The EWSS will be closed to new employers on 1 January but there is no guarantee that we will not be in a situation, and I hope not, when further restrictions will be imposed on sectors.</p><p>Therefore, the EWSS may need to be reopened.  Will the Minister keep this matter under review?  What powers has he to change it or would a change need legislation to be passed?</p></speech>

Both of them have paid out more than &euro;8 billion to support employers and have played a vital role in protecting our country's economy.  Making a change to the date of 1 January 2022 would require a legislative change.</p> <p>  As to whether I support the Government's current policy on the pandemic unemployment payment, I do.  While I accept that last night's decision is impacting workers and businesses, I believe that our decision is the right one.  As with any decision, it will have to be kept under review.</p></speech>

The date of 1 January is potentially problematic because the D&aacute;il will not be sitting and God knows how the pandemic will go.  Obviously, we all hope that it will go in the right direction and the numbers will decrease, but it could also go in the other direction and the Government could face the same situation it faced in the aftermath of last Christmas and have to take drastic decisions.  Therefore, the D&aacute;il would have to be reconvened to pass legislation.  Would it not be more appropriate on Report Stage to consider giving the Minister a power to allow the date to be extended with subsequent approval by the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

While I can never be certain about where we will be with the disease, which is an obvious point to make by now, if things take a turn for the worse, employers can enter the scheme at any point up to the end of the year.  This gives adequate scope to affected employers.  At the moment, I believe this is the right balance.</p></speech>

The changes in respect of innocent errors avoiding penalties are welcome, but why would the Minister remove the prohibition on a reduction of penalties in offshore cases?  Deputy Durkan, who gave us his history lessons, will probably recall how we were nicknamed "Amnesty International" in the 1990s because of all the tax amnesties for offshore cases.  I hope that this is not a similar, if different, type of measure.  Allowing those who declare offshore funds to avoid penalties is hardly a disincentive to engaging in offshore transactions.  Will the Minister justify this change and speak to the issue?</p></speech>

The provisions were designed to restrict penalty mitigation in a case where a person has or had offshore matters as defined, notwithstanding the making of what would otherwise be a qualifying disclosure.  The definition of "offshore matters" was extremely broad and essentially included any offshore income, gain, account or property.  The provision removes any incentive for taxpayers to approach Revenue voluntarily to regularise their tax affairs where such regularisation involved offshore matters because there was no benefit in doing so.  They cannot avail of mitigation of penalties and cannot avoid publication and potential prosecution, all of which are benefits normally associated with the making of a qualifying disclosure.  Therefore, the existence of subsection (15)(a) and related provisions in other Acts is making it more difficult to finalise interventions in many cases.  Revenue may be unable to agree the penalty with taxpayers as a higher rate of penalty will apply in any case with an offshore element.  In the absence of agreement on the penalty, Revenue must have the penalty determined by a court.  This, in turn, can often cause significant delays.</p> <p>  It is considered that the provisions have achieved the objective for which they were introduced, with 3,042 cases having been finalised with a yield of more than &euro;90 million.  As noted, the continuation of these provisions is, in some cases, acting as a deterrent to voluntary compliance and, in others, making it more difficult to finalise cases.</p> <p>  I am making this change not only on the advice of my Department, but after my Department has consulted the Revenue Commissioners.  The advice from them is that the current maintenance of this provision is making it difficult for them to agree the settlement of issues in a timely way.</p></speech>

This section would supersede section 1086, providing a new regime for the publication of the list of tax defaulters, with effect from 1 January 2022.  The first of the amendments proposes to substitute a new definition of &ldquo;qualifying disclosure&rdquo; to include a qualifying disclosure made in respect of excise duties.  This was omitted in error from the proposed new section 1086A to be inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act.</p><p>The second amendment corrects an omission relating to the exclusions from publication for certain court-determined penalties.  Publication of court-determined penalties does not arise where the penalty determined by a court does not exceed 15% of the tax underpaid.  As drafted, this exception does not cover situations where the amount of a court-determined penalty does not exceed 15% of the underpaid excise duty.</p></speech>

This section 75 would replace the old regime of section 74, but why has the threshold for publication on the list of tax defaulters been increased from &euro;35,000 to &euro;50,000?</p></speech>

This threshold is considered low and is based on the combined amount of tax, interest and penalties.  Under the current system, given that the interest charge for late penalties is 8% or 10% per year, depending on the tax type, a recent tax underpayment might escape publication because the interest rate charge was relatively low, whereas an underpayment of the same amount from a few years ago might be publishable because of a higher interest liability.  It is considered that the publication threshold should be determined based on the tax amount only, as this focuses on the under-declared tax liability.  A case is only published where the penalty is 15% or more and the taxpayer has not made a qualifying disclosure.  When considered in tandem with those provisions, increasing the threshold to &euro;50,000 focuses the publication process on defaulters and their behaviour and will not dilute the deterrent effect of publication.</p> <p>  Increasing the threshold to &euro;50,000, and confining this to tax only, will reduce the number of cases published and represent a more significant level of default that justifies publication, and thereby shall bring a greater focus on those taxpayers who are published.  This may act as a deterrent for those taxpayers who want to protect their good name, thereby achieving the objective of publication.  This change also potentially incentivises the disclosure regime even further.  The original publication threshold when the regime was introduced in 1983 was &pound;10,000 punts.  That was subsequently increased to &euro;30,000 in 2015 and then to &euro;35,000 in 2016.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that the list will become smaller and he talked about the benefits of that happening.  I am not sure if I buy into that suggested benefit of tax defaulters being a little more worried because the list will be smaller and they will be more prominently named in it.  I do not think that is what is going to happen here.  If this took effect today, what percentage of people would come off the list?  Would it be reduced by a quarter or a third?  I am asking for a guesstimate, but the Revenue may have done that already.</p></speech>

The Irish Cancer Society welcomes the Bill's provisions to ban the purchase of e-cigarettes by under-18s, to introduce a new licensing fees regime for tobacco and e-cigarettes and to end sales of tobacco products from vending machines and at child-centred events.  These changes will help to reduce children&rsquo;s opportunities to buy cigarettes and that is very welcome.  However, unfortunately, it is not enough.<br/><br/>As we all know too well, if young people want something badly enough, they will find a way to get it.  That is why the tobacco industry is spending billions making e-cigarettes attractive to children and why any legislation that does not address its aggressive advertising and child-friendly flavours and packaging is destined to fail.<br/><br/>Ireland has a proud history of being a world leader in tobacco control.  The introduction of the workplace smoking ban and plain packaging by former Ministers for Health, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and James Reilly were courageous and important victories for public health in a world that often values commercial interests more.  Unfortunately, when it comes to e-cigarettes, Ireland is a laggard, not a leader.  Estonia, Finland and Hungary have banned non-tobacco flavouring in e-cigarettes and the Netherlands announced its intention to do the same.  Nine EU countries have total bans on e-cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship.  Right now, while young people elsewhere in Europe are being protected against e-cigarette marketing, young Irish people are being bombarded with ads on billboards, on buses and at checkouts.  Our young people deserve better.  As the head of the Health Research Board, HRB, Dr. Jean Long, recently stated:</p><blockquote>	Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco cigarettes through a well-enforced regulatory regime of measures including age restriction on purchase, control of availability through licensing outlets, limits to product visibility and attractiveness, and appropriate pricing through taxation. </blockquote><p>From speaking to policymakers I understand the need for tougher e-cigarette regulation that their hesitance to do so is driven by genuine concerns.  They want to help adult smokers to quit and believe e-cigarettes have a role to play.  They know individuals, as I am sure we all do, who have moved from smoking tobacco to vaping and they are persuaded by industry arguments that the kind of measures required to protect young people from vaping will hinder the efforts of long-term smokers to quit tobacco.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that all the major e-cigarette companies are owned by big tobacco.  When a representative of PJ Carroll wrote to members recently about this Bill, they described the company as an e-cigarette company.  However, PJ Carroll is one of the biggest tobacco companies in Ireland and is owned by the global tobacco giant, British American Tobacco.<br/><br/>For years, the cigarette industry told us that cigarettes do not cause cancer, that low tar cigarettes were healthier than other products and that second-hand smoke was harmless.  It produced its own so-called research, misrepresented the findings of genuine studies and hired persuasive lobbyists to hoodwink public representatives and block progressive public health measures.  Now it is at it again.  Companies whose primary business is selling cancer-causing tobacco are trying to convince our public representatives that their main concern is smokers' health and that they want to help smokers quit tobacco using e-cigarettes.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious.  <br/><br/>It is true that some smokers prefer vaping to the use of licensed nicotine replacement gums and other products.  However, as the HRB pointed out, e-cigarettes are no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapies to help people stop smoking.  The World Health Organization stated that electronic nicotine delivery systems cannot be recommended to help cessation at the population level and warned they could impede cessation among some individuals by prolonging or even increasing addiction to nicotine.<br/><br/>The Irish Cancer Society is committed to doing everything we can to help people quit smoking.  We constantly monitor emerging evidence both nationally and globally.  We promote cessation methods that reputable independent bodies have found to be effective.  We provide smokers with individual support and advice and we have helped developed peer support programmes that been proven to help people quit.  We know how hard it is to quit smoking and stand in solidarity with those who are trying.  We understand why many adult smokers choose to try vaping and we respect that decision.  However, we cannot promote something that the WHO and others have found to be harmful.<br/><br/>The improvements we are advocating to this Bill will not hinder adult smokers who want to try vaping, but they will protect children and young people who have never smoked and would never take up the habit if it were not for e-cigarettes.  They will protect children from flavours like bubblegum, tutti-frutti and cola that are clearly aimed at them and not at lifetime tobacco smokers.  It is well established that e-cigarettes can develop into a gateway to nicotine addiction and ultimately traditional tobacco consumption, as they mimic and normalise the action of smoking.  Indeed, the HRB found adolescents who have tried an e-cigarette are between three and five times more likely to start smoking compared to those who never used e-cigarettes.  That is the real reason that the tobacco industry is so invested in electronic cigarettes.  <br/><br/>The tobacco industry kills one in two of its customers.  Its business model is dependent on recruiting young people to replace them.  It will do and say anything to achieve that goal.  Ireland&rsquo;s delay in effectively regulating e-cigarette sales and marketing has played right into its hands.  Attracted by cool advertising, childlike flavours and aggressive point of sale marketing, more and more young Irish people are taking up vaping.  As research by Professor Luke Clancy has shown, as vaping has become more popular, the smoking rate among our 15- to 16-year-olds has also increased from 13.1% in 2015 to 14.4% in 2019.<br/><br/>To conclude, Ireland has a proud tradition of taking on big tobacco and putting public health first.  Let us not undermine all of that by allowing tobacco companies an unlocked back door to entrapping a whole new generation into nicotine addiction.  Let us stand in solidarity with our EU partners in protecting our young people from tobacco and the devastation, disease and death it causes.  To do that, this legislation must include a ban on e-cigarette flavours other than tobacco, a ban on e-cigarette product advertising through all communication mediums and the introduction of plain packaging for e-cigarette products.  Heads 16, 17 and 21 should also be amended to include nicotine inhaling products as well as tobacco products.  Together, we can help adults quit smoking through safe and effective methods while also ensuring today&rsquo;s young people never take up the habit. </p></speech>

Our legislators, health authorities and health NGOs have forged a powerful alliance over many years that has made Ireland a leading global force in tobacco control.  Through bold action, enabled by political consensus, many thousands of lives have been saved in Ireland, and countless more in other countries where policies pioneered here have been replicated.  Today, the Irish Heart Foundation urges members to act boldly again to revitalise the faltering quest for a tobacco-free Ireland and to protect young people from the misery and destruction that nicotine and tobacco addiction causes.</p> <p>  We fully support this Bill, although we have made some suggestions to strengthen it in our submission.  We greatly appreciate the Department of Health and everyone else who has been involved with moving this forward and all the efforts to get the legislation to this point.  However, we do not believe it goes far enough.  After falling from 41% to 13%, the smoking rate among 15- and 16-year-olds here is now increasing for the first time in a quarter of a century.  Additionally, 39% of this age group have used e-cigarettes and 15.5% are regular users.</p><p>There is serious concern that this is the result of a gateway effect from soaring youth vaping rates,with Health Research Board, HRB, research concluding that adolescents who vape are up to five times more likely to take up smoking.  Far from achieving a tobacco-free Ireland, we now risk losing the hard-won gains of the past 25 years, as the world's big tobacco firms that now control much of Ireland's vaping market seek to addict a new generation of young people to nicotine.  To turn the tide of youth smoking back in the right direction and robustly address the dangers of vaping to young people, we believe four further measures are needed to be added to the Bill.  These are: to increase the legal age of sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21; to outlaw all e-cigarette flavours bar tobacco; to ban all e-cigarette advertising and; to introduce plain packaging of e-cigarette products.  We do not want to delay crucial provisions in the Bill that must be implemented urgently and therefore suggest complex age-of-sale legislation for tobacco could be enforced through subsequent amending legislation.</p><p> We believe a new age-of-sale law is justified on the basis of three key tests.  First, is it proportionate?  Yes, because of the unique harm smoking causes.  Many young people move from casual use to addiction between the ages of 18 and 20.  For every three young smokers, one will die of tobacco-related causes, while for every death, 30 more will suffer long-term chronic disease at some point.  Will it be effective?  Yes.  Tobacco 21 laws effected in various US states before becoming federal law have reduced smoking among 18 to 20-year-olds by as much as a third.  The US Institute of Medicine says 223,000 lives will be saved among those born between 2000 and 2019.  In Ireland, that would equate to approximately 3,500 lives saved.  We can also be confident it will work due to the hugely positive impact of increasing the age of sale here in 2002 from 16 to 18.  Third, would it breach young people's rights?  The answer to that is "No".  The notion that young people automatically acquire all rights possessed by adults at 18 is incorrect.  Those under 21 are already prohibited by law from activities such as adopting children, driving large passenger vehicles, supervising learner drivers and standing in national and European elections.  This measure also has overwhelming public support.  Our Ipsos MRBI poll found that 73% of Irish people aged over 15 support the move, including 69% in the 15 to 24 age group and 71% in the 18 to 24 age group.  We regard this as a clear message to policymakers that the Irish public wants decisive action to end the blight of smoking for good.</p><p> As in the US, such a law would have to be accompanied by similar restrictions on e-cigarettes or we would risk further fuelling of youth vaping rates.  The need for further tough measures on e-cigarettes is a product of the duplicity of an international vaping industry whose lobbyists promote e-cigarettes as a quit tool for long-term smokers, while their marketers relentlessly target young people with tactics that are as aggressive as they can get away with.  The truth is e-cigarettes are far from safe as they can damage the heart, blood vessels and lungs, while exposure to nicotine can have long-term damaging effects on young people's brain development.</p><p> The industry's business model betrays everything.  Would Marlboro manufacturer, Altria, have paid &euro;12.8 billion for a 35% stake in Juul Labs, just to help long-term smokers quit, ultimately putting itself out of business?  Of course not.  The reality is underlined by its recent &euro;40 million settlement with the state of North Carolina, after being sued for using deceptive practices targeting young people.  Long-term smokers represent only a small part of the target market of big e-cigarette brands.  The main objective &ndash; and profits &ndash; lie in addicting young people who have never smoked.  By banning child-friendly flavours and advertising, along with plain packaging of e-cigarette products, the State could remove the key methods used to target young people.  Many e-cigarette liquids are sold in bright, attractive packaging with cartoon characters.  I have a couple of them here that I can show members.  They come in various sweet, fruity flavours such as bubblegum and strawberry milkshake designed to entice young people.  Vaping industry claims that such flavours are not intended for young people but are necessary to assist long-term smokers are nonsense.  US research shows that almost 80% of youth users gave the availability of flavours as the reason why they vape.  US Food and Drug Administration research also found that 97% of youth vapers had used a flavoured e-cigarette in the last month and were more than three times more likely to use fruit flavours as older adults.  This was backed up by research we conducted with the Irish Cancer Society showing unanimous agreement among focus groups of third and fourth-year students that sweet and fruity flavours, along with bright colourful packaging, were aimed solely at young people.</p><p> Meanwhile, e-cigarette advertising is banned in print, radio and on TV but is permitted on billboards, public transport and at point of sale.  This means young people are exposed to advertising near their schools, on high streets, in shops and on buses, trains etc., as part of their everyday lives.  Research shows this advertising is effective.  The bigger and hidden danger, however, is online.  While online e-cigarette marketing is illegal, accounts are permitted on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.  This enables targeting of young people by social media influencers and celebrities promoting e-cigarette brands.  Companies claim they only engage with adult audiences, but research shows they circumvent these rules by using hashtags like #gaelicfootball, for example, to communicate with teenagers.  Despite the success of tobacco control policies in Ireland, smoking still claims almost 6,000 lives here every year, more than have, sadly, died throughout the pandemic.  Without decisive action now we will condemn this generation of children and young people to a similar and completely avoidable health catastrophe.  We cannot let that happen.</p></speech>

We will move straight into questions to the witnesses.  Each group will have ten minutes.  The answers must be given within the ten minutes as well.  A few apologies have been received from members.  Some members also outlined at the start of the meeting that they have other meetings to attend, but they will try to get in later on.  We will see how the morning goes.</p></speech>

Both presentations were very strong in calling for a total ban on advertising on billboards and on public transport, among other places.  Do we have any idea of the kind of expenditure at the moment by these companies on such advertising?  I presume they are spending large amounts of money, so they must find it very effective.  If we ban such advertising, will they divert the money into other ways of promoting their product?  Reference was made to nine countries where there has been a ban along the lines the witnesses indicated.  Does someone want to take that question?</p></speech>

It is not fully transparent exactly how much tobacco companies spend on billboards but we do know from going out and about the proliferation of advertisements for e-cigarettes on buses, billboards and in shops.  Prominent product placement is evident in shops.  Mr. Macey referred to marketing e-cigarette products so that they look like sweets.  There is a proliferation of marketing going on to make such products attractive to children in particular.</p> <p>  The question on whether the industry will try to find another approach if we ban one type of advertising is a good one.  Yes, they will.  That is why we have to keep up with them.  We have seen from other countries that such an approach works.  Finland, for example, has managed to reduce the adult smoking rate while also maintaining vaping rates really low.</p><p>The reason is that Finland is very progressive in its legislation and has been a leader in this area.  We have to be vigilant and protect our children.  Industry will find a way.  There have been news reports on the tactics it still uses in the developing world.  The smoking prevalence in Lesotho is 50%, which is horrifying, because single cigarettes are still sold outside schools.  Industry will also find loopholes that governments allow.  It is important that we keep up with those loopholes and close them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#D00200"><p>I will talk about one of those loopholes relating to the sale of cigarettes at present.  We brought in a regulation that cigarettes have to be sold in packs of 20 or more.  My understanding is that 30% of all cigarettes now sold are in packs greater than 20.  Should we also look at this in the context of, for argument's sake, someone who is on 20 cigarettes a day now buying a pack of, for example, 27 cigarettes?  The likelihood is that that person will smoke those 27 cigarettes in one day.  While we have said cigarettes cannot be sold in packs of less than 20, should we also be bringing in a regulation that only packs of 20 can be sold?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#D00300"><p>As the Deputy pointed out, in recent years we have certainly seen a proliferation in the sale of packs of 27, 28 and, in certain cases, 35, which makes up approximately 30% of sales so far.  The worry is that when they are sold in those pack sizes, the cost per single cigarette is in fact lower than might be found for a pack of 20.  That is a concern.  We know that higher prices discourage people from taking up the habit and also encourage people to quit smoking.  It is known, and the WHO has shown, that if the price of cigarettes in high-income countries is raised by 10%, there will be a subsequent drop in the smoking rate of 4%.  That is certainly something we should look at.  The Department has stated that there has not been a whole lot of evidence on it to date, but it suggests that the Department should take a look at that, examine what further evidence is available and do research into smoking habits around those larger packs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#D00400"><p>The other issue that arose during the lockdown in 2020 was that the sale of cigarettes, and cigarette and tobacco products, went up by &euro;150 million.  I presume this indicates the amount of product that comes in from abroad when people go on holidays and bring cigarettes back with them.  Should we do more to control that whole area?  For instance, Finland was referred to earlier.  My understanding is that tobacco products can only be brought into Finland if the health warning on the packets is in Finnish and Swedish.  For argument's sake, what if a regulation was introduced here whereby a tobacco product could only be brought in if the warning on it was in Irish and English?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Macey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#D00500"><p>I will come in briefly on the previous question.  I remember a time when young children would be seen going into shops to buy three Major cigarettes and a pennyworth of chewing gum for 10p.  That was stopped, then the sale of a packet of ten cigarettes was stopped and we went to packs of 20.  In Australia, cigarettes are sold in packets of 30.  I have seen some evidence that what Deputy Burke is talking about may be a problem and may be something we have to deal with.  It needs to be looked at.  We might be able to look at that through the tax system.  The excise on cigarettes could be amended or adjusted to take account of those larger sales that are cheaper per unit and are, therefore, making it cheaper to smoke.  As Mr. Gordon said, generally speaking, the more young people have to pay for cigarettes, the more out of their reach they tend to be.</p> <p>  The issue of bringing amounts of tobacco in that are not smuggled but are not duty paid is one that should be looked at.  There is no point having a high-tax policy if people can circumvent it in any way.  We have to constantly be vigilant in rooting out loopholes to prevent that.  Smuggling is the other area.  Over many years, we have called for Revenue to have more resources, both manpower and physical resources, to ensure that smuggling is minimised.  Up to two or three years ago, it was doing very well in getting the rate down to below the EU average but it is creeping up again.  We have to make sure that there is a proper action plan to tackle, specifically, cigarette and tobacco smuggling.  In addition, Revenue should be empowered with the resources it needs to tackle the problem effectively.</p></speech>

A lot of work is being done by the health service and the Department of Health.  Is there some further action we can take to help people move away from smoking?  We have had major campaigns over the years but do we now need to refresh those campaigns?</p></speech>

We spend between &euro;11 million and &euro;12 million a year on helping smokers to quit.  The tax cost to smokers, on top of all the other tax they pay, is &euro;1 billion.  Between 70% and 80% of smokers want to quit.  We have to do more to help them through advertising campaigns, availability of medications and quit services, which is support that can really help people.  Cigarettes are more addictive than they were 50 years ago.  The industry is always looking at ways to pack more addictive nicotine into them and to make it more difficult than ever to quit.  It is more difficult now than it has ever been before.  We have to help people more.  The State is taking in approximately &euro;1 billion each year from smokers and spending around 1% of that on helping people to quit.  It is not right or fair.</p></speech>

There is a lot of similarity between them in terms of their asks.  To what extent have the two organisations discussed these asks with the Department?  What has been its reaction in respect of additional measures in the legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Averil Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#D01000"><p>We have been lobbying for this legislation for a good few years now.  The Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation work together very closely on this and we have had joint meetings with different Ministers about it.  As I mentioned in my opening contribution, there has been resistance on matters such as flavouring and marketing.  We understand that resistance is driven by a view in some quarters that vaping can be helpful in quitting smoking.  That is not our view.  We have done an extensive review of the research.  It is not the view of the WHO, the US Surgeon General, <i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</i>or other international experts on this.<br/><br/>We understand that people, from their experience, know smokers who swear by vaping and believe, on an individual level, that it is effective.  As I said, we support smokers who want to try to quit through any means they can.  We know exactly how hard it is but we can only advocate for measures that are evidence based.  We have heard from officials that they believe that regulating e-cigarette marketing and flavours will make these products less attractive to adult smokers.  We do not believe that is true.  Do members really think that the packet Mr. Macy showed them, with &quot;juicy&quot; printed on the front and which looks like a packet of sweets, is really aimed at the 60-year-old adult who smokes four packs a day?  That is absolutely not the case.  Somebody moving from the taste of tobacco to vaping does not need something that tastes like pineapple or cola.</p><p>We do not believe that is true.  However, while other people have genuinely held views, we must bring forward our evidence- based view that they are not appropriate.  When the Department was before the committee on the Bill, one of the officials said that people are voting with their feet for for vaping because vaping has become very popular. </p><p> I will return to the question Deputy Burke has highlighted which is we are not giving them realistic options.  We were really disappointed to see a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Louise O'Reilly last year that State expenditure on smoking cessation medications actually failed by 12% between 2010 and 2019.  We are not giving people the help they need to use the tried and tested methods of NRT.  People need peer support.  We have developed the We Can Quit programme that we piloted and worked with the Department to have it mainstreamed as a quit support.  People need a mixture of affordable alternatives and practical hands-on peer and behavioural support.  It is only when those are available that it is possible for people to quit.  The advertising and marketing is part of that, to make people aware of the importance of quitting.  Most smokers want to quit.  They know what smoking is doing to their health, the risk of cancer, the impact on their household budget, particularly those on low incomes, but they need the practical supports to make it possible-----  </p></speech>

We found, working with the Irish Cancer Society, there has been great political support but it is clear that officials do not share that.  How long does it have to make a decision on this?  We are talking about an addiction, and an industry that is trying to take hold of a generation of children.  We do not have time to make a leisurely decision on it.  Even from a precautionary principle perspective we need to do something about that.  It is not acceptable just to see how the situation develops because it will be too late.  Imagine if tobacco smoking was invented today, and we said we will wait for 30 or 40 years to see what happens before we decide what we do about it.  Knowing what we know, it would be stopped outright and there would be no issue about it.  It will be terrible if we are in a position in five or ten years' time where we are saying "God, I wish we did something about that when we had the chance".</p></speech>

We will pursue that with the Department.  In regard to the issue of illegal sales of cigarettes, this was very prevalent up until a couple of years ago.  I am not aware of it to the same extent now.  Is that an accurate assessment of the situation, or is it just that I have not come across it?  What is Mr. Macey's information on the extent of illegal sales?  It does not seem to be as open as it had been previously.</p></speech>

It was deliberately over-estimating both the scale and the impact of smuggling in an effort to stop Governments putting up the price of cigarettes each year, in other words, to get that money going into its coffers rather than into the State's coffers.  What has happened over the past six or seven years is that research showed smuggling reduced from around 16% down to around 10% or 11%.  Now it is creeping back up again to around 14% or 15%.  It is still there, it is still an issue and it needs to be dealt with so the impact of those tax increases is registered in terms of reduced consumption particularly among young people.  The Deputy is right in that there is not as much said about it now because the industry is not using it as one of its lobbying tools at the moment.</p></speech>

In terms of the practice of illegal sales of cigarettes, I would not be aware of people going door to door or selling on the street in town.  I would not be as aware of it now as I had been previously.  Has it reduced or is it just that we are used to it and do not notice it as much?</p></speech>

The EU recognises that many countries, like Ireland, have a strong tobacco control policy and that it is a problem when many people come back from holidays or from their home countries bringing large quantities of tobacco.  The EU is looking into that.  With the EU it takes a while, perhaps a few years, but there was a consultation on it a few months ago which we responded to obviously agreeing that it should be clamped down on, and restricted.  The EU is looking into the problem whereby people can go to another EU country where tobacco and cigarettes are sold for miniscule prices compared to here.  We recognise that is a problem and the EU is looking into it.  It definitely needs to be addressed in that sense.</p></speech>

She said that the tobacco industry kills one in two of its customers.  That is very hard-hitting but obviously true.  That is why we are here in regard to this Bill and the pre-legislative scrutiny to look at how we can make this Bill better.  I accept what both organisations are saying.  They welcome the legislation in as far as it goes, but it should, and can, go further.  I agree with them.  There is one point of difference between the two organisations.  They are on the same page in most areas but, and this is a question for Ms Power first, the Irish Heart Foundation supports increasing the legal age of sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21.  I do not see that in her opening statement.  Is there a point of difference or is that something she would also support?</p></speech>

In the US, Tobacco 21 law was introduced in various states there and in 2019 reduced smoking in the 18-21 age group by up to a third.  There is a small but growing body of evidence particularly from the US but also from elsewhere that suggests that a ban on tobacco sales to those under 21 may prove effective in reducing smoking rates among younger people.  We agree on that.  We also agree that supply is only half the equation.</p><p>The Government can increase the age limit as much as it likes, even up to the age of 30, but children will still get their hands on cigarettes if we do not deal with the demand issue, the marketing and the advertising.  We think the Government must do both.  That is something both our organisations have closely advocated on and that is a view we share.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Power for that response.</p> <p>  On that issue, Mr. Macey accepts, and it is a sensible approach, that this issue might be best dealt with in separate amending legislation.  He referred to it as a complex age of sale item of legislation that might need to be done separately.  Is that the proposal he would make?  While he is flagging this legislation, he does not necessarily think this is a measure that should be primarily dealt with in this legislation but that it is something that should be done later.  He might talk us through the logic of that from his perspective.</p></speech>

We think the Department of Health will support this measure.  We hope it will.  We had an international transatlantic conference on it yesterday.  The level of evidence is very strong.  </p> <p>  In terms of the various elements we both agree on and call for regarding e-cigarettes, that will stop nicotine addiction and it will have a gateway effect but we have to do more to tackle youth smoking.  With respect to the policy that Ireland would be tobacco free by 2025, there was a time when we thought that by 2025 we would get the youth smoking rate down to 5%.  It is not 14% now and that will not happen.  Therefore, we must do more.  This is a very sensible and evidence-based method of doing it.</p> <p>  There are very important measures in the Bill, with which we are dealing, that need to be enacted quickly.  There has been quite a long delay, understandably in light of Covid, and we cannot wait any longer.  That must be done separately.  A separate Bill or amending legislation could be introduced quite quickly.  There needs to be consultations with sellers.  Education and enforcement must be thought through to make sure it is as effective as it needs to be.  We would separate those out but we think the other three points around e-cigarettes should be included in the current legislation.</p></speech>

It is more about teasing some of this out and looking at the international best practice and research.  It would be sensible for the committee in making its recommendations on foot of the prelegislative scrutiny process to recommend that this measure would be examined separately and perhaps we, as a committee, could examine it also, but certainly it is an issue that needs to be examined and progressed.</p> <p>  On the flavouring issue, and this is a question for Ms Power first, there is no doubt and it cannot be argued that e-cigarette flavouring ranging from strawberry milkshake to bubble gum is anything other than targeting young people.  How could that be targeting people in their 40s or 50s or 30s?  It is obviously targeted at young people.  I missed the first contribution as I was doing a media bit and I apologise if this question has been answered already, but why is a provision in this respect not in the Bill as presented?  Where is the resistance coming from?  Is there resistance within the Department to a ban on such flavouring?  I would certainly support such a provision and also elements around advertising.  What the organisations are proposing makes sense but it does not make sense that it is not in the legislation as presented.  Ms Power might respond first to that point followed by Mr. Macey and I will leave my contribution at that.</p></speech>

The Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation also undertook research.  We consulted young people on this, showed them the packets and marketing and asked them if they believed the advertising and product design were aimed at them.  They very strongly believed they were.  They believed it mimicked sweets that are popular among their age groups.  They are also seeing influencers on social media promoting vaping.  They believe the marketing is very much aimed at them and not at their parents or grandparents.<br/><br/>I cannot talk for the officials but we know from the contributions they made to the committee previously there is a view that vaping can be helpful as a cessation aid.  We would say that is not the mainstream view internationally.  There is a minority view from Public Health England, to which the officials referred, but its view on this is very much an outlier internationally and it is not the view of the World Health Organization, <i>The Lancet</i>, the European Respiratory Society or the US surgeon general.  The body of evidence on this internationally is that vaping is not effective as a cessation tool, that it is no more effective than the existing nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, tools we have and that there are risks with vaping that are not associated with the other forms of NRT, as Mr. Macey mentioned with respect to the health effects of vaping.  Another problem is that people move from smoking to vaping but then they never quit vaping.  There is an ongoing nicotine addiction with vaping that people do not have if they move from smoking to other forms of NRT.  For that reason, having reviewed the evidence, we do not recommend vaping.<br/><br/>The Department previously put much stock into getting the Health Research Board to research this issue.  We note the Health Research Board, having done a systematic review of international evidence came out strongly stating it could not recommend vaping.  I quoted Dr. Jean Long from the Health Research Board in my opening statement as having called for the same regulation for e-cigarettes as for tobacco products.  While I cannot speak for the officials, I believe it is their genuine view with respect to regulating e-cigarettes in the way we have called for young people.  They have told us some adults like strawberry flavour.  That is fine but by not tackling those kinds of flavours, e-cigarette products are being made more attractive to children.  While some people might like the different flavours, if somebody is used to tobacco flavour, does he or she really need the enticement of fruit flavours to move to vaping?  We just do not accept that.  We can only bring an evidence-based view to the committee and ask the members to listen to us.  Our only agenda in the Irish Cancer Society is to stop people getting cancer and to do everything we can to help smokers to quit.  The same is true of the Irish Heart Foundation and international bodies which are urging action on this.  We are not asking Ireland to be at the vanguard of this.  As I said in my opening statement, we are well behind our European partners and we need to play catch-up and protect our young people before it is too late.</p></speech>

However, at the same time because of the business model and the marketing practices of certainly the vast majority of the people who sell them, there is a danger to young people.  The issue is where to strike the balance.  I do not know how anyone could even think a balance can be struck by having the availability of 16,000 different flavours that are in various markets.</p><p>These are marketing tools and they are almost exclusively directed at young people because if young people are not addicted, there is no business model.  As Ms Power said, someone working in an industry whose products kill one in two of the people who use them is not really concerned about what effect those products will have.  It beggars belief that anyone would think it is preferable to ensure that a long-term smoker has access to strawberry milkshake and chocolate fudge flavours of e-cigarettes, even though that creates a danger and risk for a whole generation of young people.  We do not know the full extent of the problem.  We can legitimately say that the impact of e-cigarettes on people's health will be less than smoking but a lit cigarette contains 4,000 different poisons and it has elements of rocket fuel and rat poison in it.  There is little that could be sold that would be as toxic or more toxic than that.  Just being less harmful than cigarettes is not a great recommendation for anybody to use e-cigarettes.</p><p> The balance has to be struck with children in mind because we cannot afford to have a situation in ten years' time where we see the effect of wider scale addiction than we have already.  The addiction level is serious.  It can still be tackled effectively but we are running out of time.  We have to move on this quickly.  We cannot afford to wait and see how this develops.</p></speech>

This is a very interesting debate.  My opinions have changed on this issue a number of times.  I have moved from having an agnostic point of view to favouring more regulation and harm reduction, which is what we are here to discuss today.  There is no doubt the tobacco industry is trying to reinvent itself by selling another product by another means.  We have seen in the last 50 or 60 years that big tobacco plays an insidious role in how it markets its products and so forth.  I have no doubt it is trying to get new consumers to use its products.  I am all for regulation and if that means people have less access to products that are harmful, then that is a good thing.</p> <p>  I have about six questions so I ask for short answers.  They relate to the Bill and also a matter that falls outside its outside.  First, where are these vape products mainly made?</p></speech>

Many are made outside the EU and some are made within the EU.  It is hard to say definitively what proportion of the products come from where.</p></speech>

After that, the costs are relatively low.  A bottle of e-liquid, about 10 ml, would cost between &euro;2.50 and &euro;6, depending on the bottle.  It might take a smoker who was on ten or 15 cigarettes per day one week to get through that.</p> <p>  Ms Power referred to the Department talking about people voting with their feet.  Part of the reason for that is the cost because traditional nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, costs are more expensive and some of it is subsidised on the medical card.  However, a prescription from a GP is required for this, which is another barrier.  The cost for people who are not on a medical card is about &euro;36 per week for patches or about &euro;26 per week for gum.  People are not necessarily moving to e-cigarettes because they find them more effective.  Rather, they do so because they are cheaper than nicotine products, even though they want to quit.  As Ms Power said, we have seen that while the funding towards tobacco cessation as a whole increased by about 1% between 2010 and 2019, the investment in medical cessation products and NRT, including gums, patches and other prescription products like Champix, has fallen by 12%.  We need to see a drive towards supporting people to quit and that is something that the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation have called for in numerous joint pre-budget submissions in the past.  It is disappointing that it has not come to pass in recent years.</p></speech>

Is there evidence that young people, who have traditionally started with tobacco products, are now starting with vaping products?  We all have friends and family who have gone from smoking 15 cigarettes per day to vaping.  That is a better evolution but the science says that these products could be just as harmful as tobacco, although that is another discussion.  Is there evidence that young people aged between 13 and 17 are going straight to vaping products?</p></speech>

In the 12 to 17 years category we have seen a rise from one in ten people using vaping products to one in five people using them.  There were studies in the past year on 15 and 16-year-olds showing that the proportion of people in that age range who have ever used e-cigarettes is around four in ten.  That has risen significantly in the past five years.  We are concerned with the emerging evidence, particularly from the Health Research Board, indicating that people who have used e-cigarettes are three to four times more likely to progress to tobacco smoking.  That is why we are talking about flavours and advertising.  It is because we need to restrict children's access to products that are harmful and can lead to lifelong addiction.  The industry wants to replace smokers who are dying.  Some 6,000 people die in Ireland per year from smoking-related illnesses and about 45% of those deaths are due to cancers.  My colleagues can talk about the proportion of those who die from cardiovascular disease and stroke, which cause around four in ten smoker deaths.  That is why the industry is targeting these kids with packaging and flavours like tutti-frutti and bubble gum.</p></speech>

That makes it much easier to get young people hooked on nicotine through vaping than through taking up cigarettes.</p><p>That is a big part of the problem.</p></speech>

In regard to flavours, studies from the US show that most children start off with flavours.  The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks found that flavours decrease the perception of harm, attract young users and increase willingness to try e-cigarettes.  We are concerned about that and cancer.  As stateD by Mr. Gordon, they start off with e-cigarettes.  There is a strong gateway effect to smoking.  Our major concern today is young people.  We do not want to lose a new generation to tobacco and nicotine addiction.</p></speech>

How many people in Ireland are vaping or using e-cigarettes on a daily basis?  Do we have a percentage or number for that?</p></speech>

That includes daily users of e-cigarettes and occasional users.  Again, more generally, we see a higher preponderance of it in younger people.  It was mentioned that four in ten 15 to 16 year olds have used e-cigarettes.  Some 16% of that group used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days, which is really worrying, particularly when taken in tandem with a rise in smoking rates among that group in the past few years, as pointed out earlier by Mr. Macey.</p></speech>

There are number of factors at play there, but it is a good thing.  Looking at this over a 25 year block, I am guessing that the percentage of people that have stopped smoking is, probably, 25% to 35%.  Some people have gone the route of stopping completely and a reasonable percentage have moved to vaping.  That has a wider societal effect in regard to public health.  There are a number of factors at play here too but, again, let us be honest, that is a good thing.  What we do not want to see - I was slightly fooled by this - is people giving up cigarette smoking and replacing it with something else.  The narrative out there is that vaping is less harmful than cigarettes.  It was stated in the witnesses' opening statements that vaping is not less harmful.  Some people will argue that vaping is less harmful.  For the person who previously smoked, say, 30 cigarettes per day and for health reasons decided to give them up, is vaping less harmful?  Some people have said to me that vaping is less harmful than smoking 30 cigarettes per day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Macey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#H00600"><p>The evidence to date shows quite strongly that it is less harmful than smoking.  As stated previously, when you light a cigarette 4,000 poisons come from that, including elements of rocket fuel and rat poison.  There would be very little chance it could be as toxic or more toxic.  What we do not know is how damaging vaping will be over time.  We have only the evidence from the general sale of these products for the past 15 years or less to work on and so the harm has not been fully worked out.  We know they are harmful; it is the extent to which they are harmful that is the question.  It is not likely that they are going to be found to be as harmful as cigarettes.  That is it.  </p> <p>  What we would say to people is that they should only try e-cigarettes if they have tried every other quit means out there.  If they cannot quit in any other way, then they should try e-cigarettes because the chances are that that will reduce the harm that they suffer from smoking.  We know plenty of doctors who take that view.  As I said, cigarettes are becoming more addictive.  It is really difficult to give up.  Those of us who have gone through it know just how difficult it is.  Doctors are encouraging people to try the other quit methods that are safer and, if they do not work, as a last resort, to try e-cigarettes because they will not be as damaging in all probability.</p></speech>

The last thing a long-term smoker wants to see is a child or young person taking up the habit.  It is possible to maintain access to vaping for adults who feel in desperation that it is their only option while also protecting children from the flavouring and marketing so that children who never would have taken up e-cigarettes, or who might have tried them once and found them disgusting and so did not go on to develop a nicotine addiction, do not end up using e-cigarettes as a gateway to cigarette and tobacco smoking and, thus, nicotine addiction.  As stated by Deputy Kenny, we are making progress.  We have been winning this fight.  A small proportion of people still need our help to get off cigarettes.  There are people who are really struggling and they need more Government support.  They need nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, to be cheaper and they need more direct support in terms of helping them to quit.  Over time, smoking rates have decreased dramatically in this country both among young people and adults because we have been brave enough to take on industry, ban smoking indoors, introduce plain packaging and increase prices, as well as other positive public health measures.  It would be madness to risk all of that.  We know that the rates of smoking among young people are increasing for the first time in years because of vaping.  It is possible, from a harm reduction point of view, to maintain that choice for the long-term adult smoker for whom vaping is the only option in terms of helping him or her to quit tobacco smoking without having vaping products pushed in the face of children every time they go into a newsagents and on billboards and the sides of buses.  We can do both.</p></speech>

Businesses have raised with us the fact that it makes them very uncomfortable.  Restaurant representatives have told me previously that it puts them in a really uncomfortable position when, for example, they have a vaper at one table who insists that he or she has the right to vape while customers sitting beside the vaper feel really uncomfortable about the impact on them.  Restaurant owners would prefer to be able to say that the law states that people cannot vape indoors rather than being in that invidious position.  If the committee could consider adding that to the Bill, we would be very supportive.</p></speech>

Also, quite like smoking, if e-cigarettes are allowed indoors, it normalises these products.  If someone inside is using e-cigarettes, it makes them attractive, especially to young children.  They see this and think it looks cool.  We would very much encourage the Government to follow the workplace smoking ban and stamp it out.</p></speech>

I also believe that vaping shops should be closed down because they are made to look trendy.  They are usually beside mobile phone shops and we know that young people love their mobile phones.  A type of zone is created that appeals to young people.  As Ms Power has said, the number of young people smoking has increased and one would have to say that is a direct result of vaping.</p> <p>  I commend Ms Power on the work she did in this House previously and the work she is doing in her current role.  Is it time to consider further anti-smoking measures such as introducing no-smoking zones outside school gates and the front doors of hospitals?  Does Ms Power agree that smoking should be banned outdoors where people are eating?  Is there work to be done in that regard?</p></speech>

We have called for this previously and other countries have taken a lead on it.  It is problematic if one walks out a door and the first thing that hits one is a waft of smoke.  We know that hospital campuses and universities have done that themselves, while local authorities have introduced regulations around playgrounds and so on but we believe it should be the law.  As CEO of the Irish Cancer Society and a former CEO of the Asthma Society of Ireland, I know that this causes huge problems for people with respiratory illnesses like asthma, including me.  I cannot eat outside where people are smoking in my face, which was a particular problem during Covid, because it has an immediate impact on my asthma.  The indoor ban has been amazing and it is great that we led on that but it is time to make all of our public spaces, including parks, beaches and hospital campuses, smoke-free, safe places for everybody by law.</p></speech>

I know I will not be popular with certain people for saying this but I believe that needs to happen.

About four years after the workplace smoking ban was introduced, research was done which showed that as a result of that legislation there was a reduction of three deaths per day from acute coronary syndrome and stroke in the country.  It is believed that the main impact was from the reduction in passive or second-hand smoking.  It is a major issue.  We wrote to local authorities around the country and we understand that Dublin City Council is going to provide that there will be no smoking in the public areas outside pubs.  Several county councils that we wrote to have told us they would prefer national legislation on this rather than trying to deal with it individually.  Some of the councils we have written to are doing it but others are not.  We need a proper response on this.</p></speech>

I would certainly support such a measure.  We have come a long way and the silent majority are on the side of further restrictions.  I suspect that if there was a proposal to reintroduce smoking in pubs, there would be an outcry, similar to the outcry in 2003 when the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, introduced the ban.  At that time, the vintners tried to say that they run the country and that it would not happen but the conversation now would be completely different.  The people who want to ban smoking everywhere for health reasons have huge support from the silent majority.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there can be a level of misunderstanding among smokers who do not realise it can be damaging to the people beside them even when they are outside.  Of course, it is less damaging than in an unventilated indoor space but depending on where a person is sitting and what way the wind is blowing, cigarette smoke can blow straight into a child's or adult's face and can be extremely harmful.  That is compounded, obviously, in busier spaces.  This is an issue we would love to see this committee taking on and I thank Senator Conway for raising it.</p></speech>

I have learned so much today.  I want to return to the issue of flavours and the banning of flavoured e-cigarettes which I agree is vitally important, particularly as HRB research indicates that adolescents who vape are more likely to take up smoking.  Flavoured e-cigarettes are definitely targeted at children.  What do the witnesses think about the fact that such a ban is not in the Bill?  What is the thinking behind that because such a ban seems like common sense to me?  Why is it not in the Bill?  Why is banning flavours not in this legislation?</p></speech>

It will be our job to persuade it.  I worked very closely on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  This is not unlike it.  We have a big battle fighting against the industry.  I want to touch a little on the matter of advertising.  We can draw on the alcohol experience here and think about how visible it is.  I would like to hear a little more from the witnesses on why they think it is important that we ban e-cigarette advertising.  I ask them to say a little more about that and the importance of banning advertising in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Averil Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#K00300"><p>It is great to see Senator Black.  It is the same argument as with alcohol.  The reason the industry invests so much in advertising is to create this view that its product is a lifestyle choice and that it is cool, sexy and attractive.  There are restrictions on direct online advertising for e-cigarettes under the tobacco products directive but the types of things we see on social media are influencers promoting vaping in the same way as cigarettes were traditionally promoted by attractive-looking people promoting the idea that smoking was cool.  That is obviously very attractive to teenagers in particular and they are the market audience.</p> <p>  As we said earlier, we can deal with supply all we like, and it is very important that the Bill is bringing in restrictions on supply, but unless we deal with advertising and the relentless promotion of both alcohol and tobacco, we will never really fix the problem because if people - young people in particular - want something badly enough, they will get their hands on it.  We have to do both.  The problem with e-cigarettes in particular is that they are promoted as something that is cool.  They mimic the physical actions of smoking and get young people addicted to nicotine in a way that we know leads them on to smoking.  The industry would not be spending so much on that kind of marketing if it did not work.  That is why it is so important that we deal not just with the supply but with everything that pushes that demand and makes people think that something which, as Mr. Macey said, is inherently dangerous and bad for us is actually cool.  We have to deal with that insidious, disgusting use of advertising that gets children hooked on a product that is hugely harmful to their health and is likely to lead to them taking up smoking, with all the disease and death that smoking causes.  We have to cut that off and make sure companies are not able to promote e-cigarettes in the same way they are no longer able to promote tobacco.</p></speech>

I totally agree with her.  It comes back to the legislation around alcohol and the importance of advertising in that legislation.  What role do tobacco companies have in e-cigarette companies?  We have heard that some tobacco companies have shares in these groups.  Are there alliances made by tobacco companies to prevent these regulations?  Is this not a conflict of interest if we have tobacco companies inadvertently lobbying on public health?  Again, it is a little like the alcohol issue because that was almost like public health versus big industry.  I just wanted to get a little understanding around that from the witnesses' perspective.  Do they think tobacco companies have an interest or shares in e-cigarette companies?  What is their thinking on all of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#K00500"><p>Most of the large e-cigarette companies are either owned or part-owned by tobacco companies.  In the US, for example, Juul, which at one point had a 70% market share, is part-owned by Altria, which is Marlboro's parent company.  Here, a couple of the main brands like VIP are owned by P.J. Carroll &amp;amp; Company, which is a subsidiary of British American Tobacco.  Logic is owned by Japan Tobacco International.  These companies all have significant shares in those vaping companies.  We certainly feel that tobacco companies are using vaping as a back door or a Trojan horse to try to get a seat at the table in making laws around tobacco control.  That is clearly what they have been doing through vaping.  They have no interest in people quitting their tobacco products and they have no interest in people quitting their vaping products.  An internal R.J. Reynolds memo that was leaked by a whistleblower stated, &quot;Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public.&quot;  Tobacco companies' products are death and doubt and that is what they have been selling for decades.<br/><br/>Parliamentarians have been standing four-square against the tobacco industry for a very long time but it is becoming increasingly difficult for Deputies and Senators to actually know who is lobbying them.  That is a real challenge.  It is the same issue with the general public.  We did research with Ipsos and it showed that only three in ten people had any awareness that the tobacco industry owned or part-owned many of the major vaping brands.  It is a real challenge and one that we have to face head-on.  We have to apply a lot of scrutiny to what is happening, particularly when we see vaping companies talking about reducing harm, referring to studies from Public Health England and latching on to figures that have been, if not debunked, then heavily criticised by the likes of <i>The Lancet. </i></p></speech>

It gives them access to a whole new generation of children to addict to nicotine.  It assists them in increasing the smoking rates among children and gives them access back into the political system that they lost, at least in Ireland although maybe not in other countries.  We adhere to the WHO framework convention on tobacco control, FCTC, regulations that are designed to prevent lobbying by tobacco companies.  Their interest in vaping companies has given them a route back in to lobby for whatever they want.  The last thing they care about is long-term smokers trying to quit.  They are looking at a whole different area of making vast new sums of money and regaining the influence they have lost.</p></speech>

A lot of e-cigarette companies, similarly to tobacco company tactics, try to make their product look cool and attractive.  One of the ways they do that is by selling these e-cigarettes at festivals and at other kinds of temporary premises.  Juul was a big culprit there.  This legislation will ban tobacco products at temporary or moveable premises but that does not include nicotine-inhaling products like e-cigarettes.  That is a major amendment we would have to make to the Bill, that e-cigarettes and tobacco products be banned at these temporary facilities.  E-cigarette companies have their stands at festivals or other events in Ireland that young people attend.  They are not even trying to market them as any kind of cessation device; they just want to market them as something cool that people can have with friends while listening to music.  This Bill needs to be amended to ban e-cigarettes at moveable premises, and also at events for children.  This Bill bans tobacco at events with children.  There is no reason nicotine-inhaling products need to be sold at events for children either.  Those are two major amendments that we think need to be included.</p></speech>

Can they outline the rules and regulations for lobbying by the tobacco industry in Ireland and internationally and how lobbying works here?  I ask because it is important for the people listening in to understand the regulations here, particularly when we talk so much about tobacco companies presenting themselves as vape companies and other such things.</p></speech>

Within that there is an article that states that public health policies on tobacco control should be protected from the vested interests of the tobacco industry.  That includes all Government sectors, that is, the executive, legislative and judicial sectors.  In part we have seen the industry use front groups to get around that because compliance with the convention is really good.  In practice, it has meant that Government and public officials can only engage with the tobacco industry if it has a means to progress legislation on technical issues.  For example, a few years ago the Department had to meet representatives of the tobacco industry to say there was a need to figure out the type of font that will go on the plain packaging.  Discussing things like that is where they can meet industry.  Obviously the Regulation of Lobbying Act applies to any lobbyists.  From our perspective, the FCTC is the strongest global binding factor.  The convention looks at declarations of interest by any public officials.  It ensures that Government bodes cannot accept partnership with industry and that Government officials divest themselves of any interest in the tobacco industry.</p> <p>  The tobacco industry sees opportunities, through e-cigarettes, to recruit, aggressively market and keep existing customers hooked.  Mainly, it is an opportunity to influence public policy and allow unfettered access to their products.  That is the main concern but, thankfully, in the main, implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been really good.  However, the industry is muddying the waters and it is becoming increasingly harder to tell so it is a matter of vigilance by everyone as to who they are talking to, be it civil society, governments or legislators.</p></speech>

Obviously the Irish Cancer Society, in its submission, has expressed concern about the threat posed by e-cigarettes.  A lot of submissions from the industry mention the Public Health England, PHE, report stating e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than tobacco.  I have heard the 95% figure bandied around all over the place and there is a huge amount of marketing that says e-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than tobacco.  A couple of years ago I heard the society say that further research was somewhat limited.  Has there been further research?  Are e-cigarettes 95% less harmful than tobacco?  Do we still await research on the matter or is the 95% figure merely a good marketing ploy to encourage people to choose e-cigarettes and keep them within the smoking curriculum?</p></speech>

In fact <i>The Lancet</i>criticised the research on which Public Health England based its position and said: &quot;The reliance by PHE on work that the authors themselves accept as methodologically weak&quot;, and along with the declared conflict of interests surrounding its funding &quot;raises serious questions not only about the conclusions of the PHE report, but also about the quality of the agency's peer review process&quot;.  That is quite a strong view from <i>The Lancet</i>, which is a respected international medical journal.<br/><br/>The Irish Cancer Society, as am I sure does the Irish Heart Foundation, constantly monitor emerging evidence in this area.  We always check our positions against new and emerging research.  Our view, having looked at the body of international research, is that vaping cannot be recommended as a smoking cessation tool.  Recently the HRB carried out an extensive systematic review for the Irish Government and the board also reached the same view as us.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, Dr. Jean Long from the HRB, having reviewed the international evidence stated that &quot;Children and adolescents require the same protection from e-cigarettes as conventional tobacco&quot;.  There may be a harm reduction argument for long-term adult smokers, who have tried everything else but cannot stop smoking, to vape.  However, we need to make sure that we protect children and young people from ever taking up vaping and then moving on to smoking.<br/><br/>The percentage produced by PHE is constantly rolled out by industry as a means to claim that research has found vaping to be safer and an effective cessation tool.  Mr. Gordon can quote all the different surveys that we have reviewed in our own work but so many international studies have found otherwise.</p></speech>

Ms Power has said that e-cigarettes are not recommended as a cessation method except for long-term adult smokers so why do people use e-cigarettes to quit smoking?  Is it because there has been a powerful marketing campaign and we have let the ball slip?  I have the 95% figure in my head and I remember that she said a couple of years that research still needed to be done.  What drives people to use e-cigarettes?  Every second person I know seems to vape all the time.  Maybe it is just my age group but a lot of people are vaping.</p> <p>  The Irish Heart Foundation, in its opening statement, proposed an increase in the legal age of sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes to 21.  Is that a realistic option in Ireland?  What engagement has there been in terms of whether that legislation will ever happen?  Do the witnesses think that they will get political support for the increase?  Is the proposal aspirational and even though it is based on evidence, the reality of whether it might happen is another thing? </p></speech>

Part of it must be the relentless marketing.  We are bombarded with images of vaping left, right and centre.</p><p>Point-of-sale marketing is particularly effective.  It is also worth pointing out that vaping products are much more accessible than NRT products, as was mentioned earlier.  For people to get NRT products on a medical card, they must get a prescription from their GP and collect the products from a pharmacy, whereas they can go into a petrol station forecourt shop, a newsagents and up to a kiosk in a shopping centre or at a festival and get vaping products that are openly available.  We welcome that the proposed Bill will bring in a licensing regime to deal with at least some of that.</p><p> Marketing and accessibility have an impact.  Price is another element.  As stated earlier, vaping products are much cheaper than the tried and tested, safer and more effective NRT alternatives.  All of that has helped, as has the lack of Government investment in proper cessation methods.  As was mentioned earlier, Government investment in cessation medications, which is primarily aimed at those on medical cards, fell by 12% between 2010 and 2019.  Smokers are not being given realistic alternatives and practical supports.  That is also part of the problem.  I will let the representatives from the Irish Heart Foundation answer the question about the age at which cigarettes can be sold to people.</p></speech>

We had a transatlantic conference yesterday on this issue.  The HSE spoke in support of this measure.  We believe there is support in the Department for it.  I do not know how substantial it is at this point but there is definitely support.  The Economic and Social Research Institute stated in 2017 that this is the way to go, or one of the significant ways to go to further reduce tobacco use.  This measure became federal law in the United States in 2019, having been introduced in a number of states, starting with Hawaii and California in 2016.  The evidence is suggesting that among people aged 18 to 20, it is reducing smoking by between 21.7% and 33.9%.  It is also having a major impact on people aged between 15 and 17.  Older groups often procure cigarettes for those younger groups when they are underage.  This is a serious and important measure that will come through because it makes sense.  As I said in my opening statement, it is proportional because of the damage that smoking does to people, particularly young people.  We heard evidence yesterday about how one is more prone to addiction to cigarettes when one is young and the damage, not just from the length of time one is smoking but the actual damage being done while one is young, is much more considerable than among people who started in older age.  It will be effective.  We have done it before.  In 2002, we increased the age of sale from 16 to 18 and it was incredibly successful.  It is one of the main reasons our teenage smoking rate fell from 41% to 13%.</p> <p>  It is enforced in other countries, such as India.  This is not an out-there, extreme proposal.  The other thing is that it does not go against young people's rights.  People have said to me that if you are old enough to go to war for your country, you should be old enough to buy a packet if cigarettes.  That is fair enough.  The first question is who would want to send an 18-year-old to war.  We did send 40,000 young men to war in the First World War, many of whom were aged between 18 and 20.  Many of them did not come home.  This is about protecting young people's health.  Based on the American figures, if we introduced this measure today, we would save the lives of roughly 3,500 people born between 2000 and 2019.  It is a measure that can have a big and long-term impact on smoking rates.  It would reduce much of the misery and destruction caused by smoking for future generations.</p> <p>  We must deal with it.  We need an endgame for smoking.  Tobacco had a beginning and it must have an end.  We cannot just wait and hope, and go along as we are doing, with 6,000 deaths a year in Ireland.  We must deal with this and the legislation is a very sensible measures that will help.</p></speech>

Is there any way of dealing with that?  I presume it is difficult to introduce a ban within a single country.  I wonder is there any kind of move to outlaw online advertising, say at an EU level, or have our guests considered approaching some of the big companies directly on the basis of health and safety for young people?  I wonder is there any potential for limiting that at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#M01000"><p>The EU's tobacco directive is being updated.  It is being reviewed.  The EU has recognised a problem online because although e-cigarette advertising is not allowed online, the likes of the big e-cigarette companies are allowed to have social media accounts.  They pay their marketers millions to circumvent the rules through hash tags and social media influencers.  British American Tobacco was caught in Italy hiring social media influencers through its e-cigarette company.  Those influencers have large numbers of followers online, most of whom are young people.  It is something that needs to be addressed urgently because that is the way they are getting in.  It is hard to monitor because much of the analytics, including how many views an advertisement gets, is controlled by the likes of Instagram and Facebook.  It is the major way those tobacco companies are getting into young people's viewing points.  Young people see this activity online.  The EU is looking at the matter.  It will take a few years but it is something that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Ireland can definitely take the lead and start banning all forms of advertising, including billboards and point-of-sale marketing.  It can be a leader at EU level and say this needs to stop.  There is no reason why e-cigarette companies need to have a Facebook or Instagram account.  There is no reason why they need to be promoted.  Many of them promote themselves as a tech company.  They promote the image of their product as belonging beside an iPhone, as if it is a cool tech product that plugs into a USB.  There is no reason why they should be allowed any kind of advertisement.  If an e-cigarette company tries to portray itself as a cessation company, it should be controlled in that way and not allowed all this glamorous online marketing, point-of-sale marketing or billboard advertising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#N00100"><p>While we wait on Deputy Crowe, I will ask a few questions.  The elephant in the room is the difficulty in giving up cigarettes.  I was struck by something that a group that appeared before us last week said about advertisements and how films used to portray smokers as sophisticated, cool and so on.  Perhaps I am missing it, but I am not seeing the same happening with vaping.  I do not see many people vaping in films or the like.  They are still probably smoking.  There was some suggestion that films that predated the bans have the smoking parts censored.</p> <p>  After the meeting, I remembered when I was in a hospital bed in a cancer ward.  The majority of the people there had throat cancer.  One guy was called Johnny.  Johnny's whole day was spent on how he would get out to have a cigarette.  I woke up one night and Johnny's head was sticking out the window.  It was -4&deg;C or -5&deg;C, there was white frost on the window and Johnny was smoking in his pyjamas.  Every day from the time he got up, he talked about how he was going to get out.  Would the nurse bring him?  Would someone else bring him?  As I mentioned last week, I am aware of people who have lost limbs from smoking.  Giving up is not that easy.  If we are going to get the Johnnys of the world off cigarettes, we must consider everything.  That is probably the point that is being made in respect of vaping.</p> <p>  The witnesses touched on an idea on which I would like them to expand.  We understand passive smoking.  Going back to the hospital scene, the smoke was blowing back in.  How much evidence is there that the "passive smoking" effect of e-cigarettes impacts negatively on people's health?  If there is much evidence, the logic is that we need to move and legislate.  Will the witnesses expand on this point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#N00200"><p>At the moment, the evidence is somewhat limited.  What evidence we have seen is that second-hand aerosols are not harm free.  Second-hand aerosols have a health impact, as does direct aerosol usage on the person vaping.  There is a minor health effect, but the evidence in this regard is not as widespread as evidence on the direct effect of e-cigarette use.  It is the nature of the e-cigarette evidence that it is constantly evolving, given that it is relatively short term compared with tobacco research.  From what we have seen, though, there is a minor health harm from the second-hand aerosol effect.  If someone is sitting in an outdoor smoking area or indoors where e-cigarettes are constantly being blown into his or her face, there is a minor health harm, but the evidence is constantly evolving and we are always examining it to determine our position on it.  We believe that vaping should be denormalised and people should be protected from second-hand aerosols.  We would support the smoking ban being extended to e-cigarettes so that they are not allowed in workplaces.  I imagine that many restaurants would encourage the same, as it would make it easier for them if there was national legislation telling people who want to have an e-cigarette to go outside and not blow it in the faces of other patrons on whom it might have a health effect.  This would also denormalise vaping for children.</p></speech>

No one would consider blowing smoke into another person's face - it would just not be acceptable - but it seems to be viewed as acceptable for people to walk along the street and suddenly find a cloud around them.</p> <p>  The issue of alcohol was mentioned.  Where e-cigarettes are on sale, do the witnesses favour them being sectioned off?  In quite a number of multiples, there are whole aisles full of them.  People are walking down them because there might be garden products on one end, for example.  The witnesses probably know one of the multiples I am talking about.  It sells a lot of cheaper products and food, which brings in families, and there is a whole wall of vaping products.  The different flavours, colours and the like that people have mentioned do not have an impact on me, but there are people who are looking to quit.  Some say that a particular flavour helps them.  A young lad who works in my office says that he used to smoke a brand that he brought in from the US but that he cannot bring in anymore.  My message with this point is that he will now try to give up vaping.  I have listened to what the witnesses have said about cessation and the fact of dropping-----</p></speech>

This is something on which we would like to see progress.  Both of our organisations have recommended that.  Both organisations recently undertook research on people's attitudes to advertising and advertising's impact.  Brand recall was highest at point-of-sale, that is, in-store.  In 2009, Ireland banned the in-store advertising of cigarettes, which had a major impact on teen uptake.  Studies showed that, before the ban, approximately four in five teenagers remembered brands based on what they had seen in the store and, after the ban, that figure dropped to one in five.  In-store advertising has a real impact.  Children are bombarded with it if they go into any petrol station or local shop.  It is brightly advertised with bright colouring, attractive flavours like tutti frutti and cartoon-type packaging, which has been shown to make products more attractive to children and make them more likely to use those products.</p> <p>  Senator Black touched on the structural separation of alcohol.  We view it as a major priority in terms of advertising.</p></speech>

If that is the case, why do they need mass marketing?  People have to ask for cigarettes, so let them ask for a vaping product.  It will still be accessible to them, so why does it need to be beside the sweets at the checkout?  Why is that level of marketing to everyone needed?  Their adverts do not tell people to use their products to quit tobacco.  Rather, the adverts stress what a pleasurable experience vaping is, how nice the flavours are, how cool the technology is, etc.  E-cigarette companies are not marketing e-cigarettes just to move people from smoking.  Point-of-sale advertising is a key way in which they reach non-smokers and promote vaping as something that is cool, with a perception of it being risk free.  The Chairman talked about people vaping in front of others.  They genuinely believe that is okay.  They have been persuaded by industry that it is safe and not bad for them, let alone others.  The Chairman mentioned Johnny in the hospital.  Johnny is just another victim of a disgusting and relentless industry that will say and do anything.  It tries to promote as cool something that will lead people to cancer wards and spending their final days with an awful disease.  It will say and do anything to make that possible.</p><p>Our responsibility as civil society organisations, public representatives or the Government is to make sure nobody else needs to have that experience and to protect young people from it.  That is why we have been so encouraged by all the contributions made by members today.  I am very optimistic the committee will show leadership on this and work with the Department to improve the legislation and make sure we protect children and young people from that relentless marketing and disinformation.</p></speech>

I ran down the stairs to get to the meeting room.  I had been following the whole debate.  These days, members have to juggle a few things.  I have been following the debate from my office.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions so far this morning.  I have read their written submissions.  It is great to see Ms Power back in Leinster House.</p> <p>  The Bill has several aspects, including a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to those under 18, a new licensing fees regime for tobacco and e-cigarettes and the ending of tobacco sales from vending machines.  I am a child of 1982.  I do not want to hazard a guess as to the ages of those present, but when I was growing up, if you watched Formula 1 racing on Sundays, the cars that whizzed past had tobacco advertising on them.  There were chocolate cigarettes on display beside the Smarties when one went into the local shop to spend one's pocket money.  It was kind of saturation.  When I got to 12 or 13 years of age there was always a huddle of ten or 12 guys smoking down a laneway behind school at lunchtime, with a cloud of smoke rising from them.  I think that has more or less ended.  It is rare to see a huddle of young people smoking and passing a cigarette between them, either on the streets of Dublin when I am up here for the D&aacute;il or down at home in Ennis.  It has become unfashionable.  In fact, younger people are, in general, living far cleaner lives than our generation did.  They are into the gym and healthy eating and living, yet there is still a problem and this legislation seeks to deal with it.</p> <p>  In her opening statement, Ms Power referenced the Health Research Board and the World Health Organization, WHO, both of which cite in their research that e-cigarettes are no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapies.  That needs to be repeated.  I remember seeing an e-cigarette for the first time five or six years ago when they first came on stream.  An individual took a battery-powered and fruit-favoured e-cigarette out of his or her jacket pocket.  There was a little cloud of vapour and I was told it was going to wean the person off cigarettes.  That claim has been put out time and again but now, several years later, the WHO has published research to state is not factual.  That needs to be repeated.</p> <p>  On the issue of vending machines, I do not know if my head is in the clouds, but I have not seen many of them.  Where are they located, in general?  What is it being sought to limit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021111700002#O00300"><p>They are usually located in pubs or hotels.  We are a little bit behind the rest of Europe on this issue.  Approximately 14 EU countries have a ban in place, as does the UK.  I know the Department has been keen to push this ban for several years.  The thinking behind it is that it will help to denormalise smoking as it will ensure that children see fewer tobacco products around them.  In addition, there is evidence from the environmental health service that, despite most places with a vending machine having a token system in place, children tend to be more successful in their attempts to get cigarettes from vending machines than through other means.</p></speech>

In some cases they are located behind a bar counter.  A token is given and down you go.  It is kept as a financial transaction separate from the food or drinks that are sold at the till.</p> <p>  We definitely want to curb smoking.  I have never smoked a cigarette in my life.  I am very anti-smoking.  However, there are cohorts, such as older people in particular, for whom it is very difficult to break the habit.  I have grandparents who smoked.  It is very difficult for smokers in their late 80s to give up cigarettes.  It might make more sense for vending machines to be positioned away from children and the main thoroughfares of hotels rather than having an outright ban on such machines.  They should be situated under a bar counter or somewhere like that.  Having a point of sale should not be the main problem; it is more about the location of that point of sale.    </p> <p>  Another issue I wish to home in on is the importing of cigarettes.  We have won the battle on many fronts but there is an issue in respect of cigarettes being brought into the country.  Many people come off a flight or a ferry laden down with bags filled with large boxes of 100 or 200 cigarettes.  Is the regulation in that regard a bit soft?</p></speech>

As with alcohol, there are restrictions on sales at airports and in duty-free shopping areas but if one buys a product in another country and pays the tax on it, one is entitled to bring it in one's luggage.  That creates problems for us, as a country that has led on tobacco.  We increased prices to make cigarettes more expensive here but people are getting around that by going to Spain and other countries, buying them more cheaply on the high street there and then bringing them home in their luggage.  That is definitely an issue that we would welcome the Government considering.</p> <p>  The Deputy is not much younger than me; we are members of the same generation.  He is certainly better than me in terms of being able to withstand all the marketing and never smoke.  I did smoke.  As the Deputy stated, it was very popular back then.  Cigarettes were pushed at you so much when we were younger.  I took up smoking in school and it took me a long time to quit, and it was very difficult to do so.  I know exactly how difficult it is.  Thankfully, I managed to quit while I was in college.  I know exactly how difficult it is for people such as the older people to whom the Deputy referred who have never been able to break that habit.  These products are designed to be addictive.  They have become more addictive through the years.  They are designed to make sure that the older gentleman who was mentioned will still be smoking and a loyal customer of a particular cigarette brand until he goes to his grave.  The more we can do to ensure young people do not take it up in the first place and do not have to go through the trauma and difficulty of trying to quit, the better.</p></speech>

I refer to the old black and white photographs of nine-year-old or ten-year-old children with peaked caps smoking cigarettes.  One could see the pathway of those children's lives.  They probably aged far more quickly and faced more health problems than would have been the case if they did not smoke.  We want to avoid situations such as that.  Significant inroads have been made in the past 15 years or so in terms of not allowing it to happen again.  We need to double down on that effort.</p> <p>  I always feel sorry for the people in their late 80s or 90s who go to the GP and are told to pack in the cigarettes, a product they have been smoking for many years.  The person probably has only a few months or years left in his or her life.  They are dying out, unfortunately,  I want the law to be hard and clamp down on smoking.  I certainly want us to do everything we can in terms of advertising.  I believe that more taxation should be landed on top of cigarettes in each budget.  However, I always feel sorry for those people.  My grandparents were in their late 80s and they were told to pack in the cigarettes.  We do not want other people to take that path but we need to keep those older smokers in the back of our minds.</p> <p>  I do not wish to name the company, but every supermarket and convenience store sells roll-up papers made by a particular firm.  Many of the young people I see smoking - and there are far fewer of them than in previous years - make their own cigarettes because they are cheaper.  On the train I took to travel to the D&aacute;il yesterday, there were two girls sitting across from me who were rolling up seven or eight cigarettes to have later in the day.  They were very young.  No measures have been implemented in respect of that kind of paper.  If it were to be taken out of the market, I am not sure what could replace it.  Does that need to be considered?</p></speech>

Studies have shown that young people are moving towards roll-your-own tobacco as traditional packets of 20 cigarettes are being taxed at a higher rate.  Overall, by quantity, roll-your-own tobacco is slightly cheaper.  We have been calling for those products to be taxed at a higher rate.  Studies have also shown that young people consider roll-your-own tobacco to be healthier and somehow more organic than traditional cigarettes that come in packets of 20.  That needs to be addressed through taxation but it should also be highlighted that roll-your-own cigarettes are more harmful, not less harmful, than traditional cigarettes.</p> <p>  On the issue of vending machines and the locations where cigarettes can be bought, in order to make it easier for people to quit, we have to cut down on the number of locations in which cigarettes are sold, including vending machines.</p><p>We welcome the fact the proposed Bill will put new registration measures in place in the context of where tobacco products are being sold and will introduce an annual fee per outlet.  We have called for a &euro;500 annual fee per retail outlet that sells tobacco.  In the Department of Health's regulatory analysis of the proposed Bill, it was mentioned that, in the context of alcohol, a &euro;500 per retail outlet licence has to be paid annually.  We need to put a high price on retail locations that sell tobacco.  That could limit locations where tobacco could be sold.  Studies have shown the higher density of places that sell tobacco, the more people smoking in that area and the higher initiation rate for children.  That is a major step.  We need to put a high annual fee on locations selling tobacco products and ban vending machines.</p></speech>

There are not many instances around the country but I can think of one in my county where there is antique tobacco advertising.  In many places, it is replicated signage that people put up for a nostalgic look in a shop.  I know one shop in Clare where the signage is authentic and dates back to the 1920s or 1930s.  It would be no harm in some scenarios to have old tobacco signage.  It is in many pubs as well and harks back to a different era.  It is about nostalgia and creating a historical context.  There needs to be a hands-off approach to that.  There is a building across from Limerick train station I come near to every day I get the train that has old tobacco signage.  That needs to be exempt from this if it is historic.  As for all forms of modern advertising - no way.  That is aimed at selling a product.  This is aimed at historical preservation of the old enamelled signage.</p> <p>  I did not choose to be scruffy this morning; I am doing Movember.  I wanted to mention that while Ms Power and the Irish Cancer Society were here.  I am a reluctant participant in Movember because I do not have a face that goes well with stubble and the rough look, but a good childhood friend of mine passed away at the start of this month from cancer.  Far too many males are still passing from cancer.  There are far too many people passing away from cancer, but one in eight men get prostate cancer.   We are talking about lung cancer this morning.  There are so many forms of cancer.  It is a small gesture to not take the razor and it saves me a few minutes every morning.  I want to highlight the fact that Movember is happening.  A few Deputies have the permanent beard and mustache but a few of us are doing it temporarily for this month to raise funds and awareness of male cancer and male health overall.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Many of us would say that there are a number of Deputies who are scruffy all year round.  Senator Kyne does not seem to be able to get in.</p> <p>  What struck me from the evidence this morning is that many of us see smoking as a cash cow for Revenue.  The witnesses say it is worrying that supports for cessation have dropped by 15%.  That is something we, as a committee, could follow up.  Part of what we are trying to do is bring in all sections that have a view on and a relation to the issue.  The discussion was really useful this morning.  I suppose the witnesses are saying if the increase on the price of cigarettes works, maybe it will work for e-cigarettes.  That is the message they are sending.  Do the witnesses want to sum up?</p></speech>

We would support that.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak.  Ms Power mentioned that the level of knowledge members have on the issues and the views we have heard this morning are encouraging.  It is important that we do this.  If we do not deal with the addiction issue in terms of e-cigarettes and children and young people now, we probably will not get the chance again.  This is the proposed legislation, and this is the time to do it.  Defensive measures will stop the smoking rate from increasing again, which is what e-cigarettes could, apart from people becoming addicted to them, lead to.</p> <p>  We need to get into the endgame for tobacco.  We are still at 14% of teenagers smoking.  The rate among adults has been falling steadily but increased in the last HSE tracker from 15.4% to 16.1%.  There are more than 600,000 smokers in the country.  To reach our tobacco-free Ireland target by 2025, that has to be brought down to approximately 200,000.  We are way off that and we worried that the tide is turning negatively.  We have to deal with that and to continue the downward trend.  We have to look at ambitious and new ways of achieving that.  That is why the Irish Heart Foundation will campaign hard in the time to come to get the age of sale increased, because the evidence is compelling on it.  I thank the Chair and members.</p></speech>

I am encouraged by the contributions from each of the members and optimistic.  I hope we can work together to improve the proposed legislation.  We will do anything we can to help with that.  If members have further queries after the meeting, they should please come back to us and we will help them as the Bill, when drafted, goes through both Houses.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Irish Cancer Society, I thank the Chair and members for the work they do to raise awareness of cancer by sharing their experiences and making people aware of signs and symptoms and their general support for our work.

They are all most welcome.  I remind all members and witnesses to turn of their mobile phones or place them in flight mode.  While they might not appear to be causing a disturbance, they can still interfere with the sound system, which sometimes does not become apparent until after the meeting.  We have received apologies from Senator Martin.  A few others who are not presently at the table may be along in due course.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting is to engage with a number of stakeholders, all of whom made written submissions - and I thank them for doing so - on the general scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021.  Witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee today from a location outside the Leinster House precinct.  This is part of the new hybrid arrangement that we are all getting used to whereby some members are in the building and witnesses are outside, but we are all connected online.</p> <p>  I again welcome our witnesses.  We are joined by the following representatives: Dr. Seamus Taylor, head of the Department of Applied Social Studies, Maynooth University; Mr. Martin Collins, co-director, and Ms Jenny Liston, Roma programme co-ordinator, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre; Ms Fiona Finn, CEO, and Ms Fiona Hurley, policy and communications manager, Nasc; Dr. Jennifer Schweppe, co-director, and Dr. Amanda Haynes, co-director, European Centre for the Study of Hate.  From the Department of Justice, which has permanent observer status at our meetings, we are joined by Ms Kate Flynn, administrative officer, and Mr. John Garry, principal officer, both of whom are with the criminal justice legislation unit.</p><p> I have already mentioned people's own devices.  As housekeeping for these Zoom calls, if you are speaking, make sure that your device is not muted so that your contribution is heard.  If you are not speaking, make sure that your device is muted so that we do not hear papers rustling or dogs barking in the background.</p><p> I ask witnesses to be aware of parliamentary privilege and practice.  This is of particular note for witnesses, who are off the Leinster House campus at present due to the nature of the engagement and the times that we are in, so they may not enjoy the same degree of privilege with their statements as they would if they were physically on campus.  I ask them to be mindful of that when making their statements.  If anything potentially defamatory is said, I will direct them to discontinue and it is imperative that they do so.  I ask members to be aware of the long-standing parliamentary practice and traditions, especially with the extra risk to witnesses and the committee arising from remote attendance.</p><p> Each organisation will be invited to make an opening statement.  We have allocated three minutes per opening statement.  It seems to work.  The witnesses will have plenty of time to speak again over the course of the engagement.  Once all of the statements have been delivered, I will invite members of the committee to put their questions.  There will be seven minutes per member for both questions and responses, and they manage that time as they wish.  If a member wishes to have a long opening preamble, speaking for five minutes with two minutes for responses, that is fine, and if they want to ask questions for 30 seconds and allow six and a half minutes for responses, that is also fine.  When everybody has spoken once, if time allows, we might have a second round, which will be shorter.  I know there is some detail in the opening statements that have been sent to us, so I inform witnesses that I will enforce the three minute rule for their opening statements, but they will have the opportunity to speak again as the engagement goes on.</p><p> We will start with Dr. Taylor.  I welcome him and look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p></speech>

I welcome the Government's commitment to address hate crime as set out in this general scheme.  The principle underpinning the proposed Bill and much of the substance are welcome.  I have some specific concerns.  My concerns are based upon 25 years of practical experience in the equality and diversity, and criminal justice systems in England and Wales, including serving as the director-level senior civil servant responsible for hate crime policy in the Crown Prosecution Service in London.  Based on this experience, together with academic research, I am concerned that if specific issues are not addressed in this proposed hate crime Bill, Ireland risks having ineffective hate crime law.  That would be a significant lost legislative opportunity.  The other point that I want to make is that I come to this in a balanced, proportionate way.  As well as being concerned about victims, I am equally concerned about justice for defendants.  I chaired the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the main defender-focused charity focused on prisoner rights and penal reform in Ireland.</p> <p>  The most significant concern relates to head 8 of the general scheme, which deals with determining proof of motivation.  The test as laid out is a test of motivation.  Proof of committing the offence is sufficient for most criminal offences.  The proposal here sets a different legal threshold for hate crime.  As far back as December, the Department of Justice acknowledged that this is difficult.  It indicates that without a successful way through this, it is unlikely that the new law will be successful.  A workable and effective way through this has existed for 20 years in the neighbouring jurisdiction in England and Wales, and for a slightly shorter time in the North of Ireland.  The Government risks ignoring effective law in our neighbouring jurisdictions.  Instead, the Department of Justice appears to be proposing inclusion of a set of bias indicators, on the face of the hate crime Bill, from which it seems we would cumulatively adduce motivation.  From my experience, this is inappropriate, unduly complex and fails to learn from considerable practical experience in our neighbouring jurisdictions.  In England and Wales, and the North of Ireland, the determination of whether an offence has a hostility dimension can rests on a legal test of proof based on a hostile motivation and-or evidence of a demonstration of hostility.  Some 20 years of implementing such legislation, involving and accompanied by training, guidance, monitoring and reporting, with the exception of disability cases, now shows similar success rates at court to that for regular hate crimes.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the three minutes are tight.  There is a time limit for the meeting.  I know he wants to make four other points.  Does he want to take 30 seconds to go over them?</p></speech>

One particular further concern that I want to bring to the attention of the committee relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  Hate crime legislation is non-discrimination legislation.  It is in the family of equality and human rights legislation within the context of criminal law.  It somewhat mirrors employment equality law and equal status law.  As part of the Good Friday Agreement, there is a commitment to ensuring parity of protection on the grounds of equality and human rights in the North and in the Republic of Ireland.  If this Bill is enacted as set out, there will be a much more complex and higher legal threshold to be met for victims of hate crime in the Republic than in the North.  This is not in keeping with either the spirit or the substance of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I will shorten my opening statement to the three-minute limit.  "Nasc" is the Irish word for link.  We are a registered charity and we work with migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  We have a long history of anti-racism work.  We have been actively engaged in calling for hate crime and hate speech legislation for over a decade and we are pleased to see progress being made on this legislation.  It is only one step towards tackling racism and other prejudices.  While we welcome this Bill, we have concerns about garda&iacute; having a role in immigration enforcement and registration.  Undocumented migrants and migrants with precarious immigration statuses will be reluctant to make reports.</p> <p>  One key issue that we have with this proposed Bill is that the definition of "hatred" in head 2 does not reflect international standards and is not sufficiently clear to provide certainty to the public, prosecutors, and Judiciary.  We recommended that the definition of "hatred" be redrafted in line with definitions used by the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance.</p> <p>  We are concerned about the defences for publishing or otherwise disseminating or broadcasting hate speech in head 3, which are significantly more expansive than those contained in the 1989 Act.  It contains defences where the material concerned consists solely of a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, scientific, or academic discourse.  The general scheme does not contain any guidance as to how a reasonable and genuine contribution may be defined.  Is this an objective or subjective test?  We believe that if the discourse would otherwise reach the threshold set out in paragraph 1 of "inciting or being reckless as to whether such communication will incite, hatred", it is then an oxymoron to say that it was a reasonable contribution to the discourse.</p> <p>  What is political discourse?  There is a reasonable defence for utterances in the Houses of the Oireachtas so we can infer that this refers to speech outside of the Oireachtas.  We are concerned about the potential for fomenting hatred or racism as an election tactic.</p><p> Heads 4 to 6 of the Bill create 12 new aggravated offences which all share the same essential elements, namely, that the offence was "motivated by prejudice".  We disagree with the sole inclusion of the motivation test.  The requirement to prove the alleged perpetrator was motivated beyond a reasonable doubt is too high and would lead to low levels of prosecution.  We are concerned that in the case of, for example, a racially motivated offence, absent evidence that the offender is ideologically racist, the aggravated offence may not be successfully prosecuted or it may be a defence to say the slur used, for example, was used in the heat of the moment or was unrelated to the reason for the offence.</p><p> We believe the use of a demonstration test, as used in England and Wales and more recently in Northern Ireland and referred to by Dr. Taylor, would resolve this enforceability issue.  The demonstration test recognises that harm that occurs to the victim when the victim experiences the offence as a "hate crime".  A demonstration test would be satisfied by proof that the offender demonstrated hostility, such as the use of racist, homophobic or transphobic slurs towards the victim during the commission.  Nasc recommends that the Bill be amended to allow for the offence to be proved on the basis of the demonstration of hostility or motivation by prejudice.</p><p> I believe my time is about to run out.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

At the European Centre for the Study of Hate we study the treatment of hate crime in the Irish criminal justice process, as well as legislative models to address hate.  All of that is grounded in empirical research and comparative legal scholarship.  With Professor Ross Macmillan, we have conducted the first ever general population survey of public awareness and beliefs about hate crime, and hate crime legislation in Ireland.</p> <p>  We welcome the publication of the general scheme.  Our written submission includes specific suggestions with respect to each head.  In this opening statement, we would like to highlight some of the overarching principles we think should guide the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme.  First, we all want the legislation to be effective.  We propose that we critically reflect on what effective legislation is.  We think it is a scheme which achieves a balance of rights between victims and offenders, upholds the principle of certainty, the principle of minimal criminalisation, and the principle of fair labelling and sends a clear message to society that we do not tolerate targeted victimisation.</p> <p>  Second, we believe effective legislation achieves a balance between the need to leverage the declaratory potential of hate crime offences on the one hand, and their potential exclusionary effects on the other.  We have shown in our survey of the general population that labelling an individual a "hate criminal" is likely to prove an additional impediment to securing employment, as well as social integration.  At the same time, our research on the treatment of hate crime in the criminal justice process shows the creation of aggravated offences is crucial to achieving an integrated system-wide response to hate crime.  We believe that these findings underscore the need for a scheme which creates new offences but also establishes a high threshold for conviction, which is present in the general scheme.</p> <p>  Third, in learning from other jurisdictions, we note that while it is possible to later expand the scope and protections afforded by hate crime legislation, it is difficult to contract or remove protections given the message this will send to victims, communities and society at large.  For this reason, we commend the cautious, incremental approach taken in the general scheme and further advise a statutory requirement for a legislative review after five years.</p> <p>  Fourth, we emphasise that to be effective the legislation requires a scaffolding of supports for victims, offenders, and criminal justice professionals.  In the absence of these implementation measures the legislation may fail.</p> <p>  As a final and fundamental point, we should learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and draw on international good practice.  This should be done carefully, recognising the need to adapt international lessons and examples to our own jurisdiction, and ensuring the general scheme is appropriate to the Irish legal, policy, and social context.</p> <p>  In conclusion, our expertise is, as mentioned, in the area of hater crime and we would like to additionally refer the committee to the submission of the Coalition Against Hate Crime, with specific reference to incitement to hatred.  I thank the Chairman.  We look forward to answering all the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I apologise for the technical difficulties.  I thank the committee on behalf of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre for the invitation to address it on the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime Bill) 2021.  As some members may know, Pavee Point is a national non-governmental organisation that has been campaigning for the last 35 years to address racism at both the institutional and individual level and to promote Traveller and Roma inclusion in society overall.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s plan to introduce stronger and more effective legislation to deal with hate speech and hate crime.  This is a recognition the 1989 Incitement to Hatred Act is not fit for purpose.  As we all know, there have been very few prosecutions under it.</p> <p>  Hate speech and hate crime are different from other crimes.  If other speakers have alluded to this I apologise for the duplication.  I was out for about ten minutes.  Hate speech and attacks are not just on the individual but on the whole community that individual comes from.  As a result, this instills great fear, anxiety and uncertainty in that community.  Hate speech and hate crime create barriers to a more pluralist, inclusive society based on principles of equality and respect.  There must be zero tolerance towards hate speech and hate crime.  Unfortunately, it is well documented that both my community and the Roma community all too frequently experience hate speech and hate crime.  For the committee's information, in the last eight years six homes allocated to Traveller families were either vandalised or suffered arson attacks before those families could occupy them.  This was quite clearly motivated by hate.  Unfortunately, in all six cases none of the culprits was ever arrested and held to account before the courts.  That was one house per year.  It is absolutely frightening.  More recently, we have seen examples of graffiti being sprayed on the walls of Travellers' houses that says: "Knackers out".  This was a very recent development.  It occurred in Limerick only three weeks ago.  Thus, it is quite clear we need strong, effective legislation to deal with hate speech and hate crime.  As we all know, hate speech must be nipped in the bud because quite often it is a precursor to hate crime.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleague, Ms Liston, who may wish to say a few words, I want to make an observation on an aspect of the Bill I am quite concerned about.  The defence paragraph is certainly very expansive.  In particular, I am very concerned about what I would describe as a loophole or opt-out clause in relation to political discourse.  The Bill as constructed at present would seem to suggest politicians who come out with effectively racist or other homophobic comments can use political discourse as a defence.  That is how I read the Bill and it worries me.  It needs to be addressed because too often, especially with my own community, the Traveller community, and also the Roma community, it is during elections when politicians are canvassing when we hear most of the racist rhetoric and hate speech directed against Travellers and Roma.  If political discourse is going to be a line of defence, then the legislation will be all the poorer for it when it materialises.  I caution against that and urge the legislators and the drafters to revisit that because it worries us considerably.</p> <p>  As a final point, we note strong, effective hate speech law must, as a priority, be victim-centred.  It must give an effective legal remedy to those who experience hate speech and hate crime.  Those should be the overriding priorities for this piece of legislation.  As we all know, the legislation on its own will not address hate speech and hate crime.  We need a more holistic, co-ordinated approach.  We need other educational and training initiatives for the Judiciary, for prosecutors and for society overall.  The forthcoming national action plan on racism will be a huge complement to this legislation when it materialises.  I thank the committee.  My colleague, Ms Liston, might like to say a word.</p></speech>

We will bring Ms Liston in during the questions as we generally have one speaker per organisation.  Both he and Ms Liston can come in on the questions.</p><p>We might do it that way.  I want to move to the members now and take questions.  That would help to illustrate the points that have been made by the different speakers.  I thank them all for their presentations.  I will take the following members in the order in which they have indicated: Deputies Pringle, Carroll MacNeill and Martin Kenny.  They will have seven minutes each for questions and answers.  Members can continue to indicate during the course of the meeting and I will call them.  Deputy Pringle, you are first up and best dressed.  Off you go.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  I would like to thank the contributors for their contributions.  It was interesting listening to the contributions because when I read through the heads of the Bill, head 8 was the one that stuck out as to how it would happen in practice and three of the contributions highlight that as being a major problem with it.  Funnily enough, if you were an alien looking down from space at our legislation, you would think this was a great country but when you come down and see how the legislation is implemented, it is completely different.  This is a danger with this legislation as well, in that it will be nicely laid out in the law but nothing will happen on the ground in terms of implementation and enforcement.  Could Dr. Taylor expand on what happens in the UK and on how the UK deals with it?  That would be important.  How could we put that into the legislation here to ensure it takes place?  That is something Dr. Taylor might have to follow-up on with suggestions in terms of amendments.  That is my main point.</p> <p>  The point Deputy Martin Kenny made about the political discourse defence is very important and should be enacted in the legislation.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Dr. Taylor about the legal threshold that the victims of hate crime in Northern Ireland have in the Republic and that we need to recognise the Good Friday Agreement in implementing this legislation.  Maybe Dr. Taylor could respond to the point on the tests also.</p></speech>

In my experience, relying on a legal test of motivation alone will be very challenging.  It will give for very limited effectiveness in the law and it could give for ineffective law.  The Department of Justice recognised this and said so in a public document in December last.  It stated that without a way through it, it could be very hard to make this law work.</p> <p>  The way through it, I believe, is by having more than one limb to the test of proof.  Rather than relying solely on proving motivation, which is about getting into the mind of the perpetrator, I believe we can learn both from the North of Ireland and from England and Wales in terms of what they have done.  They have much longer experience.  This is not to hold up everything in England and Wales as good and hold up Ireland, which traditionally has often been done, as all bad.  We know that we could pick any range of public policy issues and the comparison works the other way.  We only have to observe some of the recent experience in relation to the handling of Covid in Britain compared to here.</p> <p>  However, on hate crime policy and practice, it is fair to say that England and Wales are leaders globally and they are recognised as such by the UN supporting UNHCR resources on the ground with experts on mission, SURGE, committee, by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and by EU Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, in terms of their legal provision, their policy and the practices.  Therefore, we can learn from very-near neighbours.</p> <p>  In the UK, they have two limbs to their legal test of proof: proving motivation; and-or proving a demonstration.  The demonstration limb allows you to take into account evidence of demonstrated hostility at or around the-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Seamus Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021111700002#D00500"><p>The demonstration test usually, but not exclusively, pertains to the use of hostile slurs at the time of offending.  It could also involve the use of graffiti, gestures and other symbols.</p> <p>  I did doctoral research on hate crime in England and Wales and I looked at 548 cases in the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPPs, office.  I found that every successful case involved the use of hostile language as well as the base criminal offence, such as assault.  I found that every failed case lacked the demonstrated hostility.</p> <p>  The demonstrated hostility is often integral to the offence.  It is consciously used in the moment.  It is often what the victim remembers for life long after the physical wounds have healed.  In a sense, it is what is often crucial to securing a conviction on the day of court.  I will give an example from my research.  Two disabled men in a north-of-England city have become friendly through attending the same day centre.  One uses a motorised wheelchair.  One uses a walking stick.  They often meet up on days when they do not attend the centre.  They meet up socially in a square in the centre of that city.  They met one day in the summertime some years ago in the centre of the city.  They were sitting on seats in the square.  A young man cycles towards them on a bike.  As he approaches them, they hear him making a loud noise with his mouth.  He slows down as he comes towards them and he lands a big spit on the man who is sitting in the motorised wheelchair, he shouts, "You f---ing mong", and he speeds off on his bike.  Both men were shocked.  They were shaken and upset, and angry.  There were witnesses, both the man who had not been spat on but also other people in the square.  They went to the police, the young man was apprehended and the case went to court.  The hostility dimension was raised from the outset in the court.  Although it is not required to be raised in Britain until the end at the sentencing point, it was raised at the outset.  The defendant challenged the hostility dimension.  He mounted a defence that the sun was shining in the square, it got in his eyes and it caused him to have a big sneeze.  The witnesses' statement regarding the demonstration of hostility secured the conviction and the enhanced penalty for the hate crime.  It was the actual utterance of the words, "You f---ing mong", that were witnessed by other people, that drove the conviction home.  Without this provision, cases like that can be very challenging to bring to a fair and just outcome.  I could go through several cases - I have 15 to hand here - to illustrate that same point.  It leads me to conclude that having a demonstration test of hostility is important to effective hate crime law in the Irish context.  It is also important in the sense of bringing parity across this island to the provisions that also exist in the North.</p></speech>

Indeed, in other law reform processes, for example, in New South Wales, where they considered the amendments to hate crime legislation, they rejected the demonstration test as being too wide.  Mason and McIntosh also reject it.  It is not like it is a standard to which, internationally, other jurisdictions strive to meet.  It has been rejected by other jurisdictions as being too broad.</p> <p>  What we also need to think about is that there are two things that are provided for in the general scheme: aggravated offences from which an individual would be convicted of an aggravated hate crime which would be on the person's record; and aggravated sentencing provisions, which are in another head of the Bill, which would not appear on the criminal record of the individual without a big change in the system.</p><p>One could capture that broader range of motivation, including demonstrations of hostility or other tests, but just because it is being done in England and Wales and there are a considerable amount of convictions in that jurisdiction does not mean it is right for here.</p></speech>

Are jurisdictions that have considered and not adopted that approach getting convictions?  The committee is concerned that we have legislation that works and is a threat.  I appreciate the point Dr. Schweppe makes about a conviction of that kind hanging around somebody for a very long time, potentially an unduly long time, particularly in the case of somebody very young and so on.  One might look at spent convictions in that regard.  In the context of social media and some of the difficulties we are seeing socially at the moment, we want legislation that is going to work and be a real deterrent.  In the jurisdictions that have not taken that approach for the reasons Dr. Schweppe has outlined, how is it working and are they getting convictions?</p></speech>

New Zealand and Canada are interesting examples.  We are not necessarily comparing like with like because we know for a fact that creating new offences, as this general scheme does, will prompt a response from the criminal justice system that an aggravated sentencing provision will not.  For example, New Zealand has an aggravated sentencing provision and there is a strong recommendation that it should move to an aggravated offences model.  Some people agree it should be broadened out to demonstration while others argue it should be kept very narrow.  I will ask the Deputy, as we did in our opening statement, to reflect on what she thinks "effectiveness" means.  Does it mean lots of convictions?  I do not think it does.  I do not think effective legislation means lots of convictions.  I think the criminal law is a very blunt instrument, as the Deputy quite rightly noted.  It does not understand the nuances of general life.</p></speech>

I think effective legislation does involve convictions.  Behaviour is influenced by seeing some incidents going through the courts and, hopefully, having a deterrent effect on everybody else.  I do not want to have legislation through which we cannot get convictions because we have not approached it in the correct way.  An incremental approach can be taken from either direction.  We can take a different approach and soften it over time, particularly if we see a deterrent effect in the first instance.  It is clearly inadequate to go through this in seven minutes.  I totally recognise that and I will hopefully have an opportunity to come back in.</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Taylor about the point he made about disability because there is something distinct there.  If I have time, I will ask him about the Good Friday Agreement but perhaps that will be asked separately.</p></speech>

I have one point to clarify about the end of our previous discussion.  It needs to be made known that there are not a considerable number of convictions in the United Kingdom, either in Northern Ireland or the UK more widely.  Some 130 defendants were convicted of hate crime in Northern Ireland in 2019 and 2020, according to the statistics on the Northern Irish Government website yesterday.  Britain has a population of 67.1 million.  Some 2% of offences are hate crime.  A crime survey in England and Wales captured people's perception of hate incidents.  That figure stood at 190,000 in 2018-2019, when it was most recently conducted.  A total of 105,090 cases were reported to the police and 12,730 went to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution.  There is a difference between what people might perceive and what ultimately ends up being convicted in the system.  The response in the UK is quite proportionate and rounded.  There is not an enormous number of convictions.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about disability.  It is more challenging than other areas for a number of reasons.  All discrimination manifests in different ways.  Racial discrimination is not the same as disability discrimination, homophobic attacks or homophobic discrimination.  There are commonalities but there are also specifics that pertain to each protected ground.  They reflect different histories and ways in which groups are socially patterned across society, whether they are segregated or not.  Policy tends to address disabled people in two ways.  Disabled people are constructed as needing care and protection, which sees them as vulnerable.  The other approach is to construct disabled people as rights-bearing citizens.  This complicates the whole disability area because the challenge is how to recognise the hostility in disability hate crime.  People ask if we dislike disabled people or hate them.  The second challenge is responding appropriately.  What I found in the cases I looked at is that cases involving disabled people are often classified as senseless crimes or attacks on vulnerable victims.  They are often not recognised for the prejudice underpinning them.  As a result, full justice and an appropriate response is often denied.  Do I have the time to give the committee an example?</p></speech>

I was giving a bit of latitude.  I am going to move on to the next questioner.  Dr. Taylor may wish to come back in with that example later in the meeting and he is welcome to do so.</p></speech>

I want to go back for a moment to the hostility dimension and the aspect of the matter about which Dr. Taylor has spoken.  One needs to be able to prove motivation and that is one of the key difficulties because proving motivation is the problem with all of this.  It always struck me that one of the things we are dealing with here, as has been mentioned in the submissions, is that this is about aggravated incidents.  It is about an attack or incident which is clearly illegal anyway and that an aggravating part of it is that the perpetrator is using a racial or sectarian slur, or whatever, while committing the illegal act and, therefore, there is clear evidence that the perpetrator is acting out of hate.  However, hate speech, in itself, without a physical attack on, or violation of, somebody, is also something we must recognise, as was mentioned earlier.  Such an act can cause as much harm to a victim as a physical attack, in many cases.  I know that from speaking to people from the Travelling community and people of different ethnicity across the country who find such acts hurtful and horrible.  It can have a long-term effect on them.  Are we prepared to accept that we must prove, in some way, the hostility dimension?  Is it possible to do it in a context where there is not another clear violation of a person's rights?</p></speech>

He summarised the situation very well.  One of the challenges is that although it is very laudable to bring incitement to hatred and hate crime into one overall Bill, they have quite distinct features.  With incitement to hatred, the speech is the offence in itself, whereas, as the Deputy has correctly pointed out, in hate crime, there is a base criminal offence, such as assault, and the hate dimension is an aggravation, if, for example, a hostile slur is used at the time.  Speech on its own is the offence for incitement to hatred while hate crime involves a base criminal offence that is aggravated by the hate dimension.  That makes it quite challenging.</p><p> I am firmly of the view, based on my experience and research, that a practical way through the regular hate crime is by accommodating the demonstration of hostility and accepting that as a valid test of proof.  It makes motivation real because it gives one a standard to judge it by.  It gives one an empirical actual reality.  That is why I believe that the demonstration test is valid.</p><p> I am not an expert on incitement to hatred.  Many of the provisions that are proposed strike me as reasonable in terms of incitement to hatred.  I would particularly commend the proposal to introduce a test of recklessness into the incitement provisions.  I think that is a significant improvement on what existed before.  However, I share the valid point made by Mr. Collins about political discourse and what legitimate parameters can be and could be considered to be placed around hateful political discourse.  I do not consider myself an expert on the incitement part of the Bill.  My expertise rests in the regular hate crime area more. </p></speech>

Parity of esteem and everything else was very carefully placed in the Good Friday Agreement.  Some of that legislation has been enacted partially but a lot of it has yet to be enacted.  One of the difficulties we have within the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the arrangements in the North of Ireland is because sectarianism is clearly one of the big issues and continues to be the big issue.  That is one of the reasons there has been resistance from almost every level of society.  With such a divided society it has been difficult to bring in the kind of legislation that would work and set up the grounds of equality that we seek to achieve.  I take the point clearly that we do not want to have a situation where we have different standards on the one island.  That point has been well made but perhaps others have a view on the matter.</p> <p>  I believe that we need to be removing things with great caution.  We do not want to be in a situation where we inhibit or in any way restrict people's freedom of speech or where we remove or in any way smother civil discourse.

The first eight paragraphs deal with what is going to be brought in, in Northern Ireland, to address equality and human rights.  Paragraph 9 is entitled "Comparable Steps by the Irish Government" and goes on to state that the measures brought forward by the Irish Government in the areas of human rights and equality will "ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland".  In my considered view, the hate crime Bill, as published, falls short of the commitment to at least an equivalent level of protection because in the North, the legal provisions on hate crime allow for proof based on demonstration of hostility or motivation.  Here in the Republic, if this Bill goes ahead unchanged, it only provides for proof on the basis of motivation.  Therefore, hate crime victims in the Republic will not have got equivalence of protection.  In addition, hate crime victims here will face a more challenging, more complex and a higher legal threshold.  Also, hate crime victims here will be less likely to get full justice in the Republic than in the North.  I do not think that is in keeping with the spirit of the substance.</p></speech>

With respect to the incitement provisions, we need to be very cautious when we carve out an exception to freedom of expression.  We know that there are some issues with the application and implementation of the 1989 Act and it needs some work.  Perhaps amending the existing Act is better than repealing and replacing it with this inherently inconsistent legislation.</p> <p>  With respect to the Good Friday Agreement, it is of course the case that in Northern Ireland there are no aggravated offences.  On one argument we have much stronger protections and much stronger legislation here, having aggravated offences, because in Northern Ireland it is simply an aggravated sentencing provision.  There is nothing to stop us having a similarly broad aggravated sentencing provision.  We can do that.  That will not go on the criminal record of the individual.  That will not affect their future employment history.  What is presented in the legislation is a dual model.  So what we would say is have a narrow model used in the aggravated offence and then have a much broader model in the sentencing provision, which can be exactly the same as Northern Ireland if that is what legislators want and that is certainly a commendable approach to take.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Carroll MacNeill, what is really dangerous and the Law Commission cautioned this with respect to introducing legislation, is that if one has a broad framework it is incredibly damaging to reduce that framework, to contract it and remove protections.  What we would advocate is to build on what the Law Commission says.  Introduce a narrow model, particularly with the offences, then build it after five years if there are insufficient convictions.  If one feels that the court has interpreted the motivation requirement too narrowly, and we do not know how they are going to interpret it, then review it after five years.  One cannot introduce broad legislation and then say that it is too broad, and say that all those things that we called hate crimes before we actually do not think they are and we are going to narrow it.  As the Law Commission said, that sends a very damaging message to society and victims, which is why we advocate the dual model, so a narrow, broad and incremental approach. </p></speech>

One of the issues is that the incitement to hatred and hate speech are part of the same Bill, which has confused a lot of people.  The fact that the consultation that was done on this Bill was exclusively limited to hate speech has also added to the confusion.</p> <p>  Nasc is part of Coalition Against Hate Crime Ireland.  One of the recommendations that it made, which was by 18 NGOs and civil society groups, as well as academics who work in this area, was for consideration to be given to separating the incitement to hatred or hate speech element versus the hate crime element.  That would, hopefully, avoid some of the confusion between the two distinct parts of the legislation.  Even the name of the legislation does not reflect the fact that there are two different parts of the legislation.  The Bill is entitled the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill but actually it is hate crime and incitement to hatred or hate speech.  That would assist with public understanding of the Bill.   </p></speech>

I lean more towards motivation but I can also see the problems with it.  It is very difficult.  I want to understand why those semantics are so important in respect of the legislation.</p><p> Demonstrations of hostility begin very much as demonstrations of facility in the broader sense, but because of differences, whether they concern social class, minority groups or race, the race element is brought later to an already existing argument.  Is hatred the motivation of somebody with low educational attainment or is it a lack of understanding of the terms he or she uses and their impact?  I ask for a little insight into why the differentiation is so important.</p></speech>

In effect, when we talk about the dual model, we are talking about being able to address hate crime through two different means.  One is the creation of these new offences.  If somebody is convicted of one of these new offences, that person will have the label of "hate crime offender" on his or her criminal record.  That will appear when the person is vetted by the Garda.  We know from research we did with Professor Ross MacMillan that this will impact, additional to a criminal record, upon the way that person is viewed by the rest of society, including as a neighbour and a potential employee.</p> <p>  The other method we have of dealing with hate crimes through this Bill, and we commend the fact that it includes this dual model, which is appropriate, is the aggravated sentencing measure that will lead to enhanced penalties.  If somebody is convicted of an assault, for example, that person is convicted of an assault.  It is not a hate-aggravated assault, but there is an enhanced penalty because of the hate element that is associated with the crime.</p> <p>  In both cases, the offender will receive an enhanced penalty and we are marking out that hate element as unacceptable to us as a society.  Where we are talking about the offences, the person will also get the label of hate crime offender, which will be on his or her record and will have significant impacts upon his or her life chances.  We are asking committee members to think about whether they want the same threshold in place in both cases - when somebody receives an enhanced penalty and when somebody receives an enhanced penalty and the label "hate crime offender".  Do they want to use the same threshold?  Does the committee want it to be the same for persons who commit a crime against somebody because they have decided to act out of their prejudice against that person on the basis of his or her characteristics, as for persons who commit a crime, for example, for financial motivation, and in the course of committing that crime used an admittedly harmful slur?  Does the committee want those persons in those two cases to be treated in the same way?</p> <p>  The Bill as it has been created offers the possibility of treating those individuals differently.  It could be that we only consider the case of a person where we can prove the crime was wholly or partially motivated - it does not have to be wholly motivated and there can also be financial motivation - and it is also in evidence, that he or she decided, at least in part, to commit that crime because that person decided to act out his or her prejudice against an individual due to that individual's characteristics.  It would then acquire the label of "hate crime offender" as well as the additional penalty.</p> <p>  Do we also want that to be the case for the person who committed the crime for no reason other than a financial motivation, but in the course of committing it used a tool that is available to us because we live in a society that is racist, homophobic, transphobic and ableist, and deployed that tool against an individual but did not commit the crime for that reason?  It seems to me the Senator has a very clear appreciation of those differences.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address that issue. </p></speech>

We have all commented on the need for an exemption not to be included for, say, political discourse.  We have all made some reference to that, but we have not got into what that means and why an exemption would exist in those spaces.  I understand some arguments in respect of universities, topics that might be discussed there and all the freedom of speech stuff, but it is not freedom of speech if that becomes an actual hate crime or hate speech.  Why are we carving that out?  It would be great if Ms Hurley could comment on that.</p></speech>

We are very concerned about the defence, specifically, for incitement in the context of political discourse.  We argue that the same probably also applies to academic discourse.  There is no definition of what makes a genuine and reasonable contribution, which is very worrying.  We know from the way the Bill is worded that this political discourse must refer to speech outside the Oireachtas because the Oireachtas is protected separately.</p> <p>  We also know, and Mr. Collins and other Pavee Point representatives will be able speak to this as well, that the lives of people from migrant and ethnic minority communities, such as Travellers and Roma, become the subject of elections.  We have seen, particularly in some of our EU counterparts, how nasty and simply racist some of that discourse has been, especially around asylum seekers whose lives are now almost seen as inherently political.  We are very concerned about that type of exemption proceeding in its current breadth.  We hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Ruane for raising the question of firewalls, which is relevant to all of us.  I will put this Bill in a little context because if we look at reports from the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, we see increased levels of reporting of racist abuse and racially motivated attacks.</p><p>There is a growing, sinister and worrying trend towards extremism and hate-motivated speech, as well as a nasty, aggressive and concerning attempt to deliberately tear apart the fabric of society, point people out and target them.  I suspect that Pavee Point would say this has been going on for a long time and has been affecting the Traveller community for a long time.  We are seeing it in a much more open way now.  As a society and as legislators, we have to respond to this.  The action plan against racism, which many speakers referred to, is useful and will be important in ensuring we are brought together again while people try to pull apart the fabric of society.  We also need to ensure people stop pulling us apart, which is where I see this legislation coming in.</p><p> I will pick up on the point on which Senator Ruane finished, namely, the use of political and academic discourse as a defence.  Mr. Collins also raised it.  Travellers have been on the receiving end of racist abuse in elections.  I understand and share many of Mr. Collins's concerns in relation to that wide exemption.  I understand the need to strike a balance with freedom of expression.  Ms Hurley discussed that point.  I ask Dr. Schweppe and Dr. Haynes to respond to that issue as well.</p></speech>

I cannot think of a single circumstance in which it would be appropriate in any academic content to utter language which incites hatred.  This is not hate speech or people saying nasty things about groups of people.  This is speech which incites hatred.  Is academic discourse Dr. Haynes and I having a cup of coffee or me speaking to my class?  Is it me writing in academic work?  It is not defined.  I cannot think of a single circumstances under which me inciting hatred could in any way be justified or excused, which are the ways in which we frame defences.  In the same way, there are no circumstances I can think of where it would be appropriate, justified or excused for a politician to incite hatred, and the standard of speech required in this criminal offence is incredibly high.  There are no circumstances in which we should incite hatred.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Ms Hurley that this is really not a criminal justice hate crime Bill but a criminal justice incitement to hatred and hate crime, and incitement to genocide, Bill.  We need to be really careful about what we are doing here.  What the incitement to hatred provisions in head 3 do is broaden out what is in the 1989 Act through the definition of "hatred" and the inclusion of the recklessness test, on which I am not as keen as Dr. Taylor.  The Bill broadens out and expands the scope of what we understand by incitement to hatred but then provides these really broad defences.  This means I cannot imagine a circumstance in which it would be at all possible to secure a conviction because somebody could simply say he or she was engaging in political discourse when he or she produced a pamphlet or made a comment on social media or in a lecture.  People could argue they are a politician, or not even a politician but speaking in a political context, or that the speech in question was political speech and, therefore, they have an absolute exemption and can incite hatred all they want.  We need to look back at the 1989 Act.  I acknowledge it has flaws but maybe just a tweaking of the 1989 Act or a reworking of elements of it is what is required rather than the introduction of this, as I said, inherently inconsistent provision in head 3.</p></speech>

As she said, it is incredibly ambiguous what political discourse and what academic discourse might entail.  An awful lot of research, not just internationally but also in a domestic context, provides evidence that incitement occurs, particularly in the political sphere.  Irish research demonstrates precisely what Mr. Collins was saying about anti-Traveller discourse in the political sphere in Ireland.  Internationally, transphobic discourse often happens in the academic sphere, which can be used as a platform for transphobic discourse.  I agree on both counts.</p></speech>

I had a difficulty recently with the lack of statistical analysis on sexual offences complaints.  Dr. Taylor went into great detail about surveys and statistics on the percentage of criminal complaints where there was evidence of racial bias or hatred.  Are there any such statistics based on complaints in Ireland?  Mr. Collins might be able to outline whether there are statistical data about complaints to GSOC or criminal complaints made by members of the Traveller community which had a racial element and did not proceed to prosecution or conviction perhaps because of inherent bias in the system.  Are any such data available?  Has Mr. Collins come across, for example, any cases involving assault, the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or public order crimes where hate crime had been identified as an aggravating factor in sentencing?  Is that information available?  That is my only question.</p> <p>  The UK is a much more diverse society and the British seem to be way ahead of us in analysing complaints and prosecutions by age, gender, etc.  Is there any such information available either from the Central Statistics Office or the Garda on these types of complaints and offences?</p></speech>

I am not aware of any official data from Ireland.  Mr. Collins spoke about the evidence we have of houses that have been burned or vandalised when Travellers or members of the Roma community were about to move into an area.  There have been no convictions in any of the cases he named.</p><p>The EU Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, in 2020 did a survey looking at hate-motivated harassment in Europe.  Irish Travellers had the third highest rate out of all the countries surveyed at 52%.  We also saw in the FRA survey, as well as in some UK research, that the reality is that hate crimes against Travellers and Roma are rarely reported.  That is down to distrust of authorities and the response to such reports.  In the UK they found that even when they did report these crimes, there was a very low level of response to the crimes due to institutional racism.  We touched on it a little bit in our opening statement but the legislation alone will not be enough to respond to hate speech and hate crime against Travellers and Roma but also against other protected categories and that we need special measures to be introduced in conjunction with the legislation to make sure that we address the wider issues in society around racism, prejudice and looking at what kind of mechanisms are required in our institutions to make sure that the legislation is capable of being implemented as well.  Perhaps Mr. Collins might want to add something.</p></speech>

All that is totally accurate.  We know anecdotally that the level of hate speech and rhetoric and hate crime directed at Travellers and Roma is significant.  There is also some evidence in the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, study of hate-motivated attacks.  It is significant but as Ms Liston has said, it is also hugely under-reported for reasons of lack of trust and lack of confidence that it will be taken seriously or investigated and dealt with effectively and so on.  We need to develop mechanisms whereby Travellers and Roma can feel confident in reporting such incidents and where such incidents will be fully and effectively investigated.  I deliberately stated at the very beginning that this Bill, which will become legislation after it goes through the various Stages, needs to be victim-centred and it needs to give an effective legal remedy to those who experience hate speech and hate crime, because the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act did not do that.</p> <p>  It is correct to state that it is so difficult to prove intent.  I am aware of a court case in Kerry a couple of years ago where a man was brought to court.  He admitted that he posted a message in Facebook that baby knackers should be used as bait for sharks.  He was identified and brought to court and he admitted posting it, but the judge dismissed the case because intent to incite hatred could not be established.  I am not an academic or a human rights lawyer but I imagine that if the demonstration test was applied in that instance, a conviction would be secured.  I may be wrong in that but it is a layperson&rsquo;s opinion.  The motivation test is important but it is essential that the demonstration test be included in the Bill when it is finalised.</p> <p>  People frequently and unnecessarily conflate two issues.  This is not about curbing freedom of expression.  We all know that freedom of expression and free speech also carry with them certain responsibilities and obligations.  As we all know, free speech does not entitle anyone to incite hatred or violence towards marginalised or disadvantaged communities.  As it has happened in other jurisdictions, it is not beyond the ingenuity of our lawmakers and drafters to develop a piece of law that protects the right to free speech, which is essential in any democratic society, but also protects vulnerable groups from hate speech and hate crime.  It is essential that the Bill is victim-centred but I also acknowledge the rights of defendants.  A balance must be struck when the legislation is finally realised.</p></speech>

I have heard much of what has been said and it answered many of the questions I had.</p> <p>   I will address four points.  Specifically, do any of the witnesses have a difficulty with the evidential threshold, as laid out in the heads of the Bill?  I will focus specifically on the concept of somebody being motivated by prejudice and the definition of protected characteristics.  Is it too loose?  Does it allow too much room for manoeuvre in terms of what constitutes something that is motivated by prejudice, which I do not think is defined in the Bill?  I know that the protected characteristics are.  Does anybody have any difficulty with the evidential bar that would be in place to prosecute an offence under the Bill?</p></speech>

I know from practice that Senator Ward might be more familiar with how the term would be interpreted.  It is interesting that he raised the question of &ldquo;protected characteristics&rdquo;.  Professor Haynes and I are reasonably happy with the approach that is taken.  We think that having a stated framework for how it was determined which characteristics were included in the legislation and which were not would be helpful.  Cognisant of the concerns that Dr. Taylor has expressed with respect to disability hate crime &ndash; we know that even with the demonstration test in England and Wales, it is extremely difficult to get a conviction for a disability hate crime - we have proposed the use of the term "contempt" in the definition of hate.  As Senator Ward says, the legislation uses just the word &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;, whereas we would advocate for a broader definition there to include hostility bias, prejudice, bigotry or contempt.  By using the "contempt" definition, which was recommended to us by Inclusion Ireland in our Out of the Shadows research in 2015 and then also recommended by Judge Desmond Marrinan in the Northern Ireland hate crime review committee report, we think that may go some way to address the concerns people have.  While some of the manifestations of disablist hate crime are not driven by prejudice, we think that if we include "contempt" that may allow for a broader framework to address that particular manifestation of hate crime.  I hope I have answered the Senator's question.  He should let me know if I have not.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Schweppe very much.  Just knowing how this kind of legislation is being applied in the UK at the other end of the scale, in terms of the trivialisation of it, sections 29 to 32, inclusive, of the Crime and Disorder Act in the UK contain similar provisions.  I am aware of instances where, for example, somebody is arrested for something like a public order offence akin to our section 6 or 6A in this context and calls the arresting officer a Welsh prat, as opposed to a prat.  Having called the arresting officer a Welsh prat creates essentially what is referred to as a racially aggravated offence and therefore it enters into a much higher tariff.  For example, if we look at head 6 of the proposed section 6A of the public order act, does anybody have concern that this legislation might be used?  We understand the grave issues that it deals with but is there a danger that it is also used at the other end of the scale to make something which is quite trivial in my view more serious than it needs to be?</p></speech>

In England and Wales, they use what is called the demonstration model.  Dr. Taylor will know whether that is the first or second limb of the test.  The legislation provides that where an offence is motivated by hatred, hostility or where hatred or hostility is demonstrated during the course of the offence, it becomes a racially aggravated offence.</p><p>I am not aware of the example of the particular slur to which Senator Ward referred and I am not aware of that case.  Certainly, there are those examples that Professor Haynes discussed where offenders will use a racist slur during the course of offence that had nothing to do with the protected characteristic identity of the individual.  However, they use that slur as a tool during the course of the offence.  I share the concerns of the Senator as to whether that low threshold would be appropriate.  Thankfully, I think it is not present in the general scheme of the Bill. </p></speech>

I ask this question on behalf of somebody who has been in contact with me.  I wonder about the denial aspect and the free speech aspect that comes with it.  Personally, I am satisfied, but is there a concern that this could be extended?  The head specifically refers to the definition under Article 11.  I am happy with that.  The person who has contacted me is wondering if this should be extended, which is a better way to put it, to include misinformation about, for example, vaccinations.  I know it is quite a different category.  Is there room in this Bill maybe for another head - it would have to be another head anyway - to extend that to cover, for example, misinformation?  We use vaccines as an example in the obvious current context.  However, at a different time of the year there might be something else going on where misinformation could cause serious harm.  Does anybody feel that there is room in this Bill to extend the offences or the context of them to include something like that?</p></speech>

However, to clarify, this person was specifically taking as an example suspicion around vaccines, because it might be attributed to certain groups more than others, such as people who are not Irish and may not have the same trust of the systems here that Irish people do.  This person was concerned that that might be used in that way.  I do not think it fits into the Bill as currently drafted.  That is the context in which the question was asked.</p></speech>

The person who expressed those opinions could also use the political context discourse defence.  This would get us back to where we started from.  It is important to determine what the speech is inciting and against what or whom.  What group is the speech inciting hatred against?  Is the speech inciting hatred against people who vaccinate or people who do not vaccinate, or is it inciting hatred against a group because they are from a particular community?  Does the Senator see what I mean?</p></speech>

Senator Ward&rsquo;s point is good.  There might be misinformation about a group of people from a particular country, or all people from a country.  One can think of lots of political contexts where that could be used.  It might be important.  It sometimes happens in academic discourse, whether inadvertently or deliberately, as well as political and social discourse, so it could be important.</p> <p>  It is always interesting for the committee when there are different perspectives on the technicality of law.  It is important and I know it is a difficult forum to try to go through some of that.  It is interesting that everybody is coming from a point of trying to create the maximum protection for victims and the most enforceable, robust law.  I know from my perspective as a spokesperson on equality, having worked with Migrants Rights Centre Ireland and Pavee Point over many years, and having seen the difficulties they face on behalf of their communities.  That is where we are all coming from. </p> <p>  I wanted to give Professor Haynes and Dr. Schweppe an opportunity to talk about the research that they had done.  I think they said that they found in their research that people would be uncomfortable living next door to somebody who had been convicted of a hate crime.  I understand that from the perspective of the person who is convicted.  However, it also speaks to how Irish people view the activity of hate-related speech and hate-related crime.  Could they give the committee a bit more information on that? </p> <p>  Earlier, Dr. Taylor gave an example from England and Wales.  It was helpful in setting the context.  It is clearly a different scenario from the one that Senator Ward presented about being a "prat" or a "Welsh prat", as it were.  The example Dr. Taylor gave was arguably much more serious.  Perhaps Dr. Taylor would like to give the committee another example if there were time.  </p></speech>

We conducted the survey with Professor Ross MacMillan through Am&aacute;rach Research on a nationally representative survey of the general population.  We asked a question of the respondents as to how comfortable they would be having somebody with a conviction for vandalising private property as their neighbour.  We picked that specific offence to give people something that they could relate to.  Some 14% were either comfortable or very comfortable.  However, when the same question was asked specifying that the vandalism of private property had included a hate element or as having been a hate crime, only 8% were comfortable.  That is approximately half the number of people being comfortable living beside somebody who has been convicted of a hate crime, compared to a non-aggravated version of the same offence.  There is an additional penalty associated with the hate offender label on top of the criminal record.  Similarly then, we asked people whether they would be comfortable living with somebody convicted of an offence as their neighbour and then whether they would be comfortable living beside somebody who has been convicted of a hate-aggravated version of the same offence.  We saw that 33% were uncomfortable having someone who committed an ordinary crime as a neighbour, but this figure increased to 50% being uncomfortable when the person had committed a hate crime.</p></speech>

I do not know if I am correct, but it seems to me from the presentation that it comes to it, possibly, from the convicted person&rsquo;s perspective.  What I am much more concerned about is the original victim, and the crime not happening in the first instance, in the context of trying to structure the legislation.  Am I wrong in picking that up?  I appreciate what Dr. Haynes is trying to say and we do not want to stigmatise people indefinitely about having a conviction of that nature.  I understand that but does that not speak to how Irish people view hate-based activity in the first instance?  Should we not take the strongest possible approach here to this legislation as a committee?</p></speech>

For example, 78% of the respondents to the survey were of the view that in the last five years, the level of hate crime in Ireland had increased.  Of the remainder, only 4% felt that it had decreased and only 19% felt that it had remained unchanged.  Certainly, there is an indication that people regard hate crime as being a problem in Irish society.  People are supportive of approaches to dealing with it through the criminal justice system.  However, we have to ask, when we are dealing with hate crime through the criminal justice system, what is the outcome we want to have.  Is the outcome to deter hate crime?  Is the outcome to ensure that re-offending does not occur?  We might, for example, create a range of hate crime offences with a low threshold and that might create a large number of people who have been labelled as hate crime offenders.</p><p>That will conflate those who committed an offence because they acted out of prejudice against an individual with those who committed an offence for a reason which had nothing to do with prejudice they might hold or act against, but used, for example, a slur in the course of that offence.  How will that impact on what we now see in terms of the public reproach for hate crime offences?  Will the public buy in to hate crime legislation which treats those who have committed crimes out of prejudice in the same way as it does those who committed crimes, for example, for financial motivation and used a slur in the course of that offence?  How will that affect the public buy-in to the impact we are trying to achieve?</p><p> The creation of hate crime offences will impact on public awareness of hate crime as an issue.  It will send a clear message to the public that we as a society reject the targeting of individuals because of who they are or their identity.  The question is whether that deterrent effect will be sustained if the legislation is so broad that we end up with large numbers of convictions, for example, for public order offences where a slur is used in the course of commissioning the offence or other offences which occur for reasons outside of the decision to act out of prejudice.  I have concerns about-----</p></speech>

How do we set that up in a way that makes this Bill do what is set out in its provisions?  How will the Bill be reflected in our structures?  Do the witnesses think there is a need to set up specialist hate crime units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  What type of training will be needed?  Do we need performance indicators at that level of reporting?  What about the handling of discriminatory incidents and the levels of satisfaction with the police?  Institutions can have a huge amount of prejudice, racial bias and all of that.  Reporting a racial incident to the police can be an issue.  The Traveller community often struggles in its relationships with the police and how it is viewed by the police.  Maybe Ms Liston and Mr. Collins can comment on what they feel the relationship will be like and what needs to happen so that minority groups like Travellers and Roma will engage.  Do we need racial awareness training or specialised people to take complaints involving hate crime or incitement to hatred?</p></speech>

It is as she mapped it out.  Pavee Point is in agreement that this legislation cannot exist in a silo.  There need to be additional special measures in conjunction with it.  For the reasons the Senator mentioned, we know this legislation will only be effective if people come forward to report and are supported through that process.  Travellers and Roma often have huge fear and mistrust of authorities, from the Garda through to the Judiciary.  How do we address that to make this legislation effective?</p> <p>  We will need measures like, as the Senator mentioned, training on hate crime and hate speech for all professionals involved.  We should also look at what other training is needed in conjunction with that, such as anti-racism and anti-discrimination training for garda&iacute; and other professionals involved.  If we have a public awareness campaign about the introduction of this legislation, we should consider all the protected categories in its provisions and how we target the public campaign so people are aware.  I work on the Roma programme.  How do we get this information to people whose first language is not English or who have language and literacy issues?  It is about thinking in a more holistic way.</p> <p>  The question was asked earlier about the data we have on the impacts of hate crime and hate speech in Ireland.  We do not really have any.  As we set this up, we need to think about how we form the baseline data around how this affects the protected categories.  Once we have those data, how will we monitor what happens as the legislation is rolled out?  What targets can be set?  As Dr. Haynes said, I hope it is about reducing the incidences of hate crime, rather than just looking at what happens when somebody is convicted.  How do we set targets to reduce these incidences?</p> <p>  I think Mr. Collins mentioned that we are looking at the national action plan against racism that is due to be published.  How can we combine the two to make sure there are people with specific responsibility and accountability for how this is looked at and not forget about the institutional and structural racism and discrimination that impacts at every level on how most of these protected categories interact with the law and with most services.  There is much work to be done to make sure it is effective.</p></speech>

We need a national equality strategy that encompasses awareness-raising, training, getting staffing structures in place to reflect the diversity of the communities served throughout the criminal justice system, monitoring and reporting.  It needs to be a whole-of-society, whole-of-institution approach.  The criminal justice system is the far end of public policy.  It mops up the mess after a lot of other stages in earlier public policy have failed.</p> <p>  I encourage the legislators to be creative and bold, and not to run with an unduly cautious or incremental approach.  It has taken 32 years to come back to review the incitement to hatred legislation that was introduced in 1989.  I would not be confident, given the history of legislation in this and other areas, that we will have a review in five years.  I think this is a once in a generation opportunity to do the right thing and do it in a balanced, appropriate, proportionate way for victims, wider society and defendants.</p></speech>

I do not want to set up any kind of hierarchy of oppression or exclusion, but I have no doubt that if that data was desegregated by ethnicity we would get a very different picture in respect of the Traveller community.  I do not think we would get the same level of repulsion because other reports suggest that in the region of 90% of the population would not want a Traveller family living beside them, would not want a Traveller marrying into their family, etc.  That is not in any way to set up a hierarchy of oppression, but rather to reflect the reality that my community experiences on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  As already stated, I am not a an academic or human rights lawyer, but when I hear people speak, it is clear that there is a fundamental question emerging that needs to be answered and that competing rights need to be reconciled between victims of hate speech and crime and perpetrators.  It is important to remind ourselves in this context of the purpose of the proposed legislation.  First and foremost, the priority has to be to protect marginalised communities that are vulnerable to hate speech and crime.  The rights of perpetrators have to be respected and taken into account, but, first and foremost, our primary concern and that of the proposed legislation is to protect vulnerable communities from hate speech and crime.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming before the committee.  He gets to have the last word.  I thank all of the members who participated.  Some of them had to go back to the Chamber for other engagements.  I thank all of the witnesses for coming before the committee.  We have had an exceptionally good engagement.  I thank all of the organisations, witnesses and those who made written submissions.  Not all were called to give oral testimony, but I thank everybody who participated in the process.</p> <p>  This concludes our formal engagement on this matter for the purposes of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I propose that we publish all of the statements on the committee's website.  This means that anybody who did not get a chance to complete an opening statement will have it published on the website, pending the agreement of the committee.  I believe the remaining members consent to that.  It is agreed.  We will do that.  It will provide people with another opportunity to learn more about the process.</p> <p>  It remains for me to thank all of the witnesses for their engagement in these discussions.  They were very illustrative and there is a lot of work to be done.  It is a difficult matter a that will need careful scrutiny, not just following this session but right through the passage of the Bill, wherever it lands.  I again thank everyone for this extremely important consideration.</p> <p>  We will adjourn until Wednesday, 24 November, when we will meet for a stakeholder engagement on the topic of minorities engaging with the justice system.  Perhaps that may be of interest to some of the witnesses who attended this meeting.  They are very welcome to tune in next week if they wish to follow that debate.</p></speech>

Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p> <p>  Today, we convene to continue our discussion on the recently published report of the Commission on Pensions.  We are all aware that the State pension is valued by all of society and it is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at preventing pensioners from falling into poverty, and we want to make sure that this remains the case into the future.</p> <p>  The Commission on Pensions chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily was an independent body comprising pension experts, academics and workers' representative groups.  As Members will be aware, the committee made its own submission to the commission with 18 specific recommendations.  The commission has completed its work and a comprehensive report was published in October.  The report stated that the current State pension is not sustainable in its current form and changes are needed.  The population, as we know, is set to increase from 5 million currently to over 6 million by 2050, which is something that we need to plan for in order to ensure that older people have an adequate pension and a safety net to keep them out of poverty.</p> <p>  There will also be fewer working age people supporting each older person.  Currently, 4.5 working-age people support each person over the age of 65 but this is set to halve to 2.3 working-age people per person over the age of 65 by 2051.  It is important to note that the proportion of older people in receipt of a fully Exchequer-funded non-contributory State pension is decreasing steadily and will continue to do so.  Eventually everybody will have paid some entitlement to a State contributory pension into the future.  There are clear challenges in ensuring the sustainability of State pensions for future generations.  This has been known for many years and confirmed in the report of the Commission on Pensions. </p> <p>  The Government has asked this committee for our views on the recommendations set out in the report.  This follows on the from the committee's remit and our recent submission to the Commission on Pensions.  In this regard, I welcome Ms Josephine Feehily, Chairperson, Commission on Pensions, and Ms Roma Burke, who is the Chairperson of the technical subgroup, Commission on Pensions.  I also welcome Mr. Tim Duggan, Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Alan Flynn, principal officer, Department of Social Protection.  All of the witnesses are very welcome here this morning.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded that full parliamentary privilege only applies to those participating from within the precincts of Leinster House.  Witnesses participating remotely should exercise caution in terms of their utterances accordingly and be attentive to the direction of the Chair in this regard.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Tim Duggan to make his opening remarks, which will be followed by a presentation to the committee by Ms Josephine Feehily.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee very much for this invitation to discuss the Report of the Commission on Pensions.  I apologise for not being able to attend in person.</p> <p>  As I am sure the committee is aware, the Department is required by law to conduct an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund every five years.  The last such review, reflecting the financial position of the fund at the end of 2015, was completed in October 2017.  Among its projections were that annual shortfalls were estimated to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population starts to have an impact and that in the absence of action to tackle it, the deficit will increase to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  Those are annual figures.  Since then, certain findings of the 2015 review were examined again in preparation for the work of the Commission on Pension's work.  In short, this examination confirmed the significant deficits that the fund is expected to experience.  We are now finalising preparations to conduct another review for completion in 2022.</p> <p>  It is clear to the Department that considerable change is under way in the demographic make-up in Ireland whereby, thankfully, people are living longer, healthier lives, which means that action is required to secure the viability of the Social Insurance Fund in the near and distant future and, by extension, to protect the current contributory State pension system which is, as the Chairman said, the bedrock of pension provision in Ireland.  In that context, the law had been changed to increase the State pension age to 67 this year and to 68 in 2028, preparations were under way to change the system from the yearly average approach that applied for the past 60 years to a total contributions approach.  In addition, consideration was being given to options for increasing funding.  This resulted in considerable debate during election 2020 about State pensions and, in particular, about the imminent increase in the State pension age.  Arising from that, the Government committed in its programme for Government to establish a Commission on Pensions to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State pension system and the Social Insurance Fund and to defer any changes in the State pension age pending its analysis and report.</p> <p>  The commission was established this time last year.  It was an independent body and, as stated by the Chairman, its membership comprised 11 people who were pension experts, academics, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.</p> <p>  As a result of the State pension age deferral, the Department estimated that the increase in expenditure in 2021 on State pensions would be &euro;221 million, that this would increase to an additional &euro;453 million next year and that the figure would continue to increase every year thereafter.  The actual additional expenditure to the end of September 2021 was &euro;207 million.  It is now expected to total approximately &euro;275 million by the end of the year.  That increase is also likely to be reflected in future years.  As a result, the additional expenditure will actually be likely to be in the region of more than &euro;500 million next year and will get higher every year from then on.  This shows clearly how the demographic impacts on the State pension are real and how the sums involved are large and grow quickly, even when relatively simple decisions are made or proposed alleviating actions are postponed.</p> <p>  This underscores the need for very careful analysis of policy options and positions and highlights how the establishment of the Commission on Pensions was necessary to look at the State pension system in the round and provide independent advice to Government, first, on the options it has and, second, on a recommended course of action.  The commission, as referred to by the Chairman, has completed its work and its report was published on 7 October 2021.  It is a comprehensive report that takes account of an extensive consultation process, an examination of international approaches, and an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections.  It has unambiguously established that the current State pension system, as it stands, is not sustainable into the future and that change is needed.</p> <p>  In this regard, the commission has set out a wide range of recommendations.  Some of these are designed to make the system fairer, some to mitigate cost pressures and some to increase the funding of the system.  In the interests of older people and future generations of older people, the far-reaching recommendations in the report need to be considered very carefully.  With that in mind, in its initial consideration of the report at its meeting on 7 October, the Government decided first: to ask the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for its view with respect to the PRSI changes recommended by the commission by end February 2022, which is in keeping with that commission's terms of reference; to refer the report to this committee for its views; and to refer it to the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and investment for consideration over the coming months.  It is expected that this will be done over a number of meetings.</p> <p>  Taking all of this into account, the Minister intends to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to the Government by end of March 2022.  In this regard, the Minister is looking forward to hearing this committee&rsquo;s view, at its convenience, and I hope this morning&rsquo;s discussion will be helpful to it in developing that.</p> <p>  I would like to conclude by saying that there are no policy proposals for the State pension system that cannot be challenged or, equally, that would find universal support.  We need, however, to be realistic here as our State pension system is facing very serious sustainability challenges.  We need to consider the very real consequences of failing to implement essential reforms to fund a sustainable and adequate State pension system.</p> <p>  I would like to compliment and thank Josephine Feehily, who was chair of the Commission on Pensions, Roma Burke, who chaired its technical sub-committee, and their nine other colleagues on the commission on an excellent analysis and report.  My team provided the secretariat to the commission, and I can assure this committee that it was a very busy team indeed such was the intensity of the commission&rsquo;s activities over its eight months.  I will now hand over to Ms Feehily to take the committee through the work of the commission and its recommendations in some detail.  Mr. Flynn and I will be more than happy to assist the committee with any questions it has after that.</p></speech>

Good morning everybody.  I have a long presentation but the committee will be pleased to know that I do not intend to read it all.  I want to give the committee more of a sense of the commission's approach and the reasoning behind the findings rather than necessarily reading them out literally.</p> <p>  The commission considered it very important to say that it is a good thing that older people are living longer and are living healthier, longer lives resulting in there being more older people.  This is a good thing.  Characterising this as a problem and a crisis is not language we like to use, nor is not something we want to contribute to.  It is a challenge that has to be planned for and managed rather than having it characterised as a problem.</p><p>Intergenerational equity was one of the considerations in the commission's terms of reference.  Characterising the fact that there are more older people as a problem gives rise to a real risk of breaking the intergenerational solidarity that we have, and we are very clear that that is not something we want to do.</p><p> With that in mind, beginning with the commission's approach, we had very narrow but focused and specific terms of reference.  They were set within the programme for Government.  When we looked at the programme for Government, we found that a number of elements there, which I will list, and members can read them at their leisure, were already settled Government policy and so we obviously had to take account of them.  The other thing we found when we examined the programme for Government's direction, was that a number of other aspects of pensions had already been given to somebody else, for the want of a better word.  For example, a universal income pilot had already been agreed and was located somewhere else and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare had already been agreed and was located somewhere else.  Focused terms of reference and certain jobs that were already focused elsewhere were very much part of forming our approach to the work.</p><p> After we reviewed those and the terms of reference, we concluded that the most useful thing we could do was contribute to fixing the "system within the system", which was the language that we used to describe it.  We set ourselves the task of identifying the scale of the sustainability challenge.  In that context, we defined fiscal sustainability but also social sustainability as important.  It was not just about money.  We had a lot of contributions from experts.  We had a consultation process where we had in excess of 200 submissions.  Some 80% of them were from individuals.  We had a survey which had more than 1,100 responses, so we had a lot of inputs to our work.  We established a technical group chaired by my colleague, Roma Burke, to help us to establish with some certainty what all the inputs were telling us.  I will hand over to her now because that group gave us an evidence base for the recommendations.  I will come back in to outline the recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roma Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#C00200"><p>In your opening statement, Chairman, you stated that the population of Ireland is currently 5 million and is going to increase to 6 million by 2050.  You also observed that the relative proportion of younger to older people is going to change.  As the population ages, there will be more older people and they will be living longer.  It is great news.  The challenge of that is that at the moment the State pension works on a pay-as-you-go basis.  That means that the current working population supports the State pension paid to older people.  At the moment, there are approximately 4.5 working age people to every older person.  As the population evolves and people gradually get older, that will reduce, so that by 2050 we estimate that the number of working age people to older people is going to drop to just 2.3 for each older person.  This is a big challenge.</p> <p>  When we are looking at a big demographic challenge, we look at big levers to try to address the challenge.  The two big levers available to us are fertility and migration.  The committee found that fertility is quite slow-moving and is unable to react quickly enough to address this very significant challenge.  Another lever is net inward migration.  That can react in a much faster manner in order to address this problem.  Putting it in the context of the total expected population in Ireland in 2050 of 6 million, we would need a working population of 7.2 million people in order to maintain the dependency ratio.  That translates to an extra working population in the order of 3.3 million, over and above the official Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures.  We concluded that in order to maintain the dependency ratio at its current levels, it would require actual fertility and migration rates that would be multiples of the current assumptions.</p> <p>  With more older people and older people living longer, the cost of the State pension is going to increase.  There is going to be twice the number of older people by 2050.  That means that the cost is going to double by 2050.  At the moment, expressed as a percentage of modified gross national income, the cost is 3.8%.  That is going to go up to 7.9% by 2050 and then it will continue to increase and will reach 9% by 2070.  To put it into context, if we were in 2050 today, we would need all of the PRSI income just to pay the State pension.</p> <p>  We looked at how to address the increasing cost of the State pension.  If we can get more people working, that would certainly help to address the challenge, and it does help, but the difficulty with that is that even if we have more people working within the working age population, the fact that the population is ageing in total means that as a proportion of everybody, the number of workers continues to fall.  It is like maintaining a boat on the sea.  You are maintaining your boat, but the tide keeps coming in and it is very hard for the boat as there is not much that the boat can do in that case.</p> <p>  We looked at other ways to address the challenge, such as increasing the State pension age.  We looked at increasing the rate of employment of older people, facilitating them to work longer.  We looked at net inward migration, which I talked about a moment ago.  We also looked at higher economic growth and higher employment.  While all of these levers help to address the challenge, we found that changing the State pension age had the most significant impact.  Notably, helping older people to work also has a fairly significant impact on addressing the challenge.</p> <p>  The State pension has a role in poverty prevention.  We did a lot of work on this.  The committee concluded that the State pension plays a very positive role in reducing poverty among older people.  We have already heard that without the State pension, poverty rates among older people would be in excess of 85%, and that is reduced right down to below 11%.</p> <p>  I will make a few points to help the committee with its discussion today.  There is a range of poverty measures and one of them, which is used quite a lot, looks at poverty in relation to income.  It compares what your income is to what is called an at-risk of poverty measure.  However, the State pension target is pegged against an earnings benchmark &ndash; gross average industrial earnings or a more recent iteration of that.  We must be aware that even if you are targeting an earnings benchmark for your State pension, there is a risk because the formula or the definition of poverty is related to income, but that does not move in the same manner as an earnings-related benchmark.</p> <p>  We then went on to have a look at increasing the State pension.  When the State pension is benchmarked, it gets increased in future in order to give certain benefits such as maintaining people's purchasing power and keeping them out of poverty and so on.  We looked at linking it to price inflation, earnings and other measures.  We must be careful, because if we link it to price inflation, there is a risk that more people can fall into poverty.  If we link it to other measures, there is a risk that the cost could escalate beyond what has been expected.  It requires a careful approach going forward.  That is a whistle-stop tour of what the committee did.  We fed in a series of papers to the commission for consideration.  I will hand back to Ms Feehily to continue.</p></speech>

That attachment is built on certainty.  Certainty is required for all sorts of reasons.  It enables people to plan and to feel confident but it is also important for other aspects of their lives, including working and saving.  We considered that there was a need for transparency and much better communication around the whole issue to avoid surprises and to help people to better understand the issues involved.  We were very much driven by considerations of equity and fairness.  An overarching conclusion was that we should move on funding first rather than on other policy levers.</p><p> Our overall conclusions related to social solidarity.  The attachment of the community to the pension was evident in submissions to the commission not only from pensioners and those soon to be pensioners, but from people right across the different demographics and in work done for us among young people.  It is the view of the commission that, if it is accepted that we want older people to have an adequate pension, everybody should contribute to ensuring that outcome on the basis of social solidarity.  The five key elements of our conclusions and recommendations involve increasing funding through a gradual increase in PRSI, an increase in PRSI for the self-employed, broadening the PRSI base, contributions from the Exchequer and a gradual increase in the pension age.  I will address those various points in the next few slides.</p><p> Based on those five levers, we put together four packages.  We considered a range of options and settled on package 4.  Package 4 uses all of the levers I have mentioned.  With regard to extending the PRSI base, the details of this extension being set out in some detail in the presentation, we excluded its extension to social welfare payments but recommend extending the PRSI base to remove the exemptions currently in place for people aged over 66 and for supplementary pensions.  We do not recommend a universal pension for a range of reasons, which I am happy to discuss if members wish.  The principal reason is that the job is also located somewhere else.  </p><p> I do not expect the members to be able to interpret the graph on slide 9.  It gives a visual sense of what we were about.  The detail is in the report.  The coloured bars represent the elements of the packages.  They show the contribution made to addressing the challenge under each package by the various elements, including funding, a change in the pension age and Exchequer contributions.  The commission is strongly of the view that, if the Government and Parliament choose a different mix for the future policy direction, as they are absolutely entitled to, compensating measures will be needed.  If it is decided to use less of a given measure and to invent a package 5 or a package 6, each of these elements will need to be addressed.  Otherwise, there will be a shortfall.</p><p> On the funding side, we confirmed the pay-as-you-go approach.  This is a structural piece which we think is quite important.  There was some discussion in the committee's meeting last week about the notion of the Social Insurance Fund.  The commission fully understands that this is not technically a fund in the sense that there are pension funds which have been put away for 20 years.  It is a pay-as-you-go fund, almost like a bank account.  We recommended that, within the fund, the funding and costs for pensions should be separated out to make them visible and transparent.  This would mean there would be no risk of it getting confused with other demand-led schemes.  We consider that an important transparency measure.  </p><p> On the payment rates side, the Minister made it clear to us at our first meeting that the Government would not contemplate reducing rates, which is an obvious lever to consider when there is a funding problem.  The commission would not have been inclined towards that view anyway.  We did say that, since the roadmap on social inclusion, there has been a proposal in place with regard to a smoothed earnings approach to benchmarking.  We asked that this be implemented because, if the rate going forward is not known, how can the sums be done?  How can the shortfall be worked out?  We recommended that an independent standing body be put in place to advise the Government on the rates derived from that benchmark each year.  Having done that, the body should then periodically review whether that was the best benchmark in terms of pensioner poverty.  We were very mindful that the risk of poverty is higher for people living alone than for a couple.  We were therefore keen for the Government to continue to increase the living alone allowance at a faster rate than the basic pension, as it did in the recent budget.</p><p> With regard to calculation methods, it has been the policy of a series of Governments to move to a total contributions approach on the basis that it is fairer.  However, this has not been fully implemented.  The commission is basically asking for it to be implemented.  If that is the Government's policy, it should implement it.  Again, how can we know what the shortfall is if the denominators keep changing?  There has been a policy of maintaining the old system, the yearly average approach, and allowing applicants for a pension to take the better of the two options.  That is a recipe for serious cost increases.  If the total contributions approach is fairer, which we believe it is, then the yearly average approach should be gradually removed.  We recommend that people be allowed to calculate which approach is better for them but that, over ten years, the payment under the yearly average approach be reduced by 10% per year so that, at the end of ten years, that option will be off the table.  By then, the total contributions approach will be serving a greater population and more and more people will be getting full pensions, based on the trajectory of employment.  If that is not done, the grounding for calculations in respect of the pensions challenge will be shifting all of the time.  The Government might as well forget about the total contributions approach because there is no point in having it as a policy while implementing something else.</p><p> We recommend that the total contributions approach become the definitive approach.  This is based on 40 years or 2,080 contributions to include ten years of credited contributions and 20 years of home-caring periods.  That policy change with regard to home-caring periods has been really important with regard to the point the Chair made on the increased proportion of pensions being based on the contributory rather than the non-contributory side.</p><p> We also believe that regular PRSI statements should be issued to contributors so that they are aware of how much they are paying and when their pensions are likely to kick in.  If the Government accepts the recommendation to phase in pension age changes, people should be able to see that, based on current policy and so on, they are likely to get their pensions at, for example, 66.75 years of age.  I am aware that the Department will issue pension contributions statements on request.  We are talking about more than that.  We want interpreted statements to be issued rather than just a list.  Again, this comes back to the idea of better communication and no surprises.</p><p> We made a recommendation in respect of carers.  I will not go into it in detail.  We had very specific terms of reference to address.  We came up with a solution which we think achieves the objective of making sure that there is special recognition and a special credited approach for the particular group of people for whom 20 years of caring credits are not enough when they reach pension age.  We also took up a recommendation from Family Carers Ireland.  It told us that it would like to see the establishment of a register of family carers.  This would run across government and not be confined to pensions.</p><p>As we thought it was a good idea, we recommended that the relevant Departments might look at that, so it will be broader than the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> The retirement age on employment contracts was one of the dilemmas that arose from the pension age discussion; there was a gap.  We received many submissions pointing out that people do not necessarily want to retire at 65.  A European directive is also in place.  It is hard work for somebody to challenge it and it requires going to the Workplace Relations Commission and so on.  Equally there are people who want to retire and have the right to retire in their existing contract.  Therefore, it is not as simple as changing everything.  The recommendation is the legislation should allow but not compel an employee to stay in employment until the State pension age.  That is designed to take care of two different groups of people.</p><p> Again, having taken account of submissions, we also felt that the social partners in government and the WRC could issue guidance to employers and workers on how to manage the transition if people want to stay at work.  There are issues with recurring contracts, issues with people who may want to reduce their working hours and so on.  That is a discussion which goes beyond our scope, but we felt that might be the right place for it.</p><p> We then come to the age.  As members of the committee will know we recommended that the age should increase beginning in 2028 at the rate of one quarter per year reaching 67 in 2031, which is ten years' time.  We then recommended it should increase by one quarter every second year reaching 68 in 2039.  It is gradual and much slower.  We felt the gradual approach which removes some of the cliffs and surprises was appropriate.  The table displayed on your screen shows at what year the different age changes would come into being.</p><p> Many people raised the issue of flexible access with us and it is also contained in the programme for Government.  We made a number of recommendations on it.  One is that a person could choose to defer access up to age 70 and receive a cost-neutral increase in their pension.  The second one was that a person whose insurance record was short might continue to contribute in order to establish an entitlement.  The third recommendation is an option for the Government to consider done in conjunction with an age increase.  The commission sees merit in recognising very long PRSI histories by including a provision whereby those who choose to retire at 65 with a very long record of 45 years may receive a full pension.  The reason we say this must be done in conjunction with an age increase is that on its own it is a cost-increasing measure, which would only add to the sustainability challenge.  It certainly has merit in the context of a total flexibility package where the age in general is going up.</p><p> The recommendation on the funding side of PRSI for self-employed has come in for some comment.  The commission was unanimous in this.  I should have said, when discussing the slide about the recommendation on age, that it was not unanimous.  Ten out of the 11 members recommended the age increase; I should have made that clear.  The self-employed PRSI of 4% is the best bargain anywhere for return on investment.  I used to work in social welfare and I remember when it was invented everybody was very excited.  I believe 4% or &pound;102 was the number.  Now 4% or &euro;500 is the floor.  The benefit range was modest.  It covered State pension and widow's pension.  The benefit range has been increased, but the rate has not.</p><p> To maintain equity and fairness relative to other workers, the self-employed PRSI contribution rate needs to increase.  We are very clear and we suggest a steeper increase for self-employed PRSI than we do for class A, which is workers and their employers.  There was a range of views in the commission about how far it should go.  We settled on 10%.  There is an argument for it to go to 11.05%, which is the employers' rate.  There is an argument for it to go to 14%, which is the combined employer and employee rate having regard to the range of benefits.  However, we will leave that to the Minister.  We did not go there, but we debated it at some length.</p><p> We are also recommending an increase in the class A rate for both employers and employees.  This is much more modest and does not need to kick in until after 2030.  We were very mindful not to impact on the labour market by increasing it too soon and too steeply.  It was not necessary in the context of package 4.  Some of the other packages have a steeper and larger increase, particularly if the age is not included.</p><p> In a way, base broadening is not new.  In 2014, PRSI was extended to unearned income on a social solidarity basis in the form of class K, which is payable on income over &euro;100.  It is payable on a class K solidarity basis by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas without entitlement to benefits.  Therefore, it is not a novel idea.  Other than applying it to the social welfare payments themselves, on a social solidarity basis PRSI class K, which is 4% on all income currently subject to PRSI, would be payable by people over 66 and would be payable on existing supplementary pensions - occupational pensions, personal pensions and public sector pensions - by way of a contribution from existing pensioners.  If the community at large wants pensions to be sustainable, adequate and certain, then the community at large ought to contribute to the balancing required.</p></speech>

I very much agree with the values underpinning it - the idea, as Ms Burke set out, that having an ageing population who are living longer is not a bad thing, but providing for that into the future must be underpinned by values of social solidarity and intergenerational solidarity.  I strongly agree with the value system that underpins this piece of work.</p> <p>  I have some broad questions and some more specific questions.  I will begin with the broadest question and this may or may not be useful.  A certain formulation of words occurs several times in the document and it was repeated this morning about the terms of reference being quite narrow or focused, whichever way we want to put it.  The commission noted that the scope of its work was positioned within a set of parameters and decisions already made by the Government.  A particular formulation of words occurs a few times in the document.  It struck me that it was repeated.  Should I read into that that the members of the commission would have liked a broader frame of reference?  This may require them to unpick their entire document and so it may not be worth looking at.  Was there something they would have liked to address in their body of work that they did not have the opportunity to address, given their terms of reference?  That is a very broad question.</p> <p>  The second slightly less broad question is about universal pensions.  There is one line, saying we are not doing that.</p><p>I would like to have that investigated in more detail.  </p><p> On the specifics did the modelling examining the various packages in respect of the funding contributions concerned consider issues such as income smoothing?  Is that already built into that modelling?  Regarding the total contributions approach, were the figures outlined to us earlier predicated on the income smoothing and total contributions approach being in place?</p><p> The Chair can cut me off if I hit my limit on questions, but on that income smoothing aspect as well, I had a look back over the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.  Two elements of that are being considered, but do the witnesses have an opinion regarding whether we should have the third element as well, and a triple lock?  It might be concerned with the concept of the minimal essential standards of living, MESL.  Should that be in there as well?</p><p> Mention was made in the report as well of using "non-labour revenue sources to help fund the State Pensions system".  Was that captured in the information presented to us regarding base broadening?  Is that what we are talking about in respect of PRSI contributions being paid elsewhere or being payable on optional pensions, or is there something else captured that I am not understanding?</p></speech>

We formed the view that if there was something that we felt strongly enough about, then we would not constrain ourselves in that regard.  For example, we made a recommendation concerning a register of family carers, an aspect that was outside of our focus, and we also made a recommendation regarding the provision of guidance to ensure that older workers might be prepared.  In the end, however, we decided, given the short timeframe we had, that our work was mainly addressed to the audience.  That is why it is repeated.</p> <p>  I said to the Minister about six months after we started our work that if I had thought of it at the start, we should probably have been called the commission on State pensions, because the audience, the submitters and the commentariat were giving us jobs that we did not have.  Therefore, this facet of our work was more addressed to the audience to make it clear that the reason we stayed in the areas where we stayed was a function of our terms of reference.  We did not have a function in respect of private pensions, and neither did we have one regarding the tax system.  Many of the submissions and much of the material addressed to us raised those hares.  The main reason this point is repeated, then, is because we were probably feeling that much of the audience did not quite get how focused and specific were our terms of reference.  That was the reason.  We debated this point, and we were content that a job of work needed to be done and that was a useful contribution we could make.  Therefore, we came up with this language we used about "fixing the system within [...] the system".</p> <p>  Moving onto the matter of universal pensions, a longer text in the full report deals with this aspect.  I just cannot find the relevant reference now.  What we state there, however, is that aspect is outside of our terms of reference, because those are based on a contributions system and a universal pension does not have that idea.  The concept, therefore, was outside the scope of our terms of reference, but we did examine it.  We found that not only was it out of scope, but we also decided that it was placed somewhere else in the form of a basic income pilot.  We arrived at that conclusion because, in the context of a basic income pilot, a pension is clearly a version of basic income.  </p> <p>  In addition, inherent in the idea of a universal basic income, whether for pensions specifically or for everyone, is the involvement of the tax system.  That was definitely out of scope, and was also placed somewhere else.  In the end, therefore, it was not a case of us having decided to recommend against the concept, we just did not recommend it on those grounds.  I hope that is okay by way of an answer.  We took that approach particularly because of the contribution element.  Once our job was grounded in the Social Insurance Fund and contributions, then the dynamic of a universal basic income would have been a different job, as it were.</p> <p>  Regarding the information we presented earlier, I am certain that the total contribution approach, TCA, change is included.  Ms Burke will be able to help me to clarify whether the income aspect is addressed in that information as well. </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct about the non-revenue sources.  It was essentially the non-labour revenue sources, and that was part of our not wanting to overly impact on the labour market.</p> <p>  We did examine the triple lock, and concluded that the triple lock can result in pensions being increased ahead of the curve.  The Deputy may recall that at the time there was some fairly intense debate in the UK about what is really an intergenerational issue in the context of the national budget.  The triple lock seemed to prevent the most equitable outcome, so we did not recommend a triple lock for that reason.  We certainly feel that by setting up the independent standing body, and by giving it the job of periodically reviewing the form of indexation, as well as the mathematics in that regard, that the form of indexation might need to evolve over time.  The most important thing, though, is to implement this first version, and then to review it.</p></speech>

A large volume of work has been done.  It is just a pity that it was not done before any mention was made of pension age increases in the first place.  It would have been a huge help.  The report contains a great deal of knowledge, and a great deal of work went into it, and I thank the witnesses for that.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what is in the report, especially regarding the need for a pension for carers.  That has been an issue for a long time and it is something that must be sorted out as quickly as possible as well as the need to allow for PRSI to be accrued by those who remain working beyond the age of 65, to examine retirement ages in contracts and to establish a body that will recommend increases in respect of the State pension, similar to the Low Pay Commission, as has been suggested.  The remit of that body should go beyond the State pension and we should require a body to recommend increases across the board for social protection payments overall every year before budget time because we have this issue, as has been said, where people receiving the State pension or other social protection payments experience great uncertainty regarding those payments.  They have no idea what they are going to get, and we have the annual football being kicked around in this regard concerning the debate on an extra fiver every year.  Therefore, I agree with a great deal of what is contained in this report.  </p> <p>  What was suggested concerning the Exchequer making annual contributions to the Social Insurance Fund was interesting.  I wonder if consideration was given to a situation where the State would make that contribution and then we are also asking the State to make a contribution regarding auto-enrolment.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their comments on the Exchequer contributing in this regard.  I think it is something that is worthwhile and something to look at.  </p> <p>  Flexibility is really important.</p><p> In the commission's report, Ms Feehily puts forward the idea of providing a State pension to those retiring at 65 and, of course, she has added to that where they have a long contribution history and she has put in a figure of 45 years.  Can she expand on why it is 45 years and whether she considered it being less?  What was the rationale for suggesting that?  Obviously, we have an issue with people who are engaged in manual labour.  They may have started work in their late teens and by the age of 65, in some cases, they have worked for 40 or 50 years.  It is an issue if we are going to ask those workers to remain on until they are 67 or 68, when they physically cannot do so.  There is also going to be an impact on their health, if that is the way we are going.  Will Ms Feehily comment in that regard?  Will it be a transition State pension being provided at 65 or a full contributory State pension, and how would that work?</p><p> Ms Feehily speaks a lot in the report about State pensions and how they protect people from poverty.  With the recent increase, the State pension will now reach the minimum standard of living, which was listed as &euro;252 by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  That is welcome.  In the context of those pensioners who are qualified adults or who are on reduced pensions, is there a protection from poverty for them, and was that looked at?  In regard to what is now the benefit payment of &euro;203 at 65, did Ms Feehily look at poverty protection for such recipients in view of the fact that they are locked out of secondary benefits like the fuel allowance?  There is an impact at 65 of going onto this benefit payment, which is set at the jobseeker&rsquo;s rate rather than the rate of the transition State pension, which was there previously.  Again, that is set well below the poverty line.</p><p> On the legislation, there are employment contracts that stipulate a retirement age of 65.  Ms Feehily said the legislation that is needed would apply to existing and new employment contracts.  She will probably know that legislation was unanimously passed twice in the Oireachtas in the past six or seven years with regard to banning mandatory retirement.  The issue that came up the last time was that the Department of Justice said it could not be done and that we could not look retrospectively at employment contracts.  Does Ms Feehily think that is feasible?  I agree it is something that needs to be sorted out because people are being forced to retire at 65 due to their contracts even though they do not want to retire.  Frankly, if they just had to wait a year to get the State pension, many would probably remain on at work for that year.</p><p> Page 132 of the report contains a table that relates to the expenditure projections from 2019 to 2070 in the context of keeping the State pension age at 66.  On a similar question to that asked by Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, do those projections include an indexation link to 34% of earnings?</p><p> The submission that we made recommended 30 years.  Ms Feehily has opted for 40 years.  She might speak a little about why she believes that 40 years is agreeable or even reachable.  For many people who are immigrating or coming home, there could be difficulties in that regard.  We have put forward 30 years.</p><p> There are a number of references to the widow&rsquo;s pension in the report.  We had put forward a recommendation regarding an issue that has arisen whereby a person has to be married in order to get the widow&rsquo;s pension.  While I appreciate that is outside the remit here, I ask whether there was any discussion around that requirement for the widow's pension.</p><p> Mr. Duggan referenced the increases in costs and what it costs to defer the pension age increase to 67.  If we did not have a mandatory retirement age as stipulated in contracts and if we allowed people to work on from 65 and accrue PRSI contributions, what would the cost be?  Do we know the figure in respect of what we will save by not paying out the contributory State pension at 66 and instead paying out a benefit payment for 65-year-olds?  In the context of the pension age increases that Ms Feehily has put forward, how does she see that working if we go to 67?  Will there be a benefit payment in the middle for those people who still have 65 in their contract?  How will that work for people in manual labour who will be expected to work up to 67?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for the comprehensive way she has reviewed our work.  I will answer the questions in the order I got them.</p> <p>  As to why we picked 45 years for the very long insurance record, it follows from 40 years.  The Irish social insurance system is somewhat unusual in that people pay full PRSI once they earn &euro;38 a week, so people start paying PRSI very young for casual employment.  It is one of the reasons why the averaging system is not very fair in terms of the pension, but that is another day&rsquo;s work.  It is not unusual when people reach the age of 65 for them to have worked for 45 years.  Given that the recommendation for a full pension was 40 years, taking account of flexible access for people who had an exceptionally long record, it seemed to us that 45 was appropriate.  It was as simple as that.  As I said, quite a number of people start paying it at 16, so it is not exceptional.</p> <p>  I would like to talk a little about the Exchequer contribution.  There were couple things driving our thoughts on that.  First, the original policy grounding of the Social Insurance Fund in 1952 was tripartite funding.  The tripartite funding has been observed but the Exchequer bit has been on a contingency basis and, for the first umpteen years of the fund, up until the middle of the 2000s, it was always in deficit.  That was designed into it.  It was meant to be tripartite funding.  We took the view that capturing that general community solidarity contribution by a contribution coming from general taxation, which would not be discretionary, was an important return to that tripartite funding principle which was established from the outset and maintained for the first 40 to 45 years of the fund's existence.  That was the first point, which was a solidarity point.  How does everybody contribute?  Everybody contributes through taxation.</p> <p>  Second, we felt that in order for the maths to be done appropriately every year, we needed certainty around the Exchequer bit and that it should not be down to squabbles.  Third, the Exchequer makes a demand-led contribution which is legislated for in regard to private pensions in the form of tax relief.  It is likely to make a demand-led contribution, which will be legislated for in the form of auto-enrolment for second-tier pensions, which will not be optional, so we felt that, for the first-tier pension, it should not be optional either.  That is the thinking: the original policy driver plus the way the other two tiers of pensions are treated.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we looked at poverty in respect of the adult dependants.  We are aware of the Vincentian Partnership and the various definitions.  It is quite clear from those definitions that a couple together has less risk of poverty than a person living alone.  We looked at it from that point of view.  We also looked at it from the point of view that if we take that at-risk-of-poverty measure, the likelihood is that the adult dependant will himself or herself be entitled to a non-contributory full pension,.  That was as far as we looked at it.</p><p>In terms of the poverty risk, it is important to remember that if there is a couple at that point, the non-contributory pension is an important piece of the safety net.</p><p> We did not look at the retirement benefit of &euro;203.  I am afraid it was out of scope.  We did not examine any issues to do with that.</p><p> On employment contracts, we clearly were aware that there were legal issues surrounding employment contracts.  There is an overarching entitlement in the European directives as well.  That is why we came up with a formula that would allow but not compel.  It is a property right of the people who want to go at 65 years of age and they want their entitlements at 65.  In many cases, it washes into their occupational pensions.  That is how we understood the risk and that is how we came up with the formula to allow but not compel, and that future contracts should be aligned with the State pension age, whatever that may be from time to time.</p><p> On 40 years' contributions as opposed to 30 years' contributions, it goes back to the point I made about people starting really young.  Thirty is very short.  I would point out that the 40 years' contributions that we are recommending is for a full pension and a person with 30 years' contributions could very well get a partial pension.  A person who emigrated could very well end up with a partial pension from another country where he or she worked.  There are European Union rights but also there is a broader social security family with reciprocal agreements, etc.  The emigration piece is probably well enough catered for by the range of agreements that would allow people to get perhaps two partial pensions.  We did not look at the issue to do with martial status of widows.  Did I answer all the questions?</p></speech>

I have to confess I have not yet read the 244 pages, although I will do so over Christmas, because a lot of stuff comes in all the time.  There is a lot of daily work in this job and I just did not have the time with all the other commitments.</p> <p>  Can Ms Feehily quantify the savings the Pensions Commission estimates because people have been encouraged to work longer and, therefore, make contributions into the system for a longer period?   What savings would arise because pensions would not be paid to anybody over 66 until he or she got to the new pension age?  That is a crucial question that goes to the nub of a big problem that will arise if you start raising the pension age.</p> <p>  I confess I am over the pension age, but the kind of job I do means I do not have to lift blocks every day, I do not have to plaster ceilings and I do not have to do lots of things that I might not feel up to.  I feel up to what I do.  One of the big problems of this is that there is a large cohort of people who by the time they come to their mid-60s are unfit for the work for which they are trained to do.  It is a phrase they use for invalidity pensions, etc., that we are all familiar with on this side of the House.  When people get to a certain age, they no longer can do the work.  This can involve people who have to spend long hours standing in retail, etc., and have problems.  It is fair to say that for a fair number people general wear and tear - they might not be very ill in the conventional sense - means they cannot do their jobs.  For example, the Army will not keep people after a certain age.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not keep people after a certain age, and it would be younger than the normal retiring age.  It is because these jobs require physical agility and ability.  People of 65 to 67 years of age will not be kept in the ranger unit.  That is an extreme example, but this is well recognised by the State.  We often allow teachers to retire early because they are burnt out after 40 years in the classroom, etc.</p> <p>  What do you do?  What do you say to these people when they come in to you?  What are we meant to say to these human beings?  Should we apologise and say that they are really meant to be working until they are 67 or 68 years of age?  That is the dilemma.  Is it to try to encourage people to work for longer or is it a cash saving and, if so, how much?</p> <p>  Of course, there was a third way round this that does not seem to have been examined.  I have to confess I have not read the whole report, and maybe it was examined.  Did the commission examine returning to the concept of the State pension transition?  The idea of the State pension transition is that if you retired and you were not earning a substantial amount of money - you could earn a very small amount - you could get the State pension but if you continued to be employed, you could not get the State pension.  Was that looked at, because one of the big disappointments is that people worked?  It is interesting and key that one trade union representative did not sign off on the age increase because that particular trade unionist would have been familiar with the human problem that really came to the fore in the last election, that is, all the people who cannot physically continue to work after their mid-60s and were looking forward to retiring having put in 40 years' very hard work.</p> <p>  The second question I have is a technical one because it is a change of policy.  When total contributions were first mooted in 2008, the policy was 30 years' contributions.  The 40 years' contributions came in when the carer's credits came in.  What made the commission decide on 30 years' contributions versus 40 years' contributions?  Even during the previous Government, when I asked the former Minister, Senator Regina Doherty, about the transition from 30 years' contributions to 40 years', the replies I got fudged the issue and stated that it only applied where you were claiming the carer's credits and that no decision had been made in terms of people who had worked or drawn credits for the 30 years.  When did that morph from 30 years' contributions to 40 years' contributions as a general policy as opposed to a specific policy?  It was introduced to deal with the reduction in the payments to people who did not have the full average.  The commission is obviously making a firm recommendation.  Was the Department providing the data working as 40 years' contributions as a given, even though to my knowledge that policy was never decided on?  As I said, the only policy that was decided on was 30 years' contributions.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Feehily about the self employed.  Even at the very beginning, on an actuarial basis, it was way better at 4%.  As the commission pointed out repeatedly, the biggest cost for social welfare is the contributory State pension and, therefore, the adds-on are not what have added the costs.</p> <p>  It is fair to say it is the best value, as Ms Feehily pointed out.  You pay your tax and your USC, which, God knows, was only meant to be a temporary provision.  It is like income tax, when Wellington introduced it the first time as a temporary expedient.  It has had a long legacy after him but USC was in the same vein.  It was meant to get us over a little hump.  It is something we should grasp the nettle on and I agree with Ms Feehily there.</p> <p>  I have probably said enough.  My big issue is the human issue.  This increase in the age does not factor in all of those people, many of whom get out of full-time work earlier on and are on invalidity pensions or whatever and cannot reasonably be expected to work after 66 years of age.  Pushing it from them is really pushing it.</p></speech>

I will pass over to Ms Burke to deal with the question on costings and savings.  By the way, income tax was introduced by the British Government as a temporary arrangement during the Napoleonic Wars.  The issues of transition and long working lives are kind of tied in together.  We did not revisit the transition pension.  We received quite a lot of inputs and views that the retirement condition irritated many people in the transition pension.  Back in the day, it was called the retirement pension.  The idea that one retired for a year and then went back to work the following year and continued to get the same pension was regarded by many people as being slightly laughable.  That point was made to us.  We did discuss returning to a thing called a transition pension.  We discussed whether we might recommend the reinvention of a retirement condition for an early pension but, taking account of the submissions made to us, decided that would be complicating things all over again.  I take the Deputy's point that some people are able and willing to continue to work and, in fact, actively seeking to continue to work, otherwise we would not have a row about the employment contract issue.  There are people who wish to keep working, while there are others who do not wish to keep working or cannot do so.  In the context of any increase in the age, we recommended that at the age of 65 people with a long insurance record - they are likely to be the people the Deputy is describing who cannot continue working and are likely to have started quite young - would get a pension without any transition or retirement condition.  That was our reasoning in respect of not returning to the transition pension.</p></speech>

It is like telling a person to go and get a suit in the average size.  It might be too long or too short if one does that.  I am interested to find out how many people actually would have got it if the 40 years' contributions was deployed rather than the averaging system or the dual system now.  I think there are gap year records in the context of many people's social insurance contributions.</p></speech>

The Deputy noted that he agreed with me.  The structure of self-employed PRSI is kind of odd, apart altogether from the fact the rate is very low.  Low-paid, self-employed persons pay 10%, while low-paid workers pay nothing.  It is odd.  The floor is &euro;500 if a self-employed person earns &euro;5,000, so it is effectively a rate of 10%.  PRSI for workers goes the other way.  It goes up as one earns more.  The PRSI percentage for the self-employed is flipped and that is kind of odd.  We make that observation as well.</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that I am very proud that my mother and father, who were both self-employed, decided to work on beyond State pension age.  I have been able to see first hand the very positive impact of that and a real work ethos.  I understand that some people are not able to keep working but in the case of my parents, they are both healthy and well and actively enjoying later life.  I started the summary from the technical committee setting out the cost of the State pension and how it increases over various periods.  By the time we get to 2050, the cost of the State pension as a percentage of modified gross national  income will be 7.9%.  If we assume the rate of employment among older people, that is, those in the 55-74 age bracket, will increase by 10%, that would reduce the cost of the State pension by 0.5%, from 7.9% to 7.4%.  It is a relatively significant impact on the cost of the State pension.</p></speech>

It is a tremendous contribution to this debate on pensions and how we plan for the future.  I will home in on the issue of the retirement age.  I will declare an interest in that I have a trade union background and have worked with workers in meat factories, on construction sites and in retail.  I agree with Mr. Duggan that we have to be realistic.  How realistic is it to expect these workers to work until the age of 68 after a lifetime of working, bearing in mind that many of them will not have spent their entire working lives in Ireland?  Many will have come in as foreign workers over the past 30 years or so.  Many others, including me, will have spent a long time abroad because of our unfortunate tradition of emigration over decades.  How realistic is it to expect these people, who have given a lifetime of work, to work on to the age of 68?</p> <p>  I again compliment the work done by the commission.  I am intrigued by the four potential packages it presented.  I prefer package 3 to package 4, because it does not force workers to work on to the age of 68.  We all support the idea of flexible working, which is a key requirement.  I am curious as to why package 3 was not chosen.  I am looking at the potential increases in employer and employee PRSI.  I see employee PRSI would go up by 0.2% under package 3, as opposed to no increase under package 4.  The difference is between a 1.55% increase and a 1.35% increase.  How do these PRSI rates compare with those of our European counterparts?  My understanding is there is a significant gap between the PRSI paid by employers here and what is typically paid in Europe.</p></speech>

The idea of the four packages is exactly the point he homed in on.  We provided options, which is what our terms of reference asked us to do.  The Government is entirely free to choose any or none of them.  We provided an evidence base for all of the options.  Package 3 is entirely on the funding side, with no contribution from the age.  The commission is a group of 11 people with a range of views and we formed the closest consensus on package 4.  We felt that the age increase makes a significant contribution to solving the challenge.  We also had submissions from bodies, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showing there was a large body of people who want to continue at work.  As I said, the employment contract issue would not be arising if there were not people who wanted to continue at work.  It was not as simple as everybody wanting to retire.</p> <p>  Package 4 emerged from a distillation of all of the inputs.  By providing the option for a pension at 65, at the same time as the age is going up, we were finding a levelling in there.  Package 4, on the age ground, emerged from a distillation of all of the inputs and addressing the scale of the problem, as well as a desire not to have everything falling on the funding side.  The trade union people, and I am sure they would not mind me saying this, would not necessarily have wanted employee PRSI going up either.</p> <p>  I take Senator Gavan's point that the difference between the various packages in the incidence of PRSI is modest, but it does have an impact on the labour market and that was also on the table from various inputs to us.  There was not a desire to increase PRSI at the same time as auto-enrolment is coming on, with a potential increase from both employers and employees to their personal pensions and things such as statutory sick pay imposing additional costs.  There were many things in the mix in the submissions to us.  However, we were particularly driven by the fact there is no fixed view that people should retire at 65 or 66.  People were looking for a range and so we put the age piece into package 4 as the optimum mix of interventions to help address the deficit, noting that people with long working lives might get a pension at 65, and as an option for Government.</p> <p>  I take the Senator's point about people having worked in different countries.  Modern social security frameworks provide for reciprocation, not just in the European Union, but beyond.  People who work in different in countries can end up with two partial pensions or combined insurance records.  It is not the sort of fatal hit it used to be many years ago.</p> <p>  There are two answers to the Senator's question on PRSI in other countries.  Social security systems are not always directly comparable.  In many countries, which I am sure the Senator knows from his own work, some elements of social security are provided through funds, including trade unions.  Several contributions can come from a payslip, so pension, unemployment insurance and health insurance can all be quite different.  Comparison is quite difficult but it is the case that we are a bit behind the curve on both the employer and employee side.  How far we are behind the curve depends on who one looks at for comparisons.  As if that was not complicated enough, the benefit range is also a bit different.  As a general comment, the Senator is correct.  We had a presentation from the OECD and when that question was put to it, the OECD pointed out we were also behind the curve on the employee side.  Does that capture the Senator's questions?</p></speech>

In terms of the potential savings of raising the pension age, I will go back to Mr. Duggan's point about being realistic.  Realistically, a number of these people, if they are forced to work on to 68, will find themselves in receipt of some kind of social payment, rather than actual work.  Age Action described this point very well last week in that we know once people get into their 50s and 60s, it is much harder to get another job.  Is it realistic to suggest this level of savings, given the Department of Social Protection's analysis suggested that many of these people will still require an alternative form of payment?</p></speech>

As I said, we therefore came up with a range of options.  Without diverting and digging deeply into this report, I am not certain how many of the likely other benefits were netted out.  A model was done for us by the secretariat of the Department which certainly took account of the better retirement benefit that was invented.  Unless Mr. Flynn can help me, I would have to go digging to see how much the likelihood of benefits was factored in and that would delay the committee.</p></speech>

I would not want to mislead the committee by providing a wrong figure to suggest exactly what was included.  When we do costs in this area, we normally net off against alternative payments.  We will check on the specific model and provide an answer to the committee afterwards.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I have an observation and one or two comments to make.  I thank the commission for this extraordinary body of work.  I am of the Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v school, in that I am familiar with the headline details but not the minutiae of the report.  The background is the decision to raise the pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028 that was made by the Government led by then Taoiseach Enda Kenny between 2011 and 2016.</p> <p>  A fundamentally dishonest debate was held in the midst of the most recent general election campaign, during which voodoo economics prevailed and nobody was prepared to stand up and say that more people cannot qualify for payment from the Social Insurance Fund without an increase in contributions.  Some even advocated for reduced contributions.  People should not have been told that more will qualify for pensions equivalent to those being paid today or increased pensions.  That is a fundamentally dishonest position.  There was further dishonesty from some who voted for an increase in the pension age in Northern Ireland from 65 to 66, which came into effect last year, but who, in June of this year, voted in this jurisdiction to reduce the pension age to 65 and argued that the only cost of that was &euro;120 million to the Social Insurance Fund.  Those positions are dishonest.  The report is stark in its detail and what is abundantly clear is that we face a difficult challenge.  The Social Insurance Fund will be in deficit to the tune of more than &euro;3 billion, and growing, by 2030 if we do nothing.</p> <p>  I appreciate the fantastic piece of work that has been carried out under the stewardship of the chairperson of the commission and by all of the members of the commission.  Why does Ms Feehily believe that the proposal in the commission's report, which, if I understand it correctly, is for an incremental increase in the pension age to 67 over the period to 2031, and to 68 some time thereafter on an incremental basis, will be in any way more acceptable than the lead-in time envisaged in the original legislation to raise the pension age to 67 and 68 in 2021 and 2028, respectively?  These are difficult issues.  We must all face up to the realities.  People are living longer, which is a fantastic achievement in our lifetime, and, consequently, they are active and healthier in society for much longer.  That brings challenges with it.  Meeting those challenges has significant economic consequences with which we are grappling.  Why does the commission believe its proposals will be more politically palatable than those that were outlined and legislated for previously?  I again thank the commission.  It has made a fantastic contribution to a very challenging area.</p> <p>  Ms Burke alluded to policy levers relating to fertility and the requirement of additional migrant workers.  Is the argument around migrant workers not bogus?  If we bring in more workers and have more people paying in, they will fund the pension entitlements of those who are hitting the pension age either now or in the near future.  However, future pension liabilities for those workers are also being incurred.  I accept we have labour shortages and requirements for non-EEA workers to fill vacancies here but that migrant worker argument is short-termism.  It is unsustainable in the long term.  Through their contributions, those workers are creating an entitlement to social welfare benefits, possibly including a pension entitlement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#L00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will invite Ms Burke to answer the Deputy's second point in a moment.  The Deputy asked a key question about the palatability of the age recommendation.  We have included a couple of things which we think might help.  The more transparency there is about the nature of the funding problem, the better the chance of creating an understanding across the community that this is not just a political whim or something that is being done for fun or to annoy people but is an important part of having a pension system that has certainty.  The comfort of certainty, as you get older, is enormously important.  We are strongly suggesting that in the lead-up to any new changes, whether they are recommended by the commission or not, more public debate take place about the underpinnings of, and the rationale for, any such decision.</p> <p>  In the debate that took place about the age increase at the beginning of 2020, there was a lot of focus on what I am calling the gap between 65 and 66.  Many people were concerned.  There are recommendations in our report that would address the gap on the employment side.  There were some people who were content to stay at work but could not do so.  We have recommended addressing the gap.  The Government has addressed the gap with a retirement benefit for the age of 65 to 66.  The gap has been addressed, or would be addressed, if our recommendation was implemented and attached to that to a fair degree.  At least one of the debating points would be addressed.</p> <p>  We also recommended a lot of communication and the issuance to workers of statements to allow for a lot of notice.  We are not recommending that the age increase begin until 2028, so there is lots of time.  The statements to workers would tell them their specific situation, pension age and contribution record.  It would set those out that information and explain it in good time.  That should be done not only once but more than once.  We recommend better communication to help understanding.</p> <p>  We felt that by moving a quarter at a time, we were reducing the sense of loss.  Some people felt they were losing a year, relative to their predecessors the previous year.  By doing it slowly and more gradually, although people still "lose", they are losing a lesser amount relative to their colleagues who retired the preceding year or the year before that.  As part of the question of addressing the gap, we recommended the option to provide a pension for people with very long records at 65.</p><p>We felt we were contributing to enabling a rounder debate in the future.</p><p> At the committee's meeting last week, which I reviewed in recent days, one of the members said there are no easy decisions in this and we agree.  There is only a question of which hard decisions will be made.  The points I have made are about contributing to a rounder discussion and to having some answers to a discussion around the age point.  The 65 age gap has been partially addressed and would be further addressed if people who wanted to stay at work could do so.  We need to have much better and earlier person-specific communications.  We must tell people that their pension age will be, for example, 67 and three quarters or 66 and we will shorten the sense of loss involved by doing it much more gradually and more slowly.  Those were our considerations on how we might help that debate to be rounder the next time.</p><p> Ms Burke might be able to help with the question on fertility and migration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roma Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#M00200"><p>That question ties in nicely with the Deputy's first question on why this might be more palatable now than the previously legislated for State pension age increases were.  A couple of years ago when we saw those increases about to come through, everybody had a bit of an understanding about the problem but not everybody was fully informed, including myself.  Before I became involved with the commission I thought that we did not need to worry about it, that more people would come into the country and that the average age of retirement would be maintained.  Other people might have said that the State pension was getting more expensive but I thought the State would cover that cost.  Everybody had a partial solution for this problem and everyone partially understood it but when the Commission on Pensions was formed, it set out to look at each of these ideas that people had, such as the possibility that migration or fertility might solve the problem.  We took a systematic and evidence-based approach to examining each of those matters in isolation and to examine if they could be relied on, if they would help to solve the problem or if they would cause other problems as the Deputy has suggested.  We looked at each one individually and we looked at the migration question purely in the context of a simplistic ratio, namely the number of working age people versus the number of people past the State pension age to see how we could maintain that.  The Deputy is correct that if the population increases by 50% over the next 30 years there will be other significant challenges for the State in housing, healthcare, childcare and in people getting older and developing an entitlement in their own right.  That would cause much wider challenges apart from just the State pension.  It was important to us to examine how many people we would need if we just wanted to maintain that simple ratio.  It demonstrated to us that the ideas we might have had previously, that a small increase in net inward migration might solve the problem, would not work.  The process allowed us to tackle that and answer the question and now we can systematically move on to other headings that might help us tackle the challenge.</p> <p>  On Ms Feehily's comments on palatability, being forewarned is incredibly important.  A key part of the second pillar of pension provision is telling people every year what they are saving, what they have saved to date and what they can expect at retirement if they continue what they are doing.  That has been crystallised for people who are actively in employment as well as for people who might have saved for retirement but who have left their pension scheme to move to another job.  Under recently introduced legislation, every year those people will get a statement that sets out their expectations and any assumptions surrounding that.  It is a question of applying that approach to the first pillar of the pension system.  We must give people that information so that they understand what they will get at retirement in order that they can plan and see if, for example, auto-enrolment or saving for a private pension and so on would be important and worthwhile for them.  Forewarned is forearmed and action can be taken if needed and if no action is needed they know that as well if they are forewarned.</p></speech>

I do not know if the witnesses have the answer to that question.  Second, I want to make an observation.  I am around long enough to remember the reduction in the pension age from 70 to 66, which happened in the 1970s and was a staggered reduction every year over four years.  It is a different kettle of fish to go in the opposite direction but it is worth remembering that we are revisiting an area we occupied within living memory when the retirement age was 70.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roma Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#M00400"><p>I would be relying on my wider understanding of pensions to work out the actuarial cost of reducing the pension age to 65.  If the retirement age was brought forward the payment would be made a year earlier and so it would be in payment for longer.  If it is assumed that the average male might live until 83, for example, and if he is getting pension increases along the way, the value of that pension is about 30:1.  If that is brought forward a year, an extra year's payment is being added to it and all the future pension payments are also being increased so it would probably increase it by at least 10%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#M00500"><p>With regard to Ms Feehily, the commission and all the staff who supported the commission's work, a substantial body of evidence has been produced.  Regardless of what decision is taken down the road, this is significant and useful and it clearly sets out the challenges, issues and options.  It starts the conversation we need to have in this country on how we address this challenge into the future.  A lot of the tools are here and members have raised questions on the figures and modelling behind that.  I want to publicly acknowledge that because it is significant work and I want to commend everyone who has been involved in that.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  Ms Feehily's presentation mentioned the issue of class K stamps for additional income being paid by people beyond the age of 65.  Within the commission report it is also acknowledged that some people beyond the age of 65 or 66 can no longer pay PRSI contributions to build up an entitlement.  How does one square the circle of paying two types of contributions beyond someone's 66th birthday?  Some people will pay class K contributions and others might pay class S or other stamps.  Should it not be the case that if someone pays PRSI, he or she should make a contribution to his or her pension up to the threshold of 30:1, 40:1 or 45:1?  People will continue to pay beyond that if the commission's report is implemented.  Why is there a need to pay some stamps that do not have an entitlement built into them?  Should that system be streamlined?</p> <p>  I want to follow up on Ms Burke's final comment on modelling and emigration and I want to come back to the other issue.  The ESRI was not able to answer the question of childcare and the indigenous working population for us last week.</p><p>If we look at what is happening here at the moment in childcare, which is replication of problems we have seen right across Europe over previous generations, the cost of rearing a family and particularly the cost of childcare has a double-edged impact.  One, it reduces the fertility rate in a country and is part of the contributing factor to that.  The other is that it also reduces participation in the workforce, PRSI contributions and taxation.  This is a double-edged effect with both a short-term and longer-term impact.  What would be the benefit of actively supporting childcare and greater participation of women in the workforce and what would that impact be on the long-term prognosis as to the cost of pensions?  Our witnesses may or may not be able to provide some information today and, if not, perhaps they might try to come back to us and grapple with this particular challenge because it was one that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, could not answer for us here last week.  <br/><br/>Turning to Mr. Duggan, in his evidence he referred to the projected modelling costs of the pension and the actual cost of the pension.  The projection was that not increasing the age from 66 to 67 would cost &euro;221 million.  He is now projecting that that figure will be &euro;275 million by year-end and over &euro;500 million in a full year.  What is the jobseeker's benefit impact on that?  If people retire at 66 years of age but cannot claim their State pension until they are 67 years of age, they would have an entitlement to jobseekers&rsquo; benefit which, to me, would negate much of the potential savings that are there.  Can Mr. Duggan give the committee the projected cost of the jobseeker's benefit if one increases the age from 66 to 67?<br/><br/>It sounds strange to me that the projections are actually going up when, if one looks at the CSO analysis of the data from <i>RIP.ie</i>, this shows that there are 2,300 additional deaths as a direct result of Covid-19, or this is the indication that has been given.  A number of people, disproportionately and sadly in respect of many older people, have died as a result of Covid-19.  As a result of Covid-19, we have fewer people claiming a State pension yet Mr. Duggan&rsquo;s projections are &euro;54 million out from where it would be.  How has that happened when, sadly, there are fewer people claiming the pension as a result of Covid-19? The cost projections have gone up by close to a quarter; that seems to me to be a significant error in respect of those particular calculations by the Department.  <br/><br/>On the famous Telecom &Eacute;ireann shares that were lodged in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF we all know that that fund has been raided to bail out the banks and has also been used to invest in stimulating the economy.  There will be a return, however, from those investments at some stage.  The Minister for Finance is telling us that the investments that were put into the banks are turning into a profit and the reality is that the National Treasury Management Agency. NTMA, will get a return on the investments that are now being put in to indigenous businesses, and so forth.  Has that been modelled into this?<br/><br/>Has any consideration been given to the fact that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has stated that the windfalls we are gaining at the moment in corporate tax should not be put into day-to-day spending?  Is there merit in ring-fencing some of that corporate tax windfall and putting it into something like the NPRF which was there to plan for the cliff edge down the road by way of costs?  Our witnesses might answer some of those specific questions, and Ms Feehily might start, please.</p></speech>

By way of general remark, this is not the commission&rsquo;s business.  PRSI needs streamlining and that is a different question.</p> <p>  The range of solutions in our recommendations in the commission&rsquo;s report around PRSI and older people would bring some complexity and the Chairman is completely correct on that.  We are recommending that those who wish to keep contributing would pay a full contribution up to age 70 if they wanted to increase their pension.  We are also recommending that if they do not have enough contributions they would keep paying and then they would stop when they had enough.  That would involve another subclass A, where A is already broken down into people with an income below &euro;300, or whatever the exact figure is.  There are subdivisions in class A and there would now be a new one.</p> <p>  The separate recommendation is about funding.  This is simply a solidarity contribution where pay is the most convenient box to put that into because it exists already as a solidarity contribution in the PRSI system.  The Chairman is correct in saying that we would be introducing some complexity.  The alternative is to simplify everything into a single rate.  It is not unusual in the history of PRSI, going back to 1979, for there to be these complexities.  In fact, in preparing as part of the commission&rsquo;s work, I discovered class P, which I had never heard of, which has all of about seven people in it.  It is not unusual within the PRSI system for it to provide subclasses to address particular issues.  We acknowledged that the complexity was already there and we may add a little bit to it but not an enormous amount.  </p> <p>  If we could use the flexible options, in particular, for people to continue paying in order to enhance their pension or to fill out their record, we thought that it was worth the complexity.  The class K piece is a straightforward funding hypothecated tax, almost.</p> <p>  Ms Burke will talk about the modelling in a moment but there are sections in the report about labour market interventions.  Childcare is not one of them but some of the other labour market interventions are set out there, including Government policy on the labour market generally.  We were mindful of it and I will allow Ms Burke to answer whether we were able to capture childcare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roma Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#N00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Childcare is the trigger for helping more women participate in the workforce.  The Chairman is really asking whether the commission considered the impact of women being better facilitated to either return to the workforce or work more?  Yes, that was fully and very carefully considered at our technical sub-committee level.  I am a lay person on economics but I was sitting beside two very able economists and we had a discussion about participation rates within the workforce, how that increases and the role of women within that.  One of the conclusions from the committee which is already built into the calculations is not what I would consider to be an optimistic calculation but one which is at the higher end of a range of assumptions.  Basically, an increase in the labour force participation rate from 62% to about 66% is built into these calculations.  Looking at the research and discussing it with my colleagues, we felt that there was probably limited scope for further participation given that that was a fairly challenging increase in labour force participation.  That, in turn, is dependent upon childcare and other factors to help people.</p><p>We also looked at the impact of increasing education levels on people going into the workforce and staying there.  There were a couple of elements to that consideration.  </p></speech>

I am not expecting the commission to provide numbers today but it would be useful from a broader policy perspective, and for the role of this committee and the recommendations it will make to the Government, if we could have figures on education, childcare and the different elements to increasing participation in the workforce.  Sadly, childcare is seen as a cost rather than as a long-term financial benefit to the economy.  It is important that is part of the overall narrative and discussion.</p> <p>  Mr. Duggan might answer one other question.  Is it feasible and practical for the existing social welfare software system to pay State contributory pensions on an incremental quarterly basis, as is being proposed by the commission?  That seems to be an issue in that the quarterly incremental payment could be challenging purely because of the software system currently operating in the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#O00300"><p>I will take the Chairman's last question first.  To implement the pension age increase on a quarterly basis would require system changes, but it is doable.  We have quite a bit of time to implement it, if the commission's recommendation is accepted and implemented by the Government.  I do not think it would be a showstopper.</p> <p>   I do not have figures to hand regarding the benefit payment for 65-year-olds, but the yearly expenditure on that is in the region of &euro;35 million to &euro;40 million, based on the number of people who seem to qualify for it, or are applying for it, at this juncture.</p> <p>  On the &euro;221 million likely increasing to &euro;275 million, remember the latter is a projection rather than an actual figure and it is impossible to be definitive about projections.  The best we can do is estimate based on previous understandings and likely behaviours.  The Department almost always errs on the side of a conservative estimate when projecting because it does not want to overstate the nature of problems.  Consequently, even though there have been, tragically, deaths from Covid, it is still the case that people are living much longer and healthier lives.  That dynamic, which is changing quite rapidly and has done so over the past ten years, coupled with some budget increases, such as the living alone allowance and matters of that nature, means that our projections may have been a little out and a little conservative.  Consequently, the actual costs being realised are a little higher than we expected.  That is because it is incredibly difficult to predict what the numbers will be over the full year and, at the time we made the projection, we did not know of some of those budgetary increases.  That explains the difference.</p></speech>

They overestimate rather than underestimate because of the way the Estimates process now works.  It does not stack up that the Department of Social Protection underestimated from a conservative perspective because that would be an irresponsible approach to fiscal management.  Until flexibility was brought in under EU fiscal policy, it was not possible to get a Supplementary Estimate.  That does not wash.  Is Mr. Duggan saying that the main reason for the significant difference is the additional budgetary changes to entitlements that have taken place?  Is it the case that since the actual cost of the State contributory pension did not increase, Mr. Duggan is including in this figure other additional costs, such as fuel allowance and other supplementary benefits?  Is that where this figure is coming from?</p></speech>

We estimate.  We try not to overstate those estimates.  That is what I mean by conservative.  I do not mean we underestimate because as the Chairman said, that would be irresponsible so we do not do that.  We certainly do not deliberately underestimate.  I am not saying the figure includes such things as fuel allowance.  I only included those allowances that are increases on the State pension payment.  Somebody who is living alone gets an increase on their payment.  We call it the living alone allowance but it is, in effect, an increase on their payment.  It is only those I include.  I do not include fuel allowance, the housing benefits package, HBP, or payments of that nature.  It is a combination of things, including the fact that more people are drawing the State pension than we may have thought because of the longevity issue.</p></speech>

I note that Deputy Kerrane wants to come in.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh will remind me that the carbon tax funds the living alone allowance.  It is not coming directly out of the Vote for the Department of Social Protection budget.  It is income that has been generated by people paying carbon taxes throughout the country.</p></speech>

It is fine if its representatives cannot answer it now.  Do the Exchequer expenditure projections in that table include the indexation link to 34% of earnings or an increase in the State pension?  I want to check that.  The witnesses can come back on it, as I appreciate they may not have that information.</p> <p>  I reiterate that I believe we will have an issue with the move to those in manual labour drawing the State pension at 67 years of age.  I appreciate what the commission has put forward in asking the Government to look at the option of providing a pension at 65 to those who simply will not be able to work beyond that age.  Has the commission put that forward as a recommendation to Government with those workers in manual labour jobs who will find it hard to remain on in work to 67 in mind?</p> <p>  The chairperson asked the question I put to Mr. Duggan earlier regarding those savings.  It would be great to get something in writing on what the savings will be if we increase the State pension age and we continue to pay out a jobseeker's rate payment benefit, or whatever it is called.  I will again make the point I made to Mr. Duggan regarding the figure of more than &euro;200 million that had to be charged because we did not increase the age to 67.  If we looked at removing the ages in contracts that see people forced to retire at 65, and we also allowed those who remained at work to accrue PRSI, I believe that figure would be much lower.</p> <p>  We need to move on getting rid of those ages stipulated in contracts that are below State pension age and allow those who want to, and are willing and able to, work on to accrue PRSI contributions.  In some cases, they need to work on because they do not have the PRSI for a full State pension.  In other cases, they want to work on for social reasons because, in some cases, they have nothing else.  It is not always financial.  I would argue that those savings are limited given that we are paying out.  Will we continue to pay out when the pension age increases to 67?  Will that benefit payment extend to two years once the pension age increases?</p></speech>

I made the point last week that people of my age or a bit younger are often so busy in their lives they may not be thinking ahead to pension age.  Having communication on what people's PRSI entitlements will amount to, done clearly and in a personalised way, as Ms Burke said, is key.  It is also a huge factor in the idea of auto-enrolment, which we have not discussed today.  As people become more aware and think in that longer term frame, auto-enrolments will become an increasingly important part of the picture.</p> <p>  The Chair might laugh at this, but he opened the door by talking about the changing nature of the world of work.  I put this question to the ESRI last week and nobody bit, as such.  We are modelling pension structures out to 2070 in this report.  In the conception of the world of work that underpins this, were we looking at a business-as-usual model?  With regard to childcare, for example, we know the caring economy will expand greatly as we have an older population.  Will that have an impact on how we fund our pensions model?  We can also look at areas around artificial intelligence and digitalisation.  It is outside Ms Burke's terms of reference but is it in the terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  There are also climate impacts.  Are we factoring this in?  If we are planning the fiscal future of the State out to 2070, are we actively taking account in our modelling of those long-term disruptive forces or presuming a business-as-usual model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021111700002#P00200"><p>First, I will address one or two of the Chair's questions to clarify.  We made a deliberate decision in terms of the data to ignore the <i>rip.ie</i>blip, for want of a better word, because we are looking at trends over time.  When we were settling our technical papers we had that conversation because our member, Seamus Coffey, was the first person to start on that particular analysis.  One could not tell whether it will be a blip or be sustained or whether it will have impact.  Now that we are in year two of a health emergency, some nations are starting to adjust downwards their life expectancy rates.  Whether that will be a blip or a trend, we decided to ignore it.<br/><br/>We also had a conversation about the pension reserve fund early in our work and a number or members had a view that maybe that was another part of the funding solution.  We came back after much analysis and decided that certainty was more important.  That is why our funding proposals are around social insurance and the Exchequer, which is recurring.  That is why we recommend the Exchequer contribution should be hardwired in.  Relying on occasional payments is not a way to fund something that is recurring and growing.  We discussed it but the Chair will not find it in the report because it was left out.<br/><br/>On Deputy Kerrane's questions, we will have to come back to her about page 132.  The Department ran models for us.  I do not know quite what the precise elements of the model it ran was.  It is better, as Mr. Flynn said, that we get it right.  There were some things included, I know that.<br/><br/>On the age 65 proposal, we decided that trying to define long hard-working lives was another complexity and debating point so we settled instead on years of contributions.  What is arduous for one might be fun for another.  I do not mean to be glib but some people like to go to work.  There is interesting stuff in the report on the labour market from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, which showed quite a number of people self-reporting that they want to remain at work.  We talked about that but reckoned the definitions could be tricky.<br/><br/>On Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's question, we did not envision a different future.  Our terms of reference, as we discussed at the beginning, were quite focused but we were clear in our own chats.  It is not in the report but we were clear in talking to colleagues that this would not be the last word.  It cannot be, because we are looking at sets of data and trends.  While we are modelling the cost out to 2070 based on the <i>status quo</i>, our age recommendations top at age 68.  We reckon another view would have to be taken of what the trend is then, what the world is like and what and the inputs are like on the funding side.  There are issues of sustainability and climate.  The impact of climate issues on the labour market is something we are only beginning to debate.  While we have labour market evidence in here relating to health, education, female participation and age, we have not factored in what happens if people, having learned in the last year and a half that they can work differently, adopt a new model.  The evidence was not there for us to do so.<br/><br/>A proposition was put to us by some submitters and in the previous work done on pensions that the pension age should be linked to life expectancy and we said we would not go that far because one would need to implement certain things, assess the new reality and form another set of proposals.  Nothing is ever set in stone.  We thought about whether to go beyond age 68 as an example and we decided going to 68 was enough and we would not link it to life expectancy.  That is partly connected to the Deputy's question about the nature of work in the future.  I do not know if that covers the various elements of the members' questions.  Ms Burke wants to add something.</p></speech>

There have been a good few questions today on the table in page 132.  On the previous page, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Commission considered it appropriate to review the wider expenditure impacts of changing the pension age rather than just considering the impact on State Pensions&rsquo; expenditure [alone], as expenditure on working age payments would increase as a result of an increased pension age. </blockquote> <p>It goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	Table 11.4 below sets out the impact of overall pension expenditure (which includes public sector pension and wider social protection payments) of changes to the State Pension age. </blockquote> <p>That might help with that question.<br/><br/>On Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's comments about looking to 2070, who knows what life will be like then?  The further you move out, the more uncertain things become.  Nobody three years ago could have predicted what has happened in the last year and a half.  It goes to show that things come which are unexpected.<br/><br/>We were mindful of the work the technical subcommittee did.  Any findings we thought would be useful to the Pensions Commission were based on looking at 2050.  We felt that was a point in time that was definable and which we could see.  That is what we focused on and then we said what we think happens if you go out to 2070.  Even in the infographic the Pensions Commission produced, the focus is on 2050 because the further you go out, my version of the world might be different from somebody else's version by that point.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. John Purcell, chairman of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, and Mr. Declan Gibbons, who is the station manager at Kilkenny Community Radio, presenting on behalf of CRAOL, who are here with us in committee room 3.  I also welcome Ms Mary Lennon, who is with us remotely.  She is the project co-ordinator from CRAOL and she will be joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that witnesses will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statement, which is limited to three minutes, I advise them of the following on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For anyone watching this meeting, in most instances Oireachtas Members and witnesses may now be physically present in the committee room or join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  At the moment we only have Senator Cassells and myself in here, so there is no fear of that for a while.  Those attending in the committee room are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p> <p>  I ask members to please identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, and to please mute their microphone when not contributing to reduce the background noise and feedback.  If joining remotely, I ask members to use the raised hand function when they wish to contribute.  I remind all those joining today's meeting to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Purcell to make his opening address.</p></speech>

In doing so, I am here with a sense of pride as to the very positive contribution that has been made by Irish radio, both independent radio and our colleagues in RT&Eacute;, during the months of dire emergency for society, our economy and our way of life.  I am also coming in a spirit of positivity, seeking to highlight what has worked, what we have learned, what challenges remain and what we can do together to address future challenges facing our country in which media play a very important role in.  Ultimately, we are all in this together.</p><p>I also want to speak of opportunities for the future and the power of our medium for positive change.  However, I must warn the committee that, despite our success achieved in the pandemic thanks to the courage, hard work, flexibility and creativity of our teams, as well as the support of the State, our sector remains fragile and action is needed to ensure that public service broadcasting, and that which we provide, is sustained and nurtured into the future.  </p><p> First, I will provide some context.  We have been in here over many years speaking about the fundamental threats, caused by a range of sectors, which are on the horizon in relation to our broadcast media.  Into this came Covd-19, which posed fundamental questions for our businesses, but, more importantly, for our society.  The prospect of having to cease operations stared many chief executives of Irish radio stations in the face in the opening stages of the pandemic, and I have spoken on this before.  However, I am glad to say the sector rose to the challenge and we have had what many consider to be radio's finest hour.  This was made possible by our teams as well as the imaginative Government support in the form of the special Covid-19 sound and vision scheme, which on top of all the other supports ensured the survival of our stations and underpinned the continuation of local coverage that was accurate, relevant, reliable and trusted.</p><p> That fund was introduced quickly; it was practical and fit for purpose.  It made a huge difference and it delivered value for money.  We believe it was instrumental in ensuring we could continue to perform throughout the pandemic.  Covid meant that the type of funding support for which we have argued for many years, where public money can be used for clearly defined purposes, was introduced in just months, where previously this would have seemed impossible.  It showed that when a need is recognised and action is taken, then a big difference can be made.  I circulated a document in advance which shows the listenership for Irish radio is in good shape.</p><p> However, Covid has not gone away, and as we speak, there are still many more twists and turns ahead and the fundamental problems and challenges for our business model remain.  For ten years before the pandemic, independent radio and our business model, along with many of our colleagues across other media, have been under pressure.  Our recovery has been fragile and is by no means assured into the long term.  </p><p> Beyond sectoral challenges for the media, I do not need to tell members the most critical threat that we face will be climate change.  This will perhaps be even greater than Covid, and it can only be reversed by concerted action by our citizens and our society.  In this effective community, communication will be a critical element, and radio can play a huge part.</p><p> Last week, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, organised an event for the broadcasting sector.  Dr. Dave Robbins, who is director of the centre for climate and society at Dublin City University, DCU, and who has studied the role of the media, highlighted the valuable role already played by local and independent radio.  There is far more that can be done and he highlighted how radio can play a significant part because we are a powerful medium for change.  We have shown the worth that we can return for investment through the Covid fund and we can do the same on climate change.</p><p> I urge members to use the good offices of this committee to help us work with the Minister and the Department to progress the establishment of a multi-annual fund geared towards the necessary public communication action required to combat the climate emergency.</p></speech>

We thought we would be looking backwards at Covid and the impact of it, but, unfortunately, it looks like it is going to be with us for some time to come.  Challenges remain and we look forward to being part of the solution to those challenges as well.</p> <p>  CRAOL, which is also called the community radio forum of Ireland, is the network of the Irish community radio sector.  We have more than 2,000 community radio volunteers, broadcasting weekly to almost 300,000 people from 21 fully licensed stations and almost 15 aspirant stations.  Our mission is to develop the community radio movement and to realise its potential to make a difference to the communities that its members are part of, delivering a social benefit to these communities.</p> <p>  Early in the pandemic, in April last year, we carried out a survey to determine the direct impact that Covid-19 was having on stations.  The purpose was to capture a snapshot of the situation across the 21 full-time, fully licensed member stations.  Some 17 stations responded; 16 of those were still broadcasting at the time of survey and one had reportedly ceased operations temporarily due to Covid.  Two stations reported increasing their hours, one of which was to facilitate leaving certificate subjects to be aired, and the remaining stations stated that they had to reduce their hours of broadcasting.</p> <p>  Broadcasting hours varied across individual stations, ranging from 40 hours per week to the full 168 per week, with all stations reporting changes to programming and schedules.  The reasons for these changes were a direct result of governmental restrictions regarding social distancing, cocooning, working from home and non-essential travel.  In fairness to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, it was quite understanding and has been quite flexible in that regard.  Changes included a reduction in the production of programmes, shifting to remote programming, ceasing live programmes, broadcasting archived programmes and content changes, such as more health related topics, programmes for elderly and broadcasting religious services.  Three stations were working completely remotely, and to facilitate remote working, a variety of software and hardware was being used.  Stations reported that boards and management committees had implemented measures that included facilitating remote working, exercising social distancing in the workplace, promotion of infection control, limiting the number of staff and volunteers at the station at any given time and maintaining communication with staff and volunteers through apps like Zoom and Google Hangouts.</p> <p>  We commissioned a follow-up survey in November of this year.  Many issues remain for the stations.  Many of the volunteers who populate stations were older or in high-risk categories and many stopped coming to the stations, resulting in the loss of good people and resources.  Pre-Covid community stations were lively social hubs that gathered many volunteers and contributors daily in their offices and the studios, and this is now gone as the ongoing Covid is heavily limiting the presence of members on the premises.  Only some volunteers want to record their programmes from home or had the skills and means to do so, and stations had to adapt to a whole new system very quickly.  This brought to light the inadequacy of facilities as some stations that operate from very small spaces and this led to volunteer displacement.  Volunteers who are dependent on public transport are wary of coming to the station, and high turnover of volunteers and staff during the pandemic has brought with it a loss of experience.</p> <p>  On the income side of things, stations are reliant on delivering training and local communities and businesses to support the running costs.  During Covid, many small businesses were closed and it was much more difficult to raise finance.  Measures and health and safety are limiting the offerings for training, summer camps, and work placements for students, etc.  In addition, the possibility of running any kind of fundraiser was severely restricted, and usually community fundraisers are ongoing challenges for the stations.</p></speech>

You will be able to raise these points again.  I appreciate the opening statements.  We will proceed to the question and answer session, where members will be asking questions.  A rota has been circulated to members.  We will stick strictly to the five minutes, and that is five minutes for questions and answers.  If I end up interrupting the witnesses, I am not being rude but we have another session after this.  Hopefully, once we get through the members' rota, we might be able to go for a second round of questions.

It is increasingly a challenge as to how we deal with misinformation and disinformation.  We saw it during the course of the pandemic and we are still dealing with it.  Equally, with regard to the points on climate change, there are people who are climate change sceptics and who are trying to spread misinformation.  There is an important role for community and local radio stations to provide factual information and to challenge if a platform is provided to climate sceptics.</p><p>Can the witnesses talk a bit more about their roles in that area, in particular where they see radio promoting increased digital and media literacy, especially in the sphere of misinformation and disinformation?  I welcome the acknowledgement of the very extensive supports that have been made available by Government.  This had to happen for the business community more widely, but we are now going to be moving into a situation whereby we are going to be rebuilding our communities.  We will face difficulty for the next while, but communities will have to come back together.  What role do the witnesses see for community and local radio stations in stressing the positives in our communities and helping them to rebuild as we recover?</p></speech>

Not too much of the time, but a large amount of the time, the public discourse at a national level and, indeed, an international level is on millions of tonnes, polar ice caps and the big macro picture.  In order to change the behaviour of our citizens, we need to make it local, relevant and so on.  In the early stages of the Covid pandemic, funding was made available whereby independent stations tendered, so to speak, for what initiatives they would undertake to increase public information.  This ranged from daily health slots to financial advice, people telephoning with problems, programmes for mental health and all of that kind of thing.  That could be replicated on climate change and those issues.  Following local families that are leading the way in adapting to the climate emergency is another way.</p> <p>  On digital literacy and misinformation, we already support a number of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, initiatives in that respect.  However, it is addressed through programming and through teasing out the issues locally and so on.  To do that, we will need resources and support because such programming is not commercially viable in its own right, but it is necessary to safeguard our democracy and increase the literacy of our citizens.</p></speech>

Mr. Purcell spoke about those things being broken down.  We looked at the 17 goals.  When we first looked at them, we wondered whether we could relate to any of them.  However, when you get into them, much of it is relatable to our business, for want of a better description, and our sector.  It is something in which we have decided to play an active part and be leaders in.</p> <p>  We have been able to demonstrate how community radio is implementing those kind of things on the ground by facilitating NGOs and local groups which are active in the community and giving them an opportunity and allowing people to talk about facts rather than scaremongering and that type of thing that goes on.  </p> <p>  The former CEO of BAI said in the last two years that community radio has been the single largest contributor to media literacy in recent decades.  There are huge challenges there in the whole remote space at the moment, but once we get back to a person-to-person situation, community media has great opportunity to increase media literacy.  In addition, we will be creative in the meantime in finding technologies that will improve that and allow us to do that.</p></speech>

Part of that was embracing technology.  One of the things that community stations do really well is deliver training to and upskilling members of the community, and especially those hard to reach communities.  That was one of the things that the stations excelled at.  They were able to adapt and change and keep their stations on air, but also keep their volunteers and communities engaged and informed of what was happening.</p></speech>

That is the best way, but to do that you need to have a sustainable media sector.</p></speech>

The figures were given by Mr. Purcell of the increase in listenership, and that is due to the fact that it is a trusted media source, and it is important that it is maintained.  A couple of colleagues and I had numerous meetings with the local media - local newspapers,  local radio and community radio - and earlier in the year put in a submission to the Future of Media Commission.  One of the conclusions we came to was the need for a diverse range of media coverage of local activity and strong journalism, both of which are essential for our local communities.</p> <p>  The content created continues to be relevant, but the way that audience accesses that content is rapidly changing.  With that change, the traditional way an organisation can earn money is under serious threat.  We have to look beyond Covid, although how far away that is, we do not know.  However, it is important the support mechanisms that were there previously are kept by Government.  We have to develop a framework that will allow this change to happen in a sustainable way for the witnesses' organisations to be able to survive and continue to give us that trusted news.</p> <p>  Part of our proposal was basically replacing the television licence fee with the public service media charge.  We could bring in in the region of an extra &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million into that fund, and make that fund available across all media, be it written media, local radio, regional radio or community radio.  Support would come through the Future of Media Commission, which was set up.  What are the witnesses' views on that proposal and is that something they would support? </p></speech>

It was due in July but has yet to see the light of day.  Our concern across the media is that this will drift and it will be just another report.  We very much welcome the idea of funding support, such that Senator Carrigy outlined.  We are agnostic on the means of delivery as that is a political decision but we would urge is action.</p> <p>  There is equally a delay in the enactment of the online safety and media regulation Bill, and that is putting off the day when the damage being done by online harms can be addressed.  It is also creating uncertainty in our industry over regulation and licence renewal, and these are serious issues for us.  We welcome suggestions of funding, but we have a concern about the timing.  Action needs to be taken now because the speed of change on the ground in broadcasting is very quick.  However, the speed of change on the framework, which we have been experiencing, is glacial. </p></speech>

Nobody loves regulation at the start, but we are well used to it and it has provided robust structures and it means we can stand over what we do.</p><p>That is still completely lacking in the online sector, and something needs to be done about that because there is no sign of a level playing pitch at all.  The amount of revenue that is heading online to an unregulated space is something that has to remain a concern for all media and for diversity and plurality in the country.  That is important.</p><p> On threats to the model, apart from environmental sustainability for community radio, just sustainability and survival are absolute constants and are absolutely essential.  However, it is not our business to decide what the model is.  We think the model needs to be robust if there is to be a media charge that will be shared out among what might be called traditional media.  It has to be something that is sustainable.</p></speech>

They lifted the spirit of rural Ireland.  As politicians, people phone us often, and there are many people out there who are very lonely and isolated, and the witnesses' organisations helped to raise their spirits and helped to ease their minds.  I thank them very much for that.</p> <p>  This question has probably been asked but I would like to ask Mr. Purcell about the real impact broadcasting can have on the climate change campaign.  Can he give us an example of how it can be used to change people's mindsets?</p> <p>  The Covid sound and vision fund was a much-needed financial support for the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI.  How important is it now to take steps to set up an annual fund to getting message across and to combat, as Mr. Purcell said, the conspiracy theorists and propaganda on climate change?  We have very powerful actors acting against climate change.  For example, we have a former President of the United States, so there are very powerful actors out there.</p> <p>  In regard to Community Radio Form of Ireland, CRAOL, the witnesses outlined the many difficulties Covid has caused rural radio stations, particularly the voluntary sector.  What is needed now for these rural stations to continue and survive?  How can we, an Oireachtas committee, help to alleviate some of the pressures they are under?</p></speech>

As I said, most are concentrating on fundraising on an ongoing basis, and that means that it takes away from their ability to deliver on the ground elsewhere, as far as the cynicism on climate change, etc., is concerned.  As I said, we are very much part of that.  We allow voices to get on air and we have the luxury, if you like, whereby we can give groups an extensive amount of time to air their views.  Rather than just having an "I did not interrupt you, you did not interrupt me" type programme, we can give people the space to do that, whether they are professionals or volunteers.  That is really important because while we might be based on a voluntary model, we are still subject to the same regulations.  Therefore, there are guarantees provided for the listener and the public.</p></speech>

However, we need staff to do that and, currently, as I said, our business model is in a fragile state.  It was never more fragile than during Covid, but when the proper supports were put in, we were able to rise to the occasion.</p> <p>  In terms of practical help that we could receive, I would ask this committee to work with us, to take the lessons learned from the success of the Covid scheme and to try to apply it to other areas, especially climate change.  There are other areas, such as the support of Irish culture, and we have done an Irish music month with another sound and vision scheme.  We can learn the lesson and move on, so that the magnificent response to Covid is not just a one-off and that we do the same again.  Unfortunately, and I do not mean to be confrontational when I say it, but there is a feeling that if we wait for the delivery of the report, the enactment of the appropriate legislation and so on, it will be too late.  We need support now.</p></speech>

A person may ask what he or she can do as he or she is only one person.  That is what community media can concentrate on and work with the communities on.</p> <p>  On what is needed for the community radio sector, no more than the independent sector, community radio has expenses, such as the insurance, licences and all the overheads, but it is providing a social benefit within the community and is covering all the topics that promote community cohesion and community living.  There could be more assistance with programme costs for community stations.</p></speech>

I apologise if this has been covered as I had to leave the meeting for a moment.  I want to ask about the integration of the broadcasting (amendment) Bill into the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I suppose this concerns the independent commercial broadcasters and, as the witnesses know well, the community stations.  In terms of the community station, it is an exemption from the broadcasting levy.  In terms of the commercial radio station, it is a greater flexibility of the advertising times, and that piqued my interest when I heard it.  I would like to hear a response from the independent broadcasters.  Is that something that has been sought by the independent radio sector for some time?  Were the advertising times too rigid?  In all of this, I am thinking about the listener.  However, I understand that the witnesses' competition is Spotify and subscription services where there are no ads.  My concern would be that we would be moving gradually towards a smaller broadcasting hour, as you might call it in television production, and which must be the same in radio.  I would welcome a response on the waiving of the levy for the community radio stations and the advertising time for the commercial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021111700002#D01000"><p>On the advertising minuteage and flexibility, currently the maximum is ten minutes per hour, and that is each hour.  What we are seeking is that it can be averaged over a number of hours.  For example, if a radio station is doing a live match commentary, because of the particular broadcast format, it is unable to put advertising in it.  It might not have been match commentary during the height of the pandemic; it might have been mass, for example, which was broadcast on many stations.  You cannot broadcast ads during that particular time, so maybe you could do four minutes of ads in one hour and ten minutes in the next hour, which is the maximum.  For those 14 minutes, we would ask that we could do four in one hour and 12 in the next hour so we could balance it.  We would not seek to do that the whole time but it is about that flexibility.  At the moment, it is very rigid.  This points out the rigidness of the way that we are regulated.  This issue has been going on for years.</p><p>It is about whether you can do ten minutes in one hour and 11 minutes in another hour, nine minutes in one and eight in another.  Meanwhile nothing is being done about the use of data by the online operators under discussion.  The idea of the advertising minute is a good examplar of the burden under which we operate, unlike those who operate online.  In regard to the amendments, we have argued consistently that we would like to see the broadcasting levy removed for independent radio also so that we can invest that money in journalism.  We have asked for that also for many years.  The key thing is that the amalgamation, or integration, of the broadcasting (amendment) Act with the online safety and media regulation Bill is that it is done sooner rather than later.  At the moment there is regulatory uncertainty.  The re-licensing process for radio stations is due to begin in the next 18 months and we currently do not know how that will be handled.</p></speech>

That is something we sought for a long time.  There are two aspects to this.  There is the financial cost of the levy, but also the process was extremely unwieldy and placed quite a burden on stations with very limited resources.  Apart from a financial burden it was an administrative burden.  We very much welcome that development.</p> <p>  Throughout Covid-19 there was only one campaign run by Government Departments, which was a Covid-19 information campaign, in which community stations were included.  As far as sustainability is concerned, we would like to be included in the very many Government information campaigns and State information campaigns.  If our stations had access to those, and if they were automatically included in those, it would have a huge impact on incomes and sustainability.  </p></speech>

One is advertising agency revenue, which would be the big multinational, national and Government spending and so on.  That has recovered very well and is performing well.  Local advertising revenue is still down, typically by between 20% and 30%.  There was a strong rebound in the months of July, August, September and October.  November has largely stopped now because of the unfortunately gloomier Covid-19 outlook.  December is uncertain.

Retaining staff is not unique to the broadcasting sector.  The training body for the radio industry, Learning Waves, did a report during Covid-19.  One of the issues that came to light was the high levels of stress suffered by many staff, primarily journalists at the front line of dealing with much of the stuff because during the pandemic many people contacted newsrooms with distressing stories and so on.  There is both the aspect of it being a tough job, and the aspect regarding the financial viability of the sector and the salaries that can be offered given the competition from online media.  As Mr. Gibbons said, the uncertainty around the whole so-called traditional media sector which, when people are constantly talking about the demise of radio and traditional media, may sometimes not make it the most attractive career choice.</p></speech>

We made a submission to this committee which reflects the bulk of them.  The main direction of travel of our feeling on it is that there cannot be too much concentration put on the regulation of online media.  The definition of harm may put it into most egregious extents of the harm.  I think much of the harm of social media is in the gradual and small things.</p><p>Mr. Gibbons and I were speaking about it before.  Ideally, I would like to see the same standards of fairness, accuracy, balance, good taste and so on that apply to traditional media applied to social media as well.  I do not think the online safety and media regulation Bill does that but it is a start.</p></speech>

We have not made representations since because we have been awaiting the publication of the Future of Media Commission.  We expected that in July, then in September, so the position our organisation took was that it would be counterproductive to jump the gun pending the publication of that.  It is apparent to us now that this does not seem to be coming any time soon so we are trying to move on.  We will make representations to the Minister very shortly in that respect.  As I said in my presentation, if we just wait for the publication at this stage, it is too long.  Presumably it will be published, debated in the committee and in the D&aacute;il, then there will be draft legislation and so on.

We are able to apply to the general round of sound and vision, and in the past two years, 2020 and 2021, a special single community fund or community round was brought in.  Last year it was &euro;750,000 in total.  This year it is &euro;500,000 due to budgetary constraints.  That is among all stations.  If you divide that by 21, it does not amount to a great deal of money, but it is obviously very welcome and it is a bit more targeted than in the past.  Community radio can also apply to the more general sound and vision rounds, as they have done.  However, as I mentioned, as far as being on the list or the Departments' registers for advertising campaigns, whether about Covid-19, health and so on, unfortunately, we have great trouble being considered and being employed in that regard.  We think that is very important for the future.</p></speech>

That will be arranged.  We will move on now because we are over time again.  It is on to me at this point.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that both commercial and community radio have been superb, particularly during Covid-19, in terms of broadcasting, excellent news bulletins and factual information, especially the daytime shows that many of the commercial radio stations run programmes which had discussions, experts and debates.  It was fantastic.  In my own area, such stations as C103, 96FM and Red FM from a commercial point of view and Bere Island radio, which is a community radio station at the very western tip of west Cork, all played a fantastic role during Covid-19 and I must acknowledge that.  That is the importance of having the witnesses in here today and having these discussions.</p> <p>  I have some questions.  The witnesses say listenership is up in general but revenue appears to be down.  I assume the drop in revenue is attributable to the fact that businesses found it incredibly tough during Covid-19 and had less income to target towards advertising.  Is there any evidence or any statistics that local businesses and SMEs in particular benefit greatly from advertising on local radio stations?</p></speech>

In our radio station we have had clients since we started 17 years ago and they would not do it unless they got results.  I am delighted that the IBI is involved with our colleagues in RT&Eacute; in establishing a new body called Radiocentre Ireland, which is going to provide case studies of the effectiveness.  The difficulty is that our revenue situation is very dynamic at the moment.  In the first three months of this year it was very difficult.  There was a recovery but not back to previous levels.  Many stations - not all - for the first six months of this year got benefits from the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and were able to keep going.  The recovery was good from July onwards but we are into unknown territory again now.  There are a number of factors.  Sometimes businesses just do not open again.  Sometimes businesses have gone online and developed the habit of just operating online.  It is a complex picture, but I would say very strongly that advertising works.</p></speech>

Just as is the case with content, the regulations governing online advertising are as nothing compared with radio.  Colleagues have probably seen examples of bogus advertising where well-known public figures appear to endorse products online.  Try that on a radio station and you will be closed down within a week.</p></speech>

The climate action discussion is important and I agree with Mr. Purcell about trying to reach some of the climate sceptics.</p><p>It is important to try to reach the audience where climate change sceptics are making an impression.  Mr. Purcell is right in wanting to relate it to how climate change is impacting people on the ground.  The most obvious examples are more common and frequent flooding events in coastal towns but also in inland towns that have rivers; those are perfect examples.  A big issue impacting my neck of the woods is coastal erosion, because we are getting more frequent storms and rising sea levels and we are seeing parts of the coast eroded away.  There is going to be a significant cost associated with that.  What is the strategy in making that more accessible and reaching that audience?</p></speech>

The challenge in respect of climate change is that, and I am no expert, many people think that the solution is out there and external to themselves.  We can be very effective in getting across to people that the solution to the global problem is local.  We want people to think globally and act locally, as the saying goes, and we are ideally poised to do that.</p></speech>

For example, I would love for my station to have a full-time environmental correspondent who does nothing other than reaching out to community groups, local businesses and agricultural organisations and discusses with them the issues that they face and then brings that into news coverage and daily programming, and maybe do a special climate programme as well.  However, at the moment, we do not have the resources to do that.  We are trying to up our climate coverage working with local organisations, etc.  Society needs a step change in action and, equally, broadcasters need a step change in action as well to help bring about the change.  We cannot do that without significant support.</p></speech>

We need a base model of funding provided there.  I would like community stations, in particular, to be considered and included, and not just considered and ignored, in public spending campaigns, of which there are many.  We are not included in JNLR research; it is important to mention that.  That is by regulation from the BAI.  Its view of the community sector is that we are here to deliver social benefit and there should not be a focus on listenership.  Many of our commercial supporters locally, which are businesses that support us, will support us to a certain degree because they support us and they are in favour of us, but, ultimately, the conversation will be about how many listeners we have.  We do not have the same mechanism to provide that information.</p></speech>

Colleagues were asking, including Senator Cassels in particular, about the number of staff and so on.  How difficult is it for stations to ensure they can continue to guarantee to provide that trusted, well researched content?  I am very conscious that in our own case in South East Radio, as Senator Mythen said, there is a limited number of staff with limited time to research some of the background material.  There would not be the same resources in a local community-based radio station.  Are there any ways in which it can be more effectively done in pooling resources?  How can local commercial radio continue to provide that level of expertise and knowledge to research the facts in an increasingly competitive environment?  I can understand that it is very difficult for a presenter if they do not have a team of researchers.  How will they be expected to challenge climate sceptics or those who are spreading misinformation on the vaccine?  What supports can be put in place to most effectively do that?</p></speech>

If a station has a news reader, a programme presenter, and a producer, and any of them have young children and one of them is sent home as a close contact, its morning show and news bulletins can be very challenged.  To put it into context, in the station where I work, we have three journalists providing 12-hour news during the day, from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m., one producer and a presenter for a two-hour morning show, and a presenter and a part-time broadcast assistant for another talk show.  In that environment, it is very difficult, when holidays or sick leave have to be covered and so on, to do the step change necessary to do environmental coverage.  It comes down to extra staff and extra team members.  With the strained resources that we operate under at the best of times, it is particularly difficult.  In the onslaught of the constant undermining of the business model, it is just getting harder and harder.  That is the reality of it.</p></speech>

It is a danger that if a resource is given and it is not pointed in a particular direction, it might not go where the need is greatest at a given time.  Therefore, a targeted measure, such as the bursary or a support towards journalism, where there has to be a person there and the funding is accounted for means the station's resources can be improved on an ongoing basis.  I agree that the need is huge.</p></speech>

However, what happens with the pooling of resources is that the local nature comes out.  For example, if someone goes from a local station covering one county to a regional focus, inevitably, the local flavour will be lost to some extent.  In addition, the money that ultimately will be saved will not be huge.  Therefore, the benefits of investment far outweigh the benefits of retrenchment and reducing and spreading the already scarce resources on a thinner basis.</p></speech>

How many staff are part time?  As Senator Cassels raised, have they lost many young journalists?  With young journalists probably earning approximately &euro;25,000 a year, they can go to other areas.  Are they haemorrhaging some of those people?  How many people are working part time because of Covid?</p></speech>

Turnover of staff is an issue.  I do not know how to address it in any more detail than that.

Something along the line of the bursary scheme I mentioned would help to improve resources.  To go back to Senator Byrne's point, we have what is called a community radio news desk, which is where the resources of stations are pooled and sent to one station, and it is filtered out there.  However, again, it is all about resources.  If we had a little bit more, we could have more of that and improve the quality of what is available.  I agree with the point Mr. Purcell made as well.  That it is grand when it is about a topic that is of quite a general nature, but if something is very locally done in a community station, it does not always transfer.</p></speech>

Before I invite witnesses to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes each, I advise them of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that her or she complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  As some of our witnesses are attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, please note there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.</p><p>Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded that the provisions of Standing Orders, in relation to matters which are <i>sub judice</i>, place an onus on members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  Therefore, I will not permit any discussion or questioning which relates to any current litigation or investigation in the course of this meeting.<br/><br/>I call on our witnesses to make their opening statements, for which they have three minutes. I call Dr. Karan Casey from FairPl&eacute;. </p></speech>

We are a feminist volunteer organisation established in January 2018 to achieve gender balance and fairness in Irish traditional and folk music.  Initially advocating for equal opportunities, it became increasingly evident that it was impossible to separate issues relating to gender representation and discrimination from those of gender-based harassment and violence.</p> <p>  Inequality in representation was being supported by workplace culture which turns a blind eye to harassment and the assault of women.  From the onset, our members began receiving unprompted, confidential disclosures of harassment and assault from women across the scene, so much so that it was clear an endemic problem existed.  In 2020, the MiseFosta campaign brought further serious allegations of sexual abuse, assault, coercion and harassment to wider public attention, which in turn led to an ever-increasing number of disclosures, which continues to this day.</p> <p>   For almost four years we have worked tirelessly as volunteers to raise awareness and to address these issues and are very grateful for the support we have received to date.  However, we have also been subjected to significant amounts of abuse, backlash and a closing of ranks.  Time and energy spent on this work has been, and continues to be, at the expense of our own craft, while perpetrators continue to earn. </p> <p>  We are proud of what we have achieved and the influence we have had.  We are proud of the solidarity that has grown between our sister organisations across the arts.  We support the work of the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, and the recommendations as set out in its report and welcome the package of measures announced by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p> <p>  However, the situation is grave and the measures should be far more ambitious.  First, all public arts funding must be subject to strict conditions to address gender-based harassment, discrimination and violence, which includes implementing and maintaining up-to-date anti-harassment policies and procedures.  Second, a statutory independent body should be established which can receive disclosures and be given the power to investigate claims of discrimination or harassment affecting those not currently protected by existing law, such as freelance or self-employed workers.  Finally, funding must be increased drastically.  The initial funding for implementation of the measures promised is woefully inadequate.  We want to ensure the Department is committed to ensuring that these measures are sustainable and not simply a one-off.  Our briefing document provides more details on these and further recommendations.  </p> <p>  These measures are long-term, sustainable solutions which will benefit us all.  However, if action is not taken, more women and marginalised groups remain at risk.  FairPl&eacute; therefore urges you all to take this seriously and address this urgently to secure a safe, respectful and inclusive working environment for all in the arts. </p> <p>  I thank all of the women who have very bravely come forward with their stories and thank all of the campaigners.  In our deliberations today, let us keep centre stage the women who have been traumatised and think of their needs at all times.  </p></speech>

Our main aim as a collective is to change the culture of abuse within the Irish traditional music and dance scene.  It began in a very organic way in June 2020 through an Instagram story that I posted, highlighting some of the abusive behaviour that had been going on.  Lockdown gave everyone much time to think, and we quickly realised that many of us had spent more time consoling friends who had experienced sexual assault at recent festivals than we had spent enjoying the music.  The speed at which the movement gained traction was the thing that surprised us all; from a post on my personal account, to hundreds of people, the vast majority of whom were girls and young women, coming forward, and an "RT&Eacute; Investigates" episode helping to shine a light on what was happening, where a number of brave women stepped forward to tell their stories.</p> <p>  It was soon clear that many knew that abuse was happening on some scale, but nobody wanted to or felt that they could speak up about it.  We realise now that although the nature of abuse is not unique to the traditional scene, there are certain endemic features that act as enabling mechanisms for abuse within the scene.  These mechanisms facilitate and almost promote abusive behaviour, and also make it hard to talk about or address.  For example, we are an incredibly tight-knit community with many unregulated social situations, which can be lovely, but it can also mean that your abuser is your fiddle teacher, a family friend, a well-respected musician or in your friend group.  We have had reports that speaking out against abuse has lost people gigs, friendships, touring opportunities and invited further harassment through victim blaming, social isolation and ostracisation. </p> <p>  We have had amazing positive responses for the most part, but some have been less supportive, with people disregarding women&rsquo;s stories as &ldquo;salacious gossip&rdquo;, &ldquo;defiling our wholesome tradition&rdquo; and &ldquo;ruining men&rsquo;s careers&rdquo;.  This leads me to believe that the image and reputation of the tradition is seen as more important than the safety of those who make up that tradition. </p> <p>  It is not feasible or realistic to expect victims, especially those who are young, to tackle this on their own. I have often asked myself why a group of young people in their teens and early twenties are dealing with hundreds of stories of abuse and have people in higher and more influential positions turn to us and ask what to do next.  It is not our responsibility; it is the responsibility of those institutions and companies that promote, run, organise and receive State funding for and profit from the traditional music. </p> <p>  MiseFosta greatly appreciates the chance to come and speak to the committee.  We support the ITI&rsquo;s work and recommendations; it is a step in the right direction but there is still much more to be done.  As we quickly begin the transition between having been a predominantly social media run movement to the return of in-person festivals and gigs, time is not on our side. </p></speech>

I acknowledge Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Maoldomhnaigh, general secretary of Comhaltas Ceoltoir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, and Majella Bartley, ardchl&aacute;raitheoir, our general registrar.</p> <p>  Comhaltas Ceoltoir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann welcomes the Speak Up: A Call for Change initiative by the Minster, Deputy Catherine Martin, and congratulates the Minister, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, the Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and all involved in its development.  It is a timely report fostering a safer and more respectful environment for the arts. </p> <p>  During the past year, Comhaltas restated and widely distributed, internally and externally, its long-standing mission and ethos statement, Who We Are: Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann&rsquo;s Vision, Values, Mission and Ethos, which are guided by many principles.  The essence of our movement is that it is all-embracing and inclusive of everyone regardless of race, religion or ability.  The core values of our services have always been underpinned by honesty, openness, fairness, the dignity of each person, free from harassment, anti-sectarian and anti-racist.  We believe in the intrinsic value of every person and we aim to further the dignity of all associated with our movement.  We want each individual to avail of opportunities for self-expression in the pursuit of Irish traditional music, song, dance and language.  We promote inclusivity and equal opportunity for all regardless of gender, marital status, sexual orientation, age, disability, religious belief, or lack thereof, race, ethnicity or nationality.  As a community participation-based intergenerational movement, Comhaltas supports the advancement of these values across the overall culture and arts sector and the elimination of any damaging behaviour.  </p> <p>  We are voluntary organisation with 430 branches in Ireland and 18 countries, all dedicated to the preservation, promotion and development of the Irish cultural traditions, delivering services throughout the island of Ireland, the Irish diaspora and across the globe.</p><p>Comhaltas&rsquo;s 18 cultural centres support its voluntary structures that collectively provide services to 3 million people annually.  A multifaceted organisation, Comhaltas is widely acknowledged for its unparalleled contribution to the vibrancy of Irish traditional music today, especially among young people.  This has largely been achieved through our holistic educational programme.  The various strands of this programme are facilitated and delivered through our democratic structures, as are all Comhaltas events at every level up to and including Fleadh Cheoil na hEireann, which consistently attracts some 500,000 people.</p><p> Cothroma&iacute;ocht: Respect, Equality, Opportunity, offers an insight into the scale and scope of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann's, CCE&rsquo;s, activities and projects.  It details statistically CCE's status in relation to gender balance throughout the organisation and outlines our intended delivery of a range of training and mentoring supports and resources at all levels, designed to advance further a positive and lasting culture of respect and dignity throughout Comhaltas and the overall Irish cultural sector.  Throughout 70 years in existence, we have remained committed to the ideals of providing appropriate opportunities for young people and all those who engage with the Irish cultural traditions, providing opportunities for self-expression and enabling them to reach their full potential.  Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann looks forward to working with the Minister and the Department in the advancement of Cothroma&iacute;ocht: Respect, Equality and Opportunity.</p></speech>

We will now have questions from members.  There are five minutes each for members for questions and answers.  For witnesses attending remotely, should they wish to elaborate on any of the statements or answers, they can raise their hand and we will give them an opportunity to come in after members put their questions.  If I do interrupt or cut across, it is because we are sticking to the five-minute time limit because we only have until 4.30.  That said, there may be an opportunity for a second round of questions.</p></speech>

I wish to commend some people, while at the same time acknowledging I will, unfortunately, leave out some people, for which I apologise.  I appreciate the huge amount of work going on to create a level playing field in the arts and to create an environment free from bullying, harassment and sexual assault.  That work ranges from Waking the Feminists to Women in Comedy and Women in Poetry, as well as Linda Coogan Byrne and the Why Not Her campaign and people who have experienced damaging behaviour and who now say enough is enough, they do not want to settle for the <i>status quo</i>.  This is the first in a series of discussions we will have on a safe and respectful working environment in the arts.  We will invite the Arts Council, the Irish Theatre Institute and perhaps the Minister to respond to our report at the end.</p><p>I commend, as others have done, the Irish Theatre Institute on its recent publication, A Call for Change (Towards Creating a Safe &amp;amp; Respectful Working Environment for the Arts).  I would welcome people's response to that report.  I also thank Dr. &Uacute;na Monaghan for the work and research she has done showing how gender affects participation in traditional and folk music.</p><p>I thank Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in for sharing her story.  I express my solidarity with the people who came out to talk about their experiences online.  I commend the musicians who spoke on the RT&Eacute; &quot;Prime Time&quot; documentary about abuse and acknowledge that their bravery led to the MiseFosta movement online.  I love folk music, I love the scene and I perform gigs, so I am conscious our traditional and folk music depends on the next generation to carry on its cultural wealth.  We are the tradition bearers.  It is important that young people from all backgrounds who are interested in music can learn, practise and perform in an environment free from harassment and abuse.  My hope is the bravery of all those who have spoken out is reflected in action.  The Minister is up for that.  I note the improvements called for by the witnesses relating to the actions that follow on from the Speak Up report. </p><p>What are the power dynamics within the sector that have prevented the campaigns from reaching their goals?  What are the public arts funding conditions being sought?  Why do the witnesses seek an independent body?  Regarding Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann, I draw on the recommendations from the report.  With regard to recommendation 1 in the Speak Up: A Call for Change report, has Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann considered working across the arts sector with other leading organisations in regard to recommendation 1?  This recommendation states:</p> <blockquote> 	Demonstrate leadership and building cross-sectoral support for change.<br /><br />Strong and committed leadership is needed in order to build confidence across the sector and that negative behaviours will not be tolerated and that there will be consequences for those perpetrating bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, humiliation, victimisation, assault and sexual assault. </blockquote> <p>One of the recommended actions is building cross-sectoral leadership and best practice to build a zero-tolerance approach to harmful behaviour in the arts.  Has Comhaltas considered working across the sector on that?  On recommendation 2, to strengthen reporting and support systems, every branch of Comhaltas must have a direct liaison person to be accepted and recognised as an official branch.  They are not elected positions; they are appointed.  Does Comhaltas have confidence in the support systems and reporting systems in place within branches, and do they extend to the wider events that take place around Fleadh Cheoil na hEireann, beyond the official structures?</p></speech>

I call Dr. Casey</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karan Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021111700002#M00700"><p>On the power dynamics and why FairPl&eacute; has not reached its goals, we have been working, unpaid, for nearly four years, but the structural framework and power dynamic within our sector, which is folk and traditional music, make it difficult to enact change.  In fairness to FairPl&eacute; and MiseFosta, we have initiated a conversation, but there needs to be more engagement from leadership.  There is very little deep engagement, and we need that for our cultural shift.  It should not be left up to victims of serious sexual assault and harassment to make that cultural shift.</p> <p>  One of the main issues that Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in alluded to in her beautiful speech was that we are a very close-knit community which is predominated by very powerful men who have not engaged.  This discourages other people from engaging.  By continuing to be silent on this issue, they enable predators.  There are many predators.  FairPl&eacute; is in receipt of information on predators it should not be in receipt of.  We do not need to be.  I do not need this in my life.  They enable men to continue to tour.  They are in their bands, they are not being taken out of their bands, even though it is known they have committed crimes.  Only last week there were reports of two predators being back on the scene in two cities in Ireland.</p> <p>  I was appalled after the "Prime Time" programme when many of the stakeholders within folk and traditional music did not come out in support of MiseFosta, which is ,and I do not mean to be patronising, a group of young people who should not have the work they have had over the past year and a half.</p><p> I feel that, for musicians, these people seem to be tone deaf.  They want to blaze out on tour and, in terms of predators going to festivals - and we are all going back out to work now - what has protected us, in effect, in the past two years or so has been the lockdown.  I was on a gig and there was somebody in the building.  Only for the Covid-19 restrictions, I would have had to meet him.  I am now looking at taking gigs next year and judging who will be at those.  I will have to plan my gigs around that, deciding whether I should go because I do not want to meet that person.</p><p> It has to be said, none of us are independently wealthy.  We are all struggling, as many artists are, so it is an impossible situation.  Somebody needs to take this burden of responsibility away from us.  Somebody needs to put these Bills in motion, fulfil the recommendations of the ITI, set up an independent body to which people can make disclosures and roll out a policy package that talks about consent, not written by the Catholic Church, and talks about how somebody on the ground can deal with something if it happens.</p></speech>

I will answer the first and then pass over to Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Maoldomhnaigh, our ardruna&iacute; and national liaison for vetting, child protection, vulnerable adults and that remit for Comhaltas.  Regarding the Senator's question on Comhaltas engaging in a cross-sectoral manner, the principles and values we espouse are across every aspect of society and every aspect of the arts.  It is a given that we co-operate.  We as an organisation whose prime focus has been with young people have always had a proactive leadership role in terms of responsibility to create and nurture within the community of Comhaltas, not just as service providers but also to those who receive our services, a legacy and a lasting impact of respect and dignity where any form of harassment is not supported.  In our document on our forthcoming plan and its implementation, you will find that reaches out.  On the subject of child protection and vulnerable adults, and the issue of a designated liaison person, I will pass over to Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Maoldomhnaigh to deal with that question.</p></speech>

Many of them have been revetted on a three-year cycle.  We have a structure in place to make sure the people employed to deliver services, such as teachers, have to go through that vetting, and we work very closely with the national vetting bureau on that.</p> <p>  Our child protection policy documents are available to view online and branches are recommended to have their own child protection policy document.  They also do risk assessments in relation to child protection and vulnerable adults-----</p></speech>

I will start with FairPl&eacute;, and perhaps Dr. Casey, Ms N&iacute; Charra or Ms Cusack can answer.  Will they comment on the Minister's response to the Speak Up: A Call for Change report?  They hinted that deficiencies remain.  What are those deficiencies?  As we are pushed for time, I will go through my questions and then allow the witnesses to answer.  In a follow-up to that, have the witnesses any detail on what kind of agency should be created to deal with complaints?  In the briefing document, section 16.3, it was mentioned that the Minister did not provide for an anonymous centralised reporting facility, and it outlines in some detail in sections 35 to 43 the need for a statutory independent body.  Will the witnesses outline information in that regard?</p> <p>  The witnesses also spoke about funding and how it needs to be drastically increased and how it is woefully inadequate.  Do they know what the funding gap is, between what is provided now and what is needed going forward?  Can we have a breakdown on that?</p> <p>  In regard to MiseFosta, Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in mentioned in her opening statement that she supports the ITI's work but that there is much more to be done.  Will she expand on that?</p> <p>  In regard to Comhaltas, my question was on policies, protections and procedures and these have been answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Chonar&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021111700002#N00900"><p>I will take the first bit.  We highly recommend the Irish Theatre Institute's recommendations on the provision of resources to arts workers such as counselling services and impartial HR advice, a mediation service and legal consultation.  It has the potential to be transformative but it needs to be funded, an issue to which Deputy Munster referred.  However, it did not follow up on having an independent body.  We feel that, for people to report, there needs to be an independent body that can look into allegations.  If they are of a criminal and serious nature, obviously they will be passed over to the Garda.  If they are not, then they will go through an investigative process and a register would be made - not publicly - where funding bodies could look to see if somebody was accused of a crime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh N&iacute; Charra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021111700002#N01000"><p>I thank the Deputy for posing that question.  Dr. Casey has covered much of the detail on the independent body but essentially what we need is a body that can investigate claims, that is independent, neutral, and not linked to any other bodies that provide or make decisions on funding, which have enough to be doing, frankly.  Furthermore, as has been mentioned by Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in and by Dr. Casey, we have spent four years getting disclosures.  We should not be the ones getting them.  It should be very obvious to people who to report to when they have something to report.  The body should have the power to investigate, and if the protected disclosure is upheld, it should be in a position to impose sanctions.  There should be consequences.</p><p>Perhaps funding could be blocked until whomever has had a complaint against him or her has had a chance to address it.  We have been passing people who come in and make complaints to us over to the Garda or we refer them to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  We have also talked to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.  However, again, it is all about having a whistleblowing mechanism where people can make these complaints.  There are examples of this already in existence elsewhere; the Central Bank and the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement have systems.  These things are not unknowns; they have been done before.  If it is at the most serious end of the spectrum where it is criminal, it gets passed on and there are consequences to that.  As Deputy Munster pointed out, sections 35 to 43 of the briefing document that we sent lay all of that out.  It also brings in the idea of dispute resolution in order that we can bring about change and correct behaviour.  </p><p> Individuals and organisations should be in a position where they can check if a person they are about to hire or collaborate with has been reported against, with the report being upheld, or if that person is on a register.  All of that is important in terms of the funding being asked.  As for funding or an idea of money, we are looking at many different recommendations, all of which need funding to resource, but &euro;200,000 is the figure the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, mentioned.  If you employ a counsellor or a legal representative, a lot of that money suddenly has been eaten up already.  There are many different areas where we need funding.  We need funding for training, we need funding for further research and we need various Departments to use their funding as well.  For example, the Department of Justice has mentioned to us in FairPl&eacute; the idea of an awareness campaign.  Those are a few examples.  </p></speech>

There is some sort of belief that we are looking for gigs.  Personally, I have been accused of looking for attention and gigs and being difficult and dangerous.</p> <p>Many of the campaigners in both MiseFosta and FairPl&eacute; have been ostracised and taken out of work for this campaigning.  In &Uacute;na Monaghan's groundbreaking research, more than 125 men and women came forward to make statements.  The Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, collected over 1,300 stories of harassment, coercion, bullying and sexual assault.  There is a crisis out there and women have nowhere to go to. </p> <p>  There is a broad spectrum of transgressions, from being harassed, told what to wear, what to sing, what to say, what not to say, getting into a van - and I am talking from my own experience of men making comments, saying, "Jaysus where we you last night?  You should have seen the woman in the lap-dancing club, the pair on her." - to more serious incidences of serious rape and assault.  They include women, including wives and girlfriends, not being allowed to go backstage because we are distracting, backing singers being forced to give blow jobs, younger women in colleges being groomed for sexual favours, teenagers being groomed and taken away on tours, drugged and then assaulted.  Women are being charmed by men who abuse their power on the stage and look for sex after gigs.  Minors are being abused during their weekly music lessons.  It goes on and on.  Somebody needs to take this on because we cannot deal with it.  </p></speech>

Where FairPl&eacute; and MiseFosta may be seen as slightly different would be in terms of the age brackets we represent.  These issues do not escape any age group and we have always worked in tandem and empathised with each other.  We have acknowledged FairPl&eacute;'s commitment to the more structural issues within the industry and the scene, and MiseFosta is more about behaviour within our age group, which also extends to the behaviour of those who work within the machinery of the scene.</p> <p>  In saying that, someone needs to take on an educational role in this or to set up some sort of portal or to provide training for those and the onus needs to be taken on.  Not only should we learn about the tradition, the notes, the history and all the other beautiful things but we should be informed from a young age about what consent is or the dangers that are out there.  If we pretend they do not exist when teaching, and I am not saying that we have explicitly pretended that they do not exist, but we have not prepared our young students for this.  We have prepared them for the wonders, the hedonistic festivals, the competitions, for acquiring such a beautiful collection of music and stories and so on.  They have been hit in the face with the reality upon attending their first festival.  </p> <p>  Some of these predators are very self-aware of what they are doing.  Whereas the rest of it can sometimes just be a lack of education or a lack of self-awareness,  and just buying into a culture that is quite predatory.  It is very hedonistic; there is much drink involved and there is peer pressure to go out and get the shift, and that causes run-ins where people end up doing something a bit shadier than that which is within their nature.  It has been discussed during the campaign that there is a pyramid from soft harassment to really conscious, violent sexual crimes.  </p></speech>

It really is disturbing.</p><p>Can the witnesses from Comhaltas expand on their statement that the pace of change is slow and there can be a reluctance to accept new norms of society?  Why is this the case?  They emphasised the role that bystanders have to play to call out discriminatory abuse.  Does Comhaltas have a binding written policy, along with its efforts to raise awareness?  By law, any adult who witnesses child abuse must report it.</p><p> On the issue of a safe and respectful work environment in the arts, the Irish Theatre Institute's Speak Up survey is disturbing reading.  It strongly indicates there is a serious, fundamental, hidden, harmful and invidious culture operating across all sectors of the arts in Ireland.  Is stronger protective legislation needed, particularly for freelance art workers who seem to be the most vulnerable?  Should a type of statutory whistleblowing system be set up specifically for the industry?</p><p> Do the representatives of FairPl&eacute; believe the Minister should include statutory binding conditions to address gender-based harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment in all public funding contracts?  Would this be part of FairPl&eacute;'s campaign?  What is their opinion on this?</p><p> Can the witnesses from MiseFosta elaborate on what is meant by operating an honest conversation about consent?  What is their definition of consent?  What support does MiseFosta need?  What barriers has it encountered in its campaign?</p></speech>

We acknowledged that society, as we know, always embraces change, perhaps.  We were pointing out that it is up to us as an organisation, as it is for everybody, to make sure structures and policies move in pace with the needs that emerge in society.  As an organisation, we have always been proactive in our sense of leadership.  We have sought to create awareness within the organisation of what the needs are, and of the sort of atmosphere that gives everybody a sense of dignity and respect.  We can elaborate further on that if the Deputy wishes.</p> <p>  The Deputy also picked up on what we had to say about bystanders.  As a potentially influential organisation, Comhaltas is where many young people in Ireland start their journey.  We see the role of the bystander, as one who feels empowered to note and create the atmosphere, to be important.  I ask Ms Bartley, the ardchl&aacute;raitheoir, to comment further on the role of the bystander and on our overall Cothroma&iacute;ocht policy.</p></speech>

This can be improved through raising awareness, training and education.  Anybody who witnesses discrimination or abuse is always encouraged to call out such behaviour in this way.  This means the secrecy under which abusers can hide will dissipate, which is important.  As we see it, the role of the bystander is extremely important.  It forms part of our training strategy for training and education strategy moving forward.  The following would be incorporated into our training: the dangers of behaviour, the awareness of what is inappropriate, the development of support systems and positive change, the encouragement of positive learning environments, the need for all to be well informed and the importance of leadership and education being to the fore.  That is our main stance when we talk about training and education in the role of the bystander.</p></speech>

That was shown very clearly when the MiseFosta campaign started.  I was recording a podcast in Irish and before doing anything like that I always make sure I have all the vocabulary I will need for the session.  When I came to the word "consent", I realised I did not know the word for "consent" in Irish.  I had my entire education through Irish, but I did not know the word.  This shows that the kind of sex education I had was completely non-existent.  Our definition of what consent means to us in MiseFosta, specifically within the traditional scene - we did exactly this in an education post on our Instagram page - is that it is an enthusiastic yes, it is continued so it can be retracted at any time, it is verbal and non-verbal so it can include body language, and it is voluntary.  As I said earlier, within the traditional music scene there are many unregulated social situations and a great deal of alcohol is involved, so things can get very complicated.  That is where those four points come in.</p></speech>

A number of questions have been asked.  At the end of this, what is important is that the stories are told and are out there, that there is a cultural change and that in the future those who engage in traditional music feel that people can perform in a safe environment.  I have a question for all or any of the witnesses.  What can we do, and indeed what can all of the organisations do, beyond this process to rebuild trust?  We have heard quite a bit about the process.  The aim of everyone here is to ensure music is played and young people are attracted into traditional music.  How can we ensure we rebuild trust in Comhaltas?  Going beyond the processes that have been outlined, how can we ensure this never happens again and people feel the environment is safe?</p></speech>

If she wishes to do so, she can answer Deputy Mythen's questions as well as those from Senator Byrne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karan Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021111700002#P00900"><p>Yes, I might refer to Ms Cusack on the statutory binding conditions.  I thank Senator Byrne for his questions.  One of the first ways to rebuild trust is to get the sexual predators who have committed serious crimes off the circuit.  If a man has raped a woman, he needs to be in jail.  That is the first thing.  The next thing would be for people to acknowledge that this is a problem.  We have been told for four years that this is a problem and that we are making a fuss.  It needs to be acknowledged and then the policies need to be put in place to deal with it,  Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in and Mr. Jackson have outlined the policy on what constitutes sexual harassment.  When people arrive at a gig, they could be given a page that says what constitutes sexual harassment and mentions who they can go to or report to if something happens.  Of course that is difficult in the traditional and folk world because gigs and sessions can be very small and might not necessarily be for money.  Therefore, to answer Deputy Mythen's question, it can be difficult to know who to go to.  Who is the boss in that situation?  That is a question we are asking the politicians to sort out.</p> <p>  The other way to build trust is for people to be heard and acknowledged.  While it is incredibly brave of all of us to have come forward and reported our accounts, it is traumatising.  It is retraumatising, and retriggering, and really difficult.  We do not want to be sitting here talking about this issue.  We need a complaints procedure to be put in place that people can avail of, as recommended in our briefing notes, to enable an investigation to be carried out.  Funding needs to be expanded greatly in order for these processes to happen.</p><p>In regard to the statutory body and whistleblowing that Deputy Mythen brought up and is important, I would be happy to go in and give the names and be a whistleblower if I thought I would be protected.  We would be happy to do it but we would need to be protected.  In France, the French equivalent of the Arts Council for the music sector is the <i>Centre National de la Musique</i>which has launched a protocol for the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, where people can report and be protected to do so.  It has given &euro;1 million.  I know they have more money but it is good.  There are many practical things we can do if we all want to find a solution.  That is why we are here today.  We all need to be on board.  This needs to be a priority.  The rape of women is not allowed.  I am astounded that our own community has not been more proactive and has left us standing in the rain, as it were.  This needs to be a priority; otherwise it is not a community.<br/><br/>For practical examples of what we can do, I will refer to Ms Cusack.  I hope I have answered everybody's questions.</p></speech>

The idea is that there is an appointed equality manager in every arts-funded venue, festival and organisation to whom people can go, including audiences, artists and technicians alike.  They can go to this person and disclose any experiences of harassment that have happened within that environment.</p> <p>  We are looking for the resources to enable organisations and festivals to do this.  They need the training.  Staff need to be trained to deal with disclosures of harassment.  The Rape Crisis Centre is currently providing an excellent training programme on how to deal with disclosures of harassment, which can be funded and extended to the arts so that when these policies are put in place, the training and the toolkit is there for the organisations and the venues.</p> <p>  This is all part of the bigger picture of all public funding being conditional.  We are looking for policies and procedures for the benefit of all staff, contractors and participants.  We want anti-harassment protocols for all venues, reporting on gender balance line-up, which includes such things as technical crew, contractors, and board staff, the provision of training for the staff in the publicly funded organisations and venues, and a disclosure of any circumstances in which allegations of harassment are upheld against a member of staff.  It is also important the organisation regularly reports back to the funder on how it is managing these policies and procedures.  They are just a set of conditions that needs to be put in place so that we are not constantly giving funding to predators and perpetrators.  It is very simple, but it can make real change.</p></speech>

We have already accounted for our equity and gender balance within this document, and there has been a whole scoping across the organisation, not just among artists but also administration and festival organisers.  In Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, our unique structure is such that there are committees of people in standing units of five who are charged with administering branches and relaying back to the full board.  Our decisions are made by a group of people, which of course means that power and authority, which are so much associated with harassment, are not vested in one person.  All our educational programmes have separate committees that make decisions in that regard.  We account for ourselves in terms of all our public funding and that relates to our internal procedures and so forth.  From our point of view any organisation and any funder can trust us to deliver not just on what we are already involved in but that which we intend to expand delivery of moving forward.</p></speech>

I welcome what Ms N&iacute; Chonar&aacute;in, Mr. &Oacute; Maoldomhnaigh and Ms Bartley mentioned about Comhaltas.  Comhaltas is just one of the organisations.  The disclosures coming into us would contradict the feedback that Comhaltas is getting.  I am not at all saying that things are being misrepresented.  What I am saying essentially is that the mechanisms for seeing if there are issues are flawed.  I want to pick up on one or two of those.</p> <p>  The vetting of more than 9,000 teachers and members of Comhaltas is important work and it is great to hear that is being done, but it is important to realise the reports that would come back to Comhaltas would only show somebody who had been convicted.  We know the percentage of people who report assaults is minuscule, that the percentage of those against whom there is enough evidence to go to court is minuscule, and that the number of those who are convicted is minuscule again.  Unfortunately, the vetting will not give the information required.  It does not give a true picture.</p> <p>  The designated liaison person, DLP, is a fantastic system and kudos to Tom&aacute;s who set this up.  It is an incredibly important structure, but again it does not go far enough because the major problem is, as Dr. Casey mentioned, when things happen to people, they are traumatised and they do not know who to report to.   DLP is quite Civil Service speak.  I went on the Comhaltas website this morning and I could not find any mention anywhere that that system is in place.  It would be a very easy, practical thing to put up the excellent report that Ms N&iacute; Chonar&aacute;in read out about the future policies, the mission and ethos.  These are all brilliant things to hear and we welcome them but they should be very clear and easy to find on the website.  DLP contacts should be easy to find on the website, with explanations of why they are there and what they can do for people.  That should be easy to find.  At the moment it is not.  There is a gap between what is happening on the ground and the information that Comhaltas is receiving.  Comhaltas is in the room today, which is why I bring this up, but it goes for all organisations.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  I was not aware of the issues, to be quite honest.  They are not acceptable and such crimes need to be punished.  The duty is on the State and us as legislators to make sure that happens, that we support people like the witnesses, and that we put whatever resources need to be put in place to ensure this does not continue.  The crux of it is in putting the proper reporting mechanisms in place and ensuring procedures are in place to deal with it.</p> <p>  It is fair to say the Government supports are not there.  What supports do the witnesses believe need to be put in place?  Apologies if this question has already been answered.</p> <p>  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is looking at the issue of vetting.  It might be a good idea for organisations to make a submission to her and the Department.  This is something about which she is proactive in changing.  As one of the speakers just said, a minuscule number of the figure of 9,000 people mentioned will have been convicted.  Reports have to made and it takes years for cases to get to court.  Some never get to court.  All these things need to be flagged within that system.  It might be an opportunity now for the witnesses to make a submission on Garda vetting and changes that need to be made.  It may be one of the simple asks.  I read the document and there were a significant number of asks, but if the witnesses were to say what changes they wanted us as a committee to prioritise and have made, and with which we could go to the Minister and ask for them to be implemented now, what would they be?</p></speech>

I appreciate everybody's support but that is the job of the committee.  Nobody looking at this would disagree we need these changes.  For ourselves, the most important element is an independent body that can investigate claims.  That takes the burden off us and we do not need it.  We need to go out and sing, and that is what I want to do.  People should be able to report across the spectrum - I do not want to label them as minor transgressions - but there is belittling and condescension, putting women down or bullying them.  This supports or props up the more serious crimes of harassment, sexual harassment, assault and rape.  There should be a separate statutory body as a mechanism to take these complaints, investigate them and hand over the more serious matters.</p> <p>  There should be a package across all the arts, and I cannot state that strongly enough.  This is not just about folk and traditional, which I love, but it takes in all the arts.  There is the question of harassment, what it is, who to go to if something happens in the workplace or at a session, and consent.  Training could be rolled out very easily by Comhaltas, which I work for often and admire greatly for its fantastic work.  It has not been and I ask all stakeholders to come up with this.</p> <p>  The final request we have is funding.  If women contact this complaints process, they should have funding for legal representation and counselling.  We really need counselling and I am in counselling.  Women in FairPl&eacute; are vicariously traumatised, having absorbed hundreds of accounts of abuse.  It is very difficult to absorb that, as Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in will testify.  We could do this and work together for solutions.  People along the way have said that of course they will help, and while I do not want to accuse anybody of platitudes, members really need to get this sorted out.</p></speech>

Basically, we are not sure now if existing equality legislation covers freelance artists in the workplace.  If it does cover freelance artists, that must be relayed in an awareness campaign so people know what to do and who to go to if they have experienced harassment or assault.  If it does not cover freelance artists, including those in music, arts and everything else, there must be a major reform.  Artists deserve to be protected in their workplace just as much as anybody else or anybody going into a Government building.</p></speech>

The big part of this independent body would be that it would essentially act as a human resources department for us because we do not have one.  We are not employees, generally speaking, and if we are employees it might be for a day in a festival.  We would go to the next festival and the one after that.  There are unique and societal matters that can be compared with various others sectors that match, but there is an added layer in our case of the freelance nature of our work.  For example, Deputy Mythen is a proud union member but freelancers and the self-employed were not even legally allowed to join a union until quite recently.  It might have been three or four years ago and members might be able to confirm that.  It is an example of our more exposed nature to all these difficulties.</p></speech>

The body should be completely independent and have judicial powers.  That is a major aspect of it.  The Departments dealing with the arts or justice matters could be involved in informing how this gets set up, but it should not come in under any of them.  There is precedent and we have listed quite a few in the briefing document.  These are similar types of bodies that exist in other areas that have the independence that is so important and that have those investigative powers.  They have the power afterwards to sanction where complaints have been upheld.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

It exists in this envisaged way.  We could do the same.</p></speech>

I understand it is growing in popularity and experiencing a massive bounce back, which is fantastic to see.  We cannot let our admiration of the art mask or cloud what is happening in that scene.  The witnesses have outlined some of the horrific incidents described by the people coming forward from the scene, mainly women.  This session is so important for us to listen to that feedback.  The witnesses have made some great suggestions for action instead of words and setting up systems and independent bodies, as well as reform within some of the organisations to ensure this type of act does not happen and is called out.  The witnesses have listed some of the horrific occurrences, such as rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and harassment.  They mentioned 1,300 stories that came from Dr. Monaghan's work.  That is shameful and should not be happening.  In what type of settings were the incidents that have been outlined happening?</p></speech>

There may have been some protection but this happened at sessions, fleadh houses, after the gig or at the fleadh.  My own incident happened on a tour bus.  Another point we did not mention is that these incidents may happen in multiple jurisdictions.  If they happen on tour, it is difficult for the women to report them because they are moving to the next gig.  Members must remember we do not have lots of money.  In fairness to Ms Kate Barry, she wrote this briefing document when it really should be a civil servant's job.  These incidents happen backstage or behind the pub, you name it.</p><p>They happen everywhere.  That is the problem.  </p></speech>

Every situation one can think of, I have heard a story about.  They are only the ones I have heard personally.  One can imagine how many others there are.  In every situation one can imagine, there has been an incident.</p></speech>

Some of them would have been minors when it happened.  For many victims, they do not realise for some time after it happens that they have been assaulted.  They are in denial and trying to convince themselves that what happened was not that bad and they make excuses for the other person.  There is such a lad culture nobody wants to ruin the buzz or cause a fuss and so people let things go.  It is very often months or years down the line before a person acknowledges that what happened was not on.  At that point, the question is whether there is any point going to the Garda to report what happened at a fleadh house.  It is so difficult that many people do not want to report.  If they do, it is retraumatising and often it does not get them anywhere.</p></speech>

I thank the younger campaigners for teaching me the language, for teaching us all and for being very brave in reframing this behaviour as sexual assault and rape.  My age group in particular has been silenced over the years.  The difficulty often is that the person is in very precarious employment.  It is not like we all have masses of money.  We have to put up with a lot of this behaviour because, often, we have to go back to work with these people.</p> <p>  I want to inject a bit of hope into this.  It is great that we are here.  I thank all of the campaigners and women who have come forward.  I particularly thank Senator Warfield, who has been very good.  We need to think about what we want.  We need to ensure that the four-year-old girl, who is a dark-skinned child living in Ennis and learning to play the fiddle, can, in 20 years' time when she will be 24, go to a session wearing whatever she wants; lead the tunes and sing whatever songs she wants; go to the toilet without having to bring her pint with her in case it is spiked; go outside later and walk down the road in the dark; and go to practice and, when returning home in the dark, not need a chaparone and be able to get to her door, put her hand in her pocket for her key and not look over her shoulder.  That is what we are all working towards.  It is really important that we keep that in mind.</p></speech>

I would like to add to what Ms N&iacute; Nuall&aacute;in said.  Not only do the victims realise what happened was not on, but when a more mature version of themselves comes to terms with the reality of what was done, it can be retraumatising.  Having internalised all of that trauma, to come forward about it and discuss it with friends is a very traumatising experience.  The person can go through similar emotions, if not worse, once he or she has realised what was done to him or her.  During the campaign, I personally have witnessed - this is where my passion in all of this comes through in sympathising with my friends - physical reactions to relaying a story.  Imagine having to do that in a cold, clinical setting such as a Garda station, where you do not know the garda or, worse, you may know the garda and that is the problem.  Some of the girls close to us were considering going to Dublin to one of the crisis centres or main Garda agencies - I do not remember the correct title of it.  One can imagine what it must be like for people to have to travel from some of the more western counties all the way to Dublin to tell their stories in a cold setting and during a pandemic.  There needs to be some type of bridge to protect our younger people.  From what I have seen, it does not get any easier when people are older, only that that they are more aware of what is available to them.</p></speech>

The term "fleadh house", which has been used many times, can be associated with Comhaltas but, as we know, can be an event in the broader musical scene.  From out point of view, we see our policy and the training programme as reaching out to that entire culture to educate and empower those who are attenders and participants.  The programme is open to young people upwards and it is about growing those skills of confidence as people move forward in that broader traditional world.</p> <p>  This document is not just about our organisation; it is about our commitment to forward education in the broad but traditional Irish cultural scene and Irish cultural traditions.  We have quite a scope abroad in terms of the Irish diaspora as well.</p></speech>

We need to action that and mobilise institutional leaders, key talent and public figures in the arts to speak publicly about the immediate need for change.

It is now up to us as legislators to ensure the right conditions and culture are brought about.  Much was said about conditionality.  I fully support the view that we as legislators need to think very seriously about how we introduce conditionality into funding right across the arts.</p><p>With regard to the independent body, Dr. Casey spoke earlier about France.  We can certainly look to it and at what it has done.  Perhaps there are other countries which have put an independent body in place and that this is a conversation for another day.  I would like to hear those examples from other countries as that could act as a useful model for us when we are looking to developing that, in conjunction with our witnesses, in the future.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the revised National Development Plan, NDP.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials to the meeting today.  I thank the Minister for taking time out of his busy schedule.  The NDP is very important to us all and, therefore, we welcome this engagement.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a statement is potentially inflammatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.  They may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings that a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practising of good hand hygiene and that people leave at least one vacant seat between them and others in attendance.  People should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the national development plan.  I would like to start by reflecting on the strategic context of the NDP and how it supports broader Government ambition for our society, our climate and our economy.  The national planning framework sets out an ambitious framework for our development as a country out to 2040.  The recent Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits us, under law, to achieve a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and move to net-zero emissions by 2050.  That statutory commitment has recently been fleshed out with the publication of the new climate action plan.  The NDP is now providing us with the funding to realise those ambitions.  While &euro;35 billion in capital expenditure funding is committed to transport over the next ten years, it does not set the strategic direction, as such.</p> <p>  So, what is that strategic direction?  What does transport look like in ten years and how does this NDP set us on our way?  First and foremost, how we travel needs to look very different to how we travel today.  We need to reduce our reliance on fossil-fuelled private vehicles.  That is tricky, because as we all know in Ireland, we have areas with very dispersed population settlements and very low population densities.  Therefore, Government supports will need to take that into account and be tailored to the circumstances people find themselves in.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in the potential of active travel as part of our response to the climate crisis we face.  It is not that every journey can be replaced by travelling on foot or by bike; there are too many variables for that, including, where you live, where you are going, what you are doing etc.  However, we can switch a lot more journeys, and that is why this NDP is committing unprecedented amounts of funding to local authorities across the country to deliver high-quality active travel infrastructure to enable more people make the switch to active travel.  We are seeing delivery start to happen across the country and can expect to see it ramped up in the years ahead.</p> <p>  In the five cities, the BusConnects project will play a hugely important role in transforming both active travel options and bus services in each of the cities.  The bus is at the heart of our public transport network and we need to invest billions of euro in its future.  That is what this NDP will do.  By 2030, I expect to see BusConnects substantially completed in each of the five cities.  We are already seeing progress on the ground.  BusConnects Dublin will have two of its new "spines" in service this year, the new BusConnects 90-minute fare will be launched at of the month, BusConnects Cork is currently out for consultation on its new network and BusConnects Galway had two of its core bus corridors out for non-statutory public consultation late last year.</p><p>However, we are not only focusing on improving bus services in the five cities; improved bus services have a massive role to play in rural Ireland also.</p><p> Recently I was delighted to launch a public consultation on Connecting Ireland, the National Transport Authority's rural mobility plan.  In budget 2022 we secured funding to roll out the first phase of Connecting Ireland next year.  In rural Ireland I recognise the vital connectivity the regional and local road network provides to cyclists, buses, commercial vehicles as well as private cars.  The national development plan, NDP, will enable a spend of up to &euro;5.35 billion on the protection and renewal of this network over the period to 2030 while another &euro;677 million has been earmarked for targeted improvement schemes across the network.</p><p> We are committing &euro;2.9 billion in funding to the protection and renewal of our national road network over the ten years of the NDP.  We are also committing &euro;5.1 billion to new national roads projects over the lifetime of the plan, which will enable improved connectivity across the country enhancing regional accessibility in line with the national strategic outcomes in the national planning framework and in line with the commitment in the programme for Government that a 2:1 ratio will be maintained between new public transport infrastructure and new road investment. </p><p> I also note our national, regional and local road networks support the safe use of the private car where sustainable transport modes cannot be used.  This NDP will invest &euro;1 billion in supporting the decarbonisation of private transport and particularly the transition to electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure.</p><p> Turning to rail, as members will be aware, a strategic rail review has been commenced to examine how we can improve rail connectivity across the island of Ireland.  This review will set out an investment framework for the coming decades and a public consultation period will launch very shortly on that.  In the meantime we are investing substantially in our rail network as it is.  In the coming weeks I will be seeking Government approval to allocate almost &euro;100 million in additional funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to support line speed improvements on the Dublin-Cork line, as well as improvements planned for the Limerick Junction to Waterford line.</p><p> I will also be seeking Government approval very shortly for the first phases of the DART+ programme.  These phases relate to the two biggest components of the overall programme, DART+ west and DART+ fleet.  Once DART+ west receives its railway order from An Bord Plean&aacute;la I will seek Government approval again to permit contracts to be signed and construction to commence.  At that point we will have much firmer ideas around the final design, as well as the cost and time implications of any changes made during the planning system.  However, it is not only about DART+, we are seeing delivery on the ground now with the arrival next year of 41 additional carriages, the construction of a new national train control centre, phase one of the Cork commuter rail programme, the design and planning to upgrade Colbert, Ceannt and Plunkett stations and improved funding across the network generally.</p><p> On MetroLink, I expect to seek Government approval in the first quarter of next year while I am informed the planning documentation should be ready for submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the second quarter.  Similar to DART+ west, I will be seeking Government approval for the project to enter the planning system.  Once it receives its railway order I will seek Government approval for the project to commence construction and that is when we will lock in the cost, delivery and benefit forecasts. </p><p> Outside of the NDP funding envelope, longer term transport planning is continuing for each of the five cities.  Those metropolitan area transport strategies provide a long-term, evidence-informed, planning horizon for transport investment in the five cities.  Importantly, these strategies then influence the land area plans for the cities in order that we get the right type and density of housing along with the right type of transport projects to support them.  That is why the NTA is currently consulting on the next draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area and next year will be consulting on the Limerick-Shannon strategy, the Waterford strategy and a revised Galway strategy.  Those strategies will extend way beyond the timeframe for the NDP and will inform the development of future NDPs in the years to come. </p><p> I look forward to discussing all those issues with the committee.</p></speech>

I want to focus in the initial round of questions on the area of active travel and public transport, an area in which the Minister is keenly interested.  As a starting point, I will deal with the unmet demand that exists.  My sense is that people are ready to make the switch but the facilities are not yet in place.  Regarding the scale of ambition on the move to active travel, I heard the Minister in the past 24 hours draw comparisons between here and Copenhagen and the moves that were made there some decades ago.  Currently, 49% of journeys in Copenhagen are done by bicycle.  The ambition in the greater Dublin area transport strategy, published less a week ago, is that 11.5% of journeys will be made by bicycle by 2042.</p> <p>  School bus transport it is oversubscribed every year.  The scale of ambition from Bus &Eacute;ireann is that we would have a 20% increase by 2030.  If we met the existing demand, fewer than 1,000 additional children would travel by school bus transport a year.  That is current policy.  Another example is the safe routes to school programme, which the Opposition supports.  However, it is greatly oversubscribed.  It provided for 170 schools this year.  Those projects will take a number of years to implement.  However, 931 schools subscribed for the programme.  That shows schools are crying out for the type of investment to support change that completely aligns with the ambition but the supports needed are not being provided.  That is the essence of my question.  There seems to be a contradiction with respect to the policy, the rhetoric, for want of a better term, between what has been put down in black and white on paper and the funding and operationalising of that.  I raise that as a concern from my position in opposition of supporting the intent but I question the alignment of policy and the provision of funding to deliver on it, in other words, the scale of investment.</p> <p>  I wish to pick up with the Minister on the achievement of what is in the NDP.  An amendment to our roads legislation appears to deal with delivering transport change in communities.  That can be seen with BusConnects and the reallocation of road space.  What is the thinking behind that amending legislation?  Is it to deliver on BusConnects or cycling infrastructure?   It appears to be a crude tool, which will be controversial.  Is it sufficient or does the Minister consider any further measure is necessary to deliver on the policy objective in that respect?  If time permits, I may come back in later.</p></speech>

I would agree with him that our ambition on active travel should not be limited to what that modelling in the greater Dublin area transport strategy indicates may be delivered.  That 11% figure is a projection based on a variety of different assumptions.  The Deputy referred to the fact that I spoke about this yesterday.  If we provide safe infrastructure, it might show those assumptions underestimate the public appetite for a healthier, quicker, cleaner, cheaper and better form of transport.  That is based on having the experience of seeing that when we create safe spaces, be it when we have provided greenways or high quality active travel urban transport infrastructure, the numbers have jumped by more than 11%.  If we can create such safer infrastructure, we will see a much higher modal share.  There is a pent-up demand for that among the Irish public that will be released.  Central to that , is creating safe routes to schools.  That has a double benefit.  It will help us address some of the morning peak traffic gridlock, of which 33% is accounted for by children being driven to school.</p><p>It will also make for safer infrastructure for a range of other uses throughout the day.  To deliver that, political decision-making at local level will be required.  The funding will be allocated centrally to help local authorities.  The legislation will be shaped in whatever way we can to give support, but it comes down to local government making decisions.  It is at local government level that the responsibility and best democratic decision-making lie.</p></speech>

I have heard the Minister say areas that buy into the new way of doing things will make greater progress and be more attractive.  How is that achieved while delivering balanced regional development at the same time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#C00300"><p>That is a fair question.  This is also an issue in Dublin.  In south-side Dublin, people will know a difficult decision was made about a project in Deansgrange that was substantially about creating a safe route to the many schools in the area.  It ran into difficulty at the local council.  It is a reality that if one council is not seeking to advance these kinds of projects, for whatever reason, the money will go elsewhere.  I could give examples on the positive side.  It has been interesting to look at what was initially a very difficult decision during the Covid period to install a coastal cycle route at Salthill, Galway.  This will be of great benefit to commuters, schoolchildren and those who use it for leisure, including tourists.  While it originally ran into difficulties, the council ultimately agreed, by an overwhelming majority, with perhaps one or two exceptions, to take what was a hard decision.  To my mind, it was the right decision.  We cannot force it.  It must not be a matter of a central government fiat demanding that infrastructure be put in place.  In truth, bearing in mind the detailed design and bringing the local business community on board, local councillors have a key role.  There will be an increasing sense that if a council does not see this as the future, it cannot be forced.  It will see money going to councils that do see it as the future.  The ones getting projects through the planning process the quickest and that can deliver the greatest return for the budget should be rewarded for that.  I have no qualms about giving responsibility to local councils and rewarding those that show they can deliver.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a very good example.  What has happened in Deansgrange has run against the grain of what it is done.</p></speech>

I am constantly telling her that D&uacute;n Laoghaire is not an example of what is happening in the rest of the country.  My concern is that those who are first up and best dressed will leave areas behind.</p> <p>  I have previously raised my concern about fares.  We need to tackle the issue.  Fares are an impediment.  My colleague, Deputy Gould, made the point very well last week that a return trip on the train from Cork to Dublin costs in excess of &euro;200 for a family.  That is a huge impediment.  I live in the commuter belt.  In Gormanston and Laytown, we have the 90-minute ticket for the Dublin area but it costs in excess of &euro;20 for a return ticket from areas five minutes farther out the road.  While some people are driving to Balbriggan to get the train, more often than not they are staying in the car.  Therefore, we need to investigate how fares serve as a barrier to access.</p> <p>  I appreciate the approach and opportunities in our major urban areas, but we need to see Connecting Ireland.  From the Opposition benches, we are supporting it.  I am encouraging my constituents to engage with it, but it should not be five years away.  If it is not delivered sooner, people will lose heart and faith.</p></speech>

The legislation is designed to create the kind of flexible environment in which we can experiment and obtain good value for money in putting in new active-travel and BusConnects projects.  The impetus for the amendments came from the judgment of Mr. Justice Meenan with regard to Strand Road, another controversial and in many ways divisive local project.  Fearing that his judgment might lead to a chilling effect on development in the area of decarbonising and in promoting active travel, we identified the need to have greater clarity and certainty regarding how local authorities would apply these sorts of experimental traffic measures.  In this regard, a weakness was identified in the existing legislation.</p></speech>

That is why we have introduced a 50% reduction for those under 24.  It will be introduced next year.  It is the reason for the 90-minute fare structure, which allows for efficiencies such that passengers can jump from a DART or Luas to a bus without having to pay more than once.  Regarding the budgetary decisions, towns such as Mallow, which are on the outer edge of a commuter belt, can and should be included.  A colleague was on to me today asking about including Skerries in the 90-minute fare category.  We will have to keep looking, reviewing and adapting.</p> <p>  The Connecting Ireland project is starting next year.  We committed &euro;5.7 million.  It is not that it is going to wait until 2025; it is starting next year.  We provided a huge increase in the public service obligation, PSO, support but it cannot carry everything.  We cannot reduce fares wholesale everywhere.  We will need additional PSO money.  For example, with regard to Connecting Ireland the estimate is &euro;55 million a year.  That must come from somewhere.  While I am keen to try to increase the PSO, we cannot just give up on fare income as one of the sources of income for public transport.</p></speech>

Perhaps we can have an exchange on them.  The first issue is that of the Limerick northern distributor road.  Phase 1 of the project, from Coonagh across to Meelick, straddling the Clare&ndash;Limerick county boundary, is well under construction, but it is going to end at the middle of no place in Meelick.  Phase 2 is currently a concept line on a map but does not look like it is moving anyplace fast.  It is not in the national development plan.  Is the Minister in favour of, or against, phase 2?  How does he see it progressing from this point forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#C01100"><p>I listened to the advice of some of our road engineers who do not believe it is an appropriate project to advance.  I agree because of what it would do.  As I said at a previous meeting of this committee, a &euro;200 million bill would be due to the operator of the tunnel under the River Shannon.  Within the confines of its contract, it will be entitled to compensation if we provide an alternative bridge across the Shannon, which is what the proposed road would involve.  Also, it would fundamentally undermine the sustainable development of Limerick.  I recently saw an attractive full-page advertisement in one of the newspapers stating Limerick city is going green.  It can, will and should, and it would benefit from this.  To do so, it has to bring life back to the centre.  Three percent of the population lives within the historic core.  To bring life back, we must bear in mind the alternative.  It is an either&ndash;or scenario.</p> <p>  Should we not develop Limerick along the four railway lines that go into and through the city and which are underutilised?  The roundabout at the end of the first phase of the northern distributor road is not in the middle of nowhere; it is very close to the community in Moyross, which could be significantly improved, developed and strengthened through the introduction of a train station, as one of many new stations we are going to put into Limerick.</p><p>The key to the development of Limerick is a new metropolitan rail system for the city.  I have been upfront and honest about that.  It will involve the reopening of the Foynes line and the use of the Ballybrophy line and putting in new stations on that, the development of stations on the Limerick Junction line to the Culbreth station, including the development of the centre and Culbreth station.  The Land Development Agency has a key role in developing Limerick in those areas by creating transport-oriented development, that is high-quality housing for people close to the centre and to public transport.  Limerick has a choice: does it want to go down the route of the old, sprawled roads based model, or does it want to be a modern green European transport orientated development city?  I think the latter is the way to go.</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, indicated that the project would progress and that it would continue to move through phases.  In his response, on the D&aacute;il record, he said that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, would advance this in the spring of 2022 <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>another phase of public consultation.</p></speech>

I believe he referred to TII as well.</p> <p>  If I can continue with my point, I am from Meelick, the community where this road will end.  It will terminate in Knockalisheen, Meelick, the community I was born and bred in.  Some people cannot wait for the road to be built.  Some people have major reservations.  That is pretty standard in whatever road project one can think of in this country.  The one thing that is unfair is the procrastinated state of uncertainty that lies ahead for many people.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said it can progress.  The statutory bodies are progressing it.  I want to know if it will progress.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan has said he has difficulties with it.  Will he put a ministerial block on its progression?  I get all the points he has made about light rail.  I really love that.  It is fantastic and I ask that he progresses with that.  We all want to see it.  If it is progressing through its statutory phases, albeit slowly and we all expect this to take a number of years, will the Minister put a block on those statutory phases, or will he allow them to progress?</p></speech>

It will not necessarily be light rail.  It will be light rail in the sense that it will be electrified rail, like all new rail developments, but it will use the existing heavy rail lines.  A real benefit Limerick has is that it has the infrastructure there already and building on top of that makes sense.</p> <p>  I do not know how informed the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is.  He is, by all means, entitled to his views and we listen and work together very effectively.  I do not expect to give that clarity.  I do not see the northern distributor road being part of the advanced design planning that TII will do.  It has to agree its own infrastructure plans.</p></speech>

That meeting was in relation to the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, plan of which the first draft did not have rail.  It will certainly have it now and is very much based on the existing rail network.  Equally, the first plan had the northern distributor road as a public transport arm within the city.  The NTA confirmed it will be in the second draft that is due to go to public consultation in January.  It is not a TII project.  It is an NTA project with the local authorities as the principal leaders, and it is the body that will build the road, when it is to be built.  It will first go from Coonagh to Knockalisheen with Limerick City and County Council and, as members are aware, Clare County Council as the lead authorities.</p> <p>  I will give Deputy Cathal Crowe extra time.  I just wanted to provide the context.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, informed Deputy Crowe during last night's debate, which I was watching, that the NTA has confirmed that the northern distributor road would be included in the second draft of the LSMATS due to go to public consultation in January.</p></speech>

That relates to the fundamental question as to whether the NTA supports the proposal that we do compact, low carbon and transport-orientated development.  In the end, the wisdom of that will be clear.  It is important, in my mind, that we see real expansion, real investment and real increased population in Limerick.  If we go by the old way, I do not think that will work.  As part of this process, we will see real clarity at the end of it.</p></speech>

I love putting the bikes into the boot of the car, taking off on a Saturday and getting fresh air in my lungs with my wife and kids.  I love that.  I love travelling by train.  Greenways are fine for weekends.  They are recreational.  They do not get someone to work, school or college.  We need roads.  We are still in the era where we depend on roads.  We cannot have ideological blocks to roads.  We also cannot have roads that are half built.  This is not the world of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner where roads end in the middle of no place.  That is what will happen with the Limerick northern distributor road.  We either build roads in their entirety - we either commit to phase 1 and phase 2 fully - or we do not commit to the road at all.  We cannot have a road dropping off in the middle of no place with a roundabout.  It has been said it will connect to Moyross, and that is true, but let us consider where it comes off in Meelick, less than a mile from my home place.  The road will come off at a minor tertiary road and that is where the rat run will be every morning.  There is good and bad with every road project in the country.  This is decisive for communities, there is no doubts about it, and people cannot be left in a state of limbo because an ideological view that this is not good for the city.  I think it has to progress.  I have some other points I wish to briefly put-----</p></speech>

That first section, in the end, was agreed and developed, and it was for the local community.  It was their clear sense that they had been excluded, isolated and not provided with connectivity, particularly in the community of Moyross.  When we agreed that with Limerick City and County Council, a condition to proceeding was that we would also take down the walls that surround some of those communities that restrict their accessibility to other communities, and that we would also build some of the BusConnect projects in Limerick with urgency and speed, so that the Moyross community and others would connect up and the city would start to work with a really high-quality functioning public transport network.  I look forward, when I go to Limerick to meet the community in Moyross and the city manager, to asking where the plans are to honour the commitment to take down those walls and increase accessibility and public transport services.  I believe that is the key to the project's successful development and making sure it is not an isolated asset that leaves the communities without the public transport and accessibility services that they deserve.</p></speech>

There are also fences.  There are fences fencing off the route corridor, a route corridor that looks even more uncertain today.  It is great to take down walls because they are social and all kinds of barriers.  However, there is a route corridor along which people are living and working, some of whom are farming.  For better or for worse, they need to know where their future lies over the next five or six years.  I say this with the greatest respect.  I am not trying to undermine the Minister.  We have different messaging coming from the NTA, the Department, the Minister and other ministerial colleagues.  Local authorities believe it can progress.  Clarity is essential in this.</p> <p>  Can I continue, Chairman, because I have a few other points?  Can I wrap up briefly?</p></speech>

The last national aviation policy we had dates from 2015.  It still exists but it is pretty much defunct now as we come out of Covid.  When will we have a new national aviation policy, one that recalibrates aviation in our country and gives back to the regions, including the likes of Shannon, Cork, Knock etc?</p> <p>  Tomorrow, we will have a meeting with the Coast Guard and I do not wish to comment on a particular matter in Clare at present.  That is progressing quite well after the intervention of a mediator today.  The Minister has ministerial authority, supreme authority, over the Coast Guard and there are a number of practices that need to be looked at and addressed quickly.  Some of their rescuing operations along cliffs have been scaled back by the Department.  The Coast Guard's ability to use a bolting system for climbing training has also been taken from it, as has climbing training within stations.  Effectively, the service is being wound back and diluted.  When the meat is really needed on the bone is at the time of rescue.  My concern is that because we are slowly diluting what the Coast Guard does, in time it will not have the skill set we require its members to have in order to carry out rescues off-shore.</p> <p>  This is my final point.  During the questions on promised legislation debate, I raised the idea of school buses with the Taoiseach and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Let us think of any town or city in the country during the months of July or August.  One can get from one side to another without any traffic congestion because schools are closed.  The local school I taught in for 15 years would typically have 250 cars each morning coming up a narrow rural road dropping off kids.</p><p>The drop-off is slow.  Imagine if we took them off the road.  The Minister talks about a 2:1 ratio in terms of public transport.  A very quick way we could do this is by investing significantly in school transportation, by ripping up the policies that existed heretofore and by getting rid of archaic rules about drains, roads and boundaries here and distances there.  If we transform school transportation, we can make it possible for buses to start here, there and everywhere each morning, thereby taking kids to school and cars off the road..</p></speech>

Coming back from Glasgow last week, all of the talk in aviation was about how it can play its part in decarbonisation.  That will be a very interesting and useful part of these developments.</p> <p>  There will be D&aacute;il statements on the R116 report so I might leave that if I can because it is more respectful to address it in the Chamber later this afternoon.  </p> <p>  A comprehensive review of school buses is being carried out by the Department of Education, which is responsible for these services, and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I agree with the Deputy.  We must look for synergies where the same bus can be used for the school run in the morning and as a community bus service in the afternoon and where we look at real innovation in terms of how we get increased numbers.  I go back to an earlier comment by Deputy O'Rourke.  We should be looking for a far more ambitious increase in the number of schoolchildren who can take buses and much better simplification of qualifying rules and so on.  At the moment, it is a very complicated scheme that is hard to administer so it needs to change.</p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statement.  Deputy Crowe and, in particular, Deputy O'Rourke spoke about cycling.  The Minister is not somebody who just talks the talk on it.  He effectively cycles the cycle.  He does it himself.  I try to do it as much as I can.  I cycled in today.  I am lucky to live relatively close to here, which enables me to do it.  I say that as somebody who did not cycle for a long time.  I got back into it about ten years ago when I was on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and was chosen to be the cycling champion.  It did not mean I was any good - I was just there to promote it.  There are millions of people who have not cycled, do not cycle and do not even think about cycling.  Many members of the committee would say that they would not cycle in Dublin because it is full of traffic and because of rush hour.  I would probably say that I would be more wary on a rural road where I might come round a bend and find a car, milk truck or tanker flying past me.</p> <p>  Touching on the ambition referenced earlier, there is a significant amount of scope in terms of promoting cycling.  Perhaps people could be offered a rent-free bicycle for six months to try it out, see how they get on and decide whether they will purchase a bicycle or get involved with cycling on a more permanent basis.  Given that almost every bicycle on the road is taking a car off the road, it is important that we eliminate the barriers.  The largest barrier to me cycling - not in here, obviously - is the fact that I do not know whether it will still be there when I come back out if I cycle into town or to the shops.  I got my first puncture in five years last week and went to a bicycle shop to get it repaired.  I was told that bicycle theft is rampant and is a big industry.  Stolen bicycles are being shipped out of the country.  Perhaps, as in the Netherlands, we need so many bicycles that people will not want to steal them anymore.  The cycle to work scheme, which the Minister was involved with in a previous existence, is a very good scheme but it has probably incentivised people to buy more expensive bicycles rather than cheaper ones.  These bicycles are, therefore, more valuable and more worth stealing.  We need to promote cycling because it is the cheapest bang for your buck you can possibly deliver.  The Minister and I know D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown very well.  The coastal mobility route has been great.  There are challenges with Deansgrange but, hopefully, they can be overcome.  It is so important that the national development plan invests in decent cycle lanes.  I am not convinced the concrete strips are a great idea.  I have said this previously to the NTA.  We need to invest enormously in cycling.</p> <p>  The Minister is very familiar with the Luas green line.  He was probably at the opening of it in 2004, as I was.  It is like a magnet in the sense that it sucks people in.  They are willing to leave their cars and walk for ten, 12 or 15 minutes to get to the Luas station because they know it is there.  They do not worry about timetables.  They know it is reliable and frequent and the journey time is reliable.  Yet in this development plan and in the Dublin strategy last week, we are more or less being told there is no upgrade other than what has been done so far to lengthen platforms and put on a few extra trains.  There is enormous development taking place, including an enormous development plan for Cherrywood.  There are plans around the Luas line in Carrickmines, coming back in towards the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum and at other sites in Kilmacud and Sandyford.  I am very concerned about the Luas green line post pandemic.  I know we have changed how we work but I am very concerned that there is very little action planned for decades other than what has already been done.  I am just concerned that it does not have the capacity to handle the planned growth right along that line and through the Minister's constituency in places like Ranelagh and Milltown.  Could the Minister address cycling and the Luas green line?</p></speech>

We require a variety of initiatives to get cycling to come up to the numbers we want.  We need safe places to park so that you do not get that gutting feeling when you come out and your bicycle is gone.  Yesterday, CI&Eacute; announced a new Heuston quarter.  It is 10 ha, so it is not small.  It includes Conyngham Road and the car park around Heuston Station.  It will go to planning permission next year.  There will be 1,000 homes within walking distance of the Luas stop but they are putting in a 5,000-place bicycle park.  This scheme is using the example of the likes of Utrecht and other incredible places where you see thousands of bicycles beside a train station.  Bicycles and trains are critical and work together.  It is also about people living there.  A bicycle gives someone 15-minute connectivity.  Someone could get down to the Point theatre from there in 15 minutes or get to St. Stephen's Green or Castleknock.  You have huge connectivity.  It goes back to the 15-minute city and transport-orientated development.  A lot of people would sign up for that.  The advantage is that if we provide good-quality safe infrastructure along the Liffey, and we are starting that, we will be surprised how quickly people will take to it.</p> <p>  Greenways are not just for tourists.  They are for local people.  They are about creating a safe space where people feel comfortable.  The coastal cycle route in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which was mentioned earlier, is an example of this revolutionary change because it allows people to bring kids and older people out.  There is a disability access scheme near the centre of the route.  Older people, people with disabilities and younger families are starting to get used to cycling.  Once you get used to it, you realise that it is a fantastic way of getting around our city.  Dublin is much drier than Copenhagen or Amsterdam.  Dublin is not as cold and dark as those cities.  It is just as flat with a few exceptions.  Mount Merrion might be a tough-----</p></speech>

First and foremost, we must provide the infrastructure.</p> <p>  Regarding the Luas and the wider greater Dublin area transport strategy review, what we do regarding the metro on the south side has been one of the most contentious and complicated issues.  The original plans to connect it to the green line near Beechwood Avenue became untenable because we had switched from what was going to be a driver system to a driverless, automated and segregated system.  As Senator Horkan knows, the green line was not designed in that way, so it would have meant effectively closing it for two or three years to reconfigure it.  That would not have been tenable.  My view is that we could have extended the metro from south of Charlemont near Ranelagh in either direction - south west, or south east towards UCD and on to Sandyford from there.  My personal view is that they have come up with a good engineering solution which, rather than continuing as an underground option, involves a light rail option to UCD and from there on to Sandyford, as well as a light rail option to the south west, as far as Terenure and Knocklyon.</p><p>What will happen with that is the increased amount we expect on the green line route will in part be catered for by the light rail line running to UCD.  There is huge demand for that.  It will reduce the increased demands we expect on the existing green line and make it work.</p><p> In the meantime it is not as if we are doing nothing.  All 26 trams on the green line are now 55 m long and eight new trams have just been purchased.  There is a significant increase in capacity on the green line and that, combined with the development of remote working, which will change some of the demand patterns, will leave a structured approach to the south side of the city with much more extensive use of light rail lines that really works.  My only regret, and it is a deep regret, is that the original design for the green line was to have a cycleway either side of it.  That was taken out at the very last minute because we felt we would be upgrading it to metro status and we did not want cyclists running beside metro trains.  If there was any way of bringing that back, we should, as it would also cater for a large volume of demand.  It will not be easy, given it was taken out originally in 2002.</p><p> The green line will work.  The rail solutions formulated by the NTA for Dublin will work.  I was not here for it but I believe there was a major hoo-ha about timelines and delivery.  That will depend, to a certain extent, on how quickly and effectively the various agencies deliver projects.  There should be real certainty now that the rail and transport-based solution is the way to go.  That is whether we are talking about the south side or Navan.  There is a variety of projects.  To my mind, they should be progressed and let us get them done.  How quickly they can be done depends on the planning system and how effectively the existing budget can be used.  That is why we need efficient use of the budget.</p></speech>

There is much money from the national development plan going to National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  We saw the report at the weekend that Eir is rolling out much of that infrastructure.  Will the Minister touch on, either now or later, how much other commercial operators are getting involved?  Are we duplicating work and State money in areas that will be commercially viable?  If commercial operators get in before NBI, is there any point in NBI going to such places at all?</p> <p>  We referenced in our private session electric scooters.  The committee received a letter about battery size arguing the current limit of 250 W is too low and not viable.  There is an argument for a higher limit for the battery of 500 W or 600 W.  One needs greater battery capacity using a scooter on a hill compared with flat ground.  There is the possibility of using geofencing to slow them in different areas and control speed but there is a requirement for a higher-capacity battery.  Will the Minister reflect on those points?</p></speech>

Part of me is cynical, worried and concerned yet excited about the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS.  I might be like a broken record on this.  People have seen all the glossy strategy documents and Facebook or social media posts on the different priority investments.  They want visualisation and priority delivery.  Part of me says we are never going to get this.  I am hoping we will.  I support the Minister on active travel, BusConnects and the light rail for Cork.  There is also the area of decarbonisation that the Minister spoke about in today's meeting.</p> <p>  We are very fortunate in Cork with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister has made appointments on the strategic rail review and the delivery of CMATS.  We are lucky that Mr. A.J. Cronin in the Cork Irish Rail office is very driven and I commend him and his staff.  How can we fast-track the delivery of these projects, as that is what people really want?</p></speech>

First and foremost, it is happening with rail.  This is next year's budget.  Our use of our portion of the European recovery and resilience fund will allow us to invest in the first phase of the upgrade from Midleton to Kent Station and will allow for the run-through from Kent Station out towards Blarney and Mallow.  That is not on the never-never but it is being budgeted for now, built and provided.  The real question is where some of the new stations go and how we might get the station at Tivoli, for example, in a timely manner.  There is the question of how to get some of the stations on the north side and where we might locate them to get this transport-oriented development concept working in Cork.</p> <p>  As the Senator has said, Irish Rail is very committed to this.  I see it as a kind of top priority and it is why it got the funding and is happening ahead of some of the other projects.  We need balanced regional development and for Cork to thrive.  It is not competing with other cities and it must stand on its own two feet and be successful.  The rail project is advancing and will not be stopped at this stage.  It is real.</p> <p>  If the Senator wishes to continue on the rail area, I can come back to bus and cycling developments.</p></speech>

There has been much commentary and many newspaper articles have been written about the M20 between Cork and Limerick.  Taking Deputy Cathal Crowe's point, there is a real need for the project.  There should be no ambiguity around the Cork to Limerick motorway.  That corridor from Cork to Limerick is critical to the economic development of both Cork and Limerick and it is about balanced regional development.  It is a pivotal project that must go ahead and supported by all of us in the Government.  I accept the Minister's comments around different issues with transport and different ways of travelling - these modal shifts - but we are talking about enhanced regional accessibility and connectivity.  In the context of the national development plan, Cork is the counterfoil to Dublin or Belfast so that road is pivotal.</p> <p>  We can look at the route from Rosslare to Waterford to Cork.  The urban network of motorways is important and I really hope the Government understands that.  It is important we stick with the messaging in a time of Covid-19 when it comes to economic development of regions outside Dublin.  That road corridor is important.</p></speech>

We all recognise the current road is not safe or fit for purpose.  It must be improved and the question is how.  Connectivity between Cork and Limerick must be improved.  Various options are being considered and I understand they include improved rail connectivity between Cork and Limerick.</p></speech>

A rail corridor between Cork and Limerick is about as good as a sieve and a bucket.  It needs to be a road.  I travelled the Cork-Limerick road last week and it is absolutely unsafe.  If we are talking about hauliers, goods or even just accessibility from Limerick to Cork it makes no sense to try to talk about changing anything else.  I do not want to have a row because it is something I passionately believe in.</p></speech>

We absolutely need to improve that.  The question is how and what route.  There are a variety of options there for both road and rail.  Let us not prejudge it.  I know that road intimately.  I have been up and down it hundreds of times, so I am fully aware of that issue.  I am aware also of the need to get traffic out of the centre of the towns of Buttevant, Charleville and Mallow and make them really vibrant places.</p> <p>  I believe it was Professor Edgar Morgenroth, who was involved in the drafting of the early stages of the NDP, who made the point that if we really want Cork and Limerick to thrive, we must invest in them.  The infrastructure in the cities is going to be key to attracting investment and being able to bring housing back to the centre.  Cork has a real problem in that it has sprawled.  Everyone has gone to Ballincollig, Carrigaline, Mallow and every point on the compass beyond that.  They are commuting from as far as Skibbereen and beyond into Cork.  We must bring life back into the centre.  To make that work we need good quality-----</p></speech>

You cannot get more Cork than the South Mall and MacCurtain Street, both of which are starting to create a better public environment for active travel and also BusConnects.  However, we need to do much more.  I recognise this is difficult.  I mentioned Deansgrange and Strand Road, where we had difficulties.  The Wilton Road on Cork is another example of the precursor of the light rail route.  I understand exactly why the residents there were concerned and why it could not be got through the council in the first place.  We need to look at what has worked in Dublin with some of the public consultation on BusConnects.  We willing to use concepts like bus gates, one-way systems and reducing and holding back traffic to provide the safe space for public transport.  I see the first key BusConnects route in Cork as going from Mahon and the docklands, through the city centre and out the Western Road.  Whether it goes via the Wilton Road or straight out to Ballincollig is the sort of detail that can be worked out, but the route needs to be built quickly.  That may require us to say we are going to restrict traffic, but we are going to provide a world-class public transport system and a better cycling system.  That is a decision for the city of Cork and for those transport offices like the NTA.  The prize, if we can deliver it and we get the demand and the housing close to it, is that this sort of route can be upgraded to light rail.  Meanwhile, the Senator will know the BusConnects project for Cork is out for consultation at the moment.</p></speech>

It provides much better connectivity from the north side to the south side of Cork.  It provides end-to-end journey routes that make sense.  Delivering that is now the key.  That public consultation is under way.  The quicker Cork can deliver on that, the more it will thrive.  I do not see anything to stop us other than political will.  I think the council will be up for it because what is the other option?  It is just a car-based system that is a sprawl system.  That is the key issue for Cork and I think Cork is ready to make that leap.</p></speech>

If we take Ballincollig to Carrigaline via Mahon, the whole bus network and a 24-hour bus is important.  I also believe the CMATS implementation office needs to be resourced and beefed up so it can drive and pull together the different strands.  I am aware there is a commitment to delivering that office in Cork.  The Minister referenced Wilton Road as an example.  There was huge resistance from the residents despite the best will of many of the councillors.  As the Minister said, I can understand the reluctance of the residents because they are on a busy road as it is.  I hope he drives the CMATS implementation office in Cork as well.</p> <p>  My final point is there is huge progress and there are huge positives.  The Minister has my full support on the whole issue we are trying to achieve.  I am just concerned that we will say the Cork-Limerick road is not necessarily of importance.  In his opening remarks, the Minister spoke about where we will be with transport in ten years' time.  There needs to be a strategic direction.  It is tricky, as he said.  We are a dispersed population.  As my father keeps telling me, what is the option for the person living in Kilmichael, who is a good bit from Dunmanway and a good bit from Macroom, to get onto the main road between Cork and Macroom?  These are the people we must try to win over as well.  It is okay for us urbanites or townies who are close to major access points for transport.  What of the person who is living in rural Ireland, such as out in Kilmichael, who is off the beaten track in terms of connectivity to the population centre or to the main artery?  We need to support them.  I thank the Minister for his engagement.</p></speech>

First, I would always listen to Senator Buttimer's father.  He is a very wise man and a good counsel.  Secondly, will the Minister give clarity on the funding of a CMATS office in Cork?</p></speech>

I have met the NTA and the local authorities on several occasions.  We have provided ongoing support and additional staff positions.  What I am saying very specifically to the NTA is that the skills it has built up in Dublin, especially on the BusConnects design system, need to be transferred now or it needs to ensure those skills can help us in Cork and elsewhere.</p> <p>  On metropolitan rail, I think Irish Rail has it in hand.  It will manage that.  I do not see resources being a restriction at all.  We have NTA officials based in Cork.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on a couple of themes, the first of which is broadband.  I want to ask the Minister about two things.  We have had NBI before us quite a number of times.  Recently, we visited their headquarters as a committee.  Two matters came up, the first of which was the delay in the process of getting the section 254 licence for the poles and the road opening licence.  NBI said to us that section 254 submissions and road opening licence approvals are considered to be among the most significant risks to the project.  I know there have been interdepartmental groups headed up by the Department.  What is it doing to speed up that process and to interact with the local authorities?</p> <p>  The second point that we, as a committee, have put forward to NBI is that we need to see immediate movement on the gap intervention areas, namely, the areas alongside existing blue areas where commercial operators have rolled out fibre broadband in rural areas.  Under the original plan, many of those areas may not, because of the roll-out, have got broadband for three or four years.  NBI has come back to us.  It has gone out to tender.  It now has five private service providers that will look to provide fibre broadband in those gap intervention areas.  We cannot have a situation where somebody in a rural area is looking out their back window at their next-door neighbour who has fibre while he or she does not.  I have it in Murroe, County Limerick and could name many other locations.  Our understanding is that under the contract NBI will be entitled to do this.</p> <p>  I will summarise my two questions.  First, what is the Minister doing to expedite the licences being issued by the local authorities for poles being erected and road opening licences?  Second, if NBI comes to the Department with a proposal to involve other commercial operators with their fibre broadband to expedite the roll-out of broadband to these gap intervention areas, will it support that proposal?</p></speech>

It has been subject to a number of delays for two to three reasons and we must overcome each of them.  The first of these was Covid.  We all know about the difficulties with getting contractors in and getting work done but that should no longer stop us.</p><p>Staff staying away from the office should not affect the NBP, so that is manageable.</p><p> The second reason was, as the Chairman said, the section 254 licensing.  It was a particular problem through the spring and the summer and was subject to real difficulty in getting poles through in time.  Recognising it as a problem, both the NBI team and the team in our Department worked with local authorities and overcame a lot of those difficulties.  I happened to be talking to the officials this morning, and my sense is that a lot of those difficulties have been overcome.  There are still some difficulties, with one or two councils concerned about issues with putting a duct in the ground on the verge of private road or private space-----</p></speech>

NBI is coming back to the Department with statistics on each local authority and on how quickly it is getting the likes of applications for the erection of poles and the opening of roads-----</p></speech>

The extent of that problem is greater than had originally been expected.  That has caused a real difficulty, which still has not been overcome and needs to be.  We have all seen and will see further that the number of surveys that have been done is really high.  They have taken off.  Actual build-outs are being held up because of the three problems to which I referred, particularly the last one.  We will overcome that problem working with Eir and NBI.</p> <p>  The one good piece of news is that all the national broadband connection points are pretty much done now.  We will see a rapid expansion covering pretty much all primary schools next year in order that every primary school in the country will be properly connected.  Where we have been able to issue contracts and have the service ready to go, I understand that the take-up has been very high, so the concept is working.  There is always in these large projects - I remember I happened to be talking to an engineer involved in one of the other-----</p></speech>

I have very specific questions.  In the original plan for the roll-out of the NBP, no priority was given to the gap intervention areas.  It is the biggest issue on the ground for us.  People look out from their back gardens and out their front doors and see their neighbours with fibre broadband and they do not have it because the commercial operator did not roll it out.  NBI has gone out and got five preferred service providers.  It will now look to have a project in place by quarter 1 of next year.  If NBI comes to the Department with that proposal, will the Department support it in expediting the roll-out of fibre broadband to these gap intervention areas?</p></speech>

I believe that the motorway could cost, at the outside, &euro;10 million per kilometre, which would come in at &euro;900 million in total.  If the cost per kilometre went up to even &euro;15 million, the total cost would be in the order of &euro;1.3 billion or &euro;1.4 billion.  We might engage with the Department on the figures because we can differ on views but, for me, this is about the hard facts of the cost.</p> <p>  As for the rail network, we had Jim Meade, the head of Irish Rail, in before the committee and he stated that to do a second rail line between Limerick Junction and Limerick city stations would cost between &euro;60 million to &euro;80 million.

TII is doing the M20 and the NTA is doing the Limerick metropolitan area transport strategy, LMATS.  He mentioned the northern distributor road.

It is significant and requires a switch towards compact, low-carbon and balanced regional development.  That is why Limerick rail, Cork rail and BusConnects in all these cities are important.</p> <p>  Going back to low-carbon development, there is a legislative force now in that the climate Act requires us to halve emissions in the next decade.  I have always said - and I think it is true - that people always put attention on agriculture as being the most difficult sector.  I do not think it is; transport is the most difficult by a country mile.  There is a requirement under the climate Act, backed up by European law as well now, that we halve our emissions in the next decade.  That is beyond compare-----</p></speech>

We must be serious about balanced regional development.  Some 42%, or 38 km, of the existing M20 has no hard shoulder.  I have driven that route countless times and, I am sorry but it is a dangerous route.  There are a significant number of fatalities on the route.  There are other issues.  I ask that TII and the NTA be allowed to continue with the process that is under way on both the M20 and the LMATS.</p></speech>

We want Cork and Limerick cities to thrive and to grow.  Looking at what is happening in other cities across Europe and indeed the world, where is the investment and where is the quality of life really increasing?  That will happen in those cities that invest in the public realm, public transport and the active travel systems within those cities.</p><p>We need connectivity, but the priority should be improving accessible public transport in the centre of our cities.  When I say centres, I am including the entire Cork area.</p></speech>

The reality is we have to look at the development plan as a 20-year project through to 2040.  There will be significant further budget availability.  The basic maths are that we have &euro;35 billion allocated for this decade.  Roughly &euro;13 billion of that will be used to maintain the existing road and rail network.  Most of the money will be spent on roads.  We have to do that for the purpose of road safety.</p></speech>

Of the &euro;22 billion remaining, we have committed &euro;4 billion to active travel, which is correct and no one disagrees with that.  Of the remainder, there will be &euro;12 billion for public transport and &euro;6 billion for roads.  That &euro;6 billion also has to provide for an endless number of bypasses and other road projects we want to carry out for road safety and other reasons.  There is a budget constraint as part of this, and we have to recognise that is real.  We can manage it and complete all of the public transport projects, including roads.</p></speech>

I will continue with some of the questions and back and forth the Chair and Minister were engaged in.</p><p>On section 254 guidelines, it would be fair to say that National Broadband Ireland, NBI, said the streamlining has improved things.  I ask the Minister to correct me if I make a mistake, but NBI said what it really wanted in a perfect world was a different planning permission system similar to what operates in the North.  In the North, poles or whatever are okayed, and if slight changes are required, people do not have to reapply.  The project is signed off at the end while making sure that due diligence is carried out.</p><p>I am aware of the Attorney General's review.  Maybe if I have time later on, I will have some specific questions on that.  The NBI referred to the Covid catch-up, which may involve a timeline for March and, in particular, acceleration.  Everyone has used the term from seven years to five years.  It outlines what the NBI would require and it referred to certain local authorities being better than others.  It said what it really required was a resource at local authority level, which would not involve a broadband person who then contacts a road engineer or planner.  Rather, it could be a single person who would be <i>au fait </i>with the situation and have some level of authority regarding planning and road engineering.  I will not mention the council, but it said in one particular council this has already happened.  If that is the case, it is something we should look at expediting.  It said it will become critical at the point in time when the acceleration plan is put in place.  If the Minister could comment on that, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, this is complicated because the Attorney General is carrying out a wider view of our planning system.  Making legislative amendments in advance or outside of that requires us to be careful because we do not want to add to what is a spaghetti of amendments to the original 2001 Act.  It would be better to do that in tandem with the review.</p> <p>  The Covid catch-up may take longer.  The key issue will not necessarily be section 254.  Rather, it will be the issue I mentioned around ducting and access to ducting.  A large amount of survey work has been done.  It is at the design-to-build phase that people find a duct is not accessible or is being fully used.  That will be the most complex issue.</p></speech>

I will draw the attention of the Minister to what he has mentioned as regards the intervention area and Eir.  In straightforward terms, I assume the Minister has done a wee bit of due diligence on this.  Regarding the intervention area, does he have any idea how many premises have been passed by Eir and how many currently have access to Eir and NBI networks?  Does the Minister know whether any other operators such as SIRO will also do pieces of work on the intervention area?  I accept there is nothing stopping anybody from doing this.</p></speech>

There is another positive and progressive development which will allow, in a limited number of circumstances, for other operators such as Eir to be able to deliver for NBI within the intervention area where it is much more economic and efficient for that to happen.  That might help houses on an isolated margin on the edge of a twilight zone between two areas.  That is one good news development I heard about this morning.  I will come back to the Deputy on the other comments.  The summary of the assessment I got from the Department's morning was that the overlap with the Eir is not-----</p></speech>

Some of my questions can only be addressed when we get answers on the numbers.  Was it foreseen that there would be an overlap in some of these areas?  I accept that at times NBI will build to get to the next area.  Some places, if we are talking about a seven-year project, will become more viable for SIRO or Eir to build into, in particular in a first area.  The major play that was made in the paper was that taxpayers could pay for NBI to build and duplicate or for NBI not to build at all and be paid.  What allowances and leeway are there with the contract?</p></speech>

The benefit for the country will be when we roll this out, combined with the recent increased investment by Virgin Media and SIRO, as well as Eir, the NBI and other operators.  We are within grasp of the prize of having what will probably be the most comprehensive high-quality fibre connectivity across the country.  The economic benefits of that are immense in terms of how we deliver public services and support balanced regional and economic development.  This is a project that delivers real value for money.</p> <p>  On the contractual issues around places that are between two areas, the Department has to make sure there is proper management of the contract so that there is not undue spending.  The public wants acceleration and the network to be built faster.</p></speech>

Questions are in the public domain and we want answers.  I accept it is not the responsibility of the Minister whether all of the necessary due diligence regarding the procurement process was done in terms of putting a contract in place.  He said there is a sufficient amount of leeway, and in situations where NBI will not build but somebody else will, NBI will not be paid a huge contingency payment.</p></speech>

If we could get that information, it would assist.  We might have to do our own work on this.  In fairness to the Minister, the matter takes in the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and relates to the provision of the other pieces of information.</p> <p>  NBI has been open.  In our interaction with it, we probably need a bit more information, including on its website.  We need information not only on how many properties are available for preorder but also on how many have been passed.  In fairness, the only genuine issue for NBI will be if it does not make the 60,000.  We all accept the Covid difficulties and all the rest of it but the shooting match for it in the next while is reaching the January target of 60,000.</p></speech>

I want to start with the Luas green line, with which I am very familiar.  Between 7 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. at Glencairn, which is a short distance from Bride's Glen, the Luas trams are already packed.  As the Minister knows, there is massive development right beside the British ambassador's residence, and there is about to be additional development at the edge of Leopardstown Heights.  Added to this is all the development that has taken place over in Aiken village.  How does the Minister envisage the green line will continue to meet demand in the area?</p> <p>  Will I ask all my questions or deal with one at a time?</p></speech>

It was proposed to extend all 26 trams to 55 m, and an additional eight new trams are being purchased.  The key point is increasing the frequency, including through work at the St. Stephen's Green junction.  There is scope to increase capacity.  The Senator is correct.  I use the Luas regularly during the morning peak hours.  Numbers are starting to come back.  It can be tackled by addressing the capacity issues.  In the longer term, as I said in reply to Senator Horkan, the Luas line from UCD to Sandyford will take some of the passengers.  The BusConnects proposals will also have an impact.  It is an integrated approach, involving an increase in public transport capacity overall.  The line will not be upgraded to metro status in the long run, so that will not be the solution.  I do not believe it should be and believe it would have been a bad engineering solution.  The Senator is correct that there is significant development in places such as Cherrywood, Glencairn and various other points along the line, but a combination of capacity increases on the existing line, the addition of a new line, particularly from UCD to Sandyford, and the other public transport projects will be the way to manage the long-term development.</p></speech>

If we could have a cycleway along the line, perhaps all the way to Ranelagh, it would be fantastic because it would serve many secondary schools on the way and get kids off the road.</p><p> I know the Minister is favourably disposed at least to exploring the idea of very light rail for Galway.  Galway city is frequently at a standstill from Oranmore almost to Barna at peak hours.  The very light rail project that I discussed recently with some of the planning people has considerable merit.  The Minister mentioned a feasibility study.  Are we talking about a full feasibility study for that or is it just a desk exercise?</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Senator was listening earlier when I was discussing the development in Cork with Senator Buttimer.  We will look to build a high-capacity BusConnects corridor through the city, and then when the demand is shown to rise, we would upgrade it to light rail.  I think the second is a real possibility in Galway.  I know the group in Galway rightly proposed two light rail lines.  The first one, as I see it, is from Barna, by Taylor's Hill Road, down to the hospital, by the university, over the Salmon Weir Bridge, through the centre and out towards Parkmore and all the industrial estates.  That route, which would cope with the real problem in Galway of everyone living on one side of the city and working on the other side, is the most urgent project.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the route is reasonably well advanced.  I believe the proposals for that Salmon Weir Bridge solution are already in the planning system.  That is progressing.  Let us build that at full speed.  In that context, a review next year will look at how that might be upgraded to light rail.  That is the way to do it.  We should build the BusConnects first and get the alignment which makes it much easier.  Establishing the alignment, the demand and the route along with getting the planning to back it up is the way to make it happen.</p></speech>

If we are building a footbridge across there to the university, it strikes me that there is an opportunity to invest there now and provide an additional bridge specifically for public transport coming from Woodquay right across the Corrib on the old Clifden line into Newcastle, feeding the hospital and all that area.  How would the Minister feel about that?</p></speech>

Alternatively, the bridge to be used for the BusConnects could be converted to light rail.  That will take time and it requires the BusConnects to go in first, which will not be easy.  There will be difficult decisions.  Galway traffic is probably the most congested and the poorest planned.  It will not be easy to make the decision to give priority to the bus corridor, but if we can do that, it opens the prospect of it being converted to light rail.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister's commitment to it.</p> <p>  I spoke to some people last week on the Galway proposals for Connecting Ireland.  I am concerned that some of the planning has taken place at desk level and that people on the ground are not aware.  For example, I made the point last week that the Annaghdown commuter stop is 10.4 km from Annaghdown and the Corrandulla one is 1.5 km from Corrandulla village.  I flag that to the Minister because we need people to get on the ground and be sure of what they are talking about before they put plans in place with respect to the future commuter links coming into Galway city.  It is all a question of getting as much traffic off the road as we possibly can in Galway.</p></speech>

We were recently talking to people in Ballinasloe about whether new Local Link services being put in were connected to the hospital.  It is important to understand the actual need at a local level.  In some of the examples developed recently, the use of Local Link services was very interesting.  In Leitrim they were incorporated in the first roll-out.  We envisage almost a doubling or quadrupling of Local Link services because they have great local knowledge, providing the flexibility to get people to the right place and getting the stops in the right place.</p></speech>

I am seeing an increasing number of parents with very young children on e-scooters as pillion passengers.  From what I can see, no helmets are being used.  I believe it is only a matter of time before we will, unfortunately, have a fatality.  How soon will we have regulation in that area?</p></speech>

As the Senator knows, it takes time to put regulations in place, particularly when significant safety issues are involved, as we have with e-scooters.  There is a delicate balance.  I look forward to debating the matter with the Senator in the Seanad.  There are enormous benefits from the use of e-scooters and a range of other mobility options, but there are safety issues.  It is not without risks and downsides.  The legislation is being framed based on the learning from other countries.  We are very aware of what other cities and countries have done.  Most of them are ahead of us in introducing regulations on speed, helmets and where the e-scooters can and cannot go.</p> <p>  If I were to summarise it, it is more akin to cycling, and as we build new cycling infrastructure, that is the right place to put e-scooters - not on the pavement but on the cycle lane.  Like cycling, I believe it will not have mandatory helmets.  We will need to have speed restrictions because that is the biggest risk factor.  This is not without its own complications and safety issues, including the one the Senator mentioned.  My recollection of the regulations is that I think we are precluding people from being carried; I will need to go back and check it.  That is something that would raise concerns.  We will look at the details of the legislation when it comes to the Seanad.</p></speech>

I am at a loss to understand what the logjam is with respect to considering the amendments prepared by the Irish Air Line Pilots Association which I along with others have sponsored in the Seanad.  It seems that when a decision is made on a Bill, it is written in stone and nobody is prepared to listen to any other views, even those of the experts.  These are the people who fly the aeroplanes and I believe they are the people we should be listening to.  Is there something ideological that prevents a Minister changing the published legislation when good arguments are made?</p></speech>

I look forward to listening to the arguments.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, introduced that Bill on Second Stage.  Subject to advice from the Department, I am always open to amendments.  I would not rule anything out in that regard.  I do not promise anything as I do not know the details of the amendments.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, the amendments are about safety in the air, proposed by the people who are the practitioners on the ground.  I implore and beg the Minister to go back and talk to his departmental officials and ask them to do some listening on this one.  Let us not waste time and delay the legislation going through the House.</p></speech>

I will raise a number of issues and projects with him in the context of the national development plan.  If he does not have the information to hand, perhaps he will organise a written response to be issued to me via his office.</p><p> I will return to the issue of rail, specifically the line between Ennis and Limerick.  I have raised the issue of flooding at Ballycar with the Minister previously.  He will recall an in-depth report was commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and compiled by RPS consultants on foot of work done by the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development during the period of the previous D&aacute;il.  A recommended option has been put forward, which has a costing of &euro;16.5 million.  I have raised this issue with the Minister during committee meetings and I have submitted parliamentary questions about it.  I do not like the responses I got, especially the replies I received to parliamentary questions.  The Department of Transport is basically washing its hands of providing a solution to the issues that still remain in Ballycar.  Flooding there is a constant battle.  Ballycar is on the western rail corridor and is an important link between Ennis and Limerick.  The solution that has been identified needs to be put in place.  The key thing is to provide the funding to do it.</p><p> I am asking for collaboration between the Department of Transport and the Office of Public Works, OPW.  If we do not have collaboration between two State entities to fund this project, I do not think we are doing anything.  We have very ambitious plans for rail, but if we cannot sort out a bread and butter issue, which involves flooding of that line for possibly up to 22 weeks at a time, I do not think we can do anything.  I would like to get a commitment from the Minister today that he will personally get involved in finding a resolution to this and that the Department of Transport, as a key stakeholder, will sit down with the OPW and come up with a solution to fund option 2 from the report, which is costed at &euro;16.5 million.  Perhaps he will make some comments on this issue.</p></speech>

It is a flooding issue and numerous landowners are involved.  While the Department of the Transport could pretend it has full control or the yea or nay on it, it is, in truth, the local authority and the OPW that are responsible for making decisions about and addressing flooding.  We will row in, work with the OPW and make sure to help in whatever way we can, but my understanding is the OPW and the local authority are where the key decisions have to be made when it comes to best options.  We will support them, including financial support if necessary, but it is not for the railway company to address the flooding issue because it involves so many other landowners in the area.  The Deputy will know we have to be careful in how we treat and respect landowners who are equally affected by this.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his commitment in that regard but some Department needs to take the lead.  Given his interest in rail and the western rail corridor, and this is a particular area of it where there is a problem, I ask that he keeps me fully briefed on progress between his Department and the OPW to bring about a solution to this issue.</p></speech>

I believe it is an idea that was first floated in 1999 by the late Councillor Sean Hillery.  I would like to see a roadmap developed and produced in respect of that spur because it is of major importance.  It will ensure our mid-west region is attractive to inward investment and will provide much-needed connectivity to the main rail network in our country.  We need to kick on with this, develop those plans, get them in place and provide that connectivity.  We could achieve that if we put together a proper roadmap for this project.  Is the Minister interested in doing that?  What are his views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1819" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#M00600"><p>We might call it a rail map rather than a roadmap but, yes, absolutely.  We need to do a whole variety of things in Limerick to use and add to the existing rail infrastructure.  The first is the Colbert Station development and the likes of a new station at Moyross, which has real potential as it is within walking distance of Thomond Park and Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and it is on an existing line where services are already running.  We also need to look at the reopening of new stations.  We mentioned earlier the twin-tracking from Limerick Junction to Colbert Station, which would also give potential new stations.  The reopening of the Foynes line for freight and commuter services and the electrification of the whole network are other projects.  From my perspective, one of the advantages coming from the new battery-electric trains is that they can cover the sort of distances needed for a Limerick regional metropolitan rail that might run from Nenagh as far as Foynes, which it could in the long run although it will take time, or even in the direction of Shannon.  That is the potential.  In the long run, it gives us a very efficient, low-carbon commuter and inter-urban rail system.  It will take time.</p> <p>  The Shannon line is the more difficult because it will be a new rail line, if we run it all the way to Shannon.  Perhaps it could start initially with a connecting bus service from Cratloe or Sixmilebridge, which would be the obvious options.  When this was looked at originally in 1999, my understanding is there would be capacity issues on the Ennis line if it ran two ways.  If I correctly recall, consideration was even given to a circular route, which would come back into the city on a new line.  Once we start building new lines, it is very expensive.  That is why the first priority is to develop existing lines and stations.</p> <p>  I keep coming back to the fact that Limerick has a decision to make.  Do its residents want to go for the sustainable option, using existing rail infrastructure and developing around that, or do they want to go into County Clare, in effect, and become a Clare and Limerick city?  I think it should be the former.  That is where real potential investment and very good quality development lies because the lines are there and are underutilised.</p></speech>

He might correspond with me on that.</p> <p>  Since I am talking about Shannon, there is a need for a new national aviation policy.  Reference is made in the national development plan to it.  Work on it has been delayed because of the Covid pandemic.  Will the Minister please outline what the thinking is in the Department at present in respect of getting work under way on that policy?  Will there be an opportunity for stakeholders to engage in that process?  I would like to see a lot more balanced regional development and more activity through Shannon Airport and the west, which will be a way to balance regional development.  We need to link national aviation policy with the national development plan.  It is great to see aviation policy mentioned in it.  We need to get work under way.  The Minister needs to engage with and listen to stakeholders in that regard.  He needs to look at the benefits of spreading out aviation traffic in a fairer way throughout the island.</p><p>It is interesting on aviation.  I look forward to meeting again the new chair of Shannon Airport, former Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  My sense is he will be looking at this area and may have a particular emphasis on how Shannon presents itself as a centre for sustainable aviation.  It has the advantage of a very long runway which can take heavier payloads than other airports and, being further west, it is a lower carbon solution when crossing the Atlantic.</p><p> I met the UK transport minister recently.  They are developing a strategy where they look to use 10% biofuels or synthetics fuels in aviation as a way of decarbonising.  In my visit to Glasgow last week, I happened the chief executive of United Airlines, who said the same thing, that they want to be the best in developing sustainable aviation solutions.  I said something to him which is broad and long term but real.  It is that we will develop the Shannon estuary as a centre for low-carbon technologies.  We will have offshore wind, convert to hydrogen and look for industries that want to use that low-carbon energy source.  The power-to-fuel concept or the idea of synthetic fuels is at an early stage.  No one has scaled up an operating model but the UK Government says it wants to do so.  I said to him that if he wanted a partner to centre and test some of these sustainable development solutions, Shannon might be as good a location as any.  It was at the forefront of the development of transatlantic travel with the flying boats coming in.  The airport is located right beside where we bring the power ashore.  My strategic thinking is that must give us potential opportunities to connect the two and give the airport a significant long-term future.  If we crack that, Shannon will boom.</p></speech>

She has done a lot of work in this regard.  I have engaged with the T&aacute;naiste and his office on this and would like if the Minister would meet with this individual and further explore the issues he has spoken about and the opportunities that exist in Shannon to develop that type of low-carbon economy around aviation.  There is great opportunity there.  Will the Minister give a commitment to engage on this with me?</p></speech>

We could keep the link up.  It is about connectivity, whether it is rail, road, bus or whatever.  It could be moved on pretty quickly.  Jim Meade and Irish Rail are keen to get going on the commuter rail link in Limerick.  It looks to me it could be up and running in two years.  I know the Minister is supportive of that.

It could be of the order of &euro;200 million.  The point I am making is that I agree with public transport but I do not believe these modes are mutually exclusive.  The Minister spoke about the northern distributor road.  He can ask anyone in Limerick or, when he comes to Limerick, go out to Coonagh and look at the road under construction and the benefits.  It will have a bus corridor on it.  That is why people are so interested.  It is not just about public transport for the northern distributor road.  It is a ring road around the city and will bring many benefits.  It can be for public transport and there can be a rail system in the city.  The commuter line can be upgraded between Limerick Junction and Limerick city.  That will cut 20 minutes off a journey time from Cork to Limerick, ten minutes travel time and people will not have to get out of the train.  It is similar with the M20.  I do not believe any of them is mutually exclusive.  They all bring about that balanced regional development.</p></speech>

I ask for the Chair's protection here.  It is important to give full context because my time is limited and precious.  Concerning things like the metro line in Dublin or Luas lines planned for Cork, I said to the Secretary General of the Minister's Department in the Committee of Public Accounts last week that there is extreme frustration among public representatives and the public about how quickly we can develop the public transport we desperately need.  Do we need to reform that process?  It is not about identifying fault, but about seeing where there is room for improvement.  The Minister has a &euro;165 billion plan and I want to know how he intends to spend it.</p></speech>

We are always looking for ways of improving but the advantage we have at present, in my experience, is that the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Irish Rail are the three big public transport delivery agencies.  They work in co-operation and are very professional.  I do not see that as the core of our problem.  The biggest problems we have had have been political and around planning.  We all know the planning system here is subject to incredibly complex legal delays.  If reform is needed, it is in that planning system and that is what the Government is doing through the Attorney General's office.</p></speech>

The work the Attorney General is doing is obviously a very important part of Government business at the moment.  It is critically important that all relevant civil servants in the Minister's Department, including the Minister, would feed into that process.  It is crucial that all feedback is given, including the local authorities, which are often able to get away with being responsible for many of the delays with regard to public transport projects.  An issue that has arisen from conversations I have had with key State agencies is around improving the planning process.  We have such an opportunity as a Government to grab the bull by the horns in terms of trying to solve that.  We need to get everybody in at the right time, however, and that should be done over the course of the next 12 months.  It is very important.</p> <p>  I wish to raise another issue with the Minister in the limited amount of time I have.  When is the allocation for national roads funding going to be released by the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1845" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#O00300"><p>On the first point, I am in direct contact with the Attorney General.  That work will have to be concluded within the year and the Deputy is absolutely right; other stakeholders need to be involved in it.  My understanding is that the board of TII is meeting next week.  I presume that after that meeting, it will outline what the broad allocations are and the approach it is taking within the existing national development plan, NDP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1846" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#O00400"><p>I want to outline one fundamental concern to the Minister, which I have mentioned previously at the committee in his absence.  While he is here with me, however, it is important to say that there are flaws with the system for the national allocations that go to national roads and national secondary roads through TII's funding budgets.</p> <p>  One very clear example of that, with which I know the Minister is very familiar at this stage, is the N73 road in north Cork.  We have a situation where TII was releasing detailed plans in terms of its annual expenditure but was not honouring some of the items that were covered within that documentation.  I have a very serious concern as a rural Deputy and a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy that those budgets are not being honoured.  What I suspect we are seeing, about which I need to get clarification, is around its annual budgets.  It appears that money is being spent on other projects, therefore, smaller projects, which are also important to many communities, are not getting the funding that had been budgeted for them at the start of the year.  The N73 was a very important example of that whereby &euro;1.5 million had been allocated in January but when it came to the time for that budget to be actually spent, the money was unavailable.  That is completely unacceptable.</p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Minister already, particularly during our meeting with the Taoiseach.  It is important when those annual allocations are made that sufficient budgets are given and money is ring-fenced in order that those works can progress.  They are fundamentally extraordinarily important in terms of road safety and the N73.  It is an extremely dangerous road and it needs increased funding.  Cork County Council has taken all the steps it has been asked to take by TII in order to prepare that road to go the construction phase so it can do the upgrade and safety works that are badly needed in the north Cork area.  I ask the Minister to look individually at that particular issue because it is an anomaly that I do not understand.  I do not really understand how State agencies can get away with doing these types of things.  It is just not good practice from an accounting point of view to make budgets and then not honour them within a financial year, and that is precisely what happened in this case.  Is that something the Minister can commit to looking into for me?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1847" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#O00500"><p>I will look into it.  I will make a broader point.  I went into the mathematics earlier of how we have &euro;35 billion and how we will spend it.  There is roughly &euro;6 billion for new roads investment in this decade.  In that figure, and I believe the Chairman and other members may have been aware of this, the first half of the decade will be a much smaller allocation than the second half of the decade.  That is due to the timeline of a variety of different projects such as the major public transportation projects in Cork, Limerick and Dublin requiring significant upfront investment and expenditure as the start.  What we expect in this first five years is, therefore, only a small fraction of the overall roads budget compared to the second, which is approximately four point something billion in the first half and one point something billion in the first half.  There will, therefore, be a very scarce allocation resource within the first five years.  There will, though, be the potential for us to identify which are the projects that will be ready to hit the road - excuse the pun - as soon as that budget window increases.  My direction on that, which is contained in the NDP, is that the priority should be on compact development.  We, therefore, support bypasses, relief roads and Town Centre First projects as a priority, as per the national planning framework.</p> <p>  We also critically mentioned here several times that road safety is what they have to do.  I am sorry; the first priority is maintaining the existing network because that is the first road safety measure we have to enhance.  It also saves money in the long run because if we let a road go, it costs much more money to bring it back to proper standards.  Within the allocations, therefore, there will be a significant amount of work that is ongoing, such as the Macroom bypass, the Westport to Castelbar road, the Dunkettle roundabout and so on.  I could go on.  There will be new projects that are very close to decision gate, such as the M28 or others like the Adare bypass.  Then, a large number of other projects will be advanced in the planning, design and development stages with the instruction to TII to optimise for bypasses.  For example, therefore, on the N26 Cahir to Limerick Junction, let us do Tipperary town first.  That has been widely discussed among Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  Also, we must do all that work so that we are ready to go when the budget starts to become available for the bypasses and relief roads that I believe should be at the centre of our roads policy for the next five, ten and 20 years.</p></speech>

I have one other issue.  The two to one strategy on public investment in public transport versus that of roads is something about which I have many concerns as a rural Deputy.  The obvious reality is that the lion's share of that public transport investment will be going into Dublin, particularly the metro project.  It is a mammoth project in terms of the capital resources that will be allocated into that area.  I ask, therefore, that that ratio would get further analysis to make sure there is balanced development on behalf of every Member of the Oireachtas in this House who is not from Dublin.  That is incredibly important to all of us to ensure that all of our regions are being helped.  As the Minister well knows, even in my area, and dare I mention Castlemartyr and Killeagh, which I must because that is a prime example, our public transport services in that region, including those heading off towards the west Waterford direction and towards Waterford city, are entirely dependent on the quality of the national roads that the bus services service as well.  That point must be made, therefore, because many parts of Ireland do not have access to a rail network.  That is just one key example.  That is my one word of caution, if I may say so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#O00700"><p>I agree.  That is why it is vital that we get the money for Connecting Ireland, the new rural bus systems we are going to put in place.  It is also vital we put the first-up money from the European Regional Development Fund into Cork rail.  We also need to get Dublin working, however.  It is not Dublin versus Cork, Dublin versus Limerick or Cork versus Limerick.  I am going on memory now; I cannot remember the exact source but I remember a call that was posited once that 70% of the tax revenue of the State is raised within 30 km of the General Post Office, GPO, and that money pays for everything else.  It is not, therefore, one city versus the other or rural versus urban.  That money will help us provide for the rural public transport services we need.</p></speech>

It is just to make the point that we cannot let Dublin gridlock because that would have knock-on consequences for the whole country.</p></speech>

If we do not want Dublin to be a gridlock, we must be able to be competitive.  That is why the Atlantic corridor is so important.  That is why national aviation policy must have as one of its terms of reference how we address the growth in travel exponentially through Dublin Airport versus Cork and Shannon airports.  It is very simple.  We are a small island with a heavy concentration of development in Dublin.</p><p>Moreover, this concentration of development in Dublin appears to be getting bigger.  We talk about it and yet we have such enormous capacity for development in the likes of Shannon Airport, Limerick city, Cork city and Galway.  That requires money from the public purse.  </p></speech>

The key question is what will see Galway, Cork, Waterford or Limerick thrive.  My position is that it will be if they position themselves as green cities of the future with compact low-carbon development and high-quality public transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1859" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#P00300"><p>I am not disagreeing but many industries are located in Cork, Limerick and Galway and are telling me they want to be able to commute from one to the other.  We must have connectivity.  Is the &euro;360 million, which is very good in terms of active travel, included in the 2:1 ratio for roads to public transport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1860" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#P00400"><p>No, it is separate.

We obviously want to push in that direction.  The Minister is right.  Up to 2025, there is not a huge amount of headroom based on the current spending proposals but many projects will get going from 2025.  I want to deal in hard facts.  I think the ratio is much higher than 2:1 because of things like active travel and other measures.  It is about facts.</p></speech>

There is a broader strategic point about where we are going.  What do we make and sell?  We make and sell very high-quality medical devices, biopharma, IT and financial services.  That is what we make and sell.  This is not necessarily shipped on heavy haulage.  Most of the haulage we do is in importing goods.  If we look at Limerick as a manufacturing and industry centre, it is not big bulk.  It is high-value and high-quality.  That is what we are brilliant at.  It is centred around the skills of our people.  In terms of developing cities and how we move people around, if we continue on a roads and private car-based system, it will not work.  Forget about the climate side of it for a second.  Let us look at the geometry of it.  We can see it in Galway more than anywhere else.  Everyone is trying to drive in and out of Parkmore, Ballybrit and other industrial estates.  At a certain point, that reaches its limit of capacity.  It is less so in Limerick because its traffic problem is not quite as bad as other cities but if everyone keeps driving to work and back, it will not work.  Investors and business people want to see countries and cities with really good-quality public transport, particularly in respect of Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford.</p></speech>

They are not mutually exclusive arguments.  I agree with the Minister about rail, public transport and active travel.  I have been at this a long time and I passionately believe that if we are to take that pressure off Dublin and compete with it on an international scale, we need to be equally served.  I want to be certain that someone can get from Cork to Galway in under two hours and that someone can get from Cork to Limerick in under an hour.  At the moment, if I come out my front door in Limerick, I can go to Galway in under an hour.  I can go to the Red Cow roundabout in under two hours while it can take me two and a half hours to get to Cork, which is half the distance.</p></speech>

While we could then build a northern distributor route in Cork so it gets around to Dunkettle, you basically would hit what we have already hit in Dublin.  You hit an M50 syndrome, where the roads are at maximum capacity and you cannot get any more traffic on them.  That is where we are in Dublin.  In Dublin, we will face a really difficult retrofitting out of that problem because it physically cannot work.  As you cannot add another strand of spaghetti to the Red Cow roundabout or another extra lane on the M50, we must reverse engines out from the place we entered.  We do not need to do that in Limerick and Cork.  At this stage, we could really say that we should put the money into the rail network, into the bus system and into high-quality housing close to the centre.</p></speech>

We will differ on that point.  We will not get the synergies to make us competitive on a national and international level with the Atlantic corridor unless we get that fast connection between the cities; both rail and road.  Whether we like it or not, nearly 80% of the road between Cork and Limerick has no hard shoulder.  It is lethal and it does not work.  TII is doing its work and we will let it do it.</p></speech>

We have built capacity for about 80,000 vehicles per day and even as we speak, on the inter-points from Waterford to Dublin, there are probably only about 5,000 to 10,000 journeys per day so we have actually provided eight or ten times the capacity.  At a time when resources are constrained and when there is going to be real pressure for us to build out these railway stations in Limerick, as once we start and put it into Moyross, they will want it in Ballysimon and Dooradoyle-----</p></speech>

We heard from Senator Craughwell.  When there will be other areas where the public transport capacity is bursting at the seams, which will happen because people flock to it as soon as we build it, that will become a question of whether we provide something that is ten times the demand or meet it where we already know the demand is at full capacity.</p></speech>

We have a rail network going by Shannon Airport so we can do the spur.  We can upgrade the rail line between Limerick Junction and Limerick city, which will take 20 minutes off a train journey from Cork to Limerick with a direct service.  The last missing piece of the jigsaw is that if we have a motorway from Limerick to Galway and up along, have nothing connecting our two main cities and business people are tearing their hair over getting from Limerick to Cork, then we have a problem.  The Minister and I beg to differ.  TII will do its work and obviously it is a debate.  The Minister and I believe passionately in our views and they are both well held.  Hopefully, my view will be the dominant one.</p></speech>

I have a lot of questions and there will be many more in the future but I believe passionately that every single village and urban settlement in rural Ireland should have a public transport hub.</p></speech>

East Cork, which I represent, would be such an excellent model for the Minister to consider regarding implementing such a system.  If the Minister is serious about getting cars off the road but bringing people from rural Ireland with him on that journey, that is one of the only ways I can see it happening.  He could do it through a pilot project through the NTA like the Safe Schools programme or through the local authorities.  Every local authority in the country would appreciate that as well because many village settlements and small towns in Ireland are crying out for additional car parking space to encourage commerce in those centres but from a public transport point of view, this is definitely something we could do to help tackle climate change and help just transition in the area of transport.  There is a lot of bad press when it comes to rural Ireland and car usage but, unfortunately, there is no alternative.  Let us create that alternative.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.</p></speech>

That would fit in very well with the Connecting Ireland public consultation at the moment about how we create those hubs and connections.  That is what it is all about.

The first is the Slane bypass.  TII appeared before us a couple of weeks ago.  I noted that the Slane bypass was referenced as being in line with NSO 1., compact growth.  I would also argue that it is in line with NSO 2., enhanced regional accessibility and the road to Derry as well.  Given what the Minister said about roads funding, and we know the figures in the both halves of the decade, how might we expect the Slane bypass to progress in the time ahead?</p> <p>  The second road, which is at a different stage of development, is the route from Kilmoon Cross to the Rath roundabout.  I have raised this project previously with the Minister.  Again, it was noted as being worse than usual on the AA Roadwatch this morning, if that is what it is still called.  It is at a very early stage of planning.  How will it be progressed?  What might someone sitting in that traffic this morning expect to see change in the next five years?  To what degree will alternative sustainable transport models and configurations be assessed and, more important, delivered during that time?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-17a.1879" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111700002#Q00400"><p>We are going to continue to invest in roads and there is a significant budget in repair and maintenance of existing roads and new roads.  Without prejudging what TII's perspective on it is, the likes of the Slane bypass, which does meet that NSO objective of supporting compact development and dealing with traffic in the centre of a very historic village, fits in with what the NDP is saying, which is that we prioritise bypasses.  There is an issue with cost.  There is a significant new bridge across the Boyne.  The project is probably in the region of &euro;100 million plus or minus.  One would look at other measures that would allow one to restrict traffic.  This relatively short corridor includes the N1, N2 and N3, all of which are within 30 to 50 km of each other.  It seems to me that the likes of the Slane bypass does meet the strategic objective of compact growth so I look forward to what TII says in that regard.  It has been a long time in planning.</p> <p>  Regarding the route from Kilmoon Cross to the Rath roundabout, I appeared before this committee in the previous D&aacute;il in the early stages of it.  One of the questions I asked was why we were widening all the approach roads to Dublin where we know it is coming to a congestion problem.  What we will have to do in Dublin in terms of BusConnects poses questions for the traffic on the M50, which is already at full capacity.  Where will this traffic go?  I understand people stuck in traffic in the morning on approach roads to the M50 but at a certain point, we must ask why we are widening all the approach roads to Dublin.  Where will the traffic go?  </p></speech>

I framed the question in a very particular way.  I did not ask when the road will be delivered.  I asked what those people could expect in the next five years in terms of progress, including the possibility of sustainable transport models.  I have raised this issue previously.  I am not hearing from the Minister that we have an answer to the question he raised with the previous Minister.</p></speech>

It would serve our constituents whether that is on the N11 or other roads.  There are certain roads where that is very difficult while there are others where it is much more achievable.  That is what I think the solution will be.  It will be to provide that public transport solution on the existing network rather than expanding roads to just steer more traffic to what is an inevitable problem at the M50.</p></speech>

I have a sense that this will sit in planning for a number of years and I do not see those alternative solutions being progressed.  It is a significant concern.  I do not think it aligns well with the Minister's stated intention.  It is a real concern for people who, ultimately, want either not to be in that traffic or to be in more free-flowing traffic.  They are not engineers.  They are not going to provide the solution.  That is for the responsible authorities but I do not see those proposals being forthcoming.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his engagement this afternoon.  Like many others here, I came into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to fight for my county, which is a rural one.  Indeed I care passionately about the western corridor referred to by the Chairman.  I believe if our island was not rooted on deep bedrock, it would be tilting over because of how Dublin has been over-developed over the years.  The population, investment and everything else have gone there.  I have come up here for a few years and hope I will be here for a few terms but I am certainly here for one term to fight for Clare and the west of Ireland.</p> <p>  Some of the dialogue we have had over and back here concerns me.  I do not think there can be any ideological block to projects that need to happen.  A road is basic infrastructure that people in the west of Ireland need.  If we look at the Cork to Limerick motorway, which is intrinsically important to us in Clare because it provides that continuous link, I am sure many members have passed through the village of Banogue.  Twice a day, the main road linking Ireland's second and third cities must be closed off by a family waving red flags so that its herd of dairy cows can cross from one side of the farm to the other.  This is a road linking Ireland's second and third cities.  A dairy herd must cross that main road every day.  It is insane.  If we look beyond Banogue and at the two or three miles coming into it and the two or three miles as you exit it, there are little crosses along the road for people who have lost their lives.  It is insane that there is no motorway linking the two cities.  It needs to happen.  </p> <p>  People have been talking about a motorway up that side of the country.  They have been talking about Limerick northern distributor roads, the western rail corridor and so many projects long before this D&aacute;il term began and this Government was formed 16 months ago or thereabouts.  I really want these projects to be progressed during the Minister's term of office.  Some of them will still be delayed for a few more years because the statutory phases of consultation, design and procurement are long and arduous but we all need to know that there will be life left in these projects and that ideological blocks will not put in the way because that is a concern of mine.  We have heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that projects will move along through statutory phases.  Not everything will be built next year or the year after but, equally, not every village can be served by rail.  I buy into rail.  I came up on the train yesterday and will go home on it tomorrow.  I love rail.  I would love to have rail in every village but it is not feasible.  We need to build roads.  It is what we put on them that will make them sustainable or not.  I need to hear from the Minister that there is life left in these projects.  </p></speech>

Everything must be based on good engineering, science and public policy.  We work collectively in government to deliver that and we can.  One thing we can agree on is the over-development of Dublin.  The vast majority of air travel goes in and out of Dublin Airport.  The vast majority of roll-on, roll-off trucks go in and out of Dublin Port.  All of them then drive down the country with goods and drive back empty.</p><p>All of the places in between suffer from all of that through traffic, including Dublin.  So the current imbalanced form of national development has to change and that is why the national planning framework is our guide.</p></speech>

We are all green and the whole country is becoming green but some baseline infrastructure is still required in Ireland.  The Limerick to Cork motorway is one.  Another project is a half completed road in County Clare.  These projects need to happen and progress.  We need to know that within this term of governance and the term that follows because politics will move on and the Minister may or may not be in his post the following term or in a different Department.

A future Government can change our decisions so there is never any block on anything.  There is a budget constraint and it is very real in the next four years, particularly when it comes to road development.  We have to be upfront and honest in that.  The reason that there is a constraint is because for too long we forgot about public transport, we did not give it priority and we did not build rail in Limerick, we had it sit in front of us as an under-used network and we were shutting services down.  I do believe that it is time to really push that.  It is not blocking anything else but it is opening up.</p></speech>

The amount has been calculated at around 7% of a shift across.  That means the penalty fee then becomes in the region of &euro;14 million versus &euro;200 million.</p></speech>

An enormous number of people rely on the Luas line, which we talked about earlier.</p> <p>  In terms of the eastern bypass that has been removed from the draft strategy, the Minister and I know the area very well.  While I never asked for the eastern bypass to be built I wanted to make sure that the reservation that is there is not immediately removed and promptly built on because that is a corridor that could be used for projects.  One could use it for the UCD to Sandyford DART line up through that reservation.  These are virgin fields and the project would not involve the relocation of a lot of services.  It would also be far easier to build on it than in other places.</p> <p>  In the mid-2000s, there was a proposal to create a blue line in the form of a bus rapid transit corridor.</p><p>That proposal would have linked the Sandyford Luas and business district through the eastern bypass reservation via University College Dublin, UCD, to RT&Eacute; and St. Vincent's Hospital and connecting to the DART.  There is an enormous number of trip generators along that route and I would ask the Minister, who is familiar with that area, to look at that proposal again and see if something could be done on that corridor, even if it was a cycleway initially.  Some of it is private ownership as the Minister knows and some of it is in local authority ownership but that could be used.</p><p> On BusConnects, I am hopeful that it will do what it is supposed to do.  The Stillorgan quiet bus corridor is more than 20 years old.  It is brilliant and it does a good job at a fraction of the cost of the Luas but the Luas is a magnet, as we said, and the more lines we have the better.  We need to incentivise people into cycling more and let them learn that it is a brilliant way of getting around.  On roads, page 64 of the NDP lists 31 projects that were in a previous NDP subject to further approvals.  How many of those may ever be built?  Depending on how much time he has I ask the Minister to deal with the eastern bypass first.</p></speech>

The port tunnel had provided the exit point for freight traffic out of the port and I did not see the strategic benefit of the eastern bypass so I am glad it has been removed from the greater Dublin area transport strategy.  I know the route the Senator is talking about well and it does seem that there are options, either for BusConnects, the blue route bus connection or else for light rail down the line.  There are two options, one running along the N11, which has the advantage of connecting to Stillorgan and Sandyford Business Park.  The other option would be to use those 17 acres of UCD that have been frozen for a potential motorway.  From talking to the president of UCD I gather that UCD is aware of the need to maintain some of that area, either as a greenbelt on the campus or else as a transport route.  The Senator will know well where the route goes from there.  You can go through Knockrabo and private land and then once you are on to the Drummartin Link Road there is the reservation on the side of the road.  It is feasible and achievable to develop that, either as a bus corridor in the short term or as a light rail corridor in the long term.  That is open to consultation.  The greater Dublin area transport strategy is a consultative space, just like the Limerick one.  If the Senator wants to make the case as someone who knows the area he would be well listened to.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each of those two route options.  There is a bit of a hill but other than that it has everything going for it.</p></speech>

There is huge scope there for bus connection.  As we know, UCD is an enormous trip generator with 17,000 or 18,000 students and 5,000 or 6,000 staff.  RT&Eacute; is another big trip generator, as is St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  There is also the question of connecting the DART to the Luas and not half enough of that is available.  There would be huge benefits to that so I urge the Minister to make sure the corridor is protected because once it is built on it can never be gotten back, as the Minister knows.  It happened in Dundrum where apartment blocks were built.  Things cannot be built there because once they are built they are built and once the line is gone it is gone.  I ask the Minister to answer the points on the road projects on page 64 of the NDP.</p></speech>

The budget availability will be constrained for the next few years so a smaller number of projects will be advanced and this is what the debate and discussion on the NDP focused on.  Rather than saying certain projects would be scrapped and certain other projects would be going ahead it was decided that it would be far better to say we would advance projects, subject to budget capabilities and the national planning framework prioritisation.  It is not to say that if a project does not get that further advancement or development it is gone forever and a day.  A lot of work has been done on various projects and that work will still be there and could still be availed of.  In the immediate future we will have to concentrate on a smaller number of projects because of budget limitations and because we have a huge amount of work we need to do on the public transport side.</p></speech>

I wish him well with it.  I ask the Minister to remember the safe routes to schools programme.  The more people we can get cycling at primary and secondary school level and the more people who are getting comfortable with cycling and using that new infrastructure that is being introduced, the better.  If they start cycling and continue cycling they are much more likely to keep it up into adult life.  If they are getting lifts to school the whole time they are much less likely to cycle at a later stage.</p></speech>

For the first time ever as far as I can tell, we had a non-Cork person appointed to the board and as chair of the board in Dr. Michael Walsh.  Let me add that Dr. Walsh was before the Committee on Transport and Communications with us last week, he is a fine person and he is eminently qualified and suitable.  Neither do we have a Cork person on the board of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  I make those comments without promoting any candidate or to seek a clientelist approach.  Given the region that Cork is, no Cork person came through the PAS.  That is wrong,it sends the wrong message and I am curious as to the Minister&rsquo;s view on that in the context of the DAA and the last two appointments to the board of the Port of Cork.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his engagement today.  It was robust at times but it was enlightening and I appreciate the Minister giving his time and effort.  I will work with him to advance the proposals he wants but we will also have that critical engagement.</p></speech>

Professor Mary Horgan&rsquo;s report has come out and it stated that the Department made no request for antigen tests to be considered for aviation travel.  The Minister might give his up-to-date views on that.  We will certainly have a session with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, on aviation.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on antigen testing for air travel?</p></speech>

That is where the correspondence went.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, told us that Professor Mary Horgan&rsquo;s group was set up for individual Departments to go directly to it, not through him.  Has the Department of Transport made a direct approach to Professor Mary Horgan?  If not then the Department needs to make such an approach if it is supportive of antigen testing.  Is this something the Minister would do on the basis that he is telling us he is supportive of antigen testing?  It appears to be somewhere up in the sky sailing around with nothing happening.</p></speech>

I am going from memory on this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is the one responsible, with my support and encouragement.</p></speech>

He said it is up to individual Departments and Ministers to go directly to Professor Mary Horgan&rsquo;s expert group on rapid testing and to ask it to come up with a blueprint for a particular roll-out of antigen testing in that Department.  If it has not been done to date then it needs to be done.  Maybe the Department of Transport would seek clarification from the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

I will go back to Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s questions.  I would agree with him and I have said to the PAS that I would like a representative from Cork on the board of the DAA; that is important.</p><p>Not to be critical of the PAS, which does a very good job, but there was a certain frustration that this had not been possible in the previous appointment.  I am hopeful and confident we will see someone from Cork on the board of the DAA.</p><p> Another question that arises with regard to the Port of Cork also relates to the PAS.  I believe Dr. Walsh has world-class credentials to do a good job there, especially where I see the future of the port going.  He has good Cork connections, but he is not a 100% blue-blood Cork person.  I thought I could overcome that for the moment.  I think he will be a brilliant chair.  I have absolute confidence in him.  I was willing to overcome his county jersey and appoint him because I think he will be a very good chair for the Port of Cork.</p></speech>

Those were his connections.</p></speech>

I get that it falls within the Department.  Even when we have moved from 50% to 100% capacity and buses have been taken off, we have received calls from people who thought they would get concessionary travel and but are not getting it, or half of them are getting it.  It is just a continuation of the general disaster.  The Taoiseach said earlier that climate change needs to be taken into account.  It is not beyond the Government to find a solution to school transport.  I will not give the list of infrastructure projects in order that I can press release for it.</p> <p>  With regard to the planning issue, when representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and others were before the committee, they pointed out issues that relate to major infrastructure projects and the difficulties they encounter.  I accept that the Attorney General review is ongoing and that the legislation will not fall in the Minister's Department.  What is the interaction between the Department and that review process?  I will throw into the mix what the Minister said when he spoke about the national development plan.  I was wondering whether it was almost a magic algorithm.  It was almost a question of survival of the fittest from a planning point of view.  To take a tiny piece of it, the Minister spoke earlier about the ten-year project for roads.  We have &euro;1 billion for the first five years and then the second tranche is &euro;5.1 billion.  The business end is at tail end of the decade, but the problem is that is also the business end from the point of view of carbon budgets, etc.  There are inbuilt difficulties.  I ask the Minister to talk about the interaction between his Department, the Attorney General review process and the legislation that will eventually come through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

We are being updated on a regular basis by the Attorney General on what he is doing.  His timeline is incredibly tight.  He is hoping to do it within the next year and it is a major overhaul of our whole planning system.  It is coming from the environmental planning lawyers and others.  In the current system, the 2001 Act has been added to in so many instances that it is often hard to understand the legislation, let alone know how to apply it.</p></speech>

We did huge work on antigen testing.  I ask the Minister to follow up and get clarity on a body of work being done on antigen testing for air travel.

Will the Minister follow up on that?  There may be a degree of misunderstanding about something that could be hugely beneficial.</p></speech>
