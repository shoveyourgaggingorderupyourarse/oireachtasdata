On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the Irish Green Building Council Mr. Pat Barry, its chief executive officer, and Ms Marion Jammet.  We also have with us Dr. Oliver Kinnane, assistant professor at the school of architecture, planning and environmental policy in University College Dublin, UCD.  Dr. Josephina Lindblom of the European Commission's DG Environment is joining us online.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege.</p><p>Guests are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice whereby they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For guests attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask any member joining us online to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I invite Mr. Barry to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#C00200"><p>The Irish Green Building Council is working in co-operation with the industry and key stakeholders to develop a roadmap to decarbonise Ireland&rsquo;s built environment.  For the first time, we have tried to capture the total environmental impact of construction and the built environment across its whole life cycle.  This work, done in close co-operation with University College Dublin, UCD, shows that emissions associated with construction and the built environment add up to 37% of our national CO emissions.  This comprises 23% operational emissions associated with the energy we use to heat, cool and light our buildings, while a further 14% of the emissions are embodied carbon emissions from the production of construction materials, the transport of materials, the construction process and the maintenance, repair and disposal of buildings and infrastructure.</p> <p>  The introduction of the nearly zero energy building standard for new build and the new national retrofit scheme will lead to reductions in the CO emissions due to the operation of buildings, but the regulations need to be strengthened.  While we welcome the certainty provided by the new national retrofit scheme, retrofits must be made easier and more affordable.  Homeowners do not know what to do or where to start and need fully independent energy renovation advisers to support them on their journey and the first step is to develop a building renovation passport to plan a high-quality staged retrofit.  If the information within these passports is captured centrally, they could also support project aggregation and materials aggregation, hence reducing costs.</p> <p>  Under our current building regulations, there is no requirement for the measurement of carbon emissions in construction beyond that associated with operational energy.  The ambitious construction and renovation programmes for housing and infrastructure to cater for an expanding population over the coming 20 years could lead to significant carbon emissions if embodied carbon is not taken into account.  There is a risk we will blow the construction and built environment carbon budget if we do not address embodied carbon emissions.  The impact of all new buildings and infrastructure should be measured immediately at a project level within public procurement.  The public spending code should be updated to ensure carbon is fully accounted for in construction and infrastructure spending plans.</p> <p>  To provide certainty to the industry, a clear timeline should be published on the introduction of regulations on embodied carbon.  This should start with the requirement to measure and disclose before 2025.  The data gathered through disclosure should then allow for the setting of project-specific carbon limits by 2027.  This will improve the knowledge of the industry, stimulate action for carbon reduction and spark innovation in products and services.</p> <p>  Several concerted actions are needed to reduce the embodied carbon emissions associated with the built environment.  First, we must value existing buildings and avoid throwing away the embodied carbon and resources within them by discouraging demolition through the planning system.</p><p>We must reuse existing buildings and bring as much vacant property back into use as possible in order to minimise the need for new construction.  For new buildings, we must encourage better design and more efficient use of materials.  Addressing embodied carbon emissions can address construction cost by saving on wasted or excessive material use.</p><p> Materials used in construction must be low impact.  This means encouraging the use of reused and recycled materials to transition to circular construction.  Government has a role to play in removing the barriers to reuse of materials.  Ireland&rsquo;s climate is ideally suited and has great potential to provide bio-based construction materials, from timber to rapidly renewable fibres such as hemp.  Bio-based materials require lower CO2 emissions to produce and they also sequester carbon.  Only 24% of newly constructed homes in Ireland are timber frame compared with 75% in Scotland.  We need to support new local forestry and agriculture related industries to supply the construction sector.  Forestry licensing must be reformed to increase levels of planting.  Building regulations need to facilitate the use of low-carbon technologies and products, enabling the use of timber at scale without compromising safety or quality.  Existing construction industries such as concrete and cement must be decarbonised.</p><p> We would like to highlight once again that addressing whole-life carbon emissions in the built environment is critical to achieving our 2030 targets.  Embodied carbon is a major gap in carbon policy in Ireland and therefore we need to start from today to measure and reduce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Oliver Kinnane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to present.  The building in a climate emergency research group at UCD is undertaking a comprehensive modelling study of the Irish built environment and construction sector, baselining current activity and projecting emissions out to 2030 and 2050.  The evidence I give today is primarily derived from that research and from projects funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the European Commission, all focused on achieving a more sustainable built environment.</p> <p>  Through our modelling work we have shown that the construction and operation of the Irish built environment accounts for 23 megatonnes of CO2 emissions annually, a 37% share of all emissions.  This is split two to one between the operation and construction of the built environment.  The built environment is growing.  Considerable construction across all sectors is planned from now to 2030.  This growth in our built environment will bring significant additional operational and embodied emissions in the short time horizon to 2030.  Our model highlights the challenge to reduce operational emissions by 51%.  The only scenario where we achieve this reduction in operational carbon by 2030 is one where: the national retrofit plan is implemented in its entirety; renewable energy rises to 80%; and significant changes in user behaviour to further increase the efficiency of buildings in use occur.  Improvement in embodied emissions, although not bound by the same targets, will be even more difficult.  We baseline today&rsquo;s emissions at approximately 9 megatonnes of CO2, and if construction grows as outlined in the national development plan, NDP, with no change in the carbon intensity of construction, our model shows embodied emissions rising to over twice that total by 2030.</p> <p>  It is essential that we enhance the performance of the current building stock.  Retrofit of 500,000 homes to a B2 standard or better can reduce emissions by 2 megatonnes of CO2 by 2030 if aligned with significant improvement in the carbon intensity of the electricity supply.  Current retrofit rates are well below the levels required, however.  Among other barriers, necessary knowledge and skills are lacking across the design and construction industry.  Through projects we have undertaken for the SEAI we have identified a performance gap between house retrofits to a nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard and actual performance.  In some cases, A-rated homes are performing at C levels.  Approximately 50% of fabrics are not meeting design U-values and heat pumps are underperforming, often due to improper installation.  It is important we get retrofit right to avoid retrofitting the retrofit in ten years' time.</p> <p>  Embodied emissions in construction will grow to 2030 as construction grows.</p><p>It is not regulated and measurement is currently not mandated, even though these emissions represent 14% of our national emissions.  Concrete represents more than 90% of our building material-related national production emissions.  Innovations in the cement industry can reduce this considerably.  Savings of up to 50%, or more, are possible.  We estimate that a low-clinker, low-carbon concrete could cut 15% to 20% off the annual embodied carbon cost of our own national development.  Bio-based materials are a solution but uptake is low and skills and production facilities are lacking.  No processing facility exists for hemp, for example, and building regulations restrict their potential use.</p><p> We have some of the highest rates of vacancy in Europe.  Our model shows that retrofitting 100,000 of our vacant homes could slice 1 MtCO2e off an embodied carbon bill of 4 to 5 MtCO2e for the 400,000 new homes proposed in the national development plan.  We are constructing many new buildings but we are also demolishing buildings to make way for replacement buildings.  Young buildings, built only 30 to 40 years ago, are being torn down all over the city to be replaced by buildings of much greater floor area and materials of high embodied carbon.  The service life of buildings is constantly decreasing.  This is unsustainable.  We need to save the buildings we have and retrofit first.</p><p> On recycling and reuse of materials, we need to circularise our construction economy.  Construction and demolition waste is thought to be the fastest-growing waste stream in the country and up to 10 megatonnes annually is expected in the coming years.  This needs to be repurposed.  We need to get creative with our waste reuse.  As an example, our research group is doing a project with industry to replace up to 20% of cement in concrete with ground glass from recycled glass bottle waste.</p><p> We can achieve our ambitious targets but much work is required.  A whole-life carbon perspective of the built environment is necessary.  We can achieve considerable emission savings through retrofit but embodied emissions are growing and need to be measured, regulated and reduced.  Higher education will play an important role.  Research funding is critical to allow us to work alongside industry.  We need to adapt curricula to respond to the knowledge and skills shortage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Josephina Lindblom" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#E00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I work at the European Commission's Directorate General for the Environment, in a unit relating to circularity and sustainable production and consumption.  Circularity and life cycle thinking are very important in the building sector.  If we consider the full life cycle of buildings in the EU, this sector is responsible for about half of all our extracted materials and half our total energy consumption.  A third of our total generated waste is construction and demolition waste.  Up to now, the focus of the EU, as well as national building policies, has been on energy performance during the use phase of the building, that is, the energy used for heating and cooling buildings.  In order to actually decarbonise the building stock, one must look at the full life cycle and minimise the so-called whole-life carbon that we have heard of.  This means we should also consider what happens before and after we use our buildings.  We must ask ourselves this question: what if, in order to make our buildings more energy-efficient, we use a lot of materials in an inefficient way?  That comes with its own carbon cost.  What if that so-called embodied carbon is of such quantity that you will have to use the building in a very energy-efficient way for 20, 30 or even 40 years before that initial carbon cost is paid off?  What if we are renovating our existing buildings to become more energy-efficient in such a way that, at the end of the life of those buildings, the insulation cannot be separated from the concrete so all the material ends up in landfill as opposed to being recycled?</p><p>This is largely the current situation.  We therefore need modern policy that acknowledges and makes use of circularity and life cycle thinking to reach our climate targets.  This will help us to do so in a much more cost efficient way.  The European Commission has developed a common language to assess and report on the sustainability performance of buildings.  We call this framework Level(s).  It includes whole-life carbon and indicators which help a beginner to get on track to assess broader carbon emissions.  In the past year, we started to use Level(s) as a basis for circularity and life cycle thinking in a range of policy initiatives and legislative proposals.</p><p> The energy performance of buildings directive is the key building performance legislation in the EU.  The proposal for its revision includes the requirement to assess and report on whole life carbon for new buildings.  It takes life cycle thinking into account, while setting out legislation for a decarbonised building stock.  Being a directive, which is under negotiation, it sets minimum requirements but it gives freedom to member states to have a higher level of ambition in their own legislation.  Several EU member states are moving ahead in this area.  They understand that this is the most cost-efficient way of decreasing carbon emissions.  They refer to whole-life carbon in national legislation and make reporting on it part of their permissions process.  Some also set limits as well as requiring reporting.  They set out a process of how to tighten these for the future.</p><p> I stress that this is considered to be very positive by the European Commission.  Linked to the energy performance of buildings directive and the requirement to report on whole-life carbon performance of buildings, I also note it will be mandatory to report the relevant data about the carbon performance of the construction products, that is, the material used for the building under the revised construction products regulation, which was adopted by the Commission a few weeks ago.  We are doing it at both the building and product levels, so we are all moving in the same direction.</p><p> I want to comment on sustainable finance and its taxonomy, which is important in this regard.  This initiative targets private investments and sets out criteria that need to be fulfilled to define the investment as sustainable.  There is a requirement to assess and report on whole life carbon for new buildings to be considered as a sustainable investment.  In all these policy initiatives, the indicators in the Level(s) framework are used as a basis to bring in whole-life carbon.  This framework allows governments to have a structured way to introduce requirements in their own legislation.  I mentioned that other member states are moving ahead and are doing so while basing themselves on the Level(s) framework.  The Commission looks at this as a highly positive development.  I strongly encourage the committee to consider this in its work.</p></speech>

There were some very interesting points.  We will go to questions and answers.  We are limited to three hours for this meeting.  I propose that members take two minutes to ask their questions and we will give latitude to our guests to answer them, taking as much time as they need, within reason.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I ask members to raise their hands to indicate they wish to speak.  Some have already done so.</p> <p>  I was heartened to hear Dr. Lindblom speak about the energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD.  The original EPBD drove much of the change we have already seen in this country.  The new EPBD sounds as though it will take us further in the right direction.  I wonder about the timeline in that regard and about other member states.</p><p>It sounds like some member states are well ahead of us.  Perhaps Mr. Barry, Ms Jammet or Dr. Kinnane will speak about the Irish context.  What can Ireland do in the near term to get up to speed with the general direction of the energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD?  I am aware of a project in Limerick that I think utterly farcical.  It is proposed to knock a public building and move all the staff into a brand new shiny building across the road.  It makes absolutely no sense that we are not renovating the existing building because if we did so, we would not need to build the expensive, shiny building across the road.  This kind of thing is going on in Ireland.  It seems from our guests' opening statements that we are way behind with respect to valuing embodied emissions.  This committee has done a lot of work on climate-related legislation in the past two years but has not looked at embodied emissions and instead focused on the operational side.  It seems that if we did not do anything, we could theoretically meet our carbon reduction goals while still having very significant levels of embodied emissions associated with the built environment sector in Ireland.  Perhaps our guests would speak about where Ireland is at in that regard and to where we need to get.  I know our guests touched on many of the relevant points in their detailed opening statements.  How quickly can we implement important reform in this area?</p></speech>

Every publicly procured project should require disclosure of embodied carbon.</p> <p>  We should start to ask for carbon to be considered as part of the planning process.  We recently released a free carbon assessment tool with the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  It allows early, initial analysis to be done on every building.  It is a free tool and allows quick and easy carbon assessment that can even be done at the pre-planning stage.  The client can work out an essential carbon budget for the building.  We can start to ask for this information at planning stage and the Planning Regulator could set out guidance for planning authorities in how they look for information on planning.  That could be a light touch and could be done immediately within development plans.</p></speech>

However, that needs to be assessed through planning.</p></speech>

The London development plan now requires embodied carbon calculations.  Circularity statements are required for larger buildings at concept stage.  One of the challenges was having the data on products and materials but we have started to build that out now.  Many Irish construction manufacturers are now producing the data on environmental product declarations, EPDs.  We have run a successful programme on developing EPDs.</p><p>The Irish Green Building Council is developing a database on generic data.  We have the data now.  We have the tools.  We have trained up professionals in how to do it so now all we really have to do is define it.  We have the levels methodology so we know exactly how we have to implement it.  It is now only a question of asking for it and requiring it.</p></speech>

I must pass the congratulations on to my research team, Mr. Richard O'Hegarty and Mr. Stephen Wall, who have worked very hard on the report and the model.</p> <p>  I totally agree with what Mr. Barry said.  We are on a very worrying trajectory at present.  We see it all over the city.  To take an example of a local site, the old Passport Office building across the road was built in the 1980s and demolished only 30 years later.  That building succeeded one built 50 years previously.  We are getting this cycle of construction and demolition with shorter service life that could be down to 20 or 30 years in future.  We just cannot afford to do that.  There is no way we can.  The embodied carbon of these buildings is significant.  We are talking about a tonne of CO2 per metre squared of built floor area and these floor areas are getting bigger all the time.  That is the other thing.  If we look at the AIB site in Ballsbridge or anything like that, those buildings are increasing by multiples of up to four times the size of the original building.  We need to assess whether that is necessary.  To my mind, we need to legislate to stop unnecessary construction.</p> <p>  Certainly, the first step needs to be that we measure the embodied carbon of these kind of constructions.  We also need to start measuring the sunk carbon.  If a building exists on-site, how much carbon exists there?  That should be accounted for in a carbon budget for development.  Maybe that should be legislated for.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It shows the merit of taking a circular approach as opposed to just looking at the production-based inventory we have in carbon budgeting.</p> <p>  One thing that strikes me is that the representatives are very heavily focused on regulation, with demolition statements, embodied carbon statements, circularity statements and log books.  That is necessary and will come, but I also hear from them that the industry does not have the skills to do that.  Where is the low-hanging fruit?  For example, it was stated that 24% of newly constructed homes here are timber versus 75% in Scotland.  Can we achieve a shift there, through the professions and the typical designs that are used?  Can we make an early shift?  Some 90% of construction demolition waste is not reused.  Only 10% has any recovery.  Can we make early changes there so we get early wins while these larger regulatory changes are being made?</p> <p>  It would be interesting to hear from our EU colleague about where these regulatory changes are being pushed through.  I am sure Ms Lindblom has had to carry out regulatory impact assessments.  What is their likely impact on cost?  In the long term, it will obviously make it cheaper to run these buildings over their life cycle but we face a housing crisis in the short term.  Will we face short-term rises in costs in completion that forces first-time buyers?</p> <p>  Have the representatives spoken to the SEAI, which is about to launch an &euro;8 billion retrofit programme, in order to make sure that some of these principles will be built in at the outset?  We will have 20 big aggregators for retrofitting.  It seems possible they could embrace some of the suggestions.</p></speech>

Part of getting the early wins is the fact that industry is very good at stepping up to the mark when it is asked to do something.  Once it is asked to do something, or once a signal is given that we are going to move towards regulation, it is quite quick to respond.  There are early wins such as trying to move more construction towards a timber-based or bio-based approach but there are some regulatory barriers that we need to get over, particularly around the use of timber construction over 10 m, which is very difficult to do in Ireland.  Some guidance on low-density timber-frame homes has been introduced that has made it a little more difficult there as well.  For example, there is the issue of agr&eacute;ment certificates, which the SEAI requires for insulation grants.  Unless you have an Irish agr&eacute;ment, it can be difficult to use some of the bio-based insulations we currently import.  Perhaps we should be looking at developing those ourselves.  There are some barriers we could quite quickly remove and that would incentivise a move towards lower embodied carbon materials.  One of the big impacts of heat pumps over their life cycle is the refrigerants used in them.  Some of the refrigerants have very high global warming potential.  We could move towards incentivising heat pumps with a much lower global warming potential.  It is possible to get refrigerants with a global warming potential of one, whereas some of the typical ones could be 600 times that.  Over the lifetime of a heat pump, that will have a very large impact.  That could be addressed quite quickly by the SEAI.</p></speech>

The leakage of F-gases from heat pumps could be a big issue going forward.  The embodied carbon of a heat pump is already quite significant at about 4 megatonnes so we need to limit that through its lifetime.  We also need to make timber construction easier.  The restrictions at the moment are very limiting to timber construction, particularly as we go to mid-rise or high-rise construction.  These technologies are well-proven by our near neighbours.  The UK is doing an awful lot of timber construction at the moment and we are lagging behind on that.  We need greater investment in facilities for bio-based materials in the country.  I was talking to somebody from Hemp Federation Ireland last week and they said there is good uptake and growth of hemp, which is a well-proven material used across the Continent, but there is no national processing facility here so it has to be exported and imported back in.  If we are going to use hemp as insulation, or hempcrete as a material in our home industry, we are talking about transformation across the industry.  The waste situation is worrying and unsustainable.  We are reducing the number of landfills, yet we are specifying that nearly all our construction waste needs to go to landfill.  That is going to increase quite a lot with the increase in construction.</p></speech>

Are there easy changes to be made to prevent so much of our construction waste going to landfill?</p></speech>

One of the problems at the moment is the way we have implemented the European waste framework directive, particularly around the definition of waste.  Articles 27 and 28 of the directive set out criteria for when waste is waste and when it is the byproduct coming out of a building.</p><p>Under how we have applied the regulations, virtually everything that comes out of a site becomes waste unless it is reused on the site or the contractor applies to the EPA to have it considered a by-product.  In many cases, we are taking perfectly good soil and stone from sites and, in order for that to be reused on another site down the road, it has to go through a licensing process to be categorised as a by-product.  Other countries are not applying the regulations the way we are.  In the Netherlands, contractors are able to reuse these materials as they are.  If there are excess materials on a site in Ireland, though, they can be considered waste and end up being backfilled simply because of how we have applied our waste definitions.  Under the European directive, we are allowed to define waste classes as by-products.  This could be a simple and easy win.</p></speech>

I do not know the Irish situation in particular, but when I hear about building projects or national experiences where people are going ahead with this kind of thinking, they are not necessarily pointing to one or two low-hanging fruits specifically.  Rather, they are saying that, if they are pushed to assess and report on whole-life carbon, they become aware of what it is and start to compare different design options, and when they do so, they realise that, without making enormous differences in what they have planned, they can impact whole-life carbon significantly.  They also say that, if they had not needed to assess and report on it, they would not even have thought about it.  It is not the case that someone can take a single large action and solve 20% of the problem.  Rather, if someone is aware of small actions and learns how to work with and assess them, he or she can save 10% to 20% - that is what I typically hear &ndash; just by being aware that what he or she is doing has an impact on whole-life carbon.</p> <p>  Member states that are proceeding with this have realised that, if they want to save a total amount of carbon, it is much more efficient to look at the embodied carbon as well, that is, the part of the whole-life carbon that is linked to the materials and so on.  If they do not do that and instead try to save the same amount of carbon just by making their buildings very energy efficient, it would be extremely difficult and costly.  Looking at the whole picture is a much more cost-efficient way of saving the same amount of carbon.</p> <p>  Those who are working on saving carbon in a more targeted way say that saving carbon saves on cost.  Embodied carbon is, in a sense, material and if someone can save material, he or she saves costs.</p></speech>

I might add to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s question on the timeline of the directive.  Perhaps Dr. Lindblom can point to countries that are getting ahead of the directive and we should be looking to emulate.</p></speech>

The Commission's proposals on the revised energy performance of buildings directive set out that, by 2027, new buildings that are larger than 2,000 sq. m would need to be assessed and reported on and, by 2030, all buildings would need to be.  There are member states that view this as being far too late and others that are not used to thinking in this way.  The member states that are most advanced are France, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries.  The Nordic countries are doing this together because they have an internal market, as it were, so they are ensuring that what they are doing is compatible across their borders.  They already have suggestions on targets, limit values and how to squeeze those in future.</p><p>In the case of limit values, Denmark is the country that is most ahead.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations today.  They were incredibly interesting, but also very worrying, because this seems to be a real blind spot for us as a country.  It does not seem like we have actually even thought about this as an issue.</p> <p>  Dr. Kinnane spoke about the modelling of what the embodied carbon is for the current housing and building stock.  Has there been modelling done taking into account the proposals under the Housing for All plan?  What will it actually mean for that?  If we are looking at the embodied emissions, it seems to be, I believe, 14%.  Am I correct in thinking that could be nearly 30% by the time the Government gets the Housing for All plan fully implemented?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  My second question is on the point in Dr. Kinnane&rsquo;s briefing note where he said there has been work done for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in relation to the performance gap between houses retrofit to near zero energy building, nZEB, and the actual performance.  There seems to be quite a discrepancy between what the expectation was and what the reality is.  What are the reasons for that?  Why is there such a gap?  It seems that 50% of fabrics are not meeting their actual design values.  I am just wondering what the gaps are.  Why has this happened?  Has the SEAI taken those learnings and applied them to the current retrofitting plan?  If the Government will be putting something like &euro;8 billion into retrofitting and we have a very limited timeframe in which to get this done, it is incredibly important that we do it correctly and we get the emissions saving value from the money and investment that we are making.  Those are my two questions.</p></speech>

They would also be very familiar with the conditions being placed on the one-stop shop entities and whether or not those specific conditions reflect the underperformance and what has happened previously with the retrofitting that has been installed and implemented.</p></speech>

If we were to move to a less carbon-intensive model and move from predominantly masonry construction to, say, timber construction, we could reduce that bill quite considerably.  However, it is a lot of construction and it will come with a high embodied carbon bill.</p></speech>

We could see that increase to more than 20% to 25%.  I do not think it would reach 40%.  A doubling of it is what we would project.  I would have to go back to our models and have a look exactly at figures, and we can produce those.  It could be up to 20% to 25%.  There is an awful lot of construction outlined in the national development plan and we have tried to model that.  It could push us to multiples of our target values, although the embodied carbon is not tied to the -51% reduction, necessarily.  However, from a national carbon perspective, the answer is "yes".</p></speech>

That is at different levels of resolution.  The data for residential from the SEAI is very good and well maintained but there is far less data available for non-residential and commercial buildings, and even less for infrastructure.  We have a number of different methods where we try to calculate the embodied carbon across the built environment by looking at import and export of materials.  We produce a good deal of concrete and cement here and we export much of that.  We import a good deal of metals and other materials.  We can work it out based on those values.</p></speech>

We make all these findings available to the SEAI.  This is research funded by the SEAI which is keen to learn from the projects it has funded.  This is only happening in certain cases where we are seeing a performance gap.  We have a project with the SEAI, the nZeb101 project, where we are trying to monitor a large cohort of near zero-energy buildings.  Many of them are performing at very high B level or at A level, but some in certain cases are performing at a C level for which there are a number of reasons.  One is a comfort-taking issue where people in retrofit homes are often living in warmer temperatures because they can.  These homes retain the heat better but at the same time the energy bills might be increasing.  We also see installation issues, such as mis-sizing of heat pumps.  We have another project with the SEAI, the MacAirH project, where we are trying to evaluate heat pumps in operation.  We see many issues with them, such as poor installation, lack of insulation of piping, long pipe-runs and heat loss through the mismatching of heat pumps with emitter sizes.  We see the performance of heat pumps rated by manufacturers at 3.5 all the way up to 4.5 commonly operating at about 2.5 and slightly below that.  These are research findings backed up by much bigger studies done in the UK with larger sample sizes and greater research funding.  There are a number of reasons.</p> <p>  When we looked at the fabric, we were surprised by the results of the fabric analysis.  On-site installation issues and certain design issues seem to be a problem.  It is hard for us to do opening-up works post-construction so commonly we rely on thermal imaging and try to decipher from that, or heat flux monitoring.  Often it is thermal bridging due to bridged elements in the wall or thermal bypassing where there is convective movement in behind the insulation.  These are design and construction issues.</p></speech>

Certainly, as I said in my statement, across all educational levels we need to make a massive transformation and start supplying people with the correct skills.  There have been many good interventions.  The nZeb centres of excellence have been a great addition.  Incentivisation of the construction industry to join those training courses can make it aware of these kinds of installation issues.  I did one before Christmas and I learned a good deal and it was well worth the trip.  Training is a huge part of it.  Certainly in higher education, we need to do a great deal as well, and through HEI investment that we have got we plan to do much reform of curricula across all the architecture schools around the country to try to train architects in designing for retrofit and designing for energy efficiency as a priority.</p></speech>

We would be concerned if the one-stop shops were largely contractor-led and there was no independent advice being given to the homeowners.</p><p>Before any work begins, it is critical that somebody independent comes in to evaluate the property.  Ideally, we would like to see a building renovation passport developed for each home.  Not everybody is able to do a full retrofit in one go.  They may be able to afford a couple of measures, but those measures all have to link together.  The building renovation passport is about setting out a long-term strategy for the home.  It is important that the measures applied to the home are suitable.  For example, in a heritage property or traditionally-built home, there may be issues with dampness or structural defects, which all have to be evaluated before any renovation can begin.  Renovations may have to be delayed by six months to a year if there have been issues with rainwater goods that have been leaking.  The fabric needs to dry out.  A particular type of insulation may be required.  If we allow contractors to lead on it, we may end up with inappropriate solutions.  It really emphasises the importance of independent evaluation.</p></speech>

The last point about the performance gap would concern people.  Dr. Kinnane pointed to some possible reasons.  The European Court of Auditors indicated similar issues, which are concerning.  The SEAI was here a couple of weeks ago.  I specifically asked about longitudinal information before and after an assessment.  It stated it is looking at that with pilot studies.  It did not say there was a systematic response or a system to be put in place that would be comprehensive enough to catch the weaknesses.  What metrics does Dr. Kinnane think would be appropriate to address those performance gap issues?  He has limitations with regard to access.  If he was developing a system, what would be necessary from a technical and a training perspective?  What longitudinal requirements are there to ensure that householders are sufficiently <i>au fait </i>with the new technology and how to get the best performance from it?  Mr. Barry might also refer to that.</p><p>The revised energy performance of buildings directive proposals introduce minimum energy performance standards, MEPS, across the entire residential sector by 2030.  What framework does Mr. Barry think need to be put in place to ensure that can happen and to support it?</p></speech>

The research community for energy in buildings has been calling for this for decades.  There is a gap with the delivery of the product.  We design buildings to a certain standard, but nobody ever really checks if they operate like that.  It has been shown through academic study for many decades that these low energy buildings often do not operate as they should.  In the long term, we hope to monitor heat and electrical usage in buildings to understand how well they are performing.  Maybe somebody will take responsibility for post-occupancy performance of the building.</p></speech>

There is almost space for another profession in between architecture and construction, for somebody who monitors the end product.  The SEAI might take it on or an offshoot of the SEAI, together with academia.  The data certainly are of much interest to us in the research community.  The actual technology to do it is available.  We do it, for example with the nZeb101 project that we are doing, where we go in and put CT clamps - I cannot remember what the acronym stands for - on the electricity supply and depending on how the board is broken up, we can monitor electrical supply to different elements.  That becomes even easier in the case of heat pumps.  With gas fired boilers it is more difficult to get flow meters that are reliable and calibrated to monitor gas supply.  We can take some readings from billing information.  There are a lot of data out there, although getting a handle on it is difficult.  New heat pump technology monitors much of the energy usage of the heat pump and can be downloaded.  Making that available in the long term is something I would like to see.  Maybe it starts in non-residential buildings and then moves on to residential buildings but I think it is achievable.</p> <p>  On the point of occupants and new technologies, it is going to be a big issue in the coming years as we introduce new heating technologies into the system.  We do many occupant surveys of buildings we monitor.  There is a lack of knowledge of the operating of heat pump systems, where the output temperatures are much lower than in an oil-fired boiler radiator system.  Occupants are expecting the same high temperature touch to the radiator and when they do not get it, they might turn up the system and then throw everything off balance.  There is certainly room for much occupant education as well at different levels.  That needs to be done.  </p></speech>

What we do not want to happen is say, a landlord who is about to put a property on the market and who needs to hit a certain performance level throws in a couple of measures just to get him to the minimum performance.  What really needs to happen is there needs to be something like a digital passport, a building renovation passport, that first sets out where the building needs to get to in order that measures are not carried out just to achieve a particular benchmark and that all of the information on the measures that are carried out are recorded in some form of digital logbook.  Therefore the next owner of that property, if the landlord passes the property on, the next owner has access to exactly what has happened.  They will know what Register of Electrical Contractors Ireland, RECI, certificates were issued as to what electrical work has been carried out.  They will know exactly the type of heat pump that has been installed and exactly what is in the walls.  Because that work is covered up, you do not know if you are buying a property, what is in the walls.  We need to introduce a similar approach to conveyancing that includes all of this information in order that every time the property passes on to the next owner, they can build upon that work and can rely on that work and the information is reliable enough that they know the next measure will get them to a B1 and it fits; they do not have to undo the previous work that was done.  For example, the obvious thing a landlord would do is put in a condensing gas boiler.  That will get him or her up two notches in the building energy rating, BER, straight away but that is obviously not the best thing to do because we want to decarbonise them.  We have to have a long-term strategy that can be built on step by step.</p></speech>

As part of the building energy rating, BER, it already has an upload platform for BER assessors to upload documents to show compliance with the energy performance certificate, EPC.  There is already an audit trail so it is about making all that information available to the homeowner digitally.  It probably rests with the authority.</p></speech>

A condensing boiler may be installed to bring a house up to a particular BER level, but that might not be the correct decision for someone who may want to go the whole way eventually.  Where are we at in respect of regulation to phase out fossil fuel boilers?  There is something in the climate action plan about it, if I am not mistaken.  There might be an end date.  The representatives are probably much more familiar with that element of it than I am, but it is obviously something that needs to happen as soon as possible to meet the net-zero and 2030 targets.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting discussion.  Some of the key points I am taking from it as regards ongoing evaluation of nearly zero energy building standard, NZEB, or retrofitted buildings is crucial for so many different reasons, some of which have been covered.  Given our poor record regarding buildings being delivered to the standard set out in regulation, and the lack of monitoring of the construction of houses over a lengthy period, in addition to self-regulation and the deficiencies that has presented us with, the concept of a renovation passport or carbon statement for NZEB buildings is key.  There is a consumer effect to the provision of such a certificate or passport because it will make a property more desirable since it will have lower energy consumption and improved carbon credentials, particularly when it comes to such a property changing hands.</p> <p>  I will go back to another element of this discussion, namely, that of quality control.  Is that solely with the SEAI or is there a sectoral responsibility, outside any consumer responsibility, for it to actually deliver properties that pass these checks?  It occurs to me that the BER assessments operate on assumption, in my experience.  Perhaps this is a question for Mr. Barry.  They assume the regulatory standards have been met, there are certain levels of insulation here and there, and there are seals here and there, whereas much of the time those are not present and that is a problem.  I have come across it.  I bought a home containing pyrite in 2005.  I bought another home in 2018 that, when I stripped back plasterboard, had very clearly not been delivered to standard.  I have a concern regarding the continuation of self-regulation in the building sector.</p><p> My final point might not be one in respect of which Mr. Barry can provide an answer directly but he may have a view on it.  It concerns the capacity of, for example, the timber sector to step up and deliver on the move away from concrete as the primary product.  Mr. Barry mentioned that 90% of properties are built using concrete.  That feeds into the other elements mentioned in the opening statements in respect of the likes of hemp and other means of providing natural insulation within properties.  There are a lot of points there but maybe a few remarks could be made on my observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#Q00200"><p>We do need to move towards a culture, particularly in renovation, where there is more oversight.  Putting it all back to the SEAI would be quite an ask.  It is probably something that needs to be dealt with in the context of building control rather than the SEAI.  Because we will be doing so much more renovation, we need to develop more of a culture of supervision of that renovation among the professionals and within building control.  On the question around self-regulation, we need to strengthen building control.  I do not think they have sufficient resources yet.  We need to strengthen building control in order that they can carry out more inspections.</p> <p>  On the capacity of the timber sector, there is great capacity because the private forests planted in the 1980s and 1990s are all now coming to maturity.  Most of that timber is being exported and used in the UK.  In terms of the actual timber, while we have the capacity now, for the next 20 or 30 years, there is an issue with replanting in order to continue its sustainability into the future.  We definitely have the timber.  We have a lot of timber frame companies that can deliver.  Many of them are exporting as well.  There are some very good companies.  We definitely have the capacity there.  We can build more capacity if we can increase the demand in Ireland.  The first step is to get more timber used in low-rise development and then we need to move towards engineered timbers and cross-laminated timber.  We have the capacity to produce that not only for Ireland but also for export across Europe.</p> <p>  In terms of hemp, this is another opportunity.  Hemp is rapidly renewable.  We are having difficulties in getting farmers to plant timber because the land is taken up for 30 years.  It may be easier to persuade them and they are interested in planting hemp.  That is something that we could potentially do more quickly by setting up production facilities.</p></speech>

They are starting to look at changing that energy audit into a whole-life carbon audit.  This could of course also be done in respect of renovations, checking the performance at the end of the work.  I would also like to stress that across the EU, it is rare that architectural studies include life cycle thinking.  I want to flag that to the committee.  One can easily become an architect anywhere in Europe without knowing about circularity or life cycle thinking.</p><p>They can be small courses, which can be added to the programme by choice, but it is not part of the core education.  That could also be something to think about.  </p></speech>

Perhaps I will use the opportunity to make a plea to some extent for research in the field.  We talk like we know buildings well but really, our knowledge of buildings is very poor.  We are making a huge intervention here with the national retrofit programme without knowing exactly how certain building typologies actually perform.  I think Deputy Alan Farrell mentioned historic properties.  One property in six in this country is traditionally built and those properties will operate very differently to a modern-day construction.  How we retrofit them and the materials that we use to do so are very different.  That has to be understood by designers and people who install them.  There is always the likelihood that we will make the wrong decisions unless we increase our knowledge base.  As Dr. Lindblom has said, we are trying to increase the focus, within architecture and engineering schools in UCD and around the country, on circulatory life cycle thinking.  There is also space for designers and installers to upskill in the understanding of materials and how buildings perform, particularly in our damp climate, where many of our traditionally-built buildings contain a lot of moisture.  How we deal with that is key.</p></speech>

It occurs to me, from listening to this conversation today, that the BER as it currently stands would really benefit from a revamp and a refocus.  The idea of a carbon statement for a property, whether it is commercial or residential, would be really beneficial to the sector, because it would re-evaluate what it is we are trying to achieve.  I am not convinced, nor have I ever been convinced, that the BER was effective in what it was trying to achieve.  I think that the call for additional research or a requirement to have a statement brought about for buildings across the country or both, would be very beneficial.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.</p></speech>

Quite often, the production and use of hemp has certain connotations, perhaps because the plant itself looks like marijuana.  Perhaps that is where those associations come from.  The Chair will be glad to know I am going to mention west Cork again.  There are two fantastic students from Newcestown in west Cork, Cian and Caoimhe Walsh, who go to St. Brogan's College.  The reason I am mentioning them is that they won the ECO-UNESCO young environmentalist award for research they did on the use of hemp.  They have an Instagram page on the subject.  Their research was astounding and incredibly eye-opening in terms of the potential uses for hemp right across different areas, particularly in respect of construction and the making of hemp blocks and hempcrete, its sustainability, the potential for carbon storage in the hemp blocks themselves and the carbon sequestration value of growing the plant.  The hemp plant stores more carbon than the same area covered by deciduous trees.  My point is that perhaps this is an area that we should really focus on and ramp up production and research in.  Hemp could potentially be the future, not just in making our buildings more sustainable, but in making farming more sustainable through sequestration.  I also believe that from a biodiversity perspective, the hemp plant has potential benefits compared to other crops that do not have the same biodiversity value.  Is hemp the future?</p></speech>

I have worked with hemp, although not so much in recent years.  Previously, when I was in Trinity College, we did a lot of work on trying to characterise the thermal and acoustic properties of hemp.  It is a wonderful building material.  It has great potential.  It sequesters an awful lot of carbon over its lifetime.  One can grow multiple crops within a single year.  Using hemp is a no-brainer.  I have retrofitted my own house with hemp insulation.  Hemp is a winner really and we would love to see more focus on it.</p> <p>  I have spoken to Professor Tom Woolley, a practising architect in Northern Ireland who is also involved in Hemp Federation of Ireland.  He said that in the last year a large number of farmers have been moving to grow hemp.  He said there is a gap between farmers and the designers who are keen to use hemp.  To make hempcrete one takes off the woody core of the hemp stalk, chip it and mix it with lime or cement, as the case may be, but there is no processing facility for that in the country.  We use hemp fibres and mash them into a wool product to make hemp insulation.  There is no processing facility for that either.  Professor Woolley and anybody involved in the hemp industry would like that to be funded by the Government because it is hard to understand.</p></speech>

Part L of the building regulations focuses on decreasing the U-value to very low levels, which makes hempcrete an outlier as a material because to reach the required U-value one needs between 600 mm and 700 mm thick walls, which is only practical in detached once-off rural developments.  There could be more space in the building regulations for a whole-life carbon evaluation of these kinds of materials, not just their potential operational thermal resistance.  They cannot be compared with polyisocyanurate, PIR, insulation, phenolic foam insulation or polymer-based insulation products in operation but they have very good thermal mass qualities to store heat and operate quite differently.  A proper whole-life carbon analysis of hemp would show its potential and that should be enabled within the regulations.<br/><br/><font color="#3A3A3A">  The use of hemp should be incentivised.  Certainly, hemp-wool insulation products are comparable with rock-wool and mineral-wool products in its thermal conductivity.  There is plenty of scope for using that.  The problem is that the product is more expensive because it is more of a niche ecological-based product.</font></p></speech>

Again, we have to remove some of the Government barriers.  There seem to be issues that block the growing of hemp.  It is difficult and the lack of a production facility is stopping that.  There are people who want to grow it and make these materials so we must facilitate them.</p></speech>

A number of farmers on the Cooley Peninsula have grown hemp for a large number of years.  It is farcical that there is no production facility in this country and that hemp must be exported and then imported.  If we had a production facility on the island of Ireland, we could become a leader in the exportation of hemp to other parts of the world where it is currently used.  Hemp is a tried and tested sustainable building method.  The fact that it is not properly utilised is a poor reflection on this country.</p><p> I did not know anything about hemp production until six months ago when Mr. McCourt reached out and decided to meet me to discuss the matter.  It must be hard for people like him as they are left feeling that they are just voices in the wind.  The witnesses present have been very clear that hemp is a sustainable building material.  Is it only through Government funding that we can have a production facility on the island of Ireland?</p></speech>

First, infrastructure is needed which means we need a facility.</p> <p>  Second, we need to provide a clear educational programme to the wider society, the Government, politicians and farmers, in particular, because hemp production, etc. could be a real money maker for people who are based in the agriculture sector.  Third, some aspects of hemp production need to be legislatively signed off.</p> <p>  Today, it has been great to hear clear comments from both Dr. Kinnane and Mr. Barry that hemp production would be very useful in the future.  We, as a committee, could explore this subject too.</p> <p>  Timber has been discussed a lot today.  Does Mr. Barry think that the building regulations need to be dramatically altered or just need small changes in order to encourage more people to use timber?</p></speech>

At the moment it is part B, or Technical Guidance Document B.  Some of the additional guidance released by the building control office has made it very difficult to implement.  A few developers have asked the council about building in cross-laminated timber and have tried to go down that route.  Even the Office of Public Procurement has tried to go down that route but, unfortunately, it ran into a complete roadblock.</p></speech>

There are two key issues - fire safety and insurance.  It can be difficult to get insurance.  There are ways to get around the insurance issue.  I mean it is possible to set up a captive insurance by the industry to cover that.  However, fire safety would appear to be the block a the moment.</p></speech>

I mean, in terms of fire safety and insurance, and the existing building regulations, the regulations that were put in place over the last ten or 20 years have made it more difficult to build with timber and that is why there has been such a shift to 90% concrete use in the last number of years.  We must re-calibrate and analyse why such a shift took place.  Perhaps it was due to fire safety.  However, it would be right for the Government to re-analyse things.  In a changing world where we must reach targets by 2030 and retrofit, then hemp concrete would be really quick and easy to use.</p> <p>  My next question is on the proposed minimum energy performance standards by 2030 in terms of the building directives.   So the proposal to introduce the minimum energy performance standards across the entire residential sector by 2030.  What frameworks need to be put in place today to reach the standards by 2030?</p></speech>

The other part of it is moving towards disclosure of embodied carbons.  There are a number of actions highlighted in the climate action plan.  We have to set up databases of materials.</p><p>We have to set up an agreed methodology.  We have the levels methodology but there will be some additional requirements where we must give default data for certain materials and there are key regulations around how the data is used.  A couple of infrastructural things also need to be in place to enable it, including more training and education to get all of our construction workers upskilled in energy efficiency and getting the whole industry geared up for it.  It is very important that it is all communicated well in advance.</p><p> One issue with the implementation of the nearly zero energy directive is that it is always beneficial for Government to keep communicating it back to the industry to let it know.  In some cases, even when the regulations were introduced in 2017 and 2019, some in the industry were still taken a little back, even though it had been requirement since 2010 under the energy performance of buildings directive.  Communication is, therefore, vital.</p></speech>

I am struck by Mr. Barry's points that under the current building regulations, there is no requirement for measurement of carbon emissions in construction beyond that associated with operational energy and that the Government's ambitious construction and renovation programme over the next 20 years, which are really critical years, could lead to excessive emissions and waste if embodied carbon is not considered.  How have we got ourselves into this position?  It seems to be State short-sightedness at its worst.</p> <p>  Mr. Barry spoke about the huge gap with regard to embodied carbon.  With the plans for construction and retrofitting, have we actually started running before we can walk?  Could this be seen to be that we are running?  What we are hearing is certainly food for thought.  It seems to expose a kind of silo thinking.</p> <p>  Dr. Kinnane spoke of retrofitting the retrofits.  This certainly would send an unwelcome chill down anybody's spine.  I am worried that there is a lot of silo thinking here when what we actually need is joined-up thinking, for example, in addressing vacancy and reclaiming property.  We all know the old saying, "I would not start from here."  Why are we starting here, given that we have all of these gaps and lapses that appear to be known, yet we have commenced retrofitting?  Dr. Kinnane is saying we might not be doing it right and we might have to go back and retrofit these retrofits in another ten years.  There is a lot of good work going on and there are a lot of data.  To follow up on the comments of my colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke, who is in charge so that we can use this properly?  This seems to be a bit of a horror show, from my reading of the two presentations.  I am also interested in the EU perspective from Dr. Lindblom on this.</p></speech>

They are broken down into: buildings, which only covers operational carbon; electricity production; waste; land use; and industrial.  What has been missed is that under industrial emissions, a very large chunk of those emissions relates to buildings, another chunk of transport emissions relates to buildings and a chunk of waste emissions also relates to buildings.  What has been missed is that these are all connected to form embodied carbon, and construction has not been regarded as a separate sector.  This is what has happened.  Under the climate action plan, there has been a lot of focus on each sector in isolation and not enough in seeing how they are connected.  Consider a random example such as transport or minimum car parking requirements.  In urban or similar areas, the minimum car parking requirements can be such that one would have to build an entire underground car park.  We are talking about 25 tonnes of carbon to build that underground car parking space.  We are not seeing the connections between everything.  When we start to connect up transport, transport infrastructure, buildings and building infrastructure, waste, the excess use of materials and industry, we get a much more rounded picture and we can actually tackle carbon in a much more effective way, rather than trying to hand over a bit to the Department of Transport and another to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We need to have a lot more conversations between Departments.</p></speech>

Even when we look at how we build, we have a lot of dispersed development.  The more dispersed development becomes, the larger homes get.  The larger homes get, the higher their embodied carbon.  The further away they are, the more transport carbon is needed in order to transport the people.  The larger the homes, the higher their operational carbon because one must heat and light larger areas.  It is really down to making the connection between all of these different components and seeing that compact growth can help us to build more compact homes.  It can free people up from the need to drive and from the need to own cars.  A car is a source of embodied carbon.  According to an EU report, the amount involved for an electric car it is approximately 8 tonnes.  What we really need to do is connect up of all of these dots in order to reduce carbon.</p></speech>

There is lots of anecdotal evidence and lots of actual evidence that a lot of retrofitting was done inappropriately.  That has caused problems, especially with traditional construction, with heavy moisture content within envelopes.  Many vapour-impermeable products are being used to retrofit those buildings all the time and this is trapping moisture, allowing for growth of moulds and mildews, creating bad air quality and creating poor health conditions for people.  We are seeing a lot of that already and it is generally due to a lack of knowledge across the industry and a lack of training for a long time, which we are trying to correct now.  Again, it emphasises the point we really need to train the installers ahead of installation because dealing with different buildings of different construction types is not something every contractor has in their understanding.  That is what they need to be trained in before they implement installations, otherwise we will end up pulling those retrofits apart again.</p></speech>

I recognise her discussion from elsewhere as well.  The fact is we have focused for a long time on one part of the building, that is, the use phase of the building.  Ireland is not alone there.  In addition, when we look at the EU policy we have something called the energy performance of buildings directive and that is so far only looking at the use phase, though we are now changing that.  We also have had for quite some time the waste framework directive that was referred to previously as well.  However, there has not been any real thought as to the more holistic view, that is, the life cycle thinking and how that also has a direct impact on our climate targets.  That was newly introduced a number of years ago but now this is changing and, as I said, in the Commission we are now taking several steps at the building level but also at the construction product level, which goes into the building to build it.  We should, therefore, be much more aware of how we can assess these with respect to carbon.</p><p>There was not data before.  A main reason this has not been done before is it was considered complex.  Life cycle thinking is not straightforward.  It is easy to understand the concept of an energy-efficient building but it is more complicated, or more complex at least, to understand what whole-life carbon is and how do I know and how do I assess it, etc.</p><p> That is why we have been working for quite some time now, together with the sector, to develop this common language in Level(s), the tool I mentioned before, so we have a number of indicators we agree on and a method of how to use that.  As we have it we can, as of last year, include this kind of thinking in different building-related policies based on Level(s).  The Commission started doing this last year.  We see, as I said, how a number of member states - not many but several - are going ahead and starting to use this, with a higher level of ambition than what the Commission currently has, to develop this more quickly in their own legislation.  Exactly how they do that and what structure they are using I cannot say but I can of course help the committee get in contact with those who are working on this.</p></speech>

I am in my office on the campus.  It has probably been asked in many different ways but I wanted to ask again about the SEAI and the oversight and standards we need to have to ensure we meet the standards required in retrofitting.  When I asked a question of SEAI representatives some weeks ago I was assured its rating system after retrofitting was up to scratch.  Maybe our present guests will comment on what kind of oversight we could have that would improve our knowledge of this and ability to check the standards are correct.</p> <p>  My second question is brief.  I think it was Dr. Kinnane who said we have one of the highest rates of vacancy in the whole of Europe.  Would he like to comment on why he thinks that is?  Do other jurisdictions take a much more interventionist approach and attitude to vacant property and dereliction?  Should we insist on a more interventionist approach in this State?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#X00500"><p>The oversight is challenging for the SEAI because it is a very large programme.  On the one hand you have contractors who would say their current auditing is quite difficult and they struggle with the oversight.  It may need a reforming of the way it is done and maybe transitioning it more towards having more professionals involved in renovation.  One of the big barriers to having professionals involved is if you take the VAT rate on professional services, it is 23% versus 13%.  It is very difficult to get homeowners to get proper professional advice because the advice itself ends up being quite expensive, so there is a tendency to go directly to approved contractors.  It is a combination of improving the regulatory oversight, having more construction professionals involved in the process and not going directly to the contractor to do this renovation.  I do not think it ever works when contractors are working on their own.  You always need good oversight.  A professional is looking building by building at what exactly suits this building, what measures suit this particular home, what type of insulation is needed for this home and he or she is seeing what the contractor is doing.</p></speech>

One of the obvious reasons is that the nature of our planning and development has historically been on the edge of towns and cities, as opposed to within them.  We certainly need to move to a model of compact growth within urban development areas linked to transportation systems and to stop the spread of our urban growth on the edge of towns.</p><p> As Mr. Barry outlined, that will have considerable benefits from a climate perspective.  It cuts down the need for private transportation.  It cuts down the amount of operational emissions related to transportation.  Ireland is quite unique in that 42% of our 2 million homes are detached buildings.  That means from an energy and building-envelope perspective we have four walls and a roof to treat rather than two walls in the case of a mid-terrace development or one wall in the case of an apartment development.  There are considerable benefits in a number of categories if we plan better and stop sprawling development.</p><p> We need to incentivise people to move back into urban centres - towns, in particular - and to renovate vacant properties within towns.  We need to make centres of towns more attractive.  We need to make urban environments easier to live in for people who are willing to live on main street.</p></speech>

Then I will ask two short follow-up questions.  In terms of the public role, the new renovation wave policy document talks about public buildings and social infrastructure showing the way.  There has been considerable focus on building this sector.  Do we need a stronger emphasis on the public role in terms of public buildings?  They are not exactly the low-hanging fruit, but they do not have to be built at the desire of the market because the State has the keys.</p> <p>  It is anticipated under the renovation wave that the requirements with regard to public buildings and social infrastructure will extend to all public administration levels.  I imagine local development plans will need to factor it in as well.  Should we be doing more front-loading on public buildings, and not just social housing?  Would doing so give us the opportunity to set a higher quality threshold?  Dr. Kinnane mentioned the danger of a contractor-led one-stop shop.  Every individual who goes in is talking to people who are experts.  If the State has a key role in procurement, does front-loading a great deal of procurement, for example in retrofitting, give it an opportunity to raise standards and set a high bar for what it expects?  This trains the new sector up to be at a higher level when the private contractors start getting involved.  This is better than having individual households leading out first because they do not have the same tools we do in terms of quality.  How important is it that we have quality public procurement?  How important is it to go for a quality weighting, rather than a price weighting only, in our public procurement policy?</p> <p>  There are two issues in terms of solutions to vacancy.  Both speakers have made some concrete proposals, one of which involved the idea of legislation on demolition.  Considerable emissions seem to be lost by demolition.  I have heard different figures but it might take 40 to 80 years for that energy and those emissions to be reclaimed.  Of course it is the next ten years that matter.  Should we set, if not a full moratorium, a much higher regulation on demolition versus renovation or extension of buildings?</p><p>In terms of vacancy, it may have been Mr. Barry who talked about discouraging demolition but also streamlining measures around vacancy and bringing that back into play.  What measures really support us on bringing vacant buildings into play?  Mr. Barry gave a huge figure.  It could be a megatonne off our embodied carbon bill if we were to retrofit 100,000 vacant homes.  Will the speakers comment on that?  I am interested on the EU perspective on vacancy, renovation and the public-building-first role.  I will follow up afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#Z00200"><p>We need to much faster on public procurement.  It needs to be applied immediately to all buildings.  Unfortunately, the private sector is leading more because it is driven by taxonomy and is required to do it by investors.  We need that same situation in public procurement.  We need to start with social housing.  Some of the approved housing bodies we have been talking to have difficulty in drawing down funding to renovate their stock.  We should start there.  They have in some cases hundreds of houses that they could do in one go.  That is the place to start.</p> <p>  On streamlining vacant buildings, we have grants such as the living city grant and conservation and SEAI grants.  They all need to be streamlined into one substantial grant based around the total carbon mitigation of renovating a home in a town centre over and above another home.  One will get a bigger carbon bang for one's buck from renovating those homes in town centres than a very large detached bungalow which may not deliver the same impact.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry mentioned we move towards not just the energy rating of building but carbon accounting.  How important is it to account for the emissions from demolition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#Z00400"><p>It is very important.  Demolition is a no-brainer.  We cannot afford to waste the sunk carbon that exists in our buildings.  Throwing all of that to landfill rather than recycling or even upcycling it in any way and putting a new building with higher-embodied carbon materials than the original in its place is a totally unsustainable process.  We need a moratorium on that.  We need to move away from this idea that whatever money we have we just use for construction and keep constructing more and newer buildings all the time.  It is totally out of sync with the aim of reducing our carbon emissions considering the amount of carbon that is involved in that process.</p> <p>  We have a section in the newest iteration of the report that will soon be published.  Carbon emissions from public buildings are quite shocking for a much smaller set of buildings than the commercial or non-residential sector.  We see almost the same amount of operational carbon emissions from public buildings excluding housing.  The public sector has said it will lead on this through retrofit plans and it needs to.  We recently went through what I know was an exceptional winter but on UCD campus the heating was up and all the windows were open for ventilation reasons.  Again, it is the wrong decision.</p> <p>  On vacancy, I mentioned 1 megatonne.  We will have updated values on that in the new report.  If we retrofit, 1 megatonne is for 100,000 homes where we use an embodied carbon.</p><p>That is conservative, because it is estimated we have up to 180,000 vacant homes.  It might not be possible to retrofit all of them, but even if it was possible to take 100,000 of those homes - and we are estimating 40% embodied carbon in this context, relative to the cost of new construction, which is an involved construction process - we are still saying it would be possible to shave 1 megatonne off the embodied carbon build of construction.  If we are going to complete 400,000 homes, and we can do 100,000 of those by retrofitting properties now boarded up in the middle of run-down towns, that would be a win-win-win outcome across so many sectors of society.</p></speech>

I refer to accounting for emissions from demolition.  As a follow-up query, regarding the European heritage green paper, we have focused a great deal on the new skills required for retrofitting and inspection, and accounting in that regard, but we must also consider older heritage and craft skills.  The good news is that this undertaking is employment intensive.  The activities involving heritage and craft skills were time intensive and for that reason they fell out of use.  The European green paper on heritage and climate has some concrete ideas in this regard.  I would be interested to hear comments on this aspect of the matter.</p> <p>  I have two more weird questions and then Ms Lindblom can answer.  One concerns sunlight.  Theories of sunlight are grievously omitted in local development plans and strategies.  It is one of the gaps in how compact growth is designed.  Compact growth seems to be designed without a theory of sunlight.  Sunlight is important concerning energy emissions, because if we have buildings that do not get light, if there are effectively tunnels in the city that are dark all day long, that means electricity will be used for most of the day.  I ask Ms Lindblom to comment on the importance of the theory of light and sunlight regarding emissions.</p> <p>  Finally, and to follow up the Chair&rsquo;s point, we cannot afford to be installing new fossil fuel boilers.  We certainly cannot afford to do so in public buildings or in publicly procured or supported buildings.  Retrofitting to systems that use gas has been spoken of, but that seems to be another example of a situation we will need to retrofit out of soon after initial installation.</p></speech>

The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong on this point.  We are dealing now with approximately 67 megatonnes in this context.  Through the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, inventory, we are trying to reduce that figure to 32 megatonnes or 33 megatonnes.  If we change the accounting system, however, by including embodied carbon emissions, which are significant across our society, are we going to find ourselves in an extremely difficult place?</p></speech>

The national development plan is heavily front-loaded with requests for tenders and procurement.  Significant public expenditure will be devoted to extensive building projects, and consequently there will be large numbers of requests for tenders and many contracts issued.  I refer to ensuring we do not end up with many supplementary claims because the relevant standards increase while projects are being built and developed.  Should we be factoring into our procurement contracts, upfront, for the national development plan whatever measures will be needed regarding embodied emissions in future?  Should we do that to avoid a situation where we have signed off on a pile of contracts, only for the rules to change and we suddenly find every contract already signed will be one that will enable contractors to come back and make supplementary claims?</p></speech>

The EPA inventory should account for all production-based emissions in the nation.  Therefore, it will account for all production of cement, which is a huge factor.  I think I referred to 90% in the report.</p><p>We export about 40% of that cement, and we also import all our metals.  For the exact figures regarding the balance of trade, I would have to look at the numbers, but it goes from approximately 3.5 megatonnes to 4.5 megatonnes annually.  There is a balance.  Therefore, if we were to account for consumption-based emissions, that total would increase, and we probably should be accounting for it.</p></speech>

I agree that sunlight should be included in plans and strategies and some development plans do require sunlight calculations.  Sunlight and daylight, however, should be considered factors in this regard.  I also agree regarding the front-loading of the national development plan.  We should be moving to a net-zero carbon emissions specification for all developments from now on.  To take an example, a hospital proposed to be designed in 2022 will not, potentially, be completed until 2035.  Therefore, a net-zero carbon standard must be applied to the full life cycle of buildings like that from the very start.</p></speech>

We should be minimising the amount of auxiliary heat required and supplying that through electricity and green sources.  Gas Networks Ireland has placed significant focus on the integration of hydrogen with gas, and on decarbonising the gas network.  Those may be technologies that will work, but we will require a great deal of energy to create that hydrogen in the first place and to process it.  We do not, as yet, have those clean energy generation capabilities in place.  Not only one technology will be required in this regard, but a mix of them.  I also agree with the lack of focus on the ingress of daylight and sunlight into developments.  It is something we always tried to put an emphasis on in architectural schools.  In practical terms, however, that aspect always falls off the table a bit.  One technology which has proved to be a major success in the last decade has been light emitting diode, LED, lighting.

One question concerned public procurement.  In the new proposal for the energy efficiency directive, which contains articles on the public procurement of buildings, it is made clear that it should encompass all public buildings.  That is right.  It is no longer just concerned with governmental buildings, as before.  Equally, if we are going to talk about any kind of low-hanging fruit, then it should involve public buildings.  They should really lead the way with public procurement in this regard.  At the European Commission, we are developing green public procurement criteria based on levels.  These criteria, of course, will very much link into the entire carbon discussion we are having.  This will be not just in the context of new buildings but also for buildings being renovated.  This is an important aspect.  It could drive demand and awareness, as well as skills and knowledge in the sector.</p> <p>  I take this opportunity to stress an interesting French study.</p><p>It looked at typical renovation cases in different parts of France and examined how whole-life carbon can be reduced or minimised in those renovation projects without necessarily having to do a fully-fledged life cycle assessment.  If the focus is limited to, let us say, ten standard renovation projects, what would the renovation project have to do in order to reduce the whole-life carbon as opposed to if they just did any kind of renovation?  The study has some interesting results which can be implemented throughout the country.  I am suggesting that could be something interesting to look at in Ireland.  The French authorities have realised that because of the sheer number of renovations they want to happen, they expect the embodied carbon will in total be double that of the embedded carbon from new buildings.  That is not per project but on a macro level.  They want to have a lot more renovation projects as opposed to new-build projects.</p><p> I agree with what has been said regarding sunlight.  Within the framework levels I have talked about, through which we can assess and report on building performance, there is an indicator for lighting.  The Senator is right that it plays an important role both for the environment and for the health and comfort of the occupants of buildings.</p><p> There was a question about whether we will be playing with different numbers in 2027 and 2030.  Those are the two years that are mentioned in the Commission proposal on the energy performance of buildings directive.  What we have there for 2027 and 2030 is that it will be necessary to assess and report.  We will not include limit values.  We should know more by then but we will not come up with a whole-life carbon limit value at that point at time, at least not as it looks today.  By that time, it will be required to assess and report on those and we will start to actually generate data.</p><p> The proposal also suggests that buildings should come with energy performance certificates when they are being sold or rented.  There should also be an indication as to whether buildings have gone through this assessment and reporting of whole-life carbon because, as I said, the proposal suggests we start with larger buildings and gradually take on the whole building stock.  This EPC should flag from the beginning if whole-life carbon has been taken into account or not.</p><p> As to the question on European heritage skills, I apologise but I do not follow that topic so I do not know.  I can, of course, put the committee in contact with relevant colleagues of mine but it is not an area in which I have expertise.</p></speech>

This is not about heritage as a goal but more about using the skills that have been built up in the heritage sphere as one of the tools that can be useful in building renovation and the minimisation of carbon.</p></speech>

In realistic terms, is there any indication of the scale of the opportunity in the Irish context?</p><p>What sort of contribution might an Irish industry make to our building needs, whether with respect to new builds or retrofitting?

It relates to the national retrofitting plan.  We are asking people to apply for loans.  We are handing over taxpayers' money in grants to retrofit these homes.  I do not feel that Dr. Kinnane is satisfied with the quality control involved or that we can stand over the quality of work relating to the current retrofitting scheme.  Dr. Kinnane has said that in some cases, homes with a building energy rating of A2 are performing at C levels.  Something that always strikes me about Ireland is that when nobody is in charge, nobody is responsible.  Do we need a carbon tsar to take this on and make sure that taxpayer's money is not being wasted and to ensure we are not asking people to go into debt to retrofit their homes when we cannot stand over the quality control of that work?  I am concerned about Dr. Kinnane's presentation.</p></speech>

It would be an alternative construction method and it can be used in different ways.  One of the ways in which we will be trying to speed up the construction of homes is through the use of modern methods of construction.  We will be considering the potential to use modular construction with timber combined with products such as insulation that can be made from hemp.  It is difficult to quantify exactly what the potential is in that regard.  When one is trying to develop an industry like this, one is not only looking at Ireland because this has to be done on a scale that meets more than just the needs of Ireland.  We have such a cyclical construction sector that we need to consider exports as well.  We might consider the success of the Coillte companies, such as SMARTPLY.  MEDITE SMARTPLY products were developed from the forestry sector for export.  As a result, the company was able to ride through the financial crisis when there was a downturn in construction here.  We should consider developing a scale of industry that thinks big and thinks at a European level as well as an Irish level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Oliver Kinnane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022042600002#EE00200"><p>To repeat and maybe add something, when we talk about buildings, we are talking about really complex systems with lots going on and many varying parameters within them.  When we try to reductively reduce the national development plan to wrapping buildings in insulation and maybe putting heat pumps into some of them, it is a very simple solution to a very complex problem.  That is where the performance gap comes from.  It is almost impossible to believe you could take a G rated building of 450 kW hours per metre squared per year one year, and then move it up to a 25 kW hours per metre squared per year following just installation of 100 mm of insulation wrap or something like that.  What we need is holistic thinking and a much broader thinking on retrofit.  That needs to be matched with more nuanced or a greater complexity to our regulation because the regulations have very much focused on the thermal resistance of the fabric and the constant reduction of that as a solution whereas we have many different matters that need to be considered, such as ventilation, dampness and heating systems and the balance between these.  The general answer to the question is, as I said earlier, we do not know nearly as much as we think we know about buildings.  There is a lack of knowledge and a lack of evidence.  We do not have the data.  We have written studies that have looked at cohorts of 12 to 20 buildings and said that a certain percentage of them perform below their design value but that may or may not be representative of the national average.  We do not have that data.  Getting that data would be really useful to bring greater understanding about where we are going here.</p> <p>  To echo the Deputy's fear with the national retrofit plan, my fear is that we rush to retrofit without having the evidence and the knowledge that we are doing the right thing.  The SEAI has been given much more funding in recent times and it is funding what we hope is good research.  For example, we are doing a big study for it on traditional building fabrics and trying to monitor the thermal and hydrothermal, the moisture related properties of those fabrics.  We will be able to feed that back to make recommendations about retrofit of those buildings and particularly complex building typologies.  We are at a very early stage in our understanding of buildings.</p> <p>  Around the world we are rushing to retrofit without the necessary evidence and knowledge base.  There are certain things we can do but we need not to think that we are going to solve it overnight.  In that case, we would create the situation where we have to retrofit again the retrofit buildings.</p></speech>

Dr. Kinnane is right, in that there was a time when we painted old houses and then damp started forming inside the house because the materials the house was constructed of were meant to be able to breathe.  We do not know everything.  We are never at the stage where we know everything.  Is Dr. Kinnane saying that we should start retrofitting at a slower level, with maybe more insulation?  I am worried about all this money we are giving out on retrofitting and asking people to go into debt.  Does he think we should have a carbon tsar, somebody who could really keep up to date so that we could move quickly when more information comes in and that somebody in charge could direct all the different organisations?  We have so many different organisations.  What does he think about a carbon tsar?</p></speech>

I think it is necessary because if there are a great many fragmented organisations trying to implement this, it is going to lead to problems.  It is a good idea.  With more funding for research, we can inform process and strategy.  With more post-occupancy evaluation, we will get data that tells us whether we are doing the right thing, or the wrong thing.  That is how we should do it rather than rush to retrofit everything and not know whether it is the right solution or not.</p><p>To break somewhat from the party line, I think the best idea would be to give every householder in the country a &euro;500 voucher to buy draught proofing or minor measures in the local hardware store and do a shallow retrofit on the majority of buildings in the first place.</p></speech>

It is actually a multi-decade plan.  It is a nascent plan as well, and things are going to change, evolve and improve and, it is hoped, take on many of the points the witnesses have made very well.</p></speech>

Following on from the demolition and materials issue, and Deputy Bruton may even come in on it, around that recycling and reuse of materials piece, clearly one of the things it seems we need, and the witnesses might comment on this, is more public jobs, effectively, in areas of inspection and standards and making sure it is not solely left to contractors but that there is public quality control and skills.  This has come up in other areas where we have talked about the need for increasing the capacity of public inspectors.</p> <p>  Another area that strikes me as possibly needing reform is the health and safety standards.  This is not to dilute - nobody wants to do that - but to look at whether our health measures and things like that need to be re-examined, and this would not be to remove them but to look for repurposed materials.  Many of them are designed on the assumption of new materials.  That is maybe at EU level as well as at local level.  Is it a case that we need some really concrete research on issues such as reusing steel or things that might not be by-products, as discussed earlier, but are actually high-cost materials in terms of their environmental impact and full cycle?</p> <p>  I remember when I was young, I went around salvage yards all the time finding quarry tiles and that kind of thing.  Does that whole area of salvage, which became a very peripheral part of the building piece but was a very central part for years, need to be almost reimagined back into a new era?</p></speech>

Under the retrofitting plan, we would still have 1.5 million homes untouched.  These are certainly low-hanging fruit from that point of view.</p> <p>  On the issue of management of the whole process, we have a circular economy Bill, on which we have made a report.  One of the central things we recommended was that the circular economy should be reported in tandem with the climate action plan and that should be overseen by the Taoiseach.  It is not that we have not considered the leadership issue of circularity, which goes well beyond just the inventory of carbon emissions and embraces the embodied issue.  We have made that recommendation.</p> <p>  I have two short questions.  Forgive me if I have missed it but how do we get public procurement to move more rapidly in this direction?  I was surprised to hear the EU&rsquo;s taxonomy is only for private investment.  Surely we should start by making sure what we control ourselves complies with taxonomies and life cycle thinking and so on.  It is certainly not my impression it does at the moment.  It would be interesting to hear the European experience and how public procurement has changed to reflect this.</p> <p>  The other question is also looking at the European experience.</p><p>How can we create a market for these more carbon-sensitive approaches, either recovered material from demolition or elsewhere or for products with a lower carbon content?  Is it through the carbon pricing, the carbon tax, if you like?  Is that the common method or are there other methods to stimulate the market for these better products from a life cycle point of view?</p></speech>

I absolutely agree that there is a greater necessity for increased State employment to monitor this and to control retrofit and housing development.</p> <p>  On the point of innovation and materials, in our small country we have some very innovative players, particularly in the alternative low-carbon cement industry, who are doing very good work.  We also do considerable research in that field.  Cement is our home industry almost.  It is hard to imagine construction without concrete.  Even timber construction requires some level of concrete.  Finding a solution to the 5% to 8% global emissions that result from cement is key to mitigating the worst of climate change.</p> <p>  On the salvaging of materials, the European Commission has put considerable money into research projects focused on the idea that materials and buildings should have what we call material passports.  If I put 1,000 bricks onto the side of my house, those bricks should have a passport associated with them indicating the construction quality, what type they were and how they were bound together.  A plan should also be developed for the end of life or dismantling of those bricks in order that they can be reused in the industry.  I do not know what the next step will be to get it implemented after that research.</p></speech>

There is a role for recertification.  A number of European projects are looking at how to take buildings apart and reuse, for example, hollow core slabs in a precast building.  That involves a recertification process where the material can receive a CE mark and be deemed fit for reuse.  It is not just a question of downcycling material from crushed concrete, it is also a question of using the product directly in a new building.  We can move the market by introducing the requirement to measure.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we run a very successful programme on what are called environmental product declarations with manufacturers.  That creates a verified document of the carbon footprint of the material.  Once we have the data, during procurement we can start looking at materials that perform better than others and incentivising those materials to be used instead of higher-carbon materials.  Those environmental product declarations will take account of the recycled content.  For example, we produced an environmental product declaration for crushed concrete which shows that it has something like one 20th of the environmental impact of virgin aggregates.  We have the means to do this; it is a question of starting to align public procurement with taxonomy now.  The criteria are largely set out.  We just need to implement them.</p></speech>

The point about the recycled concrete aggregate is an interesting one.  I read a very interesting article recently which indicated that in Zurich approximately 45% of the concrete used in any new construction must have recycled aggregate within it and yet in Ireland we have no capacity to integrate recycled aggregate in building products.  We need to move to other models.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There is considerable evidence that the circularisation of materials can work.</p></speech>

I think this session may have borne it out that there are so many questions and so many possible decisions, solutions and steps that need to be taken.  Perhaps a further iteration of the report could capture some of the very interesting conversations that we had today.  We will certainly do our best in compiling the report which we will publish in the next seven or eight weeks.  We have quite a few reports building up now.  We are trying to take these issues very seriously, capture the critical points, highlight the issues to the general public and put pressure on government and the wider system to go in the right direction.  The witnesses present today are probably better placed to get into the nuts and bolts of the policy measures, instruments, legislative changes and regulatory changes that are required.  It would be really good to see some of those things captured in a further draft.  However, I must say that it is an excellent report and I will continue to read it in the next few days.</p> <p>  I think all the witnesses for coming in today.  While I know she had to leave, I also thank Ms Lindblom from the European Commission for taking time out to tell us about the European energy performance in buildings directive and what other countries In Europe are doing.  We will have a third session on this issue soon.  Ironically or perhaps appropriately we will be going through the circular economy Bill in the next few weeks in this committee and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is also very relevant to that legislation.  I hope the discussion we have had influences legislation that will be enacted in the coming months.</p></speech>

Senator McGreehan is listening in to the meeting.  Deputy O'Reilly is substituting for Deputy Ward.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is pre-Committee Stage detailed scrutiny of the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020.  It is a Private Members' Bill and its sponsors are Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly.  Joining us today are Ms Sarah Benson, chief executive of Women's Aid; Ms Allison Graham, chief executive of Saoirse Domestic Violence Services; Ms Marie Mulholland, chief executive of West Cork Women Against Violence; and Ms Julie Mernagh, head of people development and operations, and Ms Aoife Mulqueen, talent and development partner of Vodafone.  They are welcome and I offer apologies for the slight delay due to the D&aacute;il vote.  </p> <p>  We invited representatives of Men's Aid to the meeting but, unfortunately, due to other commitments, they were not in a position to attend and sent their sincere apologies.</p> <p>  In relation to Covid-19, we ask people to exercise personal responsibility and to be respectful of the physical space of others.  People are advised to adhere to any other public health advice.</p> <p>  For anyone joining us through MS Teams, the chat function is only to be used to make the team on site aware of any technical issues or urgent matters that may arise and is not to be used to make general comments or statements or have a general discussion during the meeting.  </p> <p>  On parliamentary privilege, witnesses participating from the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making a contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. </p> <p>  I will call witnesses in the following order: Ms Benson, then Ms Graham, Ms Mulholland and, finally, Ms Mernagh.  They each have five minutes for opening statements and then we have a speaking rota whereby members will ask questions.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for being with us.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to represent Women&rsquo;s Aid before the committee.  Women's Aid endorses the introduction of paid domestic violence leave in Ireland as a vital support for survivors, and welcomes the opportunity to make this statement to the joint committee regarding the domestic violence leave Bill. <br/><br/>Economic independence from an abusive partner is essential for women experiencing domestic abuse and employment is a key element of financial independence.  Women&rsquo;s Aid believes that paid domestic violence leave can play an important role in supporting abused women to remain in employment and therefore expand their agency and choices.  We warmly welcome this Bill and its proposed vehicle primarily being through amendments to the Organisation of Working Time Act.<br/><br/>At least one in four women in Ireland have been subjected to some form of abuse from a current or former partner.  A 2014 survey carried out by the Trades Union Congress in the UK and the Republic of Ireland found that domestic violence affects performance and attendance at work.  Of those who experienced domestic violence, over 40% said the abuse affected their ability to get to work and 57% said they had to take time off work because of the abuse.<br/><br/>Paid domestic violence leave is used in other jurisdictions for survivors to be able to attend to important and urgent matters related to domestic violence which cannot be dealt with after hours or which require immediate attention.  This could be because these activities are at a specific time that cannot be changed, such as court proceedings, because they are not open after hours or because it is safer for the survivor to attend while the perpetrator thinks he or she is at work.  Domestic violence leave should include activities that are not already covered by other forms of leave such as sick leave or <i>force majeure</i>.<br/><br/>The introduction of paid domestic violence leave through this Bill potentially offers survivors a number of important benefits including retaining employment and financial independence, reducing the risk of poverty, enhancing safety, repositioning responsibility to the external factor of the abuser, supporting dignity in the workplace and offering a potential opportunity to be informed in work about specialist support services that might help.<br/><br/>Our concerns with any such legislation are that there should not be excessive barriers to paid leave for domestic violence being requested or granted, including employers requiring high levels of proof of domestic violence, such as accepting only police reports or court orders; a lack of awareness of paid leave being an option; fear that confidentiality will not be maintained; and stigma and shame.  Ideally, all employers should introduce domestic abuse policies and procedures to create a clear, consistent and transparent context for responding to employees suffering abuse and employees perpetrating abuse.<br/><br/>There should not be an emphasis on requiring proof for employees to avail of this leave.  We advocate an approach based on trust and collaboration.  Our position is that this will be sufficient given the low likelihood of an employee unnecessarily disclosing an experience of domestic abuse for anything but authentic reasons.  This issue carries with it stigma and shame which any statutory measures ought to try to mitigate and not exacerbate by requiring proof of abuse.  <br/><br/>While employees should be required to give advance notice of leave when possible, there may be emergency situations when it is not and this should be allowed for.  It therefore needs to be treated in a similar fashion to <i>force majeure</i>, whereby it can be applied at short notice or retrospectively.  In our reading of the proposed new section 23D, the Bill appears to accommodate circumstances where leave cannot be prearranged.  We welcome the fact that no requirement for evidence is stipulated, which is extremely important to ensure the leave is fit for purpose.<br/><br/>We note reference to employees giving notification of domestic violence leave &quot;in the prescribed form&quot;.  Guidance as to what the &quot;prescribed form&quot; for requesting this leave should and should not be would be useful to ensure employers do not seek to invoke unnecessary and intrusive barriers to employees who may need to avail of this leave.  <br/><br/>Women's Aid believes the leave should be a minimum of ten days per rolling 12-month period, which is stipulated in the Bill.  This should not be reduced.  In certain cases, ten days may not be enough and additional unpaid leave may be necessary.</p><p>We recommend consideration of a process for additional leave to cover exceptional circumstances.  Ideally, this should be additional paid leave but at a minimum, it should be some unpaid leave provision that could work similarly to maternity leave provisions. <br/><br/>A key consideration in regards to domestic violence leave is confidentiality.  Records of domestic violence leave must be confidential and only shared on a need-to-know basis.  Under section 23D(4) of the Bill, employers are to maintain confidentiality regarding domestic violence leave and it is an offence not to do so.  There are exceptions to this including disclosing information to &quot;employees or agents of the employer who require the information to carry out their duties&quot;.  This may be sufficient for the legislation but for successful implementation, it may benefit from some more guidance to assist employers in developing a policy that will be clear on what these exceptions may and may not be.  Additionally, if there is a dispute about domestic violence leave in the Labour Court, there is no requirement that this would be <i>in camera</i>and these can be in public.  We note that this was previously discussed in the committee and we simply refer again to this possibly requiring some further attention. <br/><br/>As stated at the outset, Women's Aid supports this legislation.  We welcome this Bill in particular as one that has undergone extensive development, consultation and consideration of similar practices in other jurisdictions.  Many good employers in Ireland have already taken or commenced steps to create a supportive initiative for employees subjected to domestic abuse as they see it as a complete win-win to be a good employer and to boost productivity and staff retention in a way that empowers those most in need.  Women's Aid is currently actively collaborating in this work with a range of such employers, as are some of the unions.  <br/><br/>I acknowledge that in early 2021, the Minister commenced an additional consultation process on a statutory leave to which we duly made a submission.  This was mooted as a process after which it was expected that legislation for domestic violence leave would be produced.  We expected the findings of the submissions process and any recommendations to have been published in late 2021 and early 2022 but this has not yet happened.  At the same time, the Minister has alluded to some other - possibly as yet undrafted -  legislative vehicle for domestic violence leave.  Women's Aid is deeply concerned that the opportunity to enact this critically important law should not be delayed.  It should not be hitched to other legislation, which may be seeking to achieve other tangentially related ends. This Bill, which appears on the face of it to have cross-party support - why would it not? - should be the legislation that the Government supports as it cannot wait. <br/><br/>We have met employers, employer groups, unions and, of course, many survivors who see the huge value of this with a limited actual cost.  We hope that the work by this committee can produce a cross-party endorsement for this Bill without delay or deflection.  I again thank the committee again for the opportunity to submit our views on this important legislation.  I am very happy to respond to any questions the committee may have. </p></speech>

This is a very important Bill and is not before time so we hope it will receive swift attention after this.  Domestic violence is the abuse of power over another person in an intimate or close family relationship by a perpetrator to maintain absolute control over another.  It takes many forms from physical to psychological, financial to sexual and intimidation to coercive control.  It also occurs in all walk of life and all facets of Irish society and imposes serious harm on those suffering its relentless grip day in, day out.  Victims of domestic violence quite often suffer silently if they have not reached out for support or told family, friends, or work colleagues.  They keep the essentials going - going to work, study, minding their children, looking after their home and paying bills - and put on a brave face to keep everyday life and commitments functioning as much as possible.  Financial abuse has been disclosed by more and more women over the past five to ten years in our services.  These include women in paid employment who have little or no control over their own wages.</p> <p>  The availability of access to domestic violence leave from work will play an essential role in providing crucial compassionate supports to staff and in acknowledging that there are women and men in every workplace in Ireland suffering violent relationships when they go home.  Having access to domestic violence leave will benefit victims in the short term by offering some immediate space to access support services, seek refuge or move house and attend court to secure legal protections while not having to worry about their job security or loss of wages.  As a lot of these appointments are during working hours, people are forced to take annual leave days or unpaid absence or even leave their job to access help.  In the longer term, the benefits will include employment sustainability and financial independence, as well as the continued raising of awareness of domestic violence.  </p> <p> At Saoirse Domestic Violence Services, we have worked with many women over the years who struggle with balancing work and living in a violent relationship.  These are women who often were forced to flee the abuse day or night and make their way to our refuge. They may have fled with only the clothes on them and no clear knowledge of where they are going.  They could be due in work the next morning after escaping with their children during the night - often with some physical as well as psychological injuries.  They worry about not going into work, calling in sick or asking for time off at short notice as they usually have not disclosed their abuse to their employer or manager.  They worry about losing their job if they are new there or still on probation.  They cannot afford to take unpaid days off.  They may be staying in a refuge in a different county, need to get children to school or cr&egrave;che, have limited family supports nearby and have the worry of work in the mix.  When woman have been able to tell their employer and ask for help and time off, they have always felt an immediate relief that they can stop juggling that piece for now and instead focus on themselves, their children and their safety options.   </p> <p>  Women in our services often feel massive shame about telling their employer that they are in a violent relationship and worry about confidentiality, particularly if it is a smaller organisation or one connected to family or friends, for example.  They will persevere in silence and keep the job going rather than feel shame and to protect the perpetrator.  The recognition of these women's experiences through legislating for the provision of domestic violence leave is very powerful.  It tells them that we believe them and that what they are going through is important to us.  It tells these women that domestic violence is not tolerated and it provides immediate practical support when they need it without fear of consequences.  Not having the requirement to prove the domestic violence to an employer is welcomed as many victims may not have sought out any supports yet or reported it to anyone and it could act as a barrier to people taking this leave if they feel they have to prove they are being abused.  Importantly, it also sends out a clear message that domestic violence is not a private matter best keep behind closed doors.  It is affecting too many women, men and children and it affects their work life too.  </p> <p>  We feel that now is the time to act on this and swiftly follow the lead of some commendable organisations and third-level institutions in Ireland that have already introduced domestic violence leave for their employees.  Saoirse Domestic Violence Services fully supports the provision of domestic violence leave within the organisation of working time Bill spearheaded by Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald and welcomes the speedy introduction of it without further delay.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Mulholland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it this afternoon.  I am the CEO of West Cork Women Against Violence.  We provide a support service to women and children experiencing domestic violence in west Cork.  Our work extends from Macroom to the west and Bandon to the east across three peninsulas - Mizen, Sheepshead and Beara - and seven inhabited islands.  This rural geography and the remoteness of large parts of the region we service will figure significantly in my comments to the committee today.</p> <p>  This Bill is a major step forward as it inherently recognises the extensive challenges placed on those experiencing domestic violence and so provides a response to alleviate some of those challenges with sympathetic, pragmatic employment supports and protections that ensure victims are not further penalised or discriminated against because of their need for those supports. </p> <p>  When a woman is forced to take action to save herself and her children from domestic abuse, she has to navigate soul-sapping channels of bureaucracy, embark on labyrinthine journeys to access legal protections and spend achingly frustrating hours arranging and attending appointments with multiples of or sometimes every one of the following - doctor, Garda, solicitor, court clerk, social worker, counsellor, domestic violence support worker, housing officer and landlords - and has to synchronise all of those in her out-of-work hours and within the school pick-up schedule.  As mammoth a task as that is, let us consider the virtual odyssey she has to undertake to get to the offices of those professional agencies and institutions if she lives in an area like west Cork.  For our purposes, let us make it easy.  Today, our client is from Bantry and so can easily access our domestic violence support service in the town where she seeks help in obtaining a protection order.  This will require a statement from her in her own words as to the events that led her to need protection.  We will assist her to write her statement.  This process can take upwards of three hours and more usually most of the day because she is recounting traumatic events, is being retriggered and becoming distressed and needs rest breaks.</p><p>Her paperwork is then submitted to the court clerk&rsquo;s office to be scheduled for a hearing at the next immediate sitting.  However, the next sitting may be in Clonakilty which is 51 km away, a 50 minute drive from Bantry, or it could be in Bandon which is a 120 km round trip.  </p><p> Let us make it more straightforward today because we do not have time to wait for a rural bus service.  We will give our client her own means of transport, which is just as well because there is no public transport directly to Clonakilty from Bantry.  However, if she had to be in Bandon for court, there is a bus from Bantry at 8.30 a.m. that will get her to Bandon for 10.20 a.m., in time for court commencement.  Then she has to hope that her case will be heard and a protection order granted in time to catch the 4.40 p.m. bus back to Bantry, arriving at 5.50 p.m.  Should it be a busy court schedule, she may leave on the last bus which arrives in Bantry at 8.15 p.m.  Either way, it will have taken her the best part of 12 hours to attend court and get her protection order.  The cost is approximately &euro;20, which is for the bus fare and excludes eating, drinking and childcare costs.  </p><p> For today&rsquo;s purposes our client has a car and she hopes that the waiting time in court, where a myriad of other cases are to be heard from drug offences to licensing applications, is not so lengthy.  She is praying that she will be squeezed into the judge&rsquo;s schedule before the kids get out of school and that she has enough money to cover the petrol for her 100 km trip.  On this occasion, she gets her temporary protection order and must return in a week&rsquo;s time to get her safety order.  On that date the court is sitting in Macroom, a 108 km round trip with no direct bus service available.  She will worry about that next week.  For now, the next most important step is to organise an appointment with the doctor to get help with sleeping and to request a referral for her oldest to the HSE child psychologist.  Her boy is still wetting the bed at 11 years of age and hides in the hot press when he hears his father shouting. </p><p> As the family home is on her partner&rsquo;s family farm, she has been advised to put her name on the council housing list as soon as she can.  To do so she will require, on average, 12 different documents and as many as 17, particularly if she is a non-Irish resident.  Some of the documents she may need will require a fee to obtain and some may need to be translated, for yet another hefty fee.  She will also have to present herself to the council office to be assessed should she become homeless due to domestic violence.  All this will require trips, phone calls and requests to various institutions and agencies to provide proof that she has no other means of accommodation and is not intent on subverting council services which are located in only one office in west Cork, in Clonakilty.  It is a good job she does not live in Castletownbere or it would be a 200 km round trip to the housing office, with no direct bus service; worse still, she could be travelling from one of the islands. </p><p> Regretfully, I have seen too many women forced to give up work because of the rigorous, ongoing demands of organising safety and well-being for themselves and their children, resulting in work becoming incompatible with survival.  The freedom to work outside the home may have been one of the only freedoms a woman could exercise in a coercively controlled relationship and ironically, she may often have to sacrifice that employment to navigate her route to protection.  The right to paid leave and to continue in employment means a victim of domestic violence can put petrol in the car, pay bus fares, fees, pay for doctor&rsquo;s appointments and, crucially, have some level of economic independence and security. </p><p> I would respectfully suggest that it be made clear that the ten days domestic violence leave can be taken over a staggered period as waiting times, appointment availability and court sittings do not, unfortunately, occur on convenient, consecutive days.  Outside of court days, most other appointments and commitments can be met by taking a few hours leave on the required dates.  In that context, consideration should be given to domestic violence leave that is calculated in hours. </p><p> There is a clear, victim-centred focus to this Bill which I welcome, but it also has benefits for employers, permitting them to keep experienced staff who might otherwise have to leave their employ.  It also reduces the employee&rsquo;s stress and loss of focus on the job which can often occur over an extended period where a victim has very little access to paid leave to attend to the necessary processes she needs to engage in.  In combining benefits for both employee and employer, consideration of a period of flexible working for those employees who are engaged in efforts to improve their safety has proven very useful in other jurisdictions.  Flexible working has helped to overcome so many economic and social challenges, as we have found recently.  In this situation too, an option of flexible working would allow some women to work while also managing the new reality of their changed circumstances and environment which cannot be overcome within a specified, ring-fenced number of days or hours. </p><p> I thank the committee members for listening and especially for their efforts to support employees who are victims of domestic violence and coercive control. </p></speech>

My name is Julie Mernagh and I am the head of people development and operations in Vodafone Ireland, where I am responsible for our diversity and inclusion strategy.  I am joined by Ms Aoife Mulqueen, who is our diversity and inclusion specialist.  I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  We are incredibly proud of the work we do on domestic violence and abuse and are delighted to be able to share our story with the committee.</p> <p>  Why, as an employer, did we decide to focus on domestic violence and abuse?  We are able to tell our story today because Vodafone is a purpose-led organisation.  This enables us to stand up for those who are less fortunate than us and ensure that nobody is left behind.  Over three years ago we launched our purpose as an organisation, which is to Connect for a Better Future.  That purpose is underpinned by three pillars, namely, Digital Society, Inclusion for All and Planet.  Our work on domestic violence and abuse fits firmly into the category of Inclusion for All.  </p> <p>  To provide some context, we are over ten years into our diversity and inclusion journey in Vodafone Ireland.  We want to be an organisation that supports our people through both the highs of working with us but also through the lows they might encounter.  We want to support them through all of the eventualities of life.  To reach this ambition we have launched a number of progressive policies over the last number of years from flexible working through maternity leave, non-birthing parent leave, our global menopause commitment and just last month we launched our new policies around pregnancy loss, fertility and surrogacy leave mirroring our generous maternity leave policy.  We are here today to talk about our groundbreaking policy on domestic violence and abuse.  We are proud that we were the first company in Ireland to introduce such a policy and this is all part of our desire to be an employer that really supports its employees through all stages of their life.  </p> <p>  Why does it matter and why did we decide to focus on domestic violence?  We know that one in four women and one in seven men in Ireland are impacted by domestic violence.  Last year the Vodafone Foundation commissioned global research which highlighted a 53% increase in domestic violence during the pandemic and that 63% of victims of domestic violence feel safer at work than at home.  Our research also told us that for 94% of victims, domestic violence and abuse had a negative impact on their work performance.  This highlights the necessity for employers to develop a domestic violence policy.</p> <p>  How did we decide to address this in Vodafone Ireland?  As with any of our work on diversity and inclusion, this required us to take a multipronged approach which included a domestic violence policy, people-manager training and breaking the taboo.  By talking about this openly in the workplace, we empower our people to ask for help.  In designing our policy, we conducted research on how companies and governments in other countries such as New Zealand support victims and survivors of domestic violence.  Our senior leaders were incredibly supportive of this work so we are able to use the policy to provide a generous leave allowance, among other supports.  What does that include?  It includes ten days of paid annual leave which can be used for court appearances, moving home and so on.  It also includes full use of our flexible working policy and now, our hybrid working policy.  During the pandemic, it is important to note, we kept our offices open.  This was important because it gave potential victims of domestic violence a safe place to go, away from their home environment.  We also provide assistance in setting up a bank account, as well as a change of email address and phone number.  Like all staff members, we also provide support through access to our employee assistance programme.  Privacy and confidentiality are of the utmost importance in our policy.  The policy clearly describes employees' route to accessing the support they need via their people manager or the HR department.  </p> <p>  A vital part of our work was our people manager training.  As part of the domestic violence policy we partnered with Women&rsquo;s Aid to co-design and co-deliver training for our people manager community.  This was designed to empower them to support a victim of abuse in an incredibly difficult time.  We also put our HR team through a full day's training and our people manager community, all 130 of them, through a half day's training in the summer of 2019.  This training covered our recognise, respond, and refer model to taking a domestic abuse disclosure.  It also highlighted the role of the people manager in signposting the way to professional advice and support from organisations like Women&rsquo;s Aid.  In response to the increase in domestic violence over the pandemic, we also ran refresher training last year, as well as open company discussions on the topic in which all employees were able to engage.</p><p>Finally, why should other employers follow our lead?  What has been the impact of our policy so far?  In 2021 Dr. Jane Pillinger, an international researcher and expert on domestic violence conducted a study on the impact of Vodafone&rsquo;s domestic violence policy.  Given confidentiality, we are unable to disclose specifics but that research included several case studies of domestic violence policies in action that showed the positive impact our supports had on the lives of our employees. </p><p> I will share one example.  The victim had ended a relationship with an abusive partner and moved out however the abuse continued at her new temporary home and at work.  Through accessing the domestic violence policy this individual was able to disclose the situation to her people manager, connect with an expert support organisation, and create a personalised safety plan.  This person was then able to take domestic violence leave to attend solicitors and court appointments to take a protection order covering her home and workplace.  Domestic violence leave also assisted the victim in coping with the emotional and psychological toll of the abuse, while still maintaining her independence and source of income.</p><p> We know that policies such as ours can evoke change and make a real difference in creating a better, safer future in our society.</p></speech>

All the contributions were very powerful,  particularly the account of how difficult it is for someone living in a rural area.  There was a paragraph that summed it up so well including the difficulties of getting to so many things.  It is why so many people do not leave.  There are so many obstacles.  We see that a lot around family farms and things like that.  The statements were all excellent.  It is great to see that there are employers such as Vodafone leading the way.  I think this will be a really good session and I am glad that we are not under time pressure, unusually.</p></speech>

I particularly thank our witnesses.  I want to say a particular word of thanks to Ms Mulholland because she has outlined in very stark detail the picture of a woman that I could nearly relate to myself.  We were all nodding along in recognition of the obstacles around people getting to things.  The outline was very welcome because it is very real.  The one takeaway is that this is very real.  As I am sure she will not mind me saying, the Chair and I are both former trade union organisers.  We have experienced this from the other side and have seen the impact it has had.  We have seen women in their workplace fade away because they do not speak up and they do not want to answer questions about what they were doing at the weekend or talk about why they were off work yesterday.  They do not want to look into the faces of their colleagues who are cross because they have taken another day off without any notice and all of that kind of thing.  I have seen that and I know the Chair has seen it.  As public representatives, we probably have all seen in it our clinics as well.  To nearly put a face on it, Ms Mulholland's contribution was very valuable and useful.  It stopped us all in our tracks a little so I thank her particularly and I thank all our witnesses.</p> <p>  My first questions are for Ms Benson and Ms Mernagh and are on this legislation.  I am one of its sponsors.  It is an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act because I regard it as a workers' rights issue that should be part of the workplace leave and part of the normal way that a workplace functions.  Does Ms Benson think there is a benefit in treating this form of leave as part of a suite of leave to which a person is entitled under the Organisation of Working Time Act, rather than adding the legislation to a work-life balance Bill or other legislation?   For me, it is firmly situated as a workplace issue and a workers' rights issue but I would welcome the views of anyone in this regard, albeit those of Ms Benson and Ms Mernagh in the first instance.</p></speech>

One is the reason Deputy O'Reilly mentioned.  There is still huge stigma associated with domestic violence.  Anything that would spotlight it in an erroneous, additional or separate manner than any other ordinary leave buys into and feeds into the idea that it is not a legitimate reason you would need to take time off, just like your children being sick or your annual leave entitlement to rest and recover or just like having Covid-19 and needing to stay in bed.   It is incredibly important in the way that we as a society deal with domestic violence that we do so in a way that it is something that unfortunately happens, and to far too many women and to some men in this country.  If we are to respond to it, we need to do so in a highly pragmatic way that respects the dignity of an employee and it should be treated in that way.</p> <p>  It also makes it understandable.  The success of  legislation like this, in the same way as an individual employer undertaking to put in a policy, as we in Women's Aid have done, is to be able to clearly introduce it as just another one in the suite of employee policies that are there.  It is not something strange or different but just something that we have with guidelines and explanations internally around how you access it, as well as assurances around the confidentiality, the same as sick leave confidentiality or anything else.  Putting it in there is very important.  </p> <p>  The other is a very pragmatic reason which I flagged, perhaps cheekily, at the end of my statement, namely, time.  At the moment we have something that is well developed, that has already gone through consultation and which reflected on the experience in other jurisdictions, which we fed into back in 2018 and 2019 when it was being developed.  We do not see any reason for rehashing it and trying to position it in another legal vehicle.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Mernagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#E00500"><p>We also support the recommendation for a couple of reasons.  We have many debates when we introduce new policies in Vodafone Ireland.  We are always challenging ourselves and asking what barriers exist that we need to remove for our employees.  We always end up landing on the idea that having a specific policy to address a specific issue is the right way to go.  We have anecdotal and direct feedback from employees whenever we introduce new policies such as those around domestic violence that by having something on a specific issue, they are given that permission to ask for help.  It also stimulates a company-wide conversation.  That is the second lesson learned by introducing such a policy.  Our power against domestic violence is openly talking about it in the organisation.  That is not always easy.  It can be incredibly difficult.  You have to get extremely strong buy-in from senior leadership.  That is another key lesson that we learned.  The CEO and leadership team need to be really bought into this.  They need to be role modelling it and advocating from the top.  Having a direct policy in place that sits alongside all the other policies that exist opens up the conversation and empowers people to raise their hands and ask for help.  We know from direct feedback that has made a difference and has helped put in place safety plans to help people and save their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#E00600"><p>My next question is for Ms Graham and Ms Mulholland.  It is more around the current impact of not having any access to paid leave for victims and survivors.  Is it their experience that women - and I will say women because it is mostly women but not only women - have lost their jobs?  Have they found themselves in that situation because they could not access leave?  It is important to put it in the legislation but it also is important to have the conversations that go along with it and to bring the subject out of the shadows.  Do they see there is a value in that?  Practically speaking, in their experience is this the case?  Thinking of my own experience, I can think of at least one case, and possibly two, where I can say the person definitely lost their job because they could not access paid leave and they had exhausted every other form of leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Allison Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#E00700"><p>Absolutely.  Over the years we have seen numerous women, I could not count them, who lost their job.  It might be because they could not give the ongoing commitment of being in work day in, day out.  They may have come to a refuge that may be in a different county or area and they may not have transport and may not have the family supports etc. that they were used to having.</p><p>We have seen women who had to take the very difficult decision to leave a job and hand in their notice because they just felt they could not handle it any more, could not keep juggling it all and could not commit to it, or there was pressure coming from their employers, who were noting that they had taken a lot of time off, said they were unreliable or asked what was going on.  Employers would say that they needed to be in work and they could not take time off.  Women doing shift work and all sorts of other work have faced challenges because they were not able to commit to it any more.  There have been numerous women who have lost employment because of that.  I mentioned that some of these women were new in jobs and perhaps were trying to prove themselves.  Many of them were not from Ireland originally and had moved here, and had struggled to get a job.  They got a job, this had happened and they felt that they could not speak to their manager.  There was not an open door in terms of feeling that they could speak about it and what they were going through.  There also have been women who have muddled through, done their best and continued to go to work.  It has taken its toll on their mental and physical health.  At the same time, they are looking for a safer option away from the abuse and are trying to keep their kids going with some normality.  It is a big challenge for women, first to talk about it in their job to their manager and second, to find some sort of compassion.  Our experience has been that some employers are open when women come forward and speak to them.  We have asked women what would be the worst thing that would happen if they spoke to their managers, then they have spoken to them and have found them to be very compassionate.  There have also been women who have had a very negative experience, where nothing was listened to and there was no compassion or empathy.  The women were pushed out the door because they could not commit to the work and the managers did not want to know about their personal problems.  </p></speech>

She could not keep the front up either.  Many of the women that we see are in low-paid and part-time employment.  They do not have access to a lot of paid leave anyway.  To have something such as that set out in the Bill, which would give them additional paid leave, would be extremely important.  The other point to note is that after the immediacy of the need to escape and get somewhere safe, there is a lengthy period of continuing court appearances.  There may be appearances concerned with breaches of the order and access court appearances.  That can go on.  We run a therapy programme for children impacted by domestic violence.  Who is going to take the child to the appointment except mum?  That appointment will be when there is availability.  There are constant and ongoing appointments and other considerations.  After a while, it just becomes too difficult for women to hang on to their jobs.  I see it all the time.  A client has recently given up the ghost on her job.  That is why I strongly endorse this Bill.  It is a real opportunity for women to keep that level of independence and economic security.</p></speech>

The question is addressed first to Ms Benson, and then to the other witnesses.  We have more or less covered this issue, but I want to be belt and braces about it.  Are the witnesses happy and satisfied that enough consultation has been done?  We could say that there is never enough consultation.  We could be doing it for the rest of our lives.  At some point, we have to draw a line and say that we have consulted and listened and now need to move forward.  Are the witnesses happy that this legislation reflects the needs of victims and survivors as it currently stands?  Do they feel that more consultation and another report is required?  Do they think that another round-table discussion or something similar would be worthwhile, or do they feel that they have put it all out there and there is nothing more we could possibly add to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Benson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#F00400"><p>I will acknowledge that a consultation has been undertaken, which we fed into.  We have also had bilateral meetings with some of the other stakeholders, as I mentioned.  I think it is important for the success of anything like that to give the opportunity for all stakeholders to feed in.  I would welcome the publication of the additional one.  In doing so, I would be laser-focused on whether there is anything in there that has not already been articulated.  If it has already been said, then we do not need to say it again.  It is probably necessary to share that, but only from that perspective.  I do not want to speak for or name any other organisations but we have met unions, employers and some employers' representatives, where one might think that concerns may arise.  We have not found those concerns.  What we have found is an openness and a willingness.  When we think very practically about it, it is about maintaining productivity.  It also represents an incredible pivoting of the employer.  Unwittingly, in many cases, employers are a pressure point that is a tool of the abuser in a coercive controlling situation, where actually, in some cases, the express intention is to get the woman to give up work, because that makes her economically dependent.  This legislation pivots the employer to being an ally.  It costs very little.  As I have said, the net gains that we have seen in other jurisdictions seem to be that employee confidence in their employers improves and they feel looked after.  Their productivity is higher because they know that they have that safety net and they are not carrying all that pressure.  We have found that when we have those conversations, there is not anybody who would not entertain it.  Of course, we should ask whether there is anything different that we have not heard yet, and take it into consideration.</p></speech>

I feel that there is a lot of research and evidence in the public domain already.  I am not saying that we should draw a line under it and stop learning, as every day is a school day for everyone, but perhaps we are in a position to state we know enough now to move forward.  I am conscious that I have taken up a lot of time.  I might come back in if I get a chance.</p></speech>

They are invaluable for us to hear, as a committee.  I particularly welcome Ms Mulholland, from West Cork Women Against Violence.  The organisation does incredible work in my constituency supporting women and children experiencing violent and abusive situations, as well as providing counselling services, training and outreach.  Women's Aid and Saoirse Domestic Violence Services also provide similar life-changing and lifesaving services.  In this room, we are all aware of the sheer terrifying scale of domestic violence in Ireland.  The Bill from Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald really responds to the issues and realities faced by women and children who are trying to escape violent and coercive situations.  I cannot overstate the value of the committee understanding the specific challenges in rural areas, including the complexities of issues like family farms.  I know this from when I was first elected to the council and worked with West Cork Women Against Violence on issues around access to things as basic as that.  Women used to be able to go to the community welfare office to access emergency accommodation.  That changed to Clonakilty, which has had a profound impact on women and their families, keeping people in very dangerous situations.  Ms Mulholland raised the need for domestic violence leave to be taken over a staggered period, as appointment times, court dates and housing office appointments do not occur in a convenient, consecutive way.  Should that be included in the Bill?  I ask her to elaborate on the point about flexibility in taking that leave, if she wishes to add to it.  If there is time, I will come back in with more questions.</p></speech>

Clarity on that would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#F00900"><p>I know I am not a witness but the intention is that it would be taken in the normal way, so that an employee could take a half day's leave or a quarter day's leave.  That is why the Bill is an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  Everything has to be done in consultation but it is housed within the Organisation of Working Time Act because it will operate in a similar way to other leave.  It has to work for people who are on hourly or weekly contracts.</p></speech>

I absolutely would include it if people felt it was necessary.  It is already very much implicitly there in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  That is how leave operates, in any event, which is why it is there.  Employees do not have to take ten days' leave in a block when they might be busy for three days and not busy for seven days.  The intention is that they will be able to break leave up and take it accordingly, as they can with other forms of leave covered by the Organisation of Working Time Act.  That said, I would welcome discussion on an amendment if it was felt that it was necessary.  I do not see it as necessary, but that does not mean I would not be open to making sure that is crystal clear.</p></speech>

It would help us in recommending additional leave if Ms Benson gave us a sense of the kind of time required and the complexities faced by women and children experiencing domestic violence and abuse.  Women's Aid also raised a number of points in regard to confidentiality.  Ms Benson might expand on the need for guidance to assist employers when developing policies on dealing with that and related matters.</p></speech>

It would normally be with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and so without obligation, and I do not know whether it will become the rock that we would die on to put it in as &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  It would be for exceptional circumstances.  It could be that somebody has an immaculate sick leave record, for example, but then perhaps contracts a very serious illness, such as cancer or something like that, and there will be a procedure whereby he or she could apply for additional leave in exceptional circumstances, and we think those exceptional circumstances should be generously broad.  In effect, as Ms Mulholland rightly stated, depending on the situation, it can be a long or a short journey, and ten days over a 12-month rolling period may be sufficient in order to accommodate somebody.  However, they can have particularly protracted court proceedings, for example, around breaches of orders, and we also have situations where the courts themselves are weaponised almost, and that very often centres around custody and access matters and maintenance matters.  It is like a war of attrition.  If there are exceptional circumstances, we think they should be accommodated.</p> <p>  I quite cheekily put in a lot of appendices to my statement.  There are data in there which show that the uptake for both New Zealand and Australia in particular was not huge.  Again, it is incredibly hard to disclose.  If it involves one in four women, not all of those women will be in employment and not all of them may need recourse to that leave, so that would affect the number we are talking about in terms of the hazard or the risk that an employer might face by going that extra mile to put this in.</p> <p>  This leads me to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, which is around confidentiality.  It is acknowledged and it is very clear in the Bill as drafted, and we also have data protection obligations on employers.  No matter what, there is almost a double-lock with employers already facing legal obligations around confidentiality but we have just identified a couple of circumstances where there needs to be a little more precision.  We understand that where it talks about the need to disclose, that could manifest in a couple of ways.  First, it might be where there is a line manager and a HR person and they just need to know for the purposes of processing leave, and it is all within that.  However, there is a further issue that I added as an appendix and Ms Mulholland also alluded to it.  A policy is not just around having paid leave and it can also be around flexible working time and safety planning.  There can be exceptional circumstances where an individual poses a threat not just to his or her current or former partner, but also perhaps to other people in the organisation, so perhaps a member of the security staff or someone working in reception may need to be notified that a certain person is not to be on the premises, with that then being bound by confidentiality.  There needs to be some explanation of what that might mean to give staff assurance.</p> <p>  We have a policy ourselves in Women's Aid and, similarly, it is allowed to be taken in hours, but we would be very clear in those situations that it is with informed consent of the individual and nothing is done and nobody is told without them knowing and being consulted about it.  Generally, it will be in the context of workplace health and safety, not just for the person who is being subjected to the abuse but perhaps other individuals around risk management.</p> <p>  I would say again that these are rare cases but it is good to have them covered so we do not inadvertently have somebody's personal details or information shared, or that there is a chilling effect so they are not sure how their information will be received and, therefore, they will not disclose it at all.</p></speech>

What sort of guidance would help other employers to make sure they get specifics like that right in order to deal with confidentiality?  If the Vodafone representatives could go back and have somebody give them advice, out of interest, what would have been helpful to know in advance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife Mulqueen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#G00700"><p>There is a very long list of things.  Women's Aid was an amazing partner so we were able to get a lot of its knowledge to equip us with this.  One of the most important things, as the Deputy said, is around the privacy and safety of the individual and how we access that.  We learned from Women's Aid that one of the core components of a relationship in domestic violence is that the power and control is constantly taken away from the victim, so everything we wanted to do as an employer was to put back that power and control to the individual.  For us, in practical terms, that would include certain things.  It has happened that somebody has come to me to say they have a domestic violence disclosure on their team.  One of the first things we will say is that we do not need to know a name and the only person who needs to know a name is the person who is applying the annual leave to the account of that person.  Other than that, we can just have conversations about how to support that individual and the best way for them, and make sure they are in control of everything.</p> <p>  There is a huge list around some of the challenges we have had and ensuring our duty of care to our people managers as they go through this training, which is quite difficult to go through and can be quite emotional in a lot of ways.  It was probably the first time we have ever created training where we had to look at the emotional trajectory of the room to make sure that, by the end of the half-day that we put our people managers through, they felt really empowered by the end.  We did a survey at the end of every training to ask how they felt about taking a disclosure of domestic violence and 95% said they felt moderately to highly competent in taking a disclosure of domestic violence from an employee, which would not have been the case earlier in the day.  That kind of forum was definitely important in helping our understanding as the training went on.</p> <p>  Ms Mernagh mentioned the key role that our senior leaders played.  Every single one of our senior leaders attended the training and role-modelled and said that they found this incredibly important.  We also could not underestimate how our diversity and inclusion work over the last couple of years has really embedded into the employees.  After one or two sessions of our training with Women's Aid, the quality of the training, how people felt coming out of the training and how they felt they had learned something they really did not have before and that they were going to use it, not just in their work lives but in their lives in general, created a buzz that made it incredibly successful.  It still is quoted as one of the things that makes people the most proud of working at Vodafone, which is obviously hugely meaningful.</p> <p>  There are also other things that come to the fore, such as people letting us know information through a people manager.  There is a person in one our business areas who said they had left an abusive relationship because we were talking about it and because it was part of the conversation.  In that situation, that person did not even access the policy or take the leave; it was just the fact that we were talking about it that gave them the strength to move on.</p><p>There are many different aspects, with key enablers and challenges that we face throughout.  We, as a business, have said that we will talk to anybody who is considering it.  There are many tricky bits to learn relating to HR.  We are open to having conversations and have never said "No" to a conversation with another business or another HR team that is thinking of implementing this.  We want them to know that it is possible.  There are no privacy concerns, unlike in other areas.  It is beneficial.  Did I forget anything?</p></speech>

Research was carried out in west Cork, where West Cork Women Against Violence is located.  It transpired that how women in rural areas come to disclose, report or seek help is different to how they do so in more built-up areas, because of how difficult it is to maintain confidentiality in a rural area.  Women often went to their general practitioner.  They could be going in for a cough or such, so they are safe and no one will know what they are doing.  That is one example of how it is different in a rural area, where people may not feel comfortable going straight to Ms Mulholland, but will often go through those other channels.  That would certainly apply to people talking to their employers too, since there is a fear of confidentiality being broken.  Does Ms Mulholland have any insight into how that might work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Mulholland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#H00300"><p>I am listening.  I love that Vodafone is willing to talk to other businesses.  We might get Ms Mulqueen down to west Cork.  Regarding confidentiality, we are mostly dealing with small businesses.  There are a couple of big companies in Clonakilty, but employers are mostly involved in the hotel, leisure and tourism industry.  They are small, maybe family-run hotels.  Being able to tell employers what is going on would be extremely difficult, because not only do they know the employee, they probably know the partner who is the perpetrator too.  They may even have connections or be related.</p> <p>  I have a question for Deputy O'Reilly.  In order to make this work, would there be penalties for breaching confidentiality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#H00400"><p>There are standard penalties, but one would have to go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to vindicate that and to assess the level of damage to the person.  If people said they had an illness, the employer would be obliged not to visit the local Centra and gossip about it.  That obligation already exists.  Not to belabour the point, that is why this is being included in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  The intention is that when people have that time off, it is their own business and their own time to avail of leave.  It is brilliant that, in all of the discussions on this, nobody has asked what happens if someone takes that leave who is not entitled to it.  If that is ever raised, I make every person in the room state whether they would apply for this leave, and everyone I have ever met has said no.  That does not arise.  People run the risk in the same way as when they go to an employer to say they are going to hospital next week for a procedure.  While no disrespect is intended, I note people run the same risk if they go to confession, in that they are making something known.  In this case, they are putting their trust in the employer.  There are many good employers that will move ahead on this, including National University of Ireland, Galway, Ulster Bank, Vodafone and others.  The legislation is necessary for those employers that might need a nudge, though that is not to say they are not good employers.</p> <p>  This discussion is part of the legislative process; it is bringing it out into the open and is reminding people that this is leave.  If Ms Murphy is off work because she is having a procedure on her veins, it is only the business of herself, her doctor and anybody else who she wants to tell.  For the same reason, if Ms Murphy has to go to court, it is nobody's business.  One cannot legislate for people talking to each other over the garden fence with a mouthful of clothes pegs, because that will happen.  It would be silly for us to try to legislate for that.  We have tried to include it with the leave that already exists, building on the practice that people in HR, the unions and the representative organisations have to follow.  People are only as good as their reputation and they will not last long in HR or as a representative if they have a reputation for gossiping.  This builds on confidentiality which has been developed over years and is how HR should work, although it is not how it has always worked.  Penalties already exist for other forms of leave and related confidentiality issues.  All employers have obligations relating to GDPR, whether they are large multinational corporations or two-person operations.</p></speech>

I am fully supportive of paid leave for employees who are victims of domestic violence.  Over the last two years, during the pandemic, we have seen a significant increase, which has been an eye-opener.  We have to be mindful that men, too, can be in that situation, as colleagues and I see.  The witnesses spoke of many barriers, including rural transport, housing, counselling and support.  We have a long way to go, but this is a good start.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has started an examination of what supports exist.  One relates to changes to the social protection rent supplement to help victims.  It is a start, but we have a long way to go.  Carlow has no refuge, which is a disaster.  We have been working on it with the Minister, because every county needs a women's refuge.</p> <p>  We are lucky to have Amber in Kilkenny, which does great work.  Amber recently produced research on the impact of domestic abuse on the workplace in 2021.  Two hundred women and men who worked outside the home in Carlow and Kilkenny were surveyed.  Some 21% had physical threats made against them by their abuser while at work.  Some 46% said they are physically and emotionally unwell and exhausted as a result of the abuse.  Some 66% said the abuse negatively impacted their work performance.  Some 69% did not disclose the abuse to their employer, manager or co-workers, which is another concern.  Some 12% of the respondents who made a disclosure of domestic abuse said their employer or manager was not that helpful.  Some 52% of the respondents said they did not have personal experience of domestic abuse, but witnessed the effects of a colleague's domestic abuse while at work.  It is crucial that we consider these staggering figures.</p> <p>  We spoke about a duty of care.  It is hard for women in that position.  People can be very private.  We meet people every day and we might not even know that they are in such a situation.  It is important to legislate to give women a chance to get this leave and I support it.</p> <p>  The conversation with employers has been mentioned.  Do the witnesses feel there is a change in this regard?  Has Covid led to a change?  Over the years, things have been hidden and people may not have known how others were affected.  Can we see that change in society?  I compliment Vodafone on its policies.  Its representatives constantly referred to its policies.  Where did its excellent policies originate from?  Did they arise from surveys of the company?  Did it see other companies doing this?  We need to consider policies and Vodafone's policies have been game-changing.  I compliment Vodafone on that.</p><p>It is a worry that one in four women are impacted.  I see it in my area where we have no refuge.  The local authority closes at 5 p.m. on Friday and there are no supports on Saturday or Sunday.  Where do people go?  People stay in a situation because they have nowhere to go.  There are so many issues.  This is a good change.  We have many more changes to make.  I compliment all of the witnesses and I say well done.  This will be so important.  It is a start and we have many more changes to make.  Many of my questions were already asked.  The women got to them before me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Mernagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#J00200"><p>I will respond on the first point on whether employers are taking a stance on this and Ms Mulqueen might speak about 2019 and how the policy originated.  When we first introduced the policy in 2019 we were unique.  We were the first company in Ireland to do so.  Since then 27 other Vodafone markets have introduced the policy globally.  It certainly snowballed from there.  When we introduced it we were unique but we have certainly seen it ramp up in the past 18 months.  In recent months we have been inundated with requests from other organisations and representative groups, such as that of insurance bodies, asking us to present, perhaps in partnership with Women's Aid or the Rape Crisis Centre, to open up the conversation.  The death of Ashling Murphy has triggered a bigger conversation about this.  We are seeing an increase in requests for us to share our story.  This certainly amplified over the past six months and during the pandemic.</p> <p>  The question we ask ourselves is how quickly we are taking action and whether we are taking it quickly enough.  Banks are stepping forward to try to do this.  Are we going at the pace we should be going at?  I hope that when the legislation is enacted it will provide the mandate or commitment that all employers need to step up.  In Vodafone we believe this is fundamentally part of our employees' lives.  We have a responsibility to care about our employees not only in work but also in their personal lives outside of work and making sure we support them in the tough times as well as the good times.  We are seeing this increase.  Ms Mulqueen will discuss the policy in 2019.</p></speech>

Something it sees as a priority for businesses is more human-centred work.  This falls in line with much of the talk around our policies and ensuring people are taken care of.</p> <p>  To go back to 2019 when we first introduced the policy, a huge amount of groundwork was done.  Many businesses I have spoken to ask about how we got approval from our board of directors and how we got it to think of this as a priority in order that we got the opportunity to introduce the policy.  Something that was very helpful for us was the fact we had been working on diversity and inclusion, including gender.  We have 52% female representation in our leadership across the business at present.  This is not something that happened overnight.  It is something we worked on for approximately ten years.  We have consistent maintenance of the messaging on diversity and inclusion and the importance it brings to us.  We have employee resource groups, such as the women's network and the LGBT network.  We also have a diversability network.  We also have multicultural and mental health themes.  There is a lot going on in our world of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  While I will not say it was easy, laying this groundwork over time made it a very natural progression for us.  When it came to proposing it and getting sign-off from our leadership team it was incredibly smooth because of the fact we had been building this case for so long.  We no longer talk about the business case for diversity and inclusion in Vodafone because everybody understands it is core to who we are.  It is part of being a purpose-based organisation.</p></speech>

We have employed a dedicated project lead specifically to deal with a service offering.  We consult on policies.  We also have model policies that build on the collaborative work we have done with Vodafone and in initiatives in the UK, such as the employer's initiative on domestic abuse.  Through my discussions with senior people in a wide range of companies I found that over the course of the Covid pandemic, several things became more visible.  One is that when people were working at home employers started to see their employees being interfered with, where somebody was persistently disrupting them by doing things like plugging out the Wi-Fi.  In some cases it made it visible that their home was not a good workplace but neither was it a good home life.  While there are no deep data on the reasons that employee assistance programmes have been taken up in recent years, domestic violence does feature as something for which employees have sought support.  These are people in work who are seeking the therapeutic aspect of an employee assistance programme.  However, it does not give them options in the context of their workplace.</p> <p>  I very much echo what Ms Mernagh and Ms Mulqueen have said.  There is a normative impact of any legislation.  There are those who will just do it anyway and there are also those who will say it is something the State is taking seriously but is being pragmatic about and is situating it as a practical resource and support in the same way as other workplace entitlement and initiatives.  Employers will follow.  Some who never thought of it before will say it makes sense.  Others will not be as eager.  Once there is legislative statutory leave, employers must then create a policy for it to sit within.  This also speaks to the discussion on confidentiality.  We know it is exceptionally difficult for a survivor of any kind of abuse, such as childhood abuse, to be the one who has to offer it up.  Ms Graham spoke about it.  If people do not know what the reaction will be and what the response will be, they will not say something.  If they have an employer who circulates, even in a desultory manner, a new policy on the leave and it states people are guaranteed confidentiality it is a commitment from an employer, however enthusiastic or not, that will give an assurance.  All of these things lock together.</p></speech>

It will be those with fewer than ten employees.  As it is, they struggle with having proper policies in place with regard to employee handbooks and existing leave.  This will be the big challenge.  There seems to be good buy-in from bigger multinationals doing the right thing and taking the lead from Vodafone.  The small companies will be the big challenge for sure.</p></speech>

Sometimes in these situations employers do not realise some of their obligations.  Potentially this could be an issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Mulholland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022042600002#J00800"><p>Prior to Covid, I attended a meeting of employers.  There is a HR company that looks after smaller employers and we were attending meetings for updates.  I was shocked at the number of employers who did not know they were supposed to give their employees contracts.  Where do we start if employees do not even have contracts of employment?  This is what we are working with.  This is the level.  I do not think it is out of vindictiveness.</p><p>It is just a lack of knowledge and a lack of confidence about being an employer or a lack of training around being an employer.  A person sets up a small business for something that he or she is passionate about, people come to help out and are paid a wage, and the person thinks that is the end of the obligation to the workers, when actually it is so much more than that.  I often believe that domestic violence services are a bit like trade unions in that people only come looking for us when they need us.  I have often felt there is a similarity between the two types of agencies.  This is an interesting one because here we are: we need trade unions and we need domestic violence services on this one.  This is what makes the Bill so potent; it is because it is looking at the life force of all businesses, which is the workers.  It is about protecting those workers.  How long have we fought to get women into employment?  I note Vodafone has 52% of women in leadership.  I took that down.  The Bill protects all of the small gains that we have made and makes it more possible in the future for women to stay in employment.  That has got to be a plus.  </p></speech>

Ms Mulqueen said that after one year of training, someone left an abusive relationship.  It is very important, even today, to have the discussion, to talk about it, to raise awareness and for people to identify with this.  If there is no physical violence but there is abuse, people do not always see that they are in this situation and they can often be the very last person to see it.  It was a good point to make and it is good to hear that people are seeing and identifying with that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the rural aspect and this was excellent.  As Deputy Cairns has said, and as Deputy Murnane O'Connor will also know, it is often the case that in a rural constituency transport is an issue in respect of how a person gets to all of these services, and this is before you even factor in childcare or anything else.  We all know - and it is nearly all women in the room - that for a woman to have her own power, she needs to be able to earn her own money.  I remember a teacher who taught civics, which I believe has changed now to civic, social and political education, CSPE.   I went to an all-girl secondary school and this teacher was always adamant about it and always said to us to keep our foot in the door somewhere, even if we were only part-time.  She said that we had to have our own financial independence.  This may have come from something that happened in her own life but it always stayed with me for the whole of my life.  It is so important for us as women to be able to have that financial control.  If you get to a stage where work is getting difficult it is not just about taking time off for appointments, it is also about how you cope and face going into work.  That ten days is vital.  This has been a really good discussion.  Does anyone want to ask anything else or making any additional points? </p></speech>

They will not just legislate, they will commit resources to an awareness-raising campaign.  That does not have to be a break-the-bank thing.  It could also incorporate using Skillnet if one is going to target small companies.  If that does happen, probably centralised in that will be the reminder that this, similar to all other domestic violence services, DVS, is confidential and must be treated as such.  This is just a suggestion for consideration.</p></speech>

My name is Arlene Forster and I am the CEO of the NCCA.  I am joined by two colleagues, Mr. Barry Slattery, deputy CEO, and Ms Evelyn O&rsquo;Connor, acting director.</p> <p>  Appointed by the Minister for Education, the council is a representative structure.  Its remit is to advise the Minister on curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in schools and examinations on subjects that are part of the curriculum.  In carrying out this remit, the council oversaw a review of senior cycle between 2016 and 2020.  The review involved extensive work with schools and high levels of collaboration and engagement with stakeholders.  It culminated in the development of the Senior Cycle Review:</p> <p>Advisory Report which was submitted to the Minister for consideration and published following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on 29 March 2022.</p> <p>  The advisory report records and responds to the range of stakeholders&rsquo; views about how senior cycle could evolve to meet the needs of all young people.  In addition, the report signals the common ground that emerged.  That common ground centres on a renewed vision for this stage of education and on clear purposes and guiding principles for a redeveloped senior cycle.  In this way, the report provides strong foundations for the redevelopment of this stage of education so that it continues to do the following: educate the whole person; helps every student to become more enriched, engaged and competent; serves collective and individual purposes; and helps students to access diverse futures.</p> <p>  The report identifies three key areas for further research and action.  These include: providing more flexible pathways through senior cycle; having a greater mix of subjects and modules, including technical, creative and vocational options; and broadening assessment and reporting arrangements.  The report summarises the themes that emerged in the review and outlines what these might mean in a redeveloped senior cycle.  The three key areas - pathways and flexibility, curriculum components, and assessment, reporting and transitions - link directly to the themes identified by this committee in its exploration of leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>  The report also describes conducive conditions which we need to pay attention to as we move to the next stage of work.  The report concludes with a commitment to continued extensive consultation and collaboration with schools and all education partners as the senior cycle is redeveloped and as a framework for senior cycle is co-constructed.  The council looks forward to a briefing with Department of Education officials in the coming weeks as it plans a programme of work grounded in the advisory report and the Minister&rsquo;s announcement.</p> <p>  Moving briefly to the Irish language, as part of ongoing work on senior cycle, the NCCA developed draft leaving certificate specifications for Irish L1 and L2.  Work is advanced on the analysis of the consultation data and findings will be presented in a report later this year.  In addition, a report on the early enactment review of junior cycle Irish will be published.  These reports, along with the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement, will provide a basis for the next steps in this important work.</p> <p>  Further information is provided in the NCCA&rsquo;s written submission and accompanying reports.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer questions members may have.</p></speech>

My name is Andrea Feeney and I am the chief executive officer of the State Examinations Commission, SEC.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Elaine Sheridan, head of examinations and assessment, and Mr. Richard Dolan, director of operations.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities include the development, assessment, accreditation and certification of the second level school examinations and the board of commissioners are the custodians of this key national service.  The SEC is committed to working in partnership with all education stakeholders to develop and deliver a high-quality examinations and assessment system, centred on the needs of students.</p> <p>  Our appearance before the committee follows the recent announcement by the Minister and the publication by the NCCA of its report on the review of senior cycle.  We commend our NCCA colleagues for their extensive work and recognise the deep and meaningful contribution of stakeholders, many of whom have already appeared before this committee, in the review and consultation process.</p> <p>  The stated purpose of the leaving certificate is to measure the extent to which each student has fulfilled the objectives of the syllabus.</p><p>This examination is an important event in the lives of young people.  In conducting the examinations, the SEC prioritises fairness and equity, quality in all aspects and upholding examinations integrity and consistency of standards to the greatest degree possible.  </p><p> It is also noted that the leaving certificate results are used for a number of other purposes, including by employers and as a tool of progression to further education.  The latter, in particular, increases the high-stakes nature of the leaving certificate.</p><p> In advance of this appearance, the SEC made a submission under the four broad thematic headings identified by the committee.  I will now focus briefly on three of those headings.</p><p> We have set out in our submission the wide range of components that we provide that extend the assessment landscape far beyond the written examinations and allow students to demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and skills in areas that cannot always be assessed in a written examination.  Of the 41 subjects being examined at leaving certificate level in 2022, 27 have a component of assessment additional to the written examination worth at least 20%, and in some subjects, up to 60% of the marks.</p><p> We look forward to building on this experience in the reform of the senior cycle.  We will work with the NCCA, Department colleagues and through the implementation structures to give effect to the changes announced, including reducing the reliance on the final written examination.  We also will engage in a programme of research and development on a number of aspects, including the impact of weighting and timing of these additional components in order that they are worth at least 40% in all subjects.  We also will implement interim measures to spread the load of assessment pending full subject redevelopment.  High-stakes examinations are, by their nature, inherently stressful events.  Therefore, care will be required in spreading the load of assessment to mitigate the potential for stress throughout the school year.  We also have been asked to jointly research with the NCCA externally moderated school-based assessment and how it will operate in an Irish context, noting that such assessment models are widely used in other jurisdictions.</p><p> On digital learning, the SEC has invested in a number of key IT tools to streamline communications, enhance transparency and improve the delivery of examinations.  Coursework components in some leaving certificate subjects are completed digitally by students, and technology also has a very significant role for students with special educational needs, allowing them to access the examinations.  However, the deployment of technology in assessment, rather than supporting assessment, is at an early stage at second level education in Ireland.  It is recognised by the OECD that the development of digitally-based examinations is resource intensive and expensive, and often beyond the reach of national examinations boards.  We welcome the inclusion in the announcement of exploration of the potential uses of IT in examinations and assessment, as well as the recognition that this must be tied into the digital strategy for schools.</p><p> Accessibility in the examinations starts at design stage and we design our test instruments to be as accessible to the widest range of students as possible. Through the reasonable accommodations at certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, we provide students with special needs with the support arrangements they need to access the examinations.  Much work has been done by the board of the SEC to reform the scheme in recent years.  The scheme will be subject to further review in the context of senior cycle reform and a priority will be increasing the use of assistive technology to enhance access and to further support independent learning.  </p><p> The recent announcement by the Minister for Education sets the trajectory for an ambitious programme of senior cycle reform.  The review process demonstrated consensus on the need for change.  It also recognised the high level of public support and trust attached to the existing leaving certificate qualification and modes of assessment.  In undertaking further work, there will be particular focus by the SEC in seeking to underpin validity and reliability in the assessment in order that the integrity of the leaving certificate qualification and public trust and confidence in that qualification are maintained.</p><p> The examinations system relies upon the support of teachers, school leaders and other stakeholders for its success.  We welcome and value the contribution of the student and parent voice in what we do and how we do it and we wish to strengthen and deepen our relationships in our ongoing work and as we embark on the process of reform.</p><p> We look forward to working with colleagues in the NCCA, with the Minister and officials in her Department and with all of the stakeholders in education in the time ahead, contributing to the necessary reform of the educational landscape at senior cycle to the benefit of students and wider society</p><p> My colleagues and I would be very happy to respond to any questions that the committee may have.  I apologise for going over time.</p></speech>

This is probably the first time since some of the Covid restrictions were lifted that these two organisations are before the committee.  I wish to acknowledge that even though issues around the examinations and so on were much debated, both organisations worked under extreme pressure during the Covid pandemic.  I acknowledge the work that went in at that stage.</p><p> I will briefly touch on the issue of the Irish language and the Teanga 1, T1, and Teanga 2, T2, specifications.  I do not require a response because I know that response will be that there is to be a consultation, we are going to work through that and that is all okay.  I want to put the following point on record, as I did in my written submission.  There is a logic to two separate approaches but students need to be incentivised in the form of additional marks or offering this as an additional subject.  I find it difficult to understand why fluent Irish speakers or Gaeltacht students would take on a more challenging course without gaining some benefit.</p><p> More generally in terms of the leaving certificate, Ms Feeney talked about a consensus nearly emerging.  I would not say that there is a complete consensus but there was a broad consensus and members of this committee found that as well in our discussions on the leaving certificate.  A lot of the issues and concerns that existed related to whether the leaving certificate measures the skills that are needed in a modern society and whether the amount of stress that is put on the final terminal exam is disproportionate.  The move towards greater continuous assessment is something that I and a lot of the committee members would welcome.</p><p> What was outlined by the Minister for Education was necessarily broad, vague and to a large extent unclear.  I do not say that as a criticism because one must start these processes with a high-level vision but a lot of questions must be worked out and I wish to put two to both organisations.  The term "continuous assessment" can mean any number of things.  During the past week the teachers' unions have vocally expressed their concerns about marking the work of their own students.  Obviously there are arguments for and against but continuous assessment does not necessarily mean teachers must mark their own students' work.  Can the representatives of both organisations comment on the extent to which non-teacher-assessed continuous assessment is possible?  Are additional components required?  The example that has been given is the subject of chemistry.  One could have a practical exam and there are practical exams as distinct from projects in, for example, construction studies.  Perhaps there could be short papers at an earlier stage.  To what extent is this possible?  To what extent are there areas that cannot be delivered externally and independently, and require the input of the teacher who knows his or her students?  These issues comprise a lot of what we must work out.</p><p> There is another issue that is not immediately clear but perhaps it is and just was not clear to me.  We are talking about taking an English paper and an Irish paper in fifth year.  To me, the Minister does not seem to have precluded additional marks in other subjects being required in fifth year.  There are no details on whether that will be possible and I ask the representatives of the NCCA for their view.</p><p> My next query is for both organisations.  If we are going down the route of more additional components as part of the 40%, whether that is in terms of the example I have given of chemistry or of other subjects, schools will require a significant investment in equipment.  I have already mentioned construction studies and the equipment that schools have for that is not fit for purpose.  I mean that the equipment does not support schools in ensuring that students can get the benefit of studying these subjects.</p><p> My final question is for the SEC.  There is a proposal that network schools will lead the way in the roll-out of this scheme.  I imagine the challenges are far from insurmountable but it will be somewhat challenging in terms of the allocation of third level places.  Where there are two different streams of examination in those given years, has the SEC thoughts on how that can be surmounted? </p></speech>

I will begin to pick up on them and then my colleagues, Mr. Slattery and Ms O'Connor, may like to come in as well.</p> <p>  To take the comments as a whole, the Deputy has touched on a lot of both the strengths and challenges that were identified through the senior cycle review in terms of assessment, in particular.  Obviously, assessment is one of the three main areas that were identified in the review.</p><p>There is an acknowledgement in the advisory report - the Minister picked up on this - of the need and importance of additional research and of working closely with schools and the education partners in terms of examining the details of what updated assessment arrangements might look like.</p><p> Regarding teacher assessment and whether other forms of assessment could fulfil that role, one of the findings of the senior cycle review &ndash; it is clearly set out in the advisory report &ndash; was the importance of looking at broadening the range of assessment approaches and methods.  One of the key reasons for doing this is to assess a much broader range of the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions that we deem important for our young people and, in doing so, reduce the emphasis on the written examination.  Internationally, different systems put different assessment arrangements in place, but there are common characteristics across many jurisdictions.  One of those is a move towards teacher-based assessment.  One of the rationales used in many jurisdictions that introduced teacher assessment was the emphasis on greater validity, or in other words, putting assessment arrangements in place that can better capture the range of learning and experiences that we deem important for our young people and, in doing so, give young people opportunities to demonstrate their learning in different ways.</p><p> A point that is often made by authorities in the assessment field &ndash; the committee has met some of them during its deliberations in recent months &ndash; is that it is important that, when broadening assessment arrangements, the additional assessment components that are introduced do not necessarily emphasise the paper and pencil format.  They need to look to other methodologies.  The Deputy asked about practicals for a young person to demonstrate particular skills or techniques in a discipline.  That is one of the reasons that teacher assessment is sometimes used in other jurisdictions, in that it opens up different methods and forms of assessment.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, though, the details of all of this need to be worked out.  We need to draw on research and work with schools to see what is manageable and feasible and what supports need to be put in place to enable this approach in our school system.</p></speech>

There was nothing in the announcement to suggest that it would be happening in the short term, but it would be subject specific and subject to further research.  There is nothing to rule it in or out, but the impact of the assessments' timing would be subject specific, by which I mean it would depend on the knowledge and skills that were being assessed and the extent to which they would be developed in the first year of study.</p></speech>

We have previous experience of this.  Within Project Maths when maths was introduced at senior cycle, it was done in that way.  It was rolled out to network schools initially and then into all schools.  In that example, the subject was the same.  We have recently been using network schools for new subjects like physical education and computer science and will do the same with climate action and drama, film and theatre studies.  We have experience of both &ndash; for an existing subject, as in the case of Project Maths, and for new subjects like physical education and computer science.</p></speech>

When officials from the Department of Education appeared before us a number of months ago, I asked them what the main difference was between the time I did the leaving certificate in 1994 and the leaving certificate now.  The suggestion from the Department was that it was not different in any radical way.  At its inception, the leaving certificate was a qualification with which one went into the world.  Now, it is a qualification with which one goes on to the next stage of education.  There is a different dynamic that goes with it now.</p><p>Indeed, when we were trying to reform the junior certificate we had that same kind of view that young people do not go into the world with their junior certificates as they might have done with their intermediate certificates back in the day.  This is the question I really have for the witnesses.  We are trying to reform something that everybody or most people accept needs to be radically reformed.  There is a level trust with the leaving certificate, however, and we must be careful about how we tinker with that.  People feel that it is transparent; I would not use the word "fair".  It is incredibly brutal.</p><p> We have come to the stage now where people who do it successfully become good at doing leaving certificates.  There is an industry built around it.  We must be honest about that.  There are grind schools and people who are willing to sell notes.  There is a whole industry built around getting one's child or a young person through this system.  Parents are able to buy or use those extra resources.  There is, therefore, fundamentally an inequality at the heart of the leaving certificate.</p><p> Not every school is the same and not every school can offer the same options.  Not every school can offer higher level Irish, English and mathematics and basic core subjects such as those.  How do we come to a scenario, therefore, where if we are going to assess people, we are assessing them fairly?  How do we ensure that every student has the opportunity to study whatever subject he or she feels best fits his or her skill set and can study it at whatever level he or she feels they can?  How unfair is it to have a second-level school that does not offer honours or higher level Irish thereby restricting that young person from ever being a primary school teacher, for example?  Those schools exist.  I remember once being a secondary school substitute teacher.  I came across a young woman who was teaching herself higher level mathematics in a room by herself because there was no higher level maths teacher in the school.  The level of determination that young woman went through to do and study that is unthinkable in a more middle-class advantaged scenario.</p><p> This is my general point.  What kind of discussion is going on as to how to level out that inequality to ensure that every student, no matter what school he or she goes to, can through remote learning or any other way avail of every single possibility or level of subjects he or she can?  Yes, we may have a transparent leaving certificate but it does not have the brutality and inequality attached to it.</p><p> I will touch on when Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and I attended the teacher conferences.  There was a sense of resistance to this idea of assessing one's own students from the conferences we attended.  If we are going to reform then we must reform.  I cannot pretend that the teacher unions have ever been friends of reform when it comes to examination structures in Ireland.  I bear the wounds of the junior certificate reform process in that regard.  We have to bring people with us whatever our opinions.  They are my two main points.  How do we make it fairer than just being transparent?  How do we bring people with us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Andrea Feeney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#G00200"><p>I cannot address the broader system issue in relation to the level of advantage that various schools have but I can address it from the examinations perspective and what the SEC does to recognise that inequity is there.  When we are assessing examinations we are looking at issues of fairness, particularly when it comes to the second and third components of assessment.  Within subjects that have a coursework element, therefore, be it a portfolio, an oral or aural examination or a project or artefact that a student has to make, there are particular conditions attached to how he or she undertakes that work.  It must be in school and under the supervision of the teacher.  We very much recognise that if those conditions are not there, it presents opportunities for students who are more advantaged outside of the school to use and have more resources at their disposal than others who come from less privileged backgrounds.</p> <p>  I remember the early days of Covid-19 when we were looking at the arrangements we could put in place for students outside school to be able to complete their work in the various subjects.  This was before the decision was taken to cancel the examinations that year.  That was a real cause of concern for the State Examinations Commission.  If we did not have those conditions of authentication and completion, then we were allowing the opportunity of the level of resource that students had to be brought to bear in the examination context.</p><p>I do not claim it is a perfect system; if it was a perfect system, we might not be here having the conversation about reform but the SEC does recognise there is a need to try to level the playing pitch.  We do that within the examinations context by having very strong authentication procedures, that is, procedures for the integrity of the process.  It does not address the broader question but within the senior cycle reform process, those issues have been brought to bear.  A broader piece of work about which colleagues in the Department are exercised is how to address disadvantage within schools but that is not within my remit in discussing this issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy touched on something that was a very prominent theme throughout the review of the senior cycle, which focused on how can a redeveloped senior cycle support all students more equitably?  That is very much echoed in the three main areas I drew attention to in our opening statement.  Of those three areas, I draw particular attention to the area of pathways and flexibility.  That was identified as being one of the key levers in ensuring that a redeveloped senior cycle would much better meet the needs of all young people who enter into the senior cycle stage of their education and by that opening up of different pathways and routes through senior cycle.  For example, one action we identified coming out of the review was the importance of having much greater choice for young people in the type of programme they would experience as part of the senior cycle.  Part of that would include auditing current provision across our programmes with an eye to finding ways to provide greater opportunity for young people in technical and professional learning and learning in the creative area.  That is with a view to leaving young people in a much better position to transition into whatever path they choose to follow, whether that is straight into apprenticeships, further or higher education or directly into the world of work.</p> <p>  Another area that the advisory report highlights holds great potential for the Deputy's question about access for young people to the range of subjects that even currently makes up the senior cycle.  It is about exploring the power of technology and the possibility perhaps of a combination of online learning but also of blended learning.  We have some experience in our system that we can draw on.  For instance, island schools have some provision for people to access some of the science subjects by using technology.  Consequently, we have small amounts of experience that we can draw on.  In the advisory report, we flag up the potential of technology to really contribute to access and in particular to ensure that students can be supported more equitably.  </p> <p>  Working directly with schools is important.  In the advisory report, we really emphasised our clear commitment to continuing to working very closely with schools in all of the work in the redevelopment of the senior cycle.  When we talk about more flexibility and choice and different pathways through the senior cycle, it will be really important that we work closely with schools to look in real terms at what works, what are the challenges and how we work around them.  We have committed to do that.  One of the ambitions has the area of equity particularly in mind.  There is lots of potential there but we have a lot of work still to do to work out the detail.  We see a number of those areas as offering huge potential to address equity.</p></speech>

My first question is for Ms Forster.  The committee's purpose is to produce a report that will outline what we recommend as senior cycle reform, taking into account the expert evidence that we hear.  In doing that we need to have an accurate assessment of the benefits of the leaving certificate as it is at present.  Briefly, what are the benefits of the leaving certificate as it exists at present?  A lot of the time, we talk necessarily negatively about it.</p></speech>

Many strengths were identified through the review, including the range of subjects and modules that are already in existence and the opportunities they present to young people, as well as the range of assessment approaches and methods in particular during transition year, the leaving certificate applied, and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  There is rich practice in those programmes.  Some of the other strengths referenced were the addition in more recent years of additional assessment components and the opportunities those present to young people to demonstrate a greater range of learning.</p><p> Transition year received huge positivity and support throughout the review.  What was highlighted in particular were the unique opportunities transition year opens up for young people's learning without the pressure of a State exam.  The school-based dimension of transition year was highlighted again and again.</p><p>Many strengths were identified, but I will call on Ms O'Connor and Mr. Slattery if there were additional strengths they may want to highlight.</p></speech>

That brings me to the point about the high retention rate we have.  It is something we probably take for granted but when people from outside the country look at our data, they always ask how we manage to keep so many young people in education.</p></speech>

Some of them have suggested that we should try to decouple the leaving certificate and the points race from admission to third level institutions.  Does Ms. Feeney think the committee should consider this or does she think it would be potentially dangerous?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.291" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Andrea Feeney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#J00600"><p>Before responding to the notion that it is just about progression, I appreciate that the leaving certificate is used for higher education, but from our perspective, it is a measure of attainment and we value the performance of all students regardless of what they want to do next.  They are treated the same way within the process.  We have been asked over time to translate the results when they come out into points and we have refused to do that because we do not want it to be seen as the tool of progression to higher education.  We recognise that students use it for apprenticeships, to go on to work, and for further education.  The uses are valued regardless of what the student wants to do next.</p> <p>  In terms of the decoupling, there was matriculation back in the day.  We talk about the stress and pressure on students currently so I wonder, in the decoupling space, what are we talking about replacing it with?  If there were to be another type of examination or assessment that students had to do in order to progress, that would exacerbate the stress and pressure on those students.  Therefore, we need to be careful about what we replace it with.  There are jurisdictions that have slightly similar systems to us.  The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, is looking at reviewing its system and trying to even out some of the inequities.  I am not sure that there is a perfect system.  We would need to be very careful in this particular area.  I appreciate and acknowledge that it creates stress on students, but who is to say that what we replace it with would not equally do that.</p></speech>

If one looks to the United States or other jurisdictions, when it comes to admission to third level institutions, each institution can formulate its own admission practices.</p></speech>

There is a fairness associated with the leaving certificate that is certainly valued.  Going back to the strengths, the review process recognised the public trust and confidence in the fairness and integrity of the process.</p></speech>

The term "rote learning" is bandied around, as is "teaching to the test", but we have some evidence that demonstrates the leaving certificate, in certain subjects in particular, is excellent at assessing higher order skills such as creativity, that is, 21st century skills.  Oxford University published the research to that effect at that time.</p></speech>

That was particularly true in the case of any of the less content-based specifications that were introduced in the mid-2000s.  As a result of those specifications, the exams aim to analyse, assess and reward critical thinking.  Even in the likes of English, a subject the Deputy mentioned, the predictability report suggested, having reviewed the papers, scripts and marking scheme, that candidates were being rewarded for higher order thinking and not for producing stock answers.  To a certain extent, there is a sense this is the case.  Our marking schemes are set out in such a way that marks are awarded for originality.  The approach to marking in various subjects ensures marks are set aside for creative and original answers.  That has been addressed through new specifications, and working closely with the NCCA on the design and development of new specifications has ensured rote learning approach is no longer really an issue.</p></speech>

We talk about the stress the leaving certificate puts on students, and we all have to play a role in that - not just the political system and Irish culture but also the media.

I am sure it is not the only source of pressure but it certainly contributes to it.  Moreover, it tends to be parents who read the coverage.

I agree with Ms Feeney that we need to be very careful about the CAO system and what could replace it because there could be nasty unintended consequences.  Nevertheless, we heard throughout the review that whatever redevelopments in the senior cycle are to take place, in parallel with diversifying pathways, introducing new curriculum components and broadening the assessment arrangements, we will also need to consider the transition arrangements, in particular for students progressing from post-primary to higher education.</p><p>All of us have a role to play in all of our discussions.  Even today, the emphasis is very much on talking about equity, meaning equity of access to higher education.  There are so many other issues relating to equity.  This is not a critisicism of anybody here but what was never mentioned was there are students in junior cycle who are following level 1 and level 2 learning programmes.  They do not even have access to a senior cycle programme, as we speak.  One of the things we are going to prioritise in the review is developing a follow-on programme for students who are currently following level 1 and level 2.  In all of our discourse it needs to be about more than progression to higher education and looking at diversifying pathways as well.</p></speech>

In other jurisdictions they have, for different reasons.  I am familiar with one jurisdiction where it was decoupled but it was not a deliberate decision.  It was universally decided they were going to go with their own admissions policy and they developed a kind of matriculation examination.  The obvious consequence of it was increased stress because students were now focused on studying two curriculums.  I did not hear the most recent update on it but they were finding the in-school curriculum, that is, the national curriculum, was getting less attention because the stakes were all about progression to university so students were focusing on the curriculum for matriculation.</p></speech>

It is easy to gloss over it but people were very clear.  The teachers, students and parents took issue with this funnel, this narrowing and this singular perspective.  When we worked with them, heard their voices and worked with a range of schools they were saying these are people and we want to develop the whole person; we want to help them to be more enriched by and engaged in their learning; we want them to be able to access whatever future they see for themselves; and we want to support them to see many options, not just one track; and that education serves collective and not just individual purposes.  That was great to see because people in our education system are clear-sighted about what they would like to see improved.  It is a great starting point to have an agreed purpose and vision of where we go from here.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, something has developed that is not allowing that vision to manifest itself.  It is just seen as a hierarchical system where the successful ones are at the top of the points level.  It is not viewed in terms of achievement and broadening the educational attainment of a student <i>per se</i>, outside the points setting.</p><p>Since the Chairman is not stopping me - it is very dangerous for a politician to have a lot of time - I will turn to Ms Feeney.  I welcome that there is a proposal that in respect of languages we are going to have a greater focus on the oral examination.  I think there is to be further emphasis on it.  Both bodies have done a good job amid the difficulties Covid has caused for us all but I am conscious that during the Irish oral examinations over Easter we had 50,000 students and the vast majority of them were able to do their orals.  However, there was a segment of 500 who were not.  I am aware both bodies fully appreciate that is a very stressful event for those students but if it was the case that, for example, a written exam was to be postponed for a month, there would be national outrage about it.</p><p>This is not a criticism of the SEC by the way.  What can we do in the future to ensure that if there is some difficulty in conducting oral examinations they can be conducted fairly rapidly after that difficulty?  The students have prepared themselves heavily in advance of the examinations.  Many parents and students in my constituency were affected by it and contacted me.</p></speech>

That was done because of Covid and as a response to the level of disruption and interruption students had already faced in their learning this year.  What happens when the oral examinations are on in a normal year is that the students' teachers are away.  If their teachers are engaging in the orals in other schools, they are away from their sixth year classes.  This can be challenging and difficult for the teachers and students involved.  The decision was taken this year to move the oral examinations to the Easter holidays in order to mitigate any potential for further disruption to learning.  We had to make sure that we had enough examiners to move it to the Easter holidays and we had to provide for sufficient reserves because of expected attrition due to Covid.  Covid has had an impact on all aspects of society and it impacted on the delivery of these examinations so we ended up with a final total of 600 students in 14 schools who were not able to take their oral examinations at Easter.  We will facilitate those students as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p>  Part of the announcement was that students and teachers would get a break over Easter.  In moving the orals to the first week of the Easter holidays, there was a sense that in the second week they would still have their break so we allowed that break to happen.  We had also notified schools in advance that there would be a period for late orals.  Those late orals are there in a normal year to facilitate students who become ill at examination time.  We set aside that period, commencing on 4 May, for the late orals this year in order to provide for students who became ill and also in the event that we would have to reschedule because of attrition due to Covid.  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to ensure that we had enough examiners to undertake the tests in the initial window, we had attrition due to Covid.  We made every effort to organise the tests for those students who were affected by it and we are arranging them at the earliest possible opportunity, which is that period commencing next week.  There had been a criticism to the effect that we should have had them last week.  The reason I have mentioned in this regard is that the break needed to be there for students.  It has also been suggested that we should have had them this week.  In having the capacity we need, we are also being conscious of not impacting further on teaching and learning times.  As a result, we are using retired examiners and teachers who are not in schools in order to ensure that capacity.  They are not available to us all of the time so by having the date set aside commencing on 4 May, we have capacity in the system to do it.  We provided that date in order to bring a level of certainty.  I appreciate that it is not ideal for the students concerned, but that certainty was there.</p> <p>  The bigger question the Deputy asked was on how we protect ourselves from these interruptions and issues into the future.  Going back to the senior cycle reform process and the interruption of Covid over the past two years, we have seen that if we had a type of assessment system or senior cycle programme where there is more dispersed assessment, it might give us greater capacity to cope with emergency situations as and when they arise.  That is a long answer to the Deputy's short question, but it is important to give the detail.</p></speech>

The objective in the future should be to recognise that if an examination date is given, then students are prepared for that.  If we are trying to ensure that we are cutting down on stress, then that scenario would be stressful for a student.  Sometimes we overinflate other types of stress.  It would, however, be stressful if an examination was due to happen on a particular day and people were then told one or two days before that it is not going to go ahead.  I hear Ms Feeney's answer.  I understand why there would has to be a back-up plan for circumstances where students become ill or if there are bereavements and where they have to take the examinations later.  When it comes to attrition as a result of an examiner not being available, however, we should try to ensure that we can provide for that closer to the time.</p></speech>

We had additional capacity in the system.  Because of Covid, the numbers were further reduced.  Ideally, in another year we would have had the people we needed to be in place.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question was about what will happen in the summer.  The Minister has already announced that alternative examinations and a deferred examination series are happening after the main set of examinations for students who are bereaved or become seriously ill or to cover circumstances that arise due to Covid.  Again, this will be based on public health advice.  We are working through the development of that scheme.</p></speech>

It is the politicians who get it in the neck because of the cancellations.  We are the first people to whom others come to complain.  It is extremely pressurising for the families affected.  I accept the answer that was given but I do not accept the explanation because the cancellation should have been flagged at least a week in advance and not the day before.  It was disappointing for any student affected.  The past two years have been upsetting for students.  Students have come before this committee to talk about the effects the pandemic has had on them.  The effects were enormous on them and their tuition.  It was upsetting and distressing for the students and their families to receive a message the day before their oral examinations were scheduled to tell them the examinations were to be postponed until a later date.  I want to mark that.  I do not need our guests to go over that again but I want to put that point on the record.  I said I would raise that issue with our guests.  Perhaps in future more thought will be put into considering the effects on students.</p> <p>  I believe our national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, other national radio outlets and our print media are reckless in some of their coverage coming up to the leaving certificate examinations.  I did my leaving certificate in 1992 and I was not involved in the points system.  All I wanted was to go to agricultural college and I was able to achieve that.  Most of our guests did their leaving certificates in the 1990s or earlier.  There is considerable stress for students who are involved in the points system now.  I have three kids and I am dreading the two years approaching the leaving certificate because of the points race.  There is a notion that one is not sexy anymore if one is not going to third level institutions.  Colleges are not good enough anymore; one must attend university, with the points race that involves.  Apprenticeships and everything else have been forgotten about.  I must commend the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his work to encourage students to undertake apprenticeships and the associated CAO system.  </p> <p>  I know some of our guests have mentioned a moratorium of the sort that applies for elections whereby the media are not allowed to cover an election for the preceding 24 hours.  Students are receiving one message from their teachers and are often receiving another message from their parents.  The messages from the media come in on top of that.  Not alone are the media driving the students mad, they are also driving the parents mad.  Those parents in turn go on to drive the students mad.  I am glad our guests have said they would like something done about it.  What can be done?  It is not their job to make that decision but I presume they have discussed the issue.  I have no doubt the issue came up as part of the review.  I am interested in hearing the views of the representatives of both organisations on this matter and what they would like politicians to do.  Is there something the politicians can do?  Have our guests spoken to our national broadcaster about the matter?  RT&Eacute; is getting taxpayers' money and is acting irresponsibly in some of its coverage.  I am interested in our guests' views and whether they have had any conversation with the media on the issue.</p></speech>

One of the other things that struck me as the Chairman was sharing his comments and questions was the value we place on the different programmes that currently make up senior cycle provision.</p><p>This theme emerged in the review itself.  Review participants spoke about the real challenge in terms of achieving parity of esteem regarding the programmes we already have.  In particular, they referenced the leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme.  As we know, 95% of young people take the leaving certificate established.  The Chairman has already touched on the extent to which we see that in terms of a pathway or an entry into higher education and university.  I believe some of it is about the values that we hold as a society.  They are hard to challenge but we need to find a way to challenge them.  From the NCCA's perspective, the senior cycle review advisory report sets out and really highlights the importance of looking at more pathways for young people and as part of that, of working as best we can to value those different pathways in order that young people see them as viable options, are given the space to think hard about what is the pathway and route they want to follow and what are their own career ambitions and aspirations.  There is an absolute commitment in our review report for the redevelopment of the senior cycle to really open up those discussions and get into detailed work with schools about trying to build more flexibility and pathways into senior cycle provision itself.</p><p> I want to pick up on something else that is relevant to the points the Chairman has made and on which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan touched a little while ago.  I refer to the relationship between the leaving certificate, in particular leaving certificate results, and the CAO system.  Ms Feeney has spoken about this and on the question about decoupling and the challenges that can raise as well.  Interestingly, in the review of the senior cycle, because as one would expect, this was part of the discussions, there was a resignation, albeit a reluctant one by some participants in the review, that such decoupling would raise its own set of difficulties and challenges.  There was also an acceptance that as we redevelop the senior cycle, that relationship will need to continue to exist to some extent.  However, as the senior cycle review advisory report emphasises the importance of a review of the CAO system and of the CAO system taking account of a redeveloped senior cycle, therein might lie some potential for trying to engender and encourage a value of the different pathways that a young person could follow as part of a redeveloped senior cycle.</p><p> On the specific question on whether we have had direct engagement with the national broadcaster and media on the coverage, in particular in the June period, we have not had direct engagement to date.  Certainly the piece that he referenced about the intense focus on the coverage in the media in the June examination period, did feature as part of our discussions but to date, we have not had follow-up directly with the broadcaster on that.</p></speech>

I ask because such an exchange might help them.  The media and the national broadcaster looks at listenership figures.  They are interested but they do not look at the pressure cooker atmosphere that is in the homes of the students and parents.  I have no doubt that the pressure cooker atmosphere was part of the review and conversation that the NCCA had in the review.</p></speech>

However, over the past two years, there has been no coverage of high achievers in August.  In 2020 and 2021, there were no photographs on the front pages saying this is the student who got nine or eight A1s.  It did not happen in either of the past two years.  That is a change, because prior to that, it was part of the firmament that in August, there would be a picture of the students who got the highest results in the country.  That has not happened in the past two years.  It is healthy-----</p></speech>

As the senior cycle changes over time, the media interest will change as well.  As we stop having this final examination event at the end on which a lot &ndash; not everything &ndash; is hinged, the dynamic will change because there will not be that kind of pinpoint event during the year that we can point to and say it is all happening now.  This is because over time, much of it will have happened in advance of that.  Some changes have happened already and we hope to see more change as the senior cycle reform rolls out.</p></speech>

Part of that is the national coverage of all of this and the points system as well.  There have been so many different issues.</p> <p>  Before calling on Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly, I note several stakeholders have expressed serious concerns regarding the lack of specifications in the revised curriculum.  Does the NCCA have plans to review the new syllabi and to include more specifications to ensure all students are taught equally to the highest professional standards?</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the curriculum agency in Belgium have found themselves subject to a legal challenge in their constitutional courts.  The basis of it is that there is over-prescription of learning outcomes and it negates the Belgian educators&rsquo; rights to curriculum freedom.  At the same meeting, colleagues from the Netherlands expressed the dilemma that they were in, which is a reverse issue - albeit not necessarily a legal one - where they are coming under increasing pressure to address the learning outcomes that are regarded as too broad.  There are different perspectives.  It is fair to say that different people understand curriculum in different ways.  Some see it as an official text that will be faithfully implemented and received in schools and prefer a very highly prescriptive curriculum, whereas others see it is as something that is more dynamic and prefer a more, let us say, permissive curriculum that has less emphasis on specifying every single piece of content and more attention on the development of skills, for example.  I will not come down on the side of either perspective but the irony is that both perspectives are premised on the same assumption, namely, the national curriculum, be it a permissive or prescriptive curriculum, will be implemented in schools exactly as intended.  However, the reality is that teachers are not passive conduits who deliver somebody else&rsquo;s curriculum.  They will be translating and mediating the curriculum within their own context to meet the needs and interests of their students.  Both perspectives underplay the complexities of this reality of the social practice of curriculum and the curriculum-making that happens in schools.</p> <p>  I will get to the answer now with two points.</p><p>The strength of the network-based school approach to the redevelopment of the senior cycle is that it will give us the opportunity to work with teachers in a way that will allow us to look at the exact nature and form of the curriculum, the resources, the supports, the professional development and the professional time that is required for teachers to work with the curriculum in the best possible way to deliver the best possible outcomes for their students.  Absolutely, we intend to conduct additional research and consult with teachers on those issues even before we engage with schools.  I wish it was as simple as conducting research that says this is exactly the way it should be and that it would solve all problems.  We have seen this issue in other jurisdictions.  That issue came up only as recently as yesterday, but I have been hearing about the same issues in other jurisdictions for more than ten years.</p></speech>

As we all know, any formal exam is stressful.  We all think that continuous assessment will be the be-all and end-all.  I personally am very supportive of it but other people who have appeared before the committee may not be as in favour of continuous assessment.  They have said it will still be a very stressful time for students and that the term "continuous assessment" has negative connotations.  Do the NCCA and the SEC plan to address this issue?  Would modularisation, whereby several assignments are completed in the school for each subject with a wide range of topics, be a better option?  Would it better prepare students for further and higher education and, indeed, the workplace?  As the witnesses know, further and higher education now have gone towards the continuous assessment format.  In other words, would it give them better skills for what they will do in future?</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor spoke earlier about the consensus that we arrived at around the purpose of a redeveloped senior cycle.  Working on from that, as we get into the individual subjects, modules or units of learning, the question is what is the contribution of each of those to a young person's overall education.  Once we are clear about the teaching and learning, the onus is on us to design assessment arrangements that are the best fit in terms of giving young people the opportunities to demonstrate that learning as best they can.  Part of it is giving them opportunities to demonstrate learning in a number of different ways.</p> <p>  As for the Chairman's questions on continuous assessment, as Mr. Slattery has mentioned, this is where the work with schools becomes really important because that work enables us to ask many of the practical questions, including some of the questions the Chair has just put to us, around what the benefits might be and, equally, what the real challenges and difficulties might be with the different forms, modes and timing of assessments.  Working closely with schools is a very important part of this.  It is not unique to the assessment piece.  It goes right across the board in terms of what we hope to do through the redevelopment of the senior cycle.</p> <p>  The other piece I would add is the research.  Mr. Slattery mentioned the extent to which we keep our eyes and ears open to international practice and experience.  That research piece will become very important for us.  In the senior cycle review advisory report, we identified a number of pieces of research, some in the assessment space, that will become critical for us as we move into the next stage of the work, which involves getting into more of the detail and nuances of areas such as assessment.</p> <p>  We need to put all those pieces in place to be able to take some of those practical questions and work them out in partnership with schools and education partners.</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that students going into those final exams in those subjects will say that they have banked some marks, so it takes some of the pressure off.  What we need to be careful about, if introducing components of assessments in all subjects, is how we time and schedule them so there is not a constant feeling of stress on students throughout the senior cycle programme.</p><p>I ask my colleague Ms Sheridan to elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#R00200"><p>It is building on what Ms Forster has said.  Again, going back to the recent announcement and the review, it is about doing research.  It is learning from others and seeing what has worked in other jurisdictions and what has not.  For example, the UK is moving back to linear exams and less modularisation.  However, we must remember the assessment load.  There are already pinch points.  Of the 41 leaving certificate subjects, 27 currently have an additional component on top of the written exam, so depending on which subjects you choose for your leaving certificate you may already have extra coursework there.  If you are choosing seven subjects and all of them have an additional component there is a certain amount of load and there are pinch points.  Broadening it and the types and modes of assessment is therefore very important but that is back to the research.  It is back first of all to seeing what happens elsewhere.</p> <p>  Again, agreeing with Ms Forster and NCCA colleagues it is hugely important to look at how this manifests itself in the school environment.  Having been a teacher myself, you look at your own particular subject but you need to be careful as there are 41 subjects and students are taking seven or eight of them.  Much of this is about balancing.  There is no point thinking bringing in these additional components will lighten the load in June if they cause a complete congestion point in October or November of fifth or sixth year.  We must look to see what is done elsewhere and work very closely with the people who are on the ground delivering this to learn what is working for them in the school environment.  That will ensure whatever changes come about are to the benefit of the students at the end of the day and not another form of stress.  That is the key thing.  We do not want to be solving stress by creating stress at different points.</p></speech>

I will let Mr. Slattery come in on the other point.  In the review, did it come through that some students are very much in favour of continuous assessment, prefer it and find it much easier while others would rather have that bank at the very end?  In other words, they would rather have the leaving certificate as it stands.  Do the officials understand the question I am asking?</p></speech>

I do not think there was a consensus on what the alternative should look like but the sense was there is too much of a concentration in the last three weeks, notwithstanding that depending on your subject combination you could have completed 50% or more of the coursework assessment in many of your subjects.  Students were not in favour of one alternative but were certainly against the concentration they felt they were experiencing at the moment.</p> <p>  In addition to learning from other jurisdictions there is also much to learn from the leaving certificate applied programme that currently exists.  It is a credit-based programme where the credits are allocated on the basis of different modules, so it is semesterised as it is broken into four sessions.  Ms Forster mentioned the work with schools.  That has flagged numerous times that one of the main directions for development in a redeveloped senior cycle is diversifying pathways.  We have been asked to look at how we can break down any ring-fencing.  There is also a very loud consensus from the reviews that we need to address the ring-fencing, which relates to many of the other issues we discussed earlier because it has a huge impact on parity of esteem and that has an impact on the uptake of the leaving certificate applied programme itself.  There is much in that programme and as we work to break down the barriers between the various different programmes there is much opportunity there.  It is really exciting.</p></speech>

What way do they pool their resources?  Do they work together in any way?  Would amalgamation streamline the work they do?  I just want a brief comment; I do not want to get into a long conversation on it but I am interested.  It was mentioned in one of our other meetings so I said I would ask.</p></speech>

Currently, it has 25 members across 18 organisations, which nominate to the council.  Our colleagues in the State Examinations Commission, SEC, are part of the council.  Therefore, the SEC is one of those partner organisations.  The council is the decision making structure in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The SEC is part of the discussions and deliberations on all decisions around curriculum and assessment advice that we ultimately share with the Minister for consideration.  In addition, our council is supported by a number of other structures, which are also representative, and we have SEC colleagues as members of all those structures on the post-primary side, supporting all curriculum and assessment work for post-primary schools.  We also have a standing group whereby members of the senior management teams in both organisations meet several times a year.  We work in close collaboration with each other, and for obvious reasons, given the roles and remits of the two organisations.</p></speech>

We work collaboratively with colleagues in the NCCA.  In other jurisdictions the development of curriculum and of examination and assessment is done by a single organisation.  We have a different governing structure, a different statutory function and a different type of board from the NCCA. Notwithstanding that, we work hand in glove with the NCCA.  As its role relates to policy advice and our role relates to implementation, there must be that feedback loop between implementation and policy.  We are involved with the NCCA, not only at council level on the junior cycle and senor cycle boards but also the individual subject development groups.  My colleague, Ms Sheridan, and all her examination and assessment managers, who are subject experts, are involved in the development of specifications and syllabuses for their relevant subjects.  There is a very close working relationship there.</p></speech>

She stated we know the biggest consequence of the flaws of our education system is the impact of the leaving certificate on students&rsquo; well-being, anxiety and stress and oftentimes depression has become a permanent feature in senior cycle students&rsquo; leaving certificate experience.  She also stated we have no choice but to reform our system.  She further stated she believes there is a great opportunity, and still does, to radically reform the assessment process of leaving certificate students.  She had a question for the NCCA.  She asked if a representative could speak to the advisory report where the NCCA notes access and equality.  For instance, she was not sure of the strategies the NCCA is employing to achieve this.  Ms Forster might elaborate on that and on how much consideration has been given to students with learning disabilities even with the proposed changes.  The emphasis of the current system on rote learning for students with learning disabilities had an obvious disadvantage.</p> <p>  Moving on to the SEC, she stated she personally supports the alternative pathways to higher education.  She further stated we know there is a major inequality in the leaving certificate system with those who can afford private and additional support performing better than those from disadvantaged backgrounds who often fall through the cracks.  She asked if, in the representatives' opinion, there is scope to include other pathways to education.  Ms Forster might respond to the Senator's first question.</p></speech>

When we look across the three big priority areas set out in the advisory report, which are trying to achieve greater flexibility in choice in terms of pathways for young people, and focus again on the curriculum components, expanding those and broadening then the assessment arrangements, there is great potential in each of those three areas to better meet the needs of all young people.  We have touched already on a number of the particular strategies within those that hold potential for reducing stress and pressure on young people such as the particular assessment arrangements that are in place, the particular programmes we currently have and removing ultimately the ring-fencing around those programmes but also making better provision for young people in areas such as technical learning, professional learning or creative learning.</p><p> I wish to pick up on an important aspect, namely, that of provision for young people with special educational needs.  This is a matter on which Mr. Slattery touched.  He mentioned that one of the innovations as part of the redevelopment of junior cycle was to develop level 1 and level 2 learning programmes.  They were positively received by students, their families and teachers who work with those young people.  As part of the review, one of the points that has been highlighted time and again is that currently there is no follow-through for those young people.  This is an important piece of work that is needed in order to ensure continuity and a pathway that is appropriate for young people.  As part of the review, attention was drawn to the importance of that work beginning as quickly as possible and that there would be a strong emphasis on it being age, peer and learning-needs appropriate.  That is a significant item of work that needs to be progressed quickly as part of the redevelopment of senior cycle so much so that in the advisory report we noted we were beginning a few particular pieces of work that were important to get off the ground quite quickly.  Across those three big areas and that special educational needs element in particular, there is great potential to address the challenges to which Senator Flynn drew attention.</p></speech>

We dealt with one of them earlier in the engagement with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan on rote learning.  We talked about special educational needs in the context of level 1 and level 2 learning programmes, but in the context of the examinations we provide the reasonable accommodations at certificate examinations scheme, RACE.  We provide that in respect of students who have special educational needs that impact on their ability to communicate what they know and can do to an examiner.  Access arrangements are put in place for these students to allow them to sit the examinations.  The number of students we accommodate under the scheme each year is significant.  Some 17%, or more than 20,000, students taking examinations will access some form of reasonable accommodation.  The range of accommodations we provide are as complex and as extensive as the range of student needs we are trying to accommodate.  It is significant in terms of the support arrangements provided in order that students can access the examinations if they have some form of special need, whether it be physical or a form of a learning difficulty.</p> <p>  We spoke briefly about the pathways with respect to the leaving certificate applied.  One of the challenges within the system is that the leaving certificate applied is not valued.  It is not appreciated.  The leaving certificate applied is a wonderful programme.  We spoke about having a very high rate of retention.  Much of that is down to the leaving certificate applied.  Students who might have left school after the junior cycle in the past will go on and complete their leaving certificate applied and their qualification is as valued as the leaving certificate.  Unfortunately, the leaving certificate applied is not valued in the context of progression and students have more limited opportunities.  They can use it for further education but cannot use it to go to higher education directly.  They can pursue post-leaving courses but they cannot go directly to higher education.  There is a challenge in having that valued.  The debate and discourse on the senior cycle has been extremely helpful in shining a light on the leaving certificate applied programme and what it is doing for a cohort of young people who would have possibly left school without this final qualification were it not for that programme.  We would love there to be more recognition for that programme, the wonderful work leaving certificate applied co-ordinators in schools do and the wonderful engagement by students in that programme, which they bring throughout their two years in the senior cycle programme. Those are the two issues I wanted to raise in addressing Senator Flynn&rsquo;s questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Slattery also spoke about the leaving certificate applied programme.  It is a fantastic programme and is not given the recognition it deserves.  Every student has something to offer.  Students often go through a phase in their life and they could be in their early 20s before they have a light bulb moment and realise they have great potential to offer.  Some of them may or may not have completed the leaving certificate applied.  It is a programme the Department of Education should push more through the secondary schools.</p><p>It is a fantastic programme that has saved an awful lot of lives by retaining people in secondary education who might have gone over the edge for various reasons, such as social or domestic issues.  It is often only when they are in their early 20s that a light is switched on and they realise the potential they have.</p></speech>

It sounds as though they are passionate about the area, which is important.  I am coming from an outside-the-school-system perspective, so the word "curriculum" sets off something in my mind.  It is quite clear we are in the middle of a new revolution.  There was the industrial revolution, there has kind of been a digital revolution and we are now probably going through yet another revolution.  When I was attending school, we had no mobile phones or Internet, yet that technology is now what our world revolves around and we need a new set of skills we never thought we would need.</p> <p>  Are our guests confident we can build in that flexibility, independence of thought and self-belief?  Of course, we need to talk about the curriculum because it is practical, but the word "curriculum" means something different from what it meant in the past.  It is important to highlight that for people at the outset.</p></speech>

We are engaged in research with someone who is examining the area of competencies as the broad, overarching, umbrella term for the person a child becomes as a result not only of his or her wider life but also of his or her experiences within education.  If we can align the experiences young people have in classrooms with the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions we are clear we want our young people to develop during their education, and if we can do so in regard to assessment as well, the answer to the Senator's question will be "Yes".</p></speech>

This is where the question of the linking of the CAO to the leaving certificate arises.  What came through strongly in contributions from previous guests who have appeared before this committee is that that might be why it is something of an issue.  Perhaps we need to lay down a blueprint for how to learn in a way that will bring people through life rather than just assessing the things they learn during their time in school.  What are our guests' thoughts on having more of a mentorship role and a more respectful relationship whereby teachers would be trusted to know what the young people sitting in front of them need and require through working collaboratively?  I am thinking of democratic schooling, for instance, which is not part of the Irish school system but which we have a lot to learn from.  Should there be more of a partnership model?</p></speech>

In the case of well-being and relationships, for example, students' experiences in schools, other educational settings and the wider society contribute directly to their overall well-being and holistic development.  We call them guiding principles rather than underpinning principles because they will not be underpinning unless they are everywhere as we redevelop the senior cycle and unless everyone is using them as a compass with which to navigate.</p> <p>  As for the philosophical thinking regarding the purpose of the senior cycle, what was coming through in the review was many diverse perspectives, which we were then able to pull together into a coherent purpose, vision and guiding principles for a redeveloped senior cycle, without necessarily having one perspective predominate, which would-----</p></speech>

My question is whether there are opportunities when we look at the network of schools, for instance.  This is the start of something that is about research and seeing what works, as I understand it.  Are there opportunities to expand into some areas of learning that had not existed previously, such as alternative modes of education that might show us an alternative way?  Rather than having continuous assessment, could there be an element of self-assessment whereby the challenges people want for themselves would be set with their teachers as opposed to by their teachers?  Might it be of benefit if we examined bringing some of those ideas at an early stage into the network of schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Arlene Forster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#V00200"><p>In addition to the points Ms O'Connor made, a couple of other issues strike me in the context of the Senator's questions.  I am struck by the pedagogy aspect and the actual experience the young person has in partnership with his or her teacher but also with his or her peers in the room.  I am thinking back to the discussions that took place during the four years of the review.  One point that was made by participants in the review was that in the case of transition year, for example, or the leaving certificate applied programme, which we were talking a moment ago, as well as the experience of young people in the link modules, which make up the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, really creative and innovative work is happening in our schools and it is important we acknowledge that.</p> <p>  From the perspective of pedagogy and the opening-up of democratic practice, part of it lies in the relationship between teaching, learning and assessment.  The three have to go hand in hand.  Some of it will probably involve looking again at what the assessment arrangements could be to demonstrate the learning we deem to be really important for young people.  As part of that, we will open up conversations about what types of experiences young people need to have access to the types of learning we deem important, and what assessment arrangements are best placed to enable young people to demonstrate that.</p> <p>  It is quite complex when we get into the detail of it, but I agree that the work with schools will open opportunities for us as we begin to examine that detail.  As Ms O'Connor said, for our part we always link this work back to the clear purpose that emerged for the redevelopment of the senior cycle and those eight guiding principles.  We arrived at those principles through consensus during the discussions as part of the review, and they have become very important reference points for us in our work with schools.</p></speech>

I have mentioned several times that I believe school in general and within every year should more closely resemble transition year.  Perhaps that will be how we can engage people in future with apprenticeships because they will have more experiences that relate to the kinds of work they might do.  Should that be more closely incorporated in order that they will have more experience of apprenticeships before they leave school?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Slattery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#V00400"><p>I was intending to respond to the Senator's previous question but my answer applies to her final one also.  A great deal of what she outlined happens in transition year in many schools, given the level of autonomy transition year affords schools.  One issue that is probably not recognised sufficiently relates to the incredible creativity of schools and teachers to respond to the needs and interests of students.  Because of the autonomy, it is in some ways camouflaged within the system and we are not aware of it.  One step we have taken - I think it is to be published today or tomorrow - is the issuing of a call for expressions of interest from schools to get involved in a school-based review of the programme that will help us in the process of redeveloping the programme statement for transition year.</p><p>That is one of the actions that was announced by the Minister last month.  It is one specific action we are taking that will hopefully uncover some of that practice.</p><p> That brings us to the point the Senator raised about transition year and apprenticeships.  We concluded the review - prior to publication - it coincided with the launch of the future further education and training, FET, strategy by SOLAS.  Unsurprisingly, there were huge synergies between its ambitious agenda and the actions arising from the senior cycle review.  That can broadly be encompassed in the idea of looking at pathways from school to FET.  This includes: looking at the learning pathways in a redeveloped senior cycle; looking links between new apprenticeship opportunities and transition year programmes; and looking at the links between FET schools and others.  We established a standing committee, similar to the committee we would have with our colleagues in the SEC, with SOLAS.  We have already established a working group which has members from our executive and members from SOLAS and we have brought in the education and training boards, ETBs.  In that working group we are identifying where there are FET providers.  This is camouflaged throughout the system and it is happening in local pockets.  We have been conducting an audit of where FET providers have established strong relationships with schools to look at what modules they provide.  Already many of these modules and connections appear to be happening in transition year.  We are looking at the existing modules on offer, how they were created and what led to their development, and we are also looking at how we can offer them more broadly across transition year.  There is a long way to go but we have started that work with SOLAS and as I said, today or tomorrow a call will go out to schools to do that audit.</p></speech>

The NCCA truly is a representative body for teachers, unions and parents and it has nominees on its board as well.  The SEC is a stand-alone body that reports directly to the Minister.  I see an advisory group here that is working with subject experts.  From what I understand, a nominee from the SEC also sits on the NCCA.  That is important.  I admire the work that has been completed in a difficult time, particularly by the SEC.  The SEC has done great work in the last two years, particularly for its assessors in managing and working with teaching groups to manage the continuous assessment and accredited grade system and so on that we have put in place in recent years.  I was incredibly impressed with the 40 subjects that are now managed by the SEC and assessors.  That is incredible.  Four extra languages were added for 2022, including Mandarin Chinese and Lithuanian, which is incredible to see.  I pay tribute to the broad range of subjects to accommodate new communities coming to Ireland.</p> <p>  I refer to the assessment along the lines of that relating to the digital side and technology.  I understand that marks are added online and that is what is reviewed.  That will be made available to students and there will be a portal that is transparently available to students.  Would we not be moving to a system where students will be inputting their information online?  When do we see that happening?  What are the cybersecurity elements around that and is there a portion of budgets within the Department of Education that needs to be allocated for it?  My other questions are on the timelines for assessment.  Some of the concerns and challenges we had with this new system in the last two years were the timing of the assessments and the marking of results that came out.  In other words, they had an impact for third level, particularly for students who were going to the UK.  How will we manage that this year?  With the new model of continuous assessment, how will we manage to make sure that marking happens in a timely way for third level students who wish to take up courses in Europe, the UK or elsewhere?</p> <p>  I mention mindfulness in an exam setting.  National University of Ireland Galway has become the first university with mindfulness.  We talk an awful lot about mindfulness and well-being, but where are the actions?  How can we see it in an exam setting where students enter in panic mode at times?</p><p>I remember what I was like and I would be cramming until God knows what hour coming into an exam.  How can we get them to switch off, detox or whatever is and suddenly calm down and engage with the exam?  What sort of methods could we look at?</p><p> I thank the NCCA so much.  The reports it has done in recent years and the way it has engaged at different levels and at different stages with schools and parents have been incredible and a huge mountain of work has been done there.  It has led to continuous assessment, which is so important when it comes to DEIS and special needs students.  There are extra courses, including drama and film, as well as climate action and looking at our current global challenges.  I understand the concerns around the assessment and capacity of students but I refer to the expansion of transition year, where we are looking at apprenticeship taster courses.  How many of those would the NCCA recommend?  The witnesses have mentioned that the network schools pilot has been rolled out and will be launched and that network schools can apply for this.  Will there be a regional mix with the schools that are being selected ?  Is there a maximum number of schools where it will take place?  On international practice and comparison with other countries, were there one or two elements that the witnesses saw in other countries that they think we should consider for the future?  I will start with Ms Feeney and her team and then we will pass over to Ms Forster.</p></speech>

I will start with the mindfulness question because it is the quickest one to deal with from my perspective.  Colleagues in the National Education Psychological Service, NEPS, are doing a huge amount of work with schools on mindfulness and well-being.  The Senator asked what happens in the examination setting.  Our superintendents are teachers so they are used to dealing with young people and they are used to not just dealing with the mechanics of delivering the examinations but to also engaging with young people in that setting.  If a student is having a difficulty on the day, we have experienced people on hand in the examination centre and available to them in school.</p> <p>  On the technology issue the Senator raised, we are using a huge amount of technology and it has really stood to us over the past two years when we were able to deliver calculated and accredited grades.  We were able to do so because we had built up capacity in online marking.  The use of the candidate self-service portal in recent years has been phenomenal and gives students immediate access to a lot of information, not only their results but subsequently the data about the marks they got.  For this year we have almost all of our leaving certificate subjects marked online and students will have access to almost all of their leaving certificate scripts online after the results come out.</p></speech>

I made the point in my opening statement that we are using a huge amount of technology in the delivery of what we do, supporting assessment but not doing the assessment, which is the question the Senator was coming at.  International research has shown that there are not a huge number of high stakes examination systems that make great use of online assessment.  There are practical reasons for that and it is not just the availability of computers.  It includes the availability of plug points in schools.  There are practical reasons the seat time is needed.  If we are arranging for 120,000 students to sit an English exam in June they all have to be able to sit that exam at that time, the devices need to be there and the electricity needs to be there.  The expansion of ICT in examination and assessment has been included within the senior cycle reform announcement and we have announced, together with the NCCA, that we will research and explore that.  There is a recognition that this needs to be tied into the digital strategy for schools.</p></speech>

We have met its staff to explore what it does and it is doing it on a small scale because of those practical considerations.  There are things that could be considered such as bringing your own device but that is a security issue.  If a student is doing an exam and can get onto the web while doing the exam that does not do a lot for fairness and integrity.  There are things we need to explore therefore, but research into that is included within the senior cycle reform.</p></speech>

The date for the results has been the end of August or early September in the past two years because of the challenges we have faced in that time.  The date for the results this year will be impacted by two things.  An announcement has been made to the effect that the overall profile of results will be no lower than the profile of results in 2021.  That requires time for analysis so after all the marking is done, we need to do the analytics required to make sure of that.  A second announcement related to deferred sittings of the examinations for students who are bereaved, seriously ill or suffering from Covid-19 and unable to take their examinations.  There will be a deferred series of examinations for those students.</p></speech>

We appreciate it.  The Senator highlighted the two new subjects the Minister has asked us to develop and on which we are beginning work.  I would add that in the advisory report, there is an acknowledgement that there may very well be other subjects, modules or units we will need to develop, and we have already identified the fact that young people need more opportunities in the technical, vocational and professional areas, in particular.  An audit is under way to assist us in identifying the other subjects or modules we need to consider.</p> <p>  We have not yet got into the detail of what the pilot network of schools will include.  It is important to note, and this is characteristic of any networks with which the NCCA works, that we will ensure the network is representative of the different school contexts and the diversity of school contexts that make up, in this case, post-primary education.  That will be important, given the work these network schools will be involved in.  It is our experience that when we put the emphasis on that representation, it invariably gives us regional representation as well.</p></speech>

On international practice and in response to the Senator's question, a number of particular elements struck us that might be of particular importance to our work on the senior cycle.  I will draw attention to some we have not spoken about heretofore in this meeting.  One of the features we saw in our examination of international practice was greater diversification in upper secondary schools and, in particular, the fact that many jurisdictions have very clearly defined vocational pathways.  There is learning there for us in redeveloping the senior cycle.</p> <p>  Another area that is prominent in other jurisdictions is broader reporting.  We captured that in the advisory report.  In Ireland, as the Senator knows, reporting very much focuses on a young person's examination results.  In the discussions during the senior cycle review, time was given to thinking about the value of having broader reporting and taking account of other experiences that young people might have, including transition year and the two years leading towards the leaving certificate itself.</p> <p>  The review of international practice also highlighted examples of systems that encourage and support greater specialisation in terms of the subjects, modules and curriculum components a young person can choose.  Alongside that, there was also a continuing emphasis on literacy and numeracy and the importance attached to them.  That is reflected in our system now.</p> <p>  A final matter to which I would draw attention is that many other jurisdictions look to a greater diversity of learning environments for young people at particular stages of their education.  For example, some systems have a greater emphasis on building partnerships with local businesses and organisations in the voluntary sector.  There is also the online learning piece we have already mentioned.  Those are just some of the things that came up in our review.  I apologise for the speed with which I went through all of that.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their presentations.  I echo some of the comments of previous speakers in thanking both the NCCA and, in particular, the SEC for the work they have done, and the quality of it, over an extremely challenging two years and under extremely pressurised circumstances.</p> <p>  When one contributes this late to a meeting, there is always going to be an element of repetition and that especially so in this case.  I raise the issue of T1 and T2 and echo the comments made earlier by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  We have discussed the matter at this committee and we have discussed it in detail at meetings of the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, of which I am also a member.  The Irish-language community has spoken with one voice on the issue.  We have received very good evidence and suggestions, particularly from Maynooth University, about possible alternative approaches.  That needs to be looked at again.  It is something that has been raised as problematic by the Irish-language community and we should come back to that point.</p> <p>  Ms Forster pre-empted some of my questions by talking about the issue of broader reporting.  Certainly in the leaving certificate and the senior cycle as currently constituted, it is almost as if two approaches are being taken.  It says, on one hand, that it is a summative assessment of learning.  However, in people's imaginations and minds' eyes, it serves as a matriculation examination for entry into third level education.  It would be interesting if we could begin to separate that.  As Ms Forster said, we could be considering broader reporting.  For example, the leaving certificate is completely blind to how good a person is at group working, which is a useful skill people will carry into their later lives.  However, teachers who emphasise group working may or may not find themselves rewarded when the leaving certificate examination results arrive.  It would be interesting to look at that issue.</p> <p>  The issue of micro-credentialling was touched upon by Mr. Slattery when we were talking about transition year.  That is something the committee has talked about in the context of third level education.  I think straight away of the Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge, TEG, or the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  It would be interesting if at the end of the senior cycle, a student emerged not just with a leaving certificate result in Irish, French, Spanish and whatever else, but also with a qualification that was recognised under the common European framework.  If we are talking about pathways, once somebody is located on that common European framework, they can see a way forward.  I am thinking in particular of some of the provisions in the Acht teanga whereby we are moving towards a 20% recruitment target in the public sector and how it is most likely that a language level of B2 will be the standard we arrive at in that regard.  However, all of this will hinge on the externally moderated school-based assessments.  There has been near consensus in terms of the need to move to a more continuous assessment-based model.  That is recognised in the senior cycle review.  All of those moves are welcome but we must see closer and in more detail how it is we can structure this externally moderated school-based assessment.  We have heard those concerns expressed by the unions.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made the distinction between whether the leaving certificate is fair or not and whether it is transparent.  There is a certain level of trust in the leaving certificate and we certainly do not want to undermine that level of trust in the public eye.  That retention of trust will hinge on how we structure the externally moderated school-based assessment.  That will be the crux point.</p> <p>  Those amount more to comments than questions but our guests may wish to respond in any case.</p></speech>

It is probably working reflecting on the fact that this is the first year of formal examination of the T1 and T2 specifications in the junior cycle even though it has been implemented for longer than that.  Because we have not had formal junior cycle examinations for the past two years, this is the first cohort to come through the new specification for Gaeilge.</p><p>In relation to the reporting, we had the conversation earlier about the role of the leaving certificate, which is to measure attainment at the end of senior cycle, and it has this follow-on use, which is used for higher education.  Describing it as the means of matriculation to higher education may do a disservice to those who do not want to go down that pathway.</p></speech>

That is what it does.  It does a disservice because not everybody wants to go to third level or higher education.  It is important that the narrative reflects that it has a broader range of purposes than just matriculation.</p> <p>  In terms of the externally moderated school-based assessment, we have been commissioned to research this to look at what works in other jurisdictions.  I am sure Ms Forster and other colleagues will want to come in on this, and perhaps Ms Sheridan as well on this particular one.  On what works in other jurisdictions, the Deputy talked about seeing it closer and more detailed.  Actually, we need to see it closer and more detailed to come up with a system that will work here.  I might just ask my colleague, Ms Sheridan, to share some exploration - not detail - of practice in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#AA00400"><p>It has been acknowledged a couple of times already throughout the morning but it is back again to the need to do research.  Again, looking at it, it is hinging on the externally based moderation piece working for this to be successful.  We all want it to be successful, because once there is a school-based assessment, it allows for greater variety and individual approaches for assessment.  However, how will this moderation be structured?  That is where we need to do the research because there are many different approaches to doing this.  For example, it could be a stand-alone statistical approach, moderation within the schools by sampling material within and across schools or a combination of both, using a statistical approach and sampling of material and getting re-marking of it by external moderators appointed by ourselves.  We need to make sure that the best blend, the hybrid or whatever approach is taken for the moderation, is the one that will work, because it is the crux of making this work and us actually trying to break the perception of the leaving certificate being the matriculation in order that the same value is put on the work of our students who are sitting the leaving certificate applied and who do not choose go to third level but choose some other pathway.  It is in working collaboration with the NCCA, looking to see what happens elsewhere and seeing, discussing and researching the different approaches and combinations of such we can bring together to ensure the most successful approach in order that the senior cycle reform is a successful change for our students in the future.</p></speech>

They were giving feedback on the draft specifications of T1 and T2, on their concerns about enactment and the model of provision and those systemic questions.  I know that the question of T1 and T2 looms large for many people but there is a richness of perspectives on it, much to do with the draft specifications as well as those questions.  We will be bringing them to the council in the coming months for its consideration.  It is not a new answer, but just to reiterate, that work is advanced at the moment.</p></speech>

Therefore, we have not given a date for results at this stage.</p><p>It will be challenging because one of the things we need to ensure is that the results of the main set of examinations in June and the deferred sitting of the examination that will happen after that will be available at the same time.  We do not know at this point the number of students who will sit that second set of examinations - the deferred series.  There is an uncertainty as a result of that and also arising from the work that we need to do to ensure that the results this year are on aggregate and no lower than the outcomes in 2021.</p></speech>

We are hoping that it will become clearer and we will be able to give more certainty on the date, but we cannot say at this point.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the challenges in the work that has been done in the past two years.  It has been challenging for everybody, not least the SEC.  The sooner people know, the better.  The lack of certainty has been very difficult.</p> <p>  Has the SEC done a measurement of the hours of learning that have been missed over the past two years by either the teachers' or students' absences?  Do we have a picture of how much has been lost out?</p></speech>

It is important that the SEC knows as well in terms of determining examinations, to give everybody a fair chance.  I know students this year are under severe pressure.  What percentage of students who do their leaving certificate go onto higher and further education?</p></speech>

On other data collection, do we have time series data in terms of measuring the correlation between those who have grinds and extra tuition beyond what is provided within the public system?  Do we have a correlation between examination results and educational attainment?</p></speech>

I suppose the concern the Deputy would have is that she is looking then at perhaps the form of league tables and performance related to where students are attending schools.  It is not information that we gather or we have.</p></speech>

I will explain why it is important.  How are we supposed to address the inequalities that are here?  I am very concerned about the widening inequality gap between those who can afford the grinds and the extra tuition, as opposed to those who are sitting the same examination but cannot afford any of that, and perhaps come from homes that are not conducive to them participating fully in terms of doing their homework and everything else.  How are we are measuring that in order to be able to address it?</p></speech>

Do we need to measure it to know?  It is quite clear that the level of inequality that the Deputy is talking about has an impact on outcome.  That is why the Department has very successfully introduced the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme and has built further on it again.  I am not sure of the need and if it would be possible to gather the data on every individual, and how reliable it would be to know the extent of what grinds or additional support that they have.  It comes in so many other forms than just grinds.  The additional supports that young people have in the home varies from household to household.  The income coming into the house is a very strong-----</p></speech>

Just in terms of the affordability, we need to measure it.  It is something that we need to look at and we will take up with the Department again as well.  We need to be able to measure the gap as it is widening and the effect of the initiatives, such as the DEIS that Mr. Slattery mentioned, which absolutely, 100% I believe in.  How are we measuring the effectiveness of that in relation to examinations and educational attainment if we do not know?  This data would be extremely useful for us in decision making.</p></speech>

It was a third level study.  It is an interesting piece of research.  It is not research that the SEC would engage in because it looks at an issue that we really do not have any control over.  It is also the case that in some respects the levelling is happening through the assessment process.  Other things happen in the lead-up to the assessment process whereby students have access to different supports, parental supports in the home and grinds.  The quality of teaching and learning can come into it as well.  We are not able to measure the individual&rsquo;s quality of teaching and learning.  Maybe there is a reason why they are looking for additional supports.  There are broader issues.  There is research going back a number of years on it.  We can certainly check and get back to the committee.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  One of the other things is that people are concerned about the timelines.  We have done so much talking about leaving certificate reform.  In regard to the 40% continuous assessment, regardless of whether that will be externally moderated - which I think it will have to be or most of it anyway -when will we be at that point where it is a 60-40 split?  When does the NCCA expect we will reach that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Arlene Forster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#CC00300"><p>I will begin.  In regard to the Minister and the timelines that she has asked the NCCA and the SEC to work to, she has asked us to be ready to work with a network of schools in September 2024.  She has identified an initial set of subjects she wants us to focus on.  Those schools obviously need two years to work through those specifications.  We then need the data and the feedback from teachers, students, parents and school leaders.  From the Minister&rsquo;s timelines, she sees 2027 as the point at which we have all of that data and feedback to enable us then to take that on board as we in the NCCA continue to work on the different specifications as modules.  On a more overarching point about timelines - we see this internationally as well - there is often a perception that curriculum development, curriculum change and assessment change in Ireland are very slow.  When you compare the overall timelines that we work to with those internationally, you find that they are on a par.  When you look at something as complex, central and critical as senior cycle, it takes time to work through these different issues in detail, particularly in view of the fact that we give so much attention, and rightly so, to the experience of schools on the ground.  That takes time.  In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on the timeline she has asked us to work to, 2024 and 2027 are key dates.</p></speech>

It is because we are living in such a fast-moving external environment none of us here really know what education delivery is going to look like internationally in ten or 15 years in terms of opportunities, the position in wider society and all of that.  It is just more than a perception that it is very slow.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the information internationally to be able to make comparisons, but what I will say is that we need to do everything possible.  If there is a certain number of subjects being looked at, what are they?  It will probably be the 2030s before we see a 60-40 split.  We are talking about a future generation of children here.  That is the frustrating thing for everybody.  What can be done to speed up the process?</p></speech>

That will help in terms of shortening the timeline.</p><p>The other thing I would say in this regard is that from our perspective, it is really important to highlight that we are not waiting until the 2030s for many of these changes to be implemented and to have a real impact on the experiences of young people.  We were speaking earlier about some of the immediate pieces of work that we already are starting to progress.  One of those is around supporting young people who are currently in the level 1 and level 2 learning programmes in junior cycle.  That work is already beginning within the NCCA and that is a really important one.  Mr. Slattery and Ms O&rsquo;Connor and colleagues in the SEC touched earlier on removing the ring fencing that currently exists around the programmes that we already have as part of senior cycle provision.  In her response, the Minister indicated that she wants some of that in place for schools from this September.  We have a transition year programme being updated and it will be available for September 2024 that Mr. Slattery has spoken to.  There are many changes already afoot and changes that will be experienced very quickly by young people in the system, including those who are already in junior cycle, as part of senior cycle provision.  While I accept the overall timeline is into the 2030s, there are important changes afoot in the more immediate to short term.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, referred earlier to construction studies and what is needed there and the workforce that we need there.  How hard is it then to roll out a practical subject such as construction studies?</p></speech>

They have a written examination, they also have a project and what we call a day practical skills test, which is a point-in-time examination.  If we look at recent examples within the junior cycle, four technical vocational subjects at junior cycle were reformed as part of junior cycle reform.  The most recent reforms of new subjects at leaving certification do not meet the definition of vocational or practical but they both have a very heavy demand in regard to the non-examination assessment, that is, physical education and computer science.</p></speech>

It was a really good document.  I have three girls and I was looking at it through the lens of one being in first year, one in third class and one in senior infants, so there is something there that gives you a sense of momentum and the changes over time, which was really helpful.

I have looked at the Oxford report, cited in several areas around the assessment of higher order thinking, which recommended that the curriculum be narrowed.  How can students do seven subjects in any depth, and allow time and space for critical thinking, when we are trying to assess so many subjects?  How do we have more critical thinking and problem solving when we have so many subjects?</p></speech>

Consideration was given to narrowing the range of subjects in order that there would be more depth in their treatment.  The consensus reached in the review process, which my colleagues in the NCCA will come in on, was that, on balance, the breadth and type of learning experience students have is actually better.  It is better to have that broad base rather than narrowing it.  Do my colleagues want to come in on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.451" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Arlene Forster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022042600002#EE01100"><p>It was a point that featured in the review.  It is fair to say it is something we - when I say "we" I mean as a society - hold as being very important throughout our education system because we see this emphasis on a broad and balanced educational experience, right from early years, through primary and on through post-primary to the end of senior cycle.  I would reference two things on the Deputy's point about critical thinking and creative thinking.  In 2008, when the NCCA published the five key skills for senior cycle, all the subject specifications that were either reviewed and updated, and the new specifications that have been developed - there are new subjects as part of senior cycle provision in more recent years - all build on the five key skills of senior cycle.  There is an emphasis on creative and critical thinking as part of that specification work in the past ten to 14 years.  Ms O'Connor spoke about eight guiding principles that emerged from the review of senior cycle as being very important now to guide our thinking and our work as we redevelop senior cycle.  As part of those eight guiding principles, there is an emphasis on that critical, creative thinking.  That would very much to the fore in all the NCCA's work on curriculum specifications, whether that is to do with subjects, modules, units of work or whatever the curriculum components consist of.</p></speech>

It is becoming custom and practice in the classroom.  It is like the use of group work and pair work.  If we look at the examination paper for politics and society, in particular, and the marking scheme for it, we will see that students are being provided with the opportunity to critically think based on case studies in which they have specialised in the classroom.  That is also the case with physical education, and even with history and geography in the mid-2000s, as those new specifications came in.</p> <p>  The space is there.  It is not that they are doing too many subjects.  It is that the newer specifications, especially those in the past ten years are less content-driven and more about providing opportunities for learning in that critical thinking space.  The students attend, sit their examinations and demonstrate that level of engagement with critical thinking in the classroom in their examination scripts, because the exams provide the opportunity and the marking scheme then rewards what the candidate has produced in the script on the day.</p><p>There has been a very positive move towards that, which will be built on further and further by having the additional component at school level because that helps the students.  It is about their engagement in other activities, such as the Deputy's son today.  That is a six-hour exam.  </p></speech>

Today, we are meeting with representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, CIIC, and the Crosscare Migrant Project to discuss issues and barriers facing members of the Irish diaspora when returning to live in Ireland.  From the CIIC, I welcome Aileen Leonard Dibra, executive director, joining us remotely from New York, along with her colleagues, Celine Kennelly, chair of the CIIC's board of directors and executive director of the Irish Immigration Pastoral Center, IIPC, in San Francisco, and Ciaran Staunton, from the Irish Lobby for Immigration, ILI, who is also joining us from New York.  From Crosscare, we are joined by Richard King, project leader, along with his colleagues, Sarah Owen, Irish abroad networking officer, and Niall Foster, information and advocacy officer.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the witnesses opening statements and that will be followed by questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow everyone an opportunity to participate.  Members will have a second opportunity to ask questions later, if they so desire.  </p> <p>   I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction is complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present in our meeting room does.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for making themselves available to us today to inform our members of the issues encountered on the ground and to respond to those aspects we have asked them to address.  I call Ms Leonard Dibra to deliver her opening statement</p></speech>

My colleagues have already been introduced.  The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers was established in 1996 to promote the welfare of Irish immigrants and to serve as the umbrella organisation for Irish immigration centres throughout the US.  The coalition is a strong, cohesive and representative voice for the needs of its membership, of which there are currently eleven centres from coast to coast, and in turn the Irish diaspora at large.  The coalition examines the needs of the Irish diaspora and supports its membership to enhance their direct service work by focusing on organisational and programmatic best practice, information sharing, data collection, national reporting and the distribution of current, accurate and reliable information on topics pertinent to the Irish community.  These include, but are not limited to, US immigration policy, various social services and professional learning and thought leadership.  The coalition diligently cultivates and strengthens relationships within the global Irish community, and values the opportunity to share information, perspective and collaborative opportunities in support of the Irish diaspora.  We are thrilled to be here today with our colleagues from the Crosscare Migrant Project.  It is a long-time diaspora partner of the coalition, with which we have collaborated on numerous times to ensure our information is current regarding policies and procedures for individuals and families intending to return to live in Ireland and making the transition home as smooth and streamlined as possible.</p> <p>  Coalition member centres provide an array of culturally competent and confidential services, outreach and assistance to Irish immigrants throughout the US.  Though immigration may be the presenting problem for an individual, it is often coupled with a plethora of other challenges, including mental health and wellness concerns, community connection and, in some cases, planning a return to live in Ireland.  The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated issues faced by the whole Irish community as individuals and families lost employment, and travel restrictions caused increased concern for loved ones abroad due to forced separation of families.  These challenges were particularly harsh for the undocumented community, with many employed in industries that were shut first and remained closed the longest, including construction, hospitality and other service-oriented professions.  The pandemic and associated year-long shutdown resulted in loss of employment, diminished savings and crisis situations for these individuals, who were also ineligible to receive US Government benefits, such as unemployment stipends and federal pandemic relief moneys.  Within this context, centres reported an increase in crisis returns, particularly from undocumented individuals and families looking to return to Ireland to live as a last resort.  The pandemic became the last straw for many.</p> <p>  In recent months, a general sense of relief has been felt throughout the Irish community as the US reopens and resumes more typical modes of operation in all sectors.  Requests for financial support related to Covid's impact appear to have largely ceased cross-country.  Irish community members, however, are still recovering from unemployment and underemployment.  In some cases, this has resulted in housing insecurity.  The number of inquiries related to returning to live in Ireland has stabilised, though centres do report clients considering a planned return.  These are mostly related to a desire to be closer to family and the availability of additional support at home.</p> <p>  Coalition members support individuals and families thinking of returning to live in Ireland in a variety of ways, including with information and resource sharing, case management and referral to other agencies, such as to our colleagues in the Crosscare Migrant Project.  Additionally, several centres continue to provide services to their clients post return to assess well-being, provide case management and-or simply check-in.  These ongoing interactions highlight the challenges for Irish citizens upon their return.  These include aspects such as: difficulty adjusting to living in Ireland again; obtaining medical insurance; accessing health care; acquiring a driver's licence; obtaining car insurance; securing housing and sourcing employment; and sorting out registration for non-Irish family members for services, such as for children or spouses who are US citizens.  Several areas of particular concern relate to converting professional certificates, such as nursing credentials, as well as medical repatriation for individuals in health crises in the US who would benefit from healing or long-term care close to family members in Ireland.  The overall bureaucracy involved in these types of situations is challenging.</p> <p>  The coalition is thankful for the ongoing and generous support received through the emigrant support programme of the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs.  We also value the strong partnership we share with Ambassador Dan Mulhall and the staff of the Irish Embassy in Washington, DC, as well as with those in the consular offices across the US and other Irish Government posts.  Once again, the coalition thanks the committee for this opportunity to meet with its members.  We look forward to a robust conversation on the topic at hand.  We are happy to answer any questions the members may have and to provide any additional information they might find helpful following the call.</p></speech>

Crosscare Migrant Project is funded by the emigrant support programme, ESP, in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We provide an information and advocacy service that supports Irish citizens who are leaving and returning to Ireland.  We have more than 20 years&rsquo; experience doing that work and we work closely with Irish consular services and missions as well as Irish organisations around the world, including our colleagues in the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, CIIC.<br/><br/>The Central Statistics Office has shown a steady increase in Irish people returning to Ireland in recent years, rising to in excess 30,000 in 2021.  The profile of people returning is varied, ranging from individuals to couples and families with children to retirees and pensioners.  The circumstances of their return are also varied.  Some come back in a very planned fashion, with jobs and accommodation arranged.  Others come back out of necessity to look after family members or because they have no legal options to stay in the country to which they emigrated.  Others come back in crisis due to various reasons, including deportation, homelessness and mental or physical health problems.  The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the numbers of people returning or planning to return and we believe this trend will continue.<br/><br/>Our core focus is on those who are vulnerable or marginalised and who are lacking family or other support networks in Ireland on which so many returning emigrants rely.  These are people who are most in need of support during the critical period of arriving and post arrival.  We do a lot of work with Irish groups and Irish consular services, and we engage with key agencies in Ireland.  We have identified three main areas where issues arise and we have done a considerable amount of work in these areas over the years.  Those areas are access to social protection, access to emergency accommodation or shelter, and visa or immigration issues.<br/><br/>I am sure members of the committee are aware of issues around social protection.  One of the main barriers is the issue of access to social protection and the habitual residence condition, HRC.  The HRC has been an issue for more than 15 years.  We successfully advocated for changes to the HRC guidelines that adopted specific recognition of returning Irish citizens in 2010.  The situation improved, but more than a decade later, it has become evident that issues with the HRC are again adversely affecting people returning to live in Ireland today.  In the majority of the cases we deal with, the individuals are in very vulnerable situations such as homelessness or at risk of homelessness, with no income or support networks.  Some have children or further health and social care support needs.<br/><br/>Key issues include a lack of understanding of how the five factors of HRC can be applied to returning emigrants, which is most likely due to lack of specific training.  There is sometimes a default to refusals where the deciding officer effectively defers a decision to the appeals office, which causes delays.  There is a disparity in the treatment of Irish citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds, particularly those who have naturalised.  The traditional routes for interim payments, such as supplementary welfare assistance, take as long to process as standard payments, which negates their effectiveness.  Our 2018 report, A Hundred Thousand Welcomes?, outlined these issues.  Our work over the past four years has shown those issues still exist.<br/><br/>Housing and homelessness are major issues facing many people in Ireland today but there are specific needs for emigrants returning into homelessness.  These people often return at short notice, in some cases assisted by our consular services, and with a wide range of needs on return.  We have identified a critical period of the 72 hours after landing and an urgent period of ten days following that where better systems need to be in place to support these people.  To access homeless emergency accommodation, people need to engage with the relevant local authority to have their needs assessed.  This usually requires the submission of a social housing application to undergo a housing needs assessment, and that takes time.  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee the person will be placed in emergency accommodation while this assessment takes place, which means he or she could be left with nowhere to sleep.  In our experience, there can be reluctance on the part of some local authorities to provide emergency accommodation where a person does not have a recent Irish address, even if he or she has an obvious local connection to the area.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the public health response to the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us a model on how such cases could be handled.  The HSE set up self-isolation facilities for vulnerable people that we were able to utilise for crisis returnees until those facilities closed in September 2021.  We were able to make referrals that effectively ensured two weeks of accommodation for returning emigrants on their arrival home.  This allowed us, and on-site staff, to engage with the local authorities, the Department of Social Protection and other services.  It created a buffer period that took the immediate risk out of returning home in crisis.  It allowed essential and wrap-around supports to be put in place, giving time to secure further temporary homeless accommodation following the two-week period.<br/><br/>An increasing number of people are returning with non-EU family members, mainly spouses and partners but also in some cases children or other dependants.  The major concern for such family units is the system of applying for immigration permission for the non-EU family member.  Different rules apply to different categories of people.  A 2018 report was commissioned by the then Minister with responsibility for the diaspora and carried out by Indecon.  The report identified de facto partners as a distinct group where there were issues involved.  A system of pre-clearance was implemented following that report.  That system, in general, works well as it gives assurances to applicants they will be able to register to live and work in Ireland on arrival.  However, the downside is the processing times, which are variable and recently jumped from three months to six months, with the potential for longer delays.<br/><br/>Non-visa required spouses and children can enter Ireland easily and, in general, can register with immigration with few difficulties.  However, visa-required spouses and children have to submit a visa application prior to returning, and while such an application can be processed via the Dublin office in three to four months, it can in some cases take up to 12 months.  We have seen appeal periods adding two years to the processing time.  We are also receiving reports of delays in the foreign birth registration process.  The timeframe involved now stands at approximately two years.  That is a barrier for some people who wish to return with Irish children who have Irish passports.<br/><br/>The impacts of these delays are most immediately obvious in situations of crisis returns, where there is a chance of the family being split up for long periods of time.  Uncertain processing times can also make planning more difficult.  We support planned returns because they are in the best interests of everyone involved.<br/><br/>Solutions can be found for all of the issues I have outlined.  Some solutions can be implemented within existing structures, for example, specific training on HRC could be made mandatory for social protection deciding officers.  Shortened processing times and an emergency processing system for visas could also be implemented.  Other solutions can be found by looking at best practice and developing new processes.  For example, we propose a protocol that would allow immediate accommodation of Irish citizens and their families returning in crisis, which would be put in place by all local authorities.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s diaspora strategy for 2020 to 2025 clearly focuses on a number of areas relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion.  One of the key areas is the welfare of the Irish abroad, which by extension must include those returning.  Another important area is the diverse nature of our diaspora.  Those are two areas where we are focussing our work.<br/><br/>We have initiated a piece of research into the experiences of Irish emigrants from minority ethnic backgrounds, a group that has traditionally been little recognised but that is increasingly becoming a feature of our diaspora.  We earlier referenced the disparity in treatment some Irish citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds have received upon returning to Ireland, and we hope our research will help to inform and educate about this specific group.<br/><br/>With a view to supporting Irish community and welfare organisations post pandemic, we carried out a piece of research in the middle of the pandemic, which was published in 2021 under the title N&iacute; Neart Go Cur Le Ch&eacute;ile.  It showed how Irish organisations around the world rallied to provide essential supports.  Their ability to do this was in large part due to the ongoing investment by Ireland in the ESP, which provides core funding to organisations such as Crosscare, the CIIC and hundreds of others, and is essential to maintaining and developing the support our diaspora needs, especially those who are at risk or vulnerable.  ESP-funded organisations on the ground around the world, working in partnership with Irish missions and each other, are uniquely placed to provide the bespoke assistance and help that makes the commitments in Ireland&rsquo;s diaspora strategy a reality.  ESP funding should be increased to offer more support and opportunities for development to existing and potential recipients.<br/><br/>I will also make a point about The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Irish Abroad.</p><p>That committee cuts across all Departments and should provide an opportunity for them to contribute to efforts to support our diaspora, specifically those who are returning.  The remit of all these Departments is foreign affairs in Ireland.  However, that committee does not have the weight or authority of an Oireachtas committee or subcommittee.  A dedicated subcommittee of this committee should be established to oversee these efforts.</p><p> I thank members for their interest and we are happy to answer any questions they have.  </p></speech>

It is something of which I have some experience.  In the previous D&aacute;il, I sat on the social protection committee and we had some of the witnesses' colleagues from Crosscare before us highlighting some of the major challenges, similar to those outlined today.  Unfortunately, the issues returning Irish immigrants experience remain broadly the same.</p> <p>  I note the figure of more than 30,000 returning in 2021.  That is a huge number.  How does it compare with previous years?  Covid has had some impact, as was outlined in the presentation from the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, particularly regarding the undocumented.  Do we have figures for the undocumented?  How many are estimated to be contained in that figure of 30,000?  Do we have an accurate picture of where these emigrants are coming from?  Is it predominantly the US, Canada or Australia?  Have we any indication around that?</p> <p>  The HRC is an issue of major concern.  I have come across it.  A number of people have been in touch with me concerning setting up bank accounts, registering with local authorities on housing lists and accessing basic essentials, including social protection.  What has been outlined is similar if not the same in terms of providing solutions.  What engagement have the witnesses had with the relevant Minister on that?  Is there any movement to provide HRC training for staff?  It is a basic and simple ask that could easily be taken up and implemented.</p> <p>  The foreign birth registration, FBR, process was raised and over the past two years I have taken it up with the Minister on a number of occasions in committee and the Chamber.  It has been a major concern.  The witnesses are probably aware the process was closed during Covid and staff were pulled from registering FBRs, which had a major impact.  We have been told additional staff will be put in to deal with it, but there is still a two-year delay, which is concerning.  Will the witnesses paint a picture of how that has a direct impact on someone?  The Minister will say that, in emergency situations, they will process applications.  How does the delay have an impact in real terms on people who have been in touch with the witnesses?</p></speech>

Reference was made to three groups who return to Ireland: those who come through planned methods, those who come through necessity and those who come through crisis.  Will the witnesses give us a pen-picture of the breakdown percentage-wise with respect to those three groups?  That might be difficult.</p> <p>  On planned returns, when people go abroad, put down roots and have children who go to school and so on, it is harder to come back.  From my trips to various places, I have noted there is a window after a number of years when people make that decision, before their roots go down.  After that happens, it is harder to come back and they build up friends and relationships.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Brady has covered much of the practical stuff and we should follow up with respect to the HRC and all that.  I am interested in the converting of professional certificates and it would be interesting to get some detail on which are the most difficult and numerous the witnesses are coming across.  We have all come across people trying to come here, whether pharmacists, doctors, nurses or whatever else, who find they cannot practice even though they have qualifications from other jurisdictions.  More detail on that would be interesting.</p> <p>  A point was made on the difficulty in adjusting to living in Ireland again, socially and emotionally.  I am interested in that.  Are the witnesses saying somebody coming here is coming to a strange place even though they came from here originally?  Do they come back and find they are in a different country?  Will the witnesses flesh that out?  We can probably tackle head on the practical stuff Deputy Brady mentioned but the social and emotional bit causes me some concern.</p></speech>

I will answer with regard to breaking down the number of people coming back and the question on how many are undocumented and where they are coming from.  The Irish community tends to be in the urban hubs here for the most part.  That is not to say they are not elsewhere, but where our centres are located, there are large numbers of Irish immigrants who seek support from them in those areas.  That is one thing I would focus on.  Does Ms Kennelly agree with that?  Centres reach out in smaller numbers to larger geographic areas, usually based on consular region, to support others not in those direct areas.</p></speech>

The larger communities are based in urban areas.  We are lucky that in most of those urban areas, one of our coalition member partners is based in the cities.  Each centre covers a larger geographic area outside its physical city presence.  We cover northern California, part of Washington state and part of Oregon-----</p></speech>

We are lucky, in terms of the membership of the coalition, that we too are generally based in urban areas, so we are very much at the coalface of our communities and can support them in that regard.  The centres have a broader remit.  In recent years, certainly in California, in economic terms a lot of our community have moved out of cities because of inflation and rising housing prices and education costs to further flung areas outside of, for example, my city, San Francisco.  All the centres are continuing to provide services to those immigrants.  In our case, we deal with west of the Rocky Mountains, while the Chicago centre comes down the middle through Texas, and the centres on the eastern coast come all the way down the eastern seaboard.  We are making sure any immigrant who is looking for a service and assistance can get it.</p><p> One issue we saw earlier during the Covid pandemic, which touches on the question as to the difference between the undocumented and the documented population, relates to the number of people who were in the US as part of inter-company transfers on work visas, where the visas had expired and they were unable to return to Ireland to renew them.  The US embassy in Dublin was closed and they, effectively, became trapped within the US.  Quite a number of people decided this life was not for them, because they were used to-----</p></speech>

There were people here working on visas who were then trapped, and we are still seeing those delays even as the US embassy in Dublin has reopened.  People are still here, to a certain extent, who have lived out this two-year process of not being able to return because they could not secure an appointment.</p></speech>

Our little madra had something to say about the issue.</p> <p>  Many people decided this was not the life for them anymore and left.  They have returned to Ireland and taken their families with them.  We were all in a position whereby we were away from family and there was concern in that regard, and that distance became very real and difficult for many of our immigrant population.  It also gave them a clear understanding of and appreciation for the life of the undocumented immigrant because they too found themselves in a position whereby they could not leave or return.  The past two years has caused us to look at this differently.  It has given a different face to returning to Ireland by the immigrant population.  I am curious to know whether Crosscare has anything to say about the variation on figures because I think that is something we do not have.  I refer to the 30,000 number that was mentioned for 2021 and what that looked like previously.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Owen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#E00600"><p>The CSO statistics that are available show that 30,200 people returned in the year to April 2021.  Prior to that, the figure for the previous year was 28,900, and for the year before that, 26,900.  The figures fluctuate, but the pandemic has meant more people have returned.  By contrast, the number of people who left to go abroad in that same period, when 30,200 returned, was 22,800, a significant difference.  Even so, the year was 2021, so people were not going many places.</p> <p>  There are limitations to these statistics.  They come from the Central Statistics Office and are quite broad.  It is very difficult to break them down and get figures for people who are returning and are undocumented.  The figures do not go into that level of detail.  Through the emigrant support programme and all the groups engaging with individuals abroad, numbers are available through reporting we all carry out biannually but, again, that can be difficult to pinpoint.  What we do know is that, earlier during the pandemic, people who came back were coming back in much more vulnerable circumstances because the pandemic, ultimately, was a push factor.  They had got to the point where they had exhausted their avenues of support and, therefore, they had no choice but to return.  It is not just that people return in a planned way or during a crisis.  Sometimes it depends on whether they have a choice about whether to return or whether they just have to return.</p> <p>  I might mention the emotional and psychological impact of return and address that point.  In 2016, we published a report, Home for Good?, in which we asked 400 Irish emigrants about their experiences of returning home in the five years prior to that.  A stark 20% of respondents stated the unexpected emotional costs of return were something they were really surprised by, meaning they had thought they were going home but did not always factor in the fact that, because they may have left when they were in their early 20s and were then coming back with a new family and children, and because their families had got older, their old networks in Ireland would not have been the same as when they had left, which obviously had an emotional impact on them.  There were also some contributions from respondents who stated they were starting every sentence with "When I lived in Australia" or "When I lived in the States", and they were often then shut down by friends and family who had heard quite enough of that.  All of that contributed to the idea that there is a period of adjustment and that return is not for everyone.  Sometimes people return to Ireland only to find they were happier in the US, the UK, Australia, Namibia or wherever they were living.  That is important to note because it will allow people to have that choice and to make migratory decisions that suit them.  We approach our work in such a way that we work with people in vulnerable circumstances and that is the focus of what we do, but we neither promote nor dissuade return.  We try to help people make informed decisions about their migration that are right for them.</p> <p>  Turning to the HRC, it sounds as though many of the committee members are well versed on this.  It has been around, unfortunately, for quite a long time.  Improvements have been made to the condition but we believe it still affects people who are in the most vulnerable circumstances, such as people coming back in destitution, with no income whatsoever. They might be being deported, with only the shirt on their back, and it can be difficult for someone in those circumstances to provide documentary evidence to show they have returned to Ireland for good and are resuming their residence here, or that they have maintained their residence here.  They may not have links with their family members or might be estranged.  They are certainly not going back into a tenancy, opening a bank account or taking the steps that would show, very effectively, that they are resuming their residence here.  Nevertheless, we always make the argument that in the case of someone who is coming back and has had no option but to do so, their centre of interest can only be in Ireland for the purposes of this condition, and we are successful at taking cases on appeal and overturning negative decisions.  We believe that with additional training for front-line deciding officers, this issue could be lessened.  The understanding of the vulnerable circumstances in which people come back, and some acceptance of the fact they will not always be able to show they have resumed their residence here, would be quite helpful.</p> <p>  Moreover, collecting numbers at a social welfare appeals office level on the number of decisions for Irish citizens that have been overturned would be useful.  Those figures, which are not currently published, would help to form a picture of the number of people who have been and continue to be affected by this issue because they apply to most payments where somebody is means tested.  As my colleague Mr. King said, we sometimes find a person will apply for, say, a jobseeker's payment and a decision on that will not be made quickly.  He or she may have applied for an interim payment such as the supplementary welfare allowance, and a decision on that will not be made until the primary payment has been refused.  Fundamentally, that leaves the person without access to any sort of income support, which can be very challenging at that critical moment and can serve to make a difficult situation worse.</p></speech>

I am very disappointed to see that the habitual residence condition is still such an issue.  To be blunt, it has broken my heart in my constituency office on occasion.  I am speaking specifically of a woman and two children who left a domestic violence situation and landed in to me literally with just the clothes on their backs.  The main barrier for them was the habitual residence condition.  It added a level of trauma to what was already a traumatic situation and should never have occurred.</p> <p>  I am interested in the social housing assessment regulations.  There are two local authorities in my constituency and I have noticed that there is not a standardised approach.  Depending on where it is that people are returning to, the criteria used in their cases can differ from those used in other local authority areas.  This does not create the level playing field that those who are returning home should have.</p> <p>  An issue that arises time and again is that something cannot be done until people get here.  There is a certain amount that people can do when there is a planned return, but there is a substantial amount that they cannot until they are physically standing in the country.  This creates barriers.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady has touched on the issue of engagement with the Department regarding the habitual residence condition.  Have the witnesses' organisations had any engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the lack of a level playing field, for want of a better term, in accessing social housing supports?</p> <p>  Ms Owen referred to an engagement Crosscare had had with people who had returned after a number of years.  What other questions does it ask them?  These people are the experts.  They are the ones who have left.  Let us be honest: it is easy to leave but not so easy to come back.  These are the people with the lived experience of that.  What other questions does Crosscare ask them?  What impact does it have on them emotionally, psychologically and logistically to be unable to find adequate supports when they come back?  Are they primarily returning to their areas of origin or are there factors pulling them to other areas?</p> <p>  There is something in the wrap-around support system Mr. King mentioned.  If it was possible to put it in place during Covid, particularly for those returning who had few resources to their name, were destitute or needed to come back due to an emergency, we should consider the matter in more detail.  There could be an argument that it could work in situations other than a pandemic.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on foreign birth registrations.  The committee received a briefing recently.  Additional staff are due to be acquired.  Disappointingly and frustratingly, though, I do not believe this will solve the backlog in the short term.</p> <p>  Regarding people returning and accessing PPS numbers, Revenue certificates and so on, do the witnesses' organisations have any engagement with the Revenue Commissioners on how that process can be streamlined and made more user-friendly?</p> <p>  Over the considerable period for which the organisations have been in existence, how have the challenges that people face changed?  There is a housing crisis at the moment and, obviously, it is a factor.  What about accessing schools, GPs and dental services, which many of us take for granted in our communities?  Has there been a change in those challenges?</p></speech>

I might refer certain of them to my colleagues.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Clarke, Deputy Brady spoke about the FBR.  The impact is mainly on planning and the delays to which that can lead.  It links to the visa and pre-clearance issues, as it all gets bundled up into the uncertain period of time before people have the citizenship they feel they need to return to the country.  This is an important distinction because it is not necessarily a requirement.  Someone does not have to have an Irish passport for his or her child to return to Ireland.  If people are coming back from a country like Australia, it is fine because there is no visa required and it will not cause an issue.  All of this builds into a picture.  We have seen in practice that there are real barriers and perceptual barriers, and all of these issues get jumbled up and dispersed around Facebook groups, sites and discussions.  For example, we heard it being said over and over for years that, due to the HRC, people could not get anything until they had been home for two years.  I believe this myth or misinformation has been put to bed to some extent, but such beliefs can have an impact.</p> <p>  The delays are mainly found in planning the return.  When people have families and are trying to arrange schools or when they are returning for their jobs, they need to know they can have a flight on this or that date because everything else will move on from there.  We have encountered a few cases of delays in pre-clearance and people's de facto partners having to wait behind for a couple of months.  It does not sound like the biggest deal in the world, but those people have to maintain two households - renting two apartments, for example - without having all of the supports they need to get their stuff over, take their flights etc.  Planned returns are important because they make people more comfortable and leave them feeling like they can return home, which feeds into Deputy Stanton's point.  The social and emotional adjustment is a large part of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton was right in that people tend to come home at key times, for example, before their kids start school or when their kids are going to college.  Their returns are bookended by big life events where people need stability.  The other side of that is where people do not have an option other than to return in the middle of those periods.  That can cause a large problem.</p> <p>  It is sometimes difficult to discuss some of the barriers because many of them are wrapped up in issues that everyone experiences, for example, housing.  It is difficult to get somewhere to rent.  The fix for some of these issues is the fix for everyone, so these issues do not just affect returning emigrants, but they add an extra layer of complication and concern.  All of these issues go into the pot of what people add up to make the right decision for them and their families.</p> <p>  Deputy Clarke made a key point about taking care of matters in advance.  During Covid, we have seen the movement of many statutory bodies to online application processes.  There is no reason many of these steps could not be taken prior to returning.  Why not take care of the steps that are easy to take &ndash; PPS numbers, visas etc. &ndash; in advance?  It is a statement that people are planning on returning and that they want to get these matters sorted.  This is more difficult to do when it comes to, for example, housing supports and social protection where there are means assessments.  In such cases, we would err on the side of increasing awareness and understanding of the rules and how they might apply to returning emigrants.  This should speed up processing.</p> <p>  In crisis returns and where people are coming back into homelessness, we would like to see guaranteed shelter of two weeks.  Currently, people who return have to present in person for that to happen.  This is problematic.  They only comprise a small group, but theirs is a very high-need group.  We focus on and put a great deal of effort into them and are in a good position to assist in their situations.  However, the whole focus could be on identifying what could be done across statutory agencies and Departments in advance.  It is more difficult to control what the private sector does, but there is no reason it cannot be done.  The interdepartmental committee could play a role.</p><p>Some of these issues were identified in the Indecon report; some were fixed and some continue.  Definitely, some revitalisation of that, with key action points, would be very useful.</p><p> On the point regarding professional certificates and things that convert back or not, it is very hard for us to pin those down.  We work with people coming from every area and every region.  Top countries of return are top countries of destination by default, such as America, Australia and England.  Increasingly, people are going to and coming back from all parts of the world.  Numbers from the Middle East have definitely increased in the past while, but we are also dealing with people coming back from south-east Asia, Latin America and Africa.</p><p> Countries that have similar systems to ours traditionally tend to be fine.  Our colleagues in the US refer to driving licences as being a very difficult matter.  A driving licence from the US cannot be exchanged whereas one from Australia can be.  Certain things make it easier for people from certain destinations, just by default, while others are more difficult.  It is also extremely difficult to get percentages of where people are coming from and so on.</p><p> We have had engagement regarding local authority areas and housing assessments.  I am struggling to recall exactly when because it was a while back but my colleague, Mr. Foster, works in this area a lot.  He sees, practically speaking, the disparity between treatment in local areas.  If he will cover one or two areas, that would be great.</p></speech>

In our experience, what is happening across all local authorities at present is the conflation of a homeless assessment with a housing assessment.  If someone is not eligible for social housing at that time and does not have a payment in place, there is a delay in that person accessing homeless accommodation.  That has been a real issue for us.  Whether it is families or single persons coming in, people have a window where they need support and accommodation.  They will have to go through the process of trying to get a payment and producing documents to be able to get on the housing list just to access homeless accommodation.  That is the first point regarding what we have experienced across the board.</p> <p>  On the level playing field and what we have experienced in respect of differences between the local authorities, we can all appreciate that Dublin has the highest number of homeless cases.  It has a lot of experience dealing with those cases in comparison with other local authorities, but we have noticed that if someone is coming back to Ireland and he or she has to present to a local authority outside Dublin, there are cases where that person is sent back to Dublin to get homeless accommodation.  If someone is coming into Ireland and getting a bus to Cork or Galway - this is not being specific to any local authority - in general that person is sent back to Dublin because he or she might not have had an address in that area for four, five, ten or 15 years.  That local area is where the person would have last had an address and where he or she might have established ties, or not, in some cases, but the treatment of people is that they have to go to Dublin to be looked after because there are not enough homeless services or the resources to look after them.</p> <p>  We have a case example involving a family who emigrated in 2015 and arrived back to Ireland in 2020.  Their business abroad had failed due to Covid and their last address was in a county council area in a Border county just outside Dublin.  They were told that because they had not been made homeless in that county, they needed to find their own accommodation.  In this case, it was lucky the family came back with savings allowing them to support their accommodation.  It took 18 days for that family to be offered accommodation by the council after numerous efforts and advocacy by us.  When they returned, the family was told they were not habitually resident and could not access homeless accommodation because they had lived abroad for five years.  As we know, the habitual residency condition is part of social welfare legislation.  I was not sure why that was applied in this situation, but it was a term that was used.  Again, it was said that since the family did not become homeless in that local authority area, despite having lived there previously, they were not entitled to accommodation.  It took a very long time.  A self-accommodation option was given to them for a two-week period.  The local authority paid for it for that two-week period and then told the family they had to move out because it could not afford to keep them in that accommodation.  We had to continue advocacy.  The family ran out of resources but eventually we got them assessed for homeless accommodation and it was given to them.</p> <p>  That was a lucky case for that family because they had the resources to be able to support themselves for the three or four weeks they were not provided with accommodation, but that will not be the case for many people, especially those returning in crisis.  That is something we have experienced.  There is a lot of pressure on the Dublin local authorities to accommodate people.  The central placement service, despite that family technically not being its responsibility, facilitated them for a few nights just to get them over the hill.  There is definitely a disparity in the treatment of families presenting as homeless when they return to Ireland.</p></speech>

As they will imagine, nothing is going on at present in respect of it.   Ms Kennelly and Ms Leonard Dibra will back me up in that we do not see anything coming down the pipeline on the issue, not under this Administration.  We do not see much hope for a future Administration because it now looks like the other party could take over both Houses.  In the context of that issue and with Covid, we see more people returning home.</p> <p>  One of the major issues is that of the driver's licence.  We know there are others but this is one that is Government-resolved.  We see what it has done in respect of seven provinces in Canada, where the Irish Government has been bilateral.  It could start that process in the United States by picking New York, California, Pennsylvania or Illinois and doing some of those.  Most of the people returning from the US are not dependent on the Government but they need drivers' licences and the independence to get around.  Most of them are going home with some money.  We have seen in the past that it has been a priority with regard to other countries.  There are about a dozen bilateral agreements right now.  We think this should be looked into.</p> <p>  I also echo what was said about the matter of returning Irish emigrants being dealt with by a permanent subcommittee of this committee.  It would be very important because emigrants are coming now and the issue is being dealt with by various committees.  We know an interdepartmental committee was set up and we know about the Indecon 2018 report.  We believe we should get to a situation where emigrants are tied in tighter so that, when they return, they do not do so not knowing what Department to go to.  I would like to see that.</p> <p>  If there are any questions on the issue of the undocumented, both Ms Leonard Dibra and Ms Kennelly will answer them.  Unfortunately, I have to run to catch a flight.  There is no white smoke coming from Washington on this issue, not now or in the not-so-distant future, unfortunately for us.  That will put more pressure on more people who are going back.  As I said, the driver's licence is one of the major issues.  I thank everyone very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#H00200"><p>I wish to pick up on the points Mr. Staunton made about the undocumented and no movement on it whatsoever.  It is very disappointing to hear that, particularly given the focus on President Biden and his roots in, and connections to, Ireland.  It is also really disappointing given the broader politics at play within the US, as Mr. Staunton outlined.  It is something on which the Irish Government and this committee need to keep the pressure and focus, but it has to be said it is disappointing.  To pick up on another point, a multi-departmental approach is critical and badly needed.  It is something this committee can pick up.</p> <p>  To go back to the Indecon report in 2018, and this is probably a broader question, there were 30 recommendations in that report.  How many of the 30 recommendations, if any, have been implemented in part or in full?  At this point, four years after that report, are there new additions that could be included?  Looking at the recommendations, everything from the motor driving Mr. Staunton mentioned and social welfare benefits and housing that have been referred to today is contained in a report that was commissioned by the Minister four years ago, yet here we are still having the same conversations when the solutions were provided.  That is the general question.</p></speech>

The Indecon report was published and we read it.  There was a laundry list of things to be addressed and we are still discussing some of those things, as Mr. Staunton would highlight were he here.  The main thing is the planned return.  Our colleagues at Crosscare Migrant Project referred to this strongly and we would agree.  Not everybody can be a planned return, but what can be done ahead of time to make that as seamless as possible?  The overall theme that I pick up, and Ms Kennelly, being the executive director, ED, of one of the centres would agree, is that it is much easier to handle things upfront and ahead of time as much as possible to make the transition back seamless.  There is the emotional side of it, which Deputy Stanton was very keen to discuss further and on which our friends at Crosscare Migrant Project have done some research, and we see it regularly through our centres to keep in touch with people who have come home.  It is a case of what we can do ahead of time and those lists of things so that it is a planned and seamless return.  That will alleviate some of the social and emotional things, or at least ease them.  Does Ms Kennelly agree?  Would she like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.497" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Celine Kennelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#H00500"><p>I would.  I will come back to something mentioned previously, and Deputy Clarke highlighted it, which is the wrap-around services that were put in place during Covid.  That is what we provide as immigration centres.  We provide wrap-around services when any member of the public comes to us in crisis.  Many of our immigrant population do, especially the undocumented, those with mental health difficulties and struggles and those with drug and alcohol abuse.  Their success depends on wrap-around services.  It depends on dealing with the housing, the medical issues and immigration issues, and giving them the tools to get back on their feet.  For many of them there has been a blip and they have found themselves unable to get over that blip and sinking further and further.  We should look to the Covid model.  It is something municipalities are doing across the US and governments are doing.  We were able to pivot quickly and provide service to our most vulnerable members of the community during Covid, and I strongly believe we should be able to learn from that.</p> <p>  In terms of people coming, as Mr. Staunton said, we do not see anything happening on the immigration front.  We see an undocumented community that continues to be further marginalised because, the longer those people are there, the fewer safety supports they have in place as they age.  One of the populations that has become a concern to many centres, and it was highlighted by the Aisling Irish Community Center in New York, is construction workers as they start to come to retirement age and are no longer able physically to perform the work they have done throughout their lives, the only work that is open to them.  What happens to them?  There is no health insurance, no retirement plan and no pension.  It is whatever they have put away.  They were living on their weekly wage and some were more successful than others in putting money away.  Many of them are single.  It is very reminiscent of what we have seen happen in the UK, where there are older Irishmen who find themselves very quickly, sometimes because of injury but certainly because of approaching retirement age, without any support systems and no longer able to support themselves.  What happens to them?</p> <p>  In terms of what can happen to address the issue of the undocumented, it must be a Government-wide continued focus beyond St. Patrick's Day.  Every Deputy, Senator and Minister who comes to the United States must speak to the leadership he or she meets to examine how we can resolve this problem based on the amazing, one-to-one relationship that exists between Ireland and the United States.  It is a relationship of migrancy.  We come and we go.  People from the US who are non-Irish citizens and non-Irish heritage citizens would love the opportunity to come to Ireland, but it is not that easy for them to come to Ireland either.  We would love to see a model created on the Irish side that creates that level of goodwill and gives something that would give the government agencies in the US a goal to work towards.  There is a broad concern among the GAA, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, AOH, and in local and national civic engagement about the influence of Irish America because, as it stands, Irish America is shrinking.  We do not have a new population coming.  We would love to see a model set in Ireland for US citizens to come there because many of them might have Irish heritage going back generations but they cannot easily come to Ireland and work.  That would give us a model to present on the US side.</p></speech>

I join Deputy Brady in expressing my disappointment at the lack of movement on the status of the undocumented.  I agree with speakers that we should focus quite a lot on that.  Perhaps we have been neglectful there recently with everything that has been happening, but it is no harm to get back on this.  I have a question related to that, which is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and the deportation of Irish people.  I have encountered a few cases of that in the past, although not so many recently.  The witnesses might comment on what is going on there.  Is it up or down?  What is the current position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Leonard Dibra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#H00700"><p>I am sorry to say that I do not have the numbers we have with me.  We will get them.  With regard to deportations, they have been down in recent years.  I wish my immigration analyst was here because he would know off the top of his head, but I believe there were 26 or 27 instances of Irish people being deported from the United States in the previous fiscal year, so the numbers are low.  The interesting thing about the undocumented community currently in the United States, and Ms Kennelly touched on this, is the fact it is further withdrawn than it has ever been.</p><p>Right before Covid-19, we were in the midst of the previous Administration where there was very harsh rhetoric with regard to immigration and the undocumented in particular.  Therefore, we already had people pulling back.  Then we went right into the pandemic during which there were questions about what services and supports people would have, and US policies on things such as the public charge rule etc. very much compounded the fear that people who should be reaching out were not.  We even saw that a little bit over the past couple of years with people seeking services through their immigration centres, which were still there and still supporting people on the front line.  There was an anxiety there, however.  We have, therefore, a population of people who have been battered down over the past six years and who are now just trying to figure out where they are going and what they are going to do.</p><p> Over the past couple of years, we saw what we had hoped would be congressional movement with a new Administration, which just got watered down, from what would at least have been the ideal pathway for people, down to a say on deportation and possible work authorisation, down to nothing.  Our undocumented population here are always vulnerable.  They are more vulnerable than ever at the moment in the sense of disappointment and ongoing fear and anxiety that has happened over recent years.</p></speech>

That probably deals with members' questions.  I will turn to Mr. King and maybe seek a closing comment.  I thank him for his earlier submission.  Apologies for not being here myself but I am most grateful indeed for the documentation he furnished along with his oral presentation.  It seems quite clear to me we have work to do.  We would be keen to do what was mentioned by Deputies Brady and Stanton.  Some of the issues raised are new and many have been around for many years in terms of  access to healthcare, insurance, driving licences, housing, employment, the recognition or otherwise of professional certificates and qualifications and, more recently, a greater diversity within the Irish diaspora.</p> <p>  I want to comment on what Deputies Brady and Stanton said in respect of the Indecon report.  We should see whether we can do an evaluation or can have one done on that in order that we can not only attend to ourselves but also transmit to Government a request that a greater level of focus from Government is needed towards many of these recommendations and in terms of gaps that might appear in the multi-departmental approach.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the emigrant support programme and the work our officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs do on the ground, not only here in Ireland but more particularly across our network of consulates in the United States, which continues to grow in response to the Irish community and level of business that is appropriate to such offices.  We very much acknowledge the programme workers and the fact that just under &euro;1 million is made available from the Department of Foreign Affairs annually, and specifically within that is a tailored diaspora fund.</p> <p>  There is a body of work for us to do, however.  Our meeting is, therefore, timely as well as being important.  This is an area to which we shall return, certainly before the end of the year.  I will call Mr. King for a final word and then maybe wrap up with Ms Leonard Dibra, Ms Kennelly and Mr. Staunton.  I acknowledge the importance of our meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#J00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation today and the opportunity to speak.  Ms Kennelly very much raised the point about the wrap-around supports and what we offer.  We collectively offer help on how we are going to support funded organisations and consular services both in Dublin and worldwide.  We can certainly attest to the phenomenal work by consular services abroad.  We have a very close relationship with the office in Dublin.  We do much work on very intense and difficult cases that come from an embassy or mission to Dublin and to us.  We then engage with the service here.  It is amazing and a model other countries look to and of which they would be envious.</p> <p>  In terms of what we need to be doing, sometimes it is easy to look for very big asks.  People say things like we should have a one-stop shop or have some legislative change.  By way of illustration, when we were lobbying around the habitual residence scheme, when we actually got a change in the wording implemented, it had a great effect.  We saw an improvement in how people were being treated and dealt with.  Organically over the years, with the moving of staff and the issue maybe becoming less recognised, some of the old problems are creeping back in.</p> <p>  The point I am trying to make is that it is a body of work across multiple agencies and some of the work is bureaucratic.  It is around constant things.  It is around training and small changes.  There may not be a super big thing we can do that generates all that attention, but there is so much expertise, energy and intelligence contained within the organisations and the services.  I think we can very easily collectively look at applying ourselves to these issues.  We can absolutely identify the ones that are consistent or new and that might need to be addressed.</p> <p>  We, the CIIC and all the other groups are funded to provide support.  We are here and this is what we do; we work with the people.  These days it is almost a luxury to have a bespoke service where a person can talk to someone face to face.  It is absolutely what people coming back deserve, however, and especially those in crisis.  We are here to do that.  We are not necessarily expecting that every Department will put in place a returning emigrant-specific group or assign people, but we need them to work with us to address those gaps and blocks we can see appear in that work, whether it is access to health service, getting PPS numbers long before people come back home, or driving licences.  We just need to apply ourselves and work through those things.</p> <p>  Certainly from our side, and I think we can speak for all the agencies and groups we work with in the emigrant support programme, we would be very much on board with doing that collegially and critically, if needs be, but in a very positive and constructive way.  We would like to second our own proposal in terms of a subcommittee or someone to look after the interdepartmental committee.  If we can just get the right people on board and people in those Departments who can implement change, we can make positive changes.  They will trickle down and out and that will send a message that helps address some of those perceptual barriers and helps people on return.  We would be very happy to help in any way we can.</p></speech>

I do not wish to go over ground that has been covered already by Ms Leonard Dibra and Mr. Staunton but this was mentioned earlier.  Did the witnesses find in the United States that Covid-19 changed people's views of emigration?  Many Irish people returned as a result of Covid-19.  Would the witnesses see Covid-19 as being in some way responsible for a lifestyle change that has resulted in people deciding to return from America to Ireland?  Is that an issue?  If that has not been dealt with already, the witnesses might make mention of it and then provide us with their final message.  I thank them both.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Leonard Dibra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022042600002#J00500"><p>We briefly touched on it.</p><p>When people, whether documented or undocumented, were stuck here, the typical trip home during the summer or holidays did not happen.  I am referring to the idea of not being able to get to loved ones.  The diaspora here is a transient one and its members go home, see family and make visits over the summer.  That all stopped.  On the mindset change of people who had the ability to travel but who could not, the resources of people who were undocumented were so limited.  People who had lived here for many years undocumented and did quite well were cut off at the knees to a certain extent in that they were blowing through savings, their businesses were shut down and there was no social network here financially helping them.  Many thanks are due to the Irish Government for the critical supports it put in place to help those particular people.  This really gave a number of the undocumented population a lifeline when no one else was giving it.  Well done to the Irish Government on that.  I thank it for that added support we got.</p><p> I agree there was a change in mindset.  I believe this mindset still features.  Crosscare Migrant Project and the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers have spoken about this.  Even though things are opening up and sectors across the board are doing much better here, albeit with the inflation that is occurring worldwide, people still ask whether they want to be back with family and in circumstances again in which they cannot get home if they need or want to.  It is in this context we are receiving at the centres some of these inquiries regarding planned returns.  Again, there has been a levelling off but the thinking still features and is still part of the mindset of many of our community members.</p><p> On behalf of Mr. Staunton, who had to leave early, Ms Kennelly and myself, I must add it is always a pleasure to speak to all the committee members and present information we gather at national level from our membership, which works non-stop to provide supports to the Irish diaspora &ndash; Irish immigrants here in the United States &ndash; providing holistic and really culturally competent support.  The immigrants know they can come to our centres and be in a safe place with people who understand them and the nuances of language.  It is a matter of sitting down, having a cup of tea and discussing the issues at hand, no matter what they might be.  Part of that is the process of returning home.  We are thrilled to have this ongoing and long-term partnership and collaboration with our friends at Crosscare Migrant Project, and that is part of the wrap-around service so many of the Deputies have brought up.  In the context of starting here in the US and transitioning back to Ireland, we have colleagues we can rely on, and they know they have colleagues here they can rely on to share the relevant information and to be as up to date as possible to help with the transitions, which only makes things more smooth.</p><p> We are happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful to the committee as it moves forward with its work, and we would very much value and love further engagement and discussion as these things move forward.  As Mr. King said, we are thankful for the funding and happy to put as much value on the investment as we possibly can for the committee members, the Irish Government in general and, most important, the Irish diaspora or community members we all serve here in the US.</p></speech>

We thank all the members of the committee for the platform to share this information.  We very much appreciate and value the relationship we have with the Irish Government and its representatives abroad.  Certainly across the United States, because that is our wheelhouse, but also across the globe, there is not a mission where the Irish diaspora and its individual members are not at the forefront of the minds of the consular corps.  I give a huge shout-out to them given the relationship we have.  I very much look forward to continuing to work with the members on these issues and to being part of the wrap-around services to care for people.</p></speech>

The reality is that divisional headquarters are spread across the country.  For example, the divisional headquarters for Longford, Roscommon and Mayo is located in Castlebar, County Mayo.  So for someone living in Longford, Roscommon or Mayo, the nearest location is Castlebar.  The legislation does not state that sex offenders must inform their local divisional headquarters.  A sex offender can inform any divisional headquarters in the country.  One could have a situation where someone who is convicted of a very serious offence, is considered to be a high-risk sex offender and, say, resides in Roscommon or Galway notifies Wexford Garda station.  That person would have complied with the legislation, as currently drafted.  My amendment states that such persons must present themselves at &quot;the local district headquarters of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.  Let us remember that it is the garda&iacute; in the local district who will be responsible for monitoring these sex offenders.  We are not even asking sex offenders, in order to comply with the register, to present themselves at the Garda station from where they are going to be monitored.  We are facilitating high-risk sex offenders going undetected by allowing them to contact any divisional headquarters.  This comes back to the culture that we have concerning the overall legislation that protects the rights of the offender rather than the rights of the victim or any future potential victims of the individual concerned.</p><p>As the Minister will know, we have a so-called sex offenders register but it exists in name only because, in practice, garda&iacute; have both hands tied behind their backs in trying to enforce it.  Every year there are in excess of 70 breaches of the register.  These involve individuals who have come to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for some other reason and then they are prosecuted for a breach of the sex offenders register.  We need to put a robust system in place and facilitate the Garda to monitor these individuals.</p><p>I want to raise another issue.  As set out in the legislation, a sex offender can comply with the requirements of registration by writing a letter to, for example, Wexford Garda station if he or she is going to reside in Donegal, Roscommon, Galway or wherever.  Sex offenders should have to present themselves in person at the Garda station that is located closest to where they reside.  In 2012, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, passed a motion at its annual conference which stated that sex offenders, in order to comply with the sex offenders register, should have to present in person at the relevant local Garda station where they plan to reside and should not have the option to notify by post.  The motion was put forward as a result of the work being done at the time by Sergeant John Hynes, who has probably been the foremost member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of securing prosecutions against sex offenders right across the west of Ireland.  He had that motion passed out of sheer frustration regarding the existing register.  The anomalies that are in the register are replicated in this legislation and, therefore, I ask the Minister to accept my amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 26 and 30 relate to the court being able to order a sex offender to avail of treatment or counselling or participate in a psychosexual evaluation.  A psychosexual evaluation is one where the risk of that offender is evaluated by a mental health professional to determine if the individual is at risk of committing a further sexual offence, and recommends treatments to diminish that particular risk.  The ultimate objectives are to: identify deviant sexual behaviour patterns; determine the risk of sexual and non-sexual tendencies and-or repetition; estimate whether there is a threat to the community; assess if they should be allowed contact with minors; clarify diagnostic impressions; offer treatment recommendations; identify specific elements that should be targeted during the patient's treatment; and render suggestions regarding community supervision.  I do not think it is too much to ask that those criteria be assessed for any individual prior to his or her release from prison.  This process would protect them as well as protect the community at large and I hope that the Minister can accept my amendments.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 seeks to ensure that an incentive is put in place for sex offenders to complete their treatment programmes.  As the Minister will know, only one in eight sex offenders avails of treatment in prison.  I accept that treatment is not always available when offenders want it but the reality is that there has been an expansion in the capacity of treatment within the Prison Service.  Yet, despite an expansion, the actual number who avail of the treatment has decreased.  In the three years up to the end of 2019, just 55 sexual offenders had taken part in the Building Better Lives programme.</p><p>In the three years up to the end of 2015, when the Building Better Lives programme was not as accessible prior to the expansion of the programme in 2016, there were 73 sex offenders participating in that treatment programme.  The reality is that such treatment reduces the risk of re-offending by three and a half times according to the Irish Prison Service's psychological unit.  The review that led to the legislation before us today, which was published by the Minister's Department back in 2009, recommended in respect of the sentencing, treatment and monitoring of sex offenders that early release of sex offenders should be conditional on their engagement with such treatment programmes.  That is recommended by the Department's report.  The report states that there should be extrinsic incentives, positive and negative, that will motivate sex offenders to participate in programmes.  It goes on to cite the practice in Vermont, in which prisoners who do not participate in programmes are not deemed eligible for parole.  The report says that the view taken was that sex offenders who do not participate in programmes should not be eligible for any form of early release or additional privileges within the prison system.  The Department's report is saying that, and I am asking that the report be implemented and its recommendations acted on here in this set of amendments.</p><p> The final amendment, No. 35, relates to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, right to be forgotten.  This is an issue I raised on Second Stage.  We have a situation where the press coverage of the activities of sex offenders can be erased from the Google listings by exploiting the EU privacy laws under GDPR.  It was never the intention of the right to be forgotten to include the facilitation of the removal and delisting of court reports regarding sex offenders and their convictions for very serious sexual offences.  Our Constitution clearly sets out that courts should be held in public, and the only way that happens effectively is through court reporting.  It is completely unacceptable that this mechanism is being used by sex offenders to erase their electronic record.  Concerns have been raised regarding the operation of this right to be forgotten.  While there is a right there, it is not an absolute right and it must be weighed against the interests of the public.  It is vital that this information is available to the public.  We cannot just airbrush away the stories of the victims.  We all know that victims in the past and even today sadly have felt compelled to waive their right to anonymity to ensure that the perpetrators are named and shamed.  Now we are exploiting the failure to apply the GDPR law effectively and the victims' stories are being erased.  This is a further abuse of those victims.  It should not and cannot be tolerated.</p><p> Google has defended its handling of requests to delist articles relating to these criminal convictions on the basis of the amount of time since the conviction took place being the main factor in that regard.  It is not taking into account the public interest in this regard.  I am saying that it must be taken into account.  The reality is that all the big tech companies are regulated in this country.  While the Minister will probably argue that this is a European regulation and must be dealt with by Europe, they are regulated in this country.  If we apply a regulation here and act effectively in respect of the management of this type of information, and it is in the public interest and in the interests of victims that it would remain in the public domain, it means that this will happen across Europe.  I hope the Minister can recognise the interests of victims here by ensuring that this particular loophole is no longer exploited by sex offenders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2022042600002#D00200"><p>In response to amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10, given the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be organised on a divisional basis and that physically there will be no Garda districts, it is impossible to accept the amendments because they refer specifically to local district Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na headquarters.  Under the new model, the Garda will be organised on a divisional basis and districts simply will not exist.  In drafting the legislation we had to take this into account, pre-empting the fact that while it is not in place across the country it will be the situation.  That is the reason for divisional headquarters instead of district headquarters.</p> <p>  In amendments Nos. 26, 29 and 30, the Deputy is essentially enforcing that all offenders would engage with psychosexual evaluation and treatment.  It is already the case that this type of engagement is taken on board by members of the Parole Board, such as where offenders have engaged in certain types of treatment, where they have shown remorse and where they have engaged and shown that they perhaps want to change.  What has been made clear to us is that forcing these types of programmes on people who do not want to acknowledge that what they have done is wrong and who do not want to engage in the programmes does not have any benefit.  It is often the case that where they do not engage in any type of programme, be it psychosexual evaluation or otherwise, the Parole Board takes that into account and can ensure that they are not released earlier.  It is obviously the Deputy's concern that people would be released early without any type of evaluation.  Having looked closely at a number of cases prior to the establishment of the Parole Board, I can assure the Deputy that the board and any recommendations that come forward take into account this type of engagement.  However, it is clear from the engagement we have had that where this is forced on individuals it does not have the desired effect which the Deputy has set out clearly and which we all would like it to have.  This applies to the number of amendments that are specifically related to this change.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 35, I remember the debate we had about this in the D&aacute;il.  As the Deputy said, the right to be forgotten is not an absolute right.  What we have done is properly transpose the GDPR.  That has been reinforced most recently in the Court of Justice of the European Union, which established in the Google Spain case and in any subsequent cases that the right to be forgotten should not apply to information that is relevant to the public interest, including previous convictions.  That is very clear.  It is not about us not regulating here but us complying with European law and the transposition of the regulation as it is set out.  However, I take on board the Deputy's concern about self-regulation of companies and how important it is that companies such as the ones he has mentioned and otherwise are clear on and understand the law and the requirement to take into account relevant public interest, including previous convictions.  Perhaps that is something we can explore further.  What I cannot and do not want to do, given the legal advice I have, is to go further than the requirement to transpose the law as it is.  We are required to transpose EU law as it is set out.  Clearly, we have done that.  The law is clear and the companies must adhere to it.  To go beyond that is not good practice and is something we are advised against.  However, I believe there is a logic in exploring further how we can make sure that it is very clear to all those online companies that this is the law, that it has been clearly set out and that where anybody is in breach of that law, there is recourse there.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, for the reasons I have outlined I cannot accept the amendments.  On the last point, however, I would be happy to explore further how we can deal with the fact that while the law is there and is clear, we must make sure that companies adhere to it and they know it is not an absolute right when it comes to the right to be forgotten.</p></speech>

I was very much involved in the debate on the reconfiguration of the divisions.  In fact, I remember the Garda Commissioner sitting in the seat the Minister is sitting in today as we teased out these issues.  We were all assured that the reconfiguration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was to improve policing.  This afternoon, the Minister is giving us a practical example of where it is not helping policing, helping victims or protecting local communities.  She is saying that, under the reconfiguration, we will not have any district headquarters any more.  It is very easy to change the amendment to read "local Garda station" because I presume there will still be local Garda stations after this reconfiguration is completed.  With all due respect, the Minister is playing with words in respect of my amendment.  She knows the thrust of it.  In fairness, it is not me who is putting it down.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who have been implementing this register for decades, have come forward and said that it is not practical and that, if they are going to be able to monitor these individuals, they need them to present in person at the local Garda station rather than in Castlebar, 40 or 50 miles away.  The difficulty is that, as result of the way in which the legislation is written, those on the register can notify any divisional headquarters in the country and thereby comply with the law.  That is not good enough.  We want these people to have to present in person to issue the notification in their local Garda station.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the amendment put forward in a genuine effort to deal with specific concerns garda&iacute; have raised regarding the implementation of this legislation.</p> <p>  On the issue regarding the parole board, what I am saying is that applications should not be accepted by the parole board unless people have availed of treatment.  I will not press the issue today but I ask the Minister to reflect on the intention behind this amendment before we deal with it on Report Stage.  I accept that people cannot be forced to avail of treatment.  It is very clear that they are not doing it at the moment because only one in eight sex offenders is prepared to avail of treatment while in prison.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the system at the moment.  The Minister's report, which was published back in 2009 and which this legislation is based on, specifically states that an incentive needs to be put in place.  If it is not to be access to the parole board, the Minister should come forward with some incentive on Report Stage.  I am only asking that she reflect the recommendations in her own report, which include a recommendation that an incentive be put in place because the system is not working at the moment.  If the treatment is as effective as the Prison Service says it is - and it says that people who avail of treatment are three and a half times less likely to reoffend - why are we not putting some sort of incentive in place to ensure this treatment is taken up?</p> <p>  My final point relates to compliance with the right to be forgotten under the GDPR.  Under a very strict interpretation, the Minister is correct in what she is saying.  There is absolutely nothing to impede us, as a member state of the European Union, from going further in this regard.  I am not asking that we go further, however.  All I am asking is that the law as set out at European Union level be enforced and implemented here in Ireland by the technology companies based here.  As a jurisdiction, we are turning a blind eye to the approach being taken at present, which effectively abuses victims again.  These people have been put under great pressure to waive their anonymity so that the offenders can be named.  With the stroke of a pen, the technology companies are airbrushing their stories away.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  If we are genuine and serious about acknowledging the hurt that has been caused and ensuring that those victims are not abused again, we need to ensure that the EU regulation is enforced in principle and verbatim, which is not happening.  We need something else here.</p> <p>  I submitted these amendments at the end of last year so the Department has had a full four months to consider them.  I am surprised that no positive suggestion has been made as to how to address this particular problem.  It was flagged when I raised this issue with the Minister on the floor of the House on Second Stage.  It is just not good enough to say that we will look at it.  We need some practical measures.  It has taken us 13 years to get this legislation in place.  The victims cannot wait another 13 years for this particular provision to be enforced by the technology companies that come under our jurisdiction and which are regulated here in Ireland.</p></speech>

With regard to amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, perhaps the Deputy has not seen the changes but it is now required that people present in person.  That is very clear set out in the legislation.  In fact, I believe an amendment the Deputy is to propose later removes the need for it to be done orally and allows it to be done <i>in camera</i>.  I am not sure if that is what was intended in the later amendment, but it is very clear that people must present in person.  We have engaged very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing this and it is happy with what we have set out with regard to the divisions.  I apologise if I sounded like I was playing with words but we obviously cannot accept the amendment which refers to a local district headquarters because they will now be divisions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also happy that people will not be allowed to evade it because there are a number of different mechanisms within the legislation in that regard.  These include a requirement to report when moving address.  People's local stations might not be open but they must report to a local Garda station so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knows where they are and is able to monitor them.  There are a number of elements to this legislation in that respect.  The question of districts and divisions is just a technicality but people must report to local garda&iacute; or to garda&iacute; in general, whether in their own local station or a nearby station, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is able to monitor them.  We have a very clear system.  Later amendments propose to change the time limit for notifying An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a person is leaving an area from seven days to three or potentially two.</p></speech>

They present to their local station.  I assume it would be much easier for offenders to present to their local station than to have to travel.  It does not change the fact that they live where they live.</p><p>There is communication within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if there are any changes or concerns then that again comes under the remit of the legislation where relevant information can be shared if there is a concern within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Whether it is a local station or one further down the road, they have to present in person and they must comply with the terms set out in their post-release programme.  There is a number of different mechanisms in the legislation that allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to monitor.  We get into all the elements of it later, like changing name and so on, but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clear that what we have in the Bill is workable and suitable and it does not impact on how it monitors sex offenders.  Whether it is the local station or one 20 miles down the road, it is clear that individuals still have to present to the station and that members of the Garda have an appropriate mechanism to monitor them.  If they change address, they obviously have to register that and make a change.  If they go on holidays for two days to a different county, they have to present to a station in that county as well.</p></speech>

When we have dealt with them, the rest of the debate will run more smoothly.  The series of amendments I have tabled are fundamental.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.555" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2022042600002#F02000"><p>The inclusion of &ldquo;any&rdquo; is to capture situations where they are away from their local station.  We will try to make that clearer.  The intention is that they will report to their local station.  I do not think it benefits an offender to have to travel 50 miles to another station.  It does not benefit them because they do not evade anyone or anything.  It does not change anything.  We will make it clearer.  Whether the reference is to &ldquo;district&rdquo; or &ldquo;divisional&rdquo;, it is a technical element to it.</p> <p>  In terms of the Parole Board, we have a Parole Act and that is where any changes to the Parole Board would fall under.  We have just increased from seven to 12 years when a person can come before the Parole Board.  That is set out, irrespective of whether somebody has engaged with education, psychosexual supports or any other type of supports.  What happens afterwards is what the Parole Board must take into account.  Any changes that fall under the Parole Act would not sit under this legislation.  It has been made very clear to us by the Prison Service and the Parole Board that it is only effective where people admit their guilt.  As Deputy Naughten says, it is very effective and where people engage in these programmes, they are less likely to reoffend, but if someone has not admitted their guilt or that what they did was wrong, engaging with these type of programmes simply will not work.  The Parole Board takes that type of engagement into account, and somebody is less likely to be released if they have not engaged in any way, shape or form, but if any changes were to happen, it would have to be reflected in the Parole Act.</p> <p>  In the final piece, what Deputy Naughten has proposed here is essentially already set out in law.  The law is very clear that the right to be forgotten is not an absolute right.  That is the law.  It is very clear.  The Parole Board must take on board what is relevant to the public interest, including previous convictions.  That clearly includes convictions for sexual offences.  What I am saying in terms of further engagement once this Bill is implemented is that we will engage with those companies and make sure they fully understand the law.  Deputy Naughten noted that people have had to waive anonymity.  If there are examples where companies have breached the law and removed content or data which are clearly in the public interest or clearly include people&rsquo;s previous convictions, then they are in breach of the law.  If we do not know about them then nothing can be done, so if there are very clear examples of where that has happened, then it would be very helpful to know that.  The law is the law and I am not sure if we can strengthen it any further.  By implementing this legislation and then engaging with that particular sector to make sure that the companies are clear about what is set out in the law and what has been set out by the Court of Justice of the European Union might go some way to making sure it is absolutely understood.</p></speech>

That is in the public domain.  I personally hate to see where victims waive their anonymity because they are given that status during a legal process to protect the victim and they feel they have no choice at the end of the court case but to disclose who they are in order to have the perpetrator named.  I do not think it is right that having gone through the trauma of the case and having to deal with it, we then have companies that are regulated here in this country deciding to just completely erase their story.  That is wrong and I do not think it should be allowed.  We need to ensure that the letter of the law is implemented here in Ireland.  I ask the Minister to think long and hard about it and I will reintroduce the amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Why is there a difference in the age here?  There seems to be a lack of consistency between the age of consent and the threshold regarding an individual being placed on the register and the length of time he or she is on it.  What is the reason for that?</p><p>In terms of amendment No. 3, the reality is that if an offender was just shy of his or her 18 birthday and committed a very serious offence and has a high risk of reoffending, why is a maximum of five years being placed on that individual?</p><p>My questions are, first, why there is a differential between 17 and 18 and, second, should we not be giving the courts the discretion on an individual who has not reached the threshold of 18 years of age but has a very high risk of reoffending.  Why should we minimise the length of time that they are subsequently on the register?</p></speech>

It simply has to do with whether someone is charged as a child or an adult.  In Ireland, a child is defined as a person under 18 years of age.  It is simply to make sure we have that clear definition.  It is not in any way aligned to consent.  I do not think consent or the age of consent should come into any of this where we are speaking about a sexual offence.  They are two separate issues.  If we start treating children differently for different crimes where do we stop?  It is simply a very clear clarification.  If people are under 18 they are a child and the rules have to apply the same as they do for any other offence.  If they are over 18 they are treated as an adult.  If we start blurring the lines, is someone aged 16 much different to someone aged 17 and <i>vice versa</i>?  This is where the five years comes in.  It applies to a child under the age of 18.  I appreciate that we can have very mature 17-year-olds and very immature 22-year-olds.  We have to have a legal definition and the line is drawn at 18.  It is not possible for us to suddenly deviate from this.</p></speech>

Regarding the five years, surely this should be based on the risk assessment carried out and available to the Judiciary at the point of sentencing.  Why are we tying the hands of the courts? The Minister will very cogently argue against mandatory sentencing on the basis we are tying the hands of the Judiciary.  In this case, we are saying it is based on the age of the individual, despite the fact this could be a very serious offence.  The risk of reoffending could be extremely high.  We are minimising the period for which a person can be on the register after release.</p></speech>

In many instances, we have a maximum sentence or penalty.  What we are referring to here is a maximum sentence of five years.  I do not think this ties the hands of the Judiciary.  This is a recommendation from the Attorney General who looked at other types of case law and criminal offences and the fact that it involves a minor.  The recommendation is five years.  This is something on which we have had a great deal of engagement with the Attorney General.  It is a maximum that allows up to five years for the judge to respond.</p></speech>

A little more clarity needs to be brought to this and the Minister accepts this.  In the modern world we live in we can communicate with a person in seconds and minutes.  We need to be able to ensure that victims understand that a person who is released and who is reporting is doing so as efficiently and effectively as possible.  This is why we feel 48 hours is more than enough time for people to be able to communicate with the Garda station, and I hope it will be the local Garda station.  They can make an appointment to go in person to meet somebody.  This should be able to be done as quickly as possible and 48 hours is more than sufficient time to do so.  This concept is repeated throughout the amendments.  I hope the Minister recognises that modern communications and technology should mean this can happen very fast.  Even 48 hours is giving too much time to do it.  We have to put it somewhere but as close as possible to immediate is what we should be trying to achieve.</p></speech>

It is not something I am majorly opposed to.  We have engaged with all of the stakeholders, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, victims groups and the Irish Prison Service.  It is three days in Northern Ireland and the UK.  We felt that by aligning this it would be in sync with the legislation in the North and the UK, where there is a lot of crossover.  It is not something I am very opposed to but there is logic given this is the number of days that people have asked for and there is synchronicity with our colleagues in the North.</p></speech>

They could contact the local Garda station within hours of arriving in an area if they wish.  The sooner it is done, the sooner local garda&iacute; are aware that a person who has a past and who has had a conviction for a very serious sexual offence is living in the area or coming to live in there.  The sooner garda&iacute; are aware of this, the more prepared they can be for it.  From this point of view, 48 hours gives them adequate time.  I hope the Minister will agree with this.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that if a person cannot physically present at Garda station, and there are reasons this may be the case, then it should be done by video.  We all have devices that have video cameras on them.  We can use WhatsApp or any type of other video app on the phone to have a conversation with the Garda.  Garda&iacute; need to have the opportunity to see what the individual looks like and what their demeanour is.  This cannot be done over the phone.  We must remember the reason we are moving to a situation where people need to present at a Garda station and engage with garda&iacute; is because of the lack of engagement that has happened up to now.  We are enshrining in this law analogue technology to monitor potentially a high-risk sex offender who is using the latest digital technology to continue the exploitation of children or anyone else they might want to abuse if they so wish or are so inclined.  We are saying in terms of engagement with the Garda they can do it over the phone.  This is not good enough.  The technology is there today to allow this to happen easily by means of a video call.</p><p>That should be the mechanism used in cases where people cannot physically present, for whatever reason, at the local Garda station. </p></speech>

That has happened in certain circumstances.  It also covers remote contact by video, where people are orally talking to someone but via video.  Therefore, this wording covers every way in which the Garda can communicate with the person, except in writing.  As was said, that is not something that will be required.

I can look at the word suggested and see if it covers everything or if there might be room for loopholes.  The intention is that there will be a conversation with someone.  In the small number of cases, and there have been some, where someone had a disability, the Garda have called in person to the individual's house.  The force has got around this issue in its own way.  We can look at this wording and explore this issue, but I cannot give a commitment because I think that &ldquo;orally&rdquo; makes clear there is a requirement to talk to somebody, be that on camera or in person.

The Garda can only take fingerprints and photographs within that time.  This seems to be a tight window.  If the Garda member monitoring sex offenders goes out sick or if there is a serious incident in a particular station, this three-day period seems to be a tight window.  Does the clock start ticking when the offender contacts the station?  Is that when the three-day period kicks in?  Periods such as bank holiday weekends or Christmas could be deliberately used as a mechanism to try to ensure the individual concerned does not provide the relevant information to the Garda.  The three-day window seems to be tight.</p><p>On amendment No. 13, the Garda can only hold an offender&rsquo;s fingerprints for three months after his or her monitoring period has expired.  The reality is that the victims must deal with this impact for the rest of their lives.  We are stipulating, however, that offenders' records will be erased three months after the monitoring period has ceased.  That is not appropriate and it is why I propose this amendment.</p></speech>

The Garda has not asked for a longer period and that is because we have provided for a level of flexibility in this section.  If it is not possible to carry out these tasks within three days, there is flexibility to further extend the period.  I am happy to clarify the position on the seven days and ensure it is clear that it is possible.</p></speech>

This responds to concerns raised that the present definition is too narrow and therefore deems some offenders ineligible.  The deletion proposed will facilitate the inclusion of a slightly wider cohort of offenders, including offenders subject to probation supervision for an offence rather than a sexual offence.  Such offenders would still need to have a previous conviction for a sexual offence to fall within the definition.  These include offenders subject to part-suspended sentence supervision orders, fully-suspended sentence supervision orders, adjourned supervision cases, Circuit Court probation orders and non-statutory supervision cases.  By deleting the text as proposed, all offenders who need to be managed through the sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, process will be included by virtue of widening the definition and, thereby, the cohort.  This just means we will be including more people within this cohort.</p></speech>

In those circumstances, there should be responsibility on the risk assessment team to share the relevant information in managing the risk of harm posed by them.  There needs to be a responsibility and an obligation on the team to share information and it cannot be used as a defence that where they reoffend and violate another human being, they can say that they had discretion or did not believe that the information was relevant.  A doctor, a health professional or a teacher has a legal obligation under the Children First policy in regard to a child who is at risk.  Surely that should be extended, so all relevant information is given and that we are not talking about the discretion of the individuals who are referenced here as to what information they are going to give and to whom they will give that information.  The intention behind this legislation should be that we are protecting women and vulnerable adults in many cases.  We should draft the legislation in that manner rather than giving discretion as to whom information or what information is going to be released.  That is the thrust of those amendments.</p></speech>

What is being proposed here is that there will be a written agreement whereby a particular member of the team will be nominated as a contact point for the victim.  In the case where the offender has served a sentence and is about to be released or is being released that they provide relevant information to the victim, including a notification of the release as soon as practical after the release has occurred and a copy of updated photographs of the offender, and any other such information considered necessary to avoid, mitigate or manage the risk posed by the offender.</p> <p>  On different occasions we have all come across circumstances where individuals have had the shock of their lives when they met the person that had done them serious harm on the street, in the supermarket or wherever and were unaware they had been released or that they were back in the community.  Somebody will have told them that the person is at large again and that they have seen them.  It has been a very traumatic experience for the victim.  We all know that the person who goes to prison is not going to be there forever and that they are going to get out at some stage.  There needs to be a process to prepare the victim for that because in many of these cases the victim has been left behind or certainly feels they have been left behind in the past.  I think there is an opportunity in this legislation to do so.</p> <p>  In the initial draft of this legislation, I thought that one would have to inform the victim when the person was being released but probably that would not be appropriate.  Certainly, as soon as practical after release, it would be important that the victim be made aware of that and as much preparation as possible should be provided to the victim.</p></speech>

There is a degree of flexibility built in.  That is why we have &quot;shall&quot; which allows for that type of information to be shared.  The Attorney General is very clear that those who need access to relevant information shall get it, but those who do not, do not.  There are certain situations where a particular type of information might not be relevant to the individuals involved at a particular time or a particular stage in the process and that is why we put forward the word &quot;shall&quot;.  It gives that little bit of flexibility where it is not necessary to provide that information.</p><p>On the second piece, SORAM<b></b>deals directly with the offenders and not the victims, so we have a separate process through the Victims of Crime Act.  We have the Victims' Charter which we are updating and, hopefully, improving through O'Malley and Supporting a Victim's journey which covers all victims, including those who are victims of sexual assault or crimes.  The Prison Service and the prison liaison officer is there to make sure that if someone is being released, the victim has that information.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a certain point will engage in certain information but certainly when a prisoner is being released, there is already that contact with the prison liaison officer to let a person know.  When it comes to the Parole Board, engagement can happen there.  What has come to light recently in my own engagement with victims is that they were not always aware that they had a right to engage with the Parole Board and that they would then in turn get the information.  We are trying to make it absolutely clear through the Victims' Charter and the Victims of Crime Act that the victim has the right to know when someone is being released, the terms of the release, the timelines, where they might be and all of those different things.  We need to make it as clear as possible but that is done through the Victims of Crime Act.</p><p>In regard to the photograph, this is something we could look at through the Victims of Crime Act.  Obviously, you do not want a situation where you have SORAM<b>, </b>which is not necessarily equipped to deal with victims as opposed to offenders, presenting someone with a photograph if they have not asked for it or if it not something that they require.  If it is something a victim wants and asks for, then perhaps there could be an appropriate mechanism for them to receive that.  I am happy to explore this further and to perhaps to look at it through the Victims of Crime Act but only to do so where a victim wants it, it is appropriate and he or she has asked for it.</p><p>There are circumstances where a picture could be shared if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a concern that a person is in an area they should not be in, or that there are children nearby, or where they are alerting someone to the fact that this person might be in the area.  That is at the discretion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but when it comes to the victim, that is something we need to explore further in the other legislation.  I am very happy to do that. </p></speech>

The victim is not informed automatically.  That needs to be re-examined and a way around it found because many victims do not know when the person is coming out.  They can get early release and it is a shock to the victim.  They do not know that they can seek that information already.  Possibly more information needs given.  It would be better than putting the onus on the victim.  There needs to be a system to get around that.</p></speech>

We will deal with the issue of names later on in the final amendment I put down.</p><p>The name may not have any relevance to the person who is being informed.  The likelihood is that in the cases where this disclosure is being made, the person being informed is aware of the individual.  If, however, an individual is hanging around a school, for example, and the person being informed is the school principal, giving a name to the principal is of little use in that instance; he or she needs to know what the individual looks like.  The requirement for a photograph should be included under section 14E(1)(a).  The Garda will have taken a photograph of the individual when he or she is being put on the register.  The disclosure should include photographic evidence.</p></speech>

In reality, what would happen under the section as drafted is that when a sex offender who is in contact with and has obviously been grooming a child or vulnerable adult is informed this disclosure will be made, he or she will just go to ground.  That means that nobody will be informed and the offender will be free to do the same thing again but on that occasion will be far more careful to ensure his or her movements do not come to the attention of An Garda.  All the offenders will do is refine the grooming mechanism they have been using up to that point to go undetected the next time.  The offenders should not be given advance notice of this information.</p><p>Amendment No. 24 is a technical amendment in respect of what &quot;publication&quot; actually means.  To me, it means the release to a publication and may not, in theory, include social media.  My wording avoids that confusion.  That is the only reason I have tabled the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 proposes that the Commissioner should be obliged to publish details on how he or she intends to assess and manage offenders post release, as well as how and when the information will be provided to other police forces or third parties.</p></speech>

We may be able to consider this further and clarify it.  The wording is that a Garda "shall, in advance of making a disclosure" inform the relevant offender.  It does not state that the member must do so.  That provides flexibility.  The Attorney General is clear that notice must be given.  I do not think there is any way around it but the use of the word "shall" suggests that, for example, a member of An Garda could go to a person who is in a new relationship and explain that his or her partner will be told and give the person an opportunity to make the disclosure himself or herself, move away from his or her partner or disengage from the relationship.  The Deputy mentioned certain other situations and in that context there is an option for the member of An Garda to go directly to the family, school or principal where there is a concern in that regard and not give advance warning.  The word "shall" gives that flexibility to An Garda, which means it does not have to give-----</p></speech>

I will not dwell on it.  I know the Minister or, more so, the Department has taken a position in respect of the approach in this regard.  I have dealt with the Department in respect of this issue for a decade and I doubt it will back down from its position but I want to flag my concern regarding the legislation as drafted in the context of the disclosure of information.  What is being provided is a very restrictive and limited right to information.  It is too restrictive and limited.  All of the discretion in this regard is being left in the hands of An Garda.  While I welcome the fact that An Garda will have the legal right to make a disclosure, an option that has not been available to it until now, there should be a mechanism for members of the public who have responsibility for the protection of a child or vulnerable adult to make an inquiry to An Garda.  I do not have an issue with An Garda then making an evaluation based on the request in respect of whether it decides to disclose.  In fairness, I believe the Garda will take a responsible approach on this issue but it is more about changing the mindset in this country in respect of the principle of disclosure.  It is about giving parents the right to protect and safeguard their child or a vulnerable adult.  Changing the culture in this country will protect far more children.  As the Minister will be aware, similar legislation has been in place in the UK for many years.  I know examples will be given of where it has been abused.  I have put forward amending legislation that provides the correct balance between the rights of parents and guardians and those of the offender.  Where it has happened in the UK, however, only a very small number of disclosures have been made.  Less than 10% of requests have led to a disclosure but in one third of cases it has brought to the attention of the authorities situations that had not previously come to their attention and led to other protection measures being put in place in respect of children.  A cultural change needs to take happen in this country such that people are far more proactive in expressing concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when something just is not right or does not add up.</p></speech>

This is my only opportunity to do so.  I am quite happy to have it out with he Chair but, under Standing Orders, I am within my remit to raise this at this point,.  If the Chair gives me a couple of minutes, I will finish with it before long.  It is a key issue.</p> <p>  I am talking about legislation that passed Second Stage and that was accepted by the then Minister, Alan Shatter.  It was referred to this committee.  It did not progress from the committee on the basis that the legislation before us now was coming forward.  The general scheme was published subsequently, in 2018, and dealt with by the committee, which has led to the legislation before us now.  Reference is made in this legislation to third parties but in very limited terms.  We have already had the conversation about notifying the perpetrator in advance of notifying any potential victim.  We need to go that step further and provide a mechanism for parents and guardians to make proactive contact with the Garda to express a reservation or concern because that may end up bringing to the attention of the Garda a risk to which a child or vulnerable adult is exposed but which is not active at the given moment.</p> <p>  I have put on the D&aacute;il record on a number of occasions incidents where children have been approached at playgrounds or on streets in the city of Dublin, and those incidents were never reported to the Garda or were reported to the Garda only three or four days later.  A cultural change needs to take place such that anything untoward is immediately reported to the Garda.  I do not think the level of disclosure will change, but changing that culture in this legislation and providing a proactive avenue for people to make contact with the Garda if they have concerns such that that route is open to them and a disclosure may be made to the Garda could end up protecting many more children and vulnerable adults.  I ask the Minister to contemplate the matter again in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are in agreement that if something happens, it should be reported immediately, whether it is a child being approached or something more sinister or serious.  If, however, a parent or other individual engages with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is flexibility there.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feels there is a risk or a necessity to disclose certain information, that can be done.  There is not a formal process set out in the legislation or a formal channel, as the Deputy proposes, but that does not prevent An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from disclosing information where it feels there is a particular risk or threat.  I hope we have been clear in the legislation that that flexibility is there.</p><p>The Attorney General's advice and the other legal advice we have is also very clear that the rights must be balanced.  While that might be difficult for people to hear when we are talking about victims, and often children in this regard, there has to be that certain balance.  That is what we have tried to do in order that this does not apply in all instances in which information is disclosed.  I do not think that is helpful for rehabilitation or, in some instances, safer communities, but there are instances in which people should be given information and in which individuals in particular cases should be aware of particular individuals.  That discretion is there, although there is no formal channel <i>per se</i>.  I am not sure how in the UK that formal channel works separately from somebody going into a police station, requesting information or giving information and then it subsequently being given back to them, but that, essentially, is available here, albeit at the discretion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda&iacute; know all the facts of the cases and of the individuals, and we are entrusting them to make that decision, albeit quite a big decision.  Given that they are the ones who have all the information, they are the appropriate people to make that decision.</p></speech>

Such perpetrators are then released back into the community.  They have orders placed on them, but if such an individual harasses the victim or hangs around the vicinity of where the victim resides or works, that victim has to go through a completely separate and new legal process.  It is considered a new offence, and that should not happen.  When the witness is useful to the State in achieving a conviction, protection is afforded to him or her during the investigation, the pre-trial and the trial proceedings.  At that stage we are talking about only an alleged offender, but once that individual changes from being an alleged offender to being a convicted offender, the protection that applies to the victim evaporates with that conviction.  There is no way the victim can at present be protected from secondary and repeated victimisation, intimidation or retaliation by a convicted offender.  We need to reflect clearly in the legislation the current shortcomings and to address those shortcomings by continuing that protection of the victim after the sex offender is released from prison such that he or she cannot go back and re-victimise the victim and effectively re-abuse the victim through the threat of intimidation or harassment.  The law needs to be strengthened in this area.  As I have said before, we do not want to see victims re-abused, which I feel is happening.  The Minister is aware of a case.  I am aware of a case in my constituency in which this level of intimidation is going on but it is at a level that will not secure a new conviction.  It should not have to come to that.  This is a continuation of abuse that has gone on previously.  That should be taken into consideration and protection provided to that individual and all other individuals who find themselves in similar circumstances.  That is the focus of amendment No. 27.</p><p>As for amendment No. 31, again, we should protect the public from harm, not just serious harm.  What is the definition of serious harm compared with the definition of harm?  Again, we are qualifying the right to protection there, and that is not appropriate.</p><p>I think I have addressed the amendments, if the Minister wishes to respond.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is discretion for any judge to say that, on release, the person cannot engage with a person or go within X amount of miles of a person, but I am also aware that does not always happen.  Understanding the case the Deputy mentioned and knowing that this is happening not just to one individual but to many others, a new civil order I am proposing as part of the stalking and harassment legislation would enable a person to bring forward a case to the civil court without having to go through a criminal process or procedure.</p><p>It is obviously much more challenging and lengthy to essentially have a civil protection order against an individual where they engage in particular types of behaviour, such as communicating to, at or with the person through another person, directly interfering with the person's day-to-day lives or causing alarm or distress.  It does not have to be that they are physically engaging with the person all of the time and it could be through many and various different means.  Once the person is able to show some form of evidence of those different behaviours, which are set out clearly in the stalking legislation, then he or she would be able to receive a civil protection mechanism, which in certain instances would be hugely helpful.</p><p> I hope that matter will be dealt with.  What I might do is make sure that as that separate legislation is progressing, it covers this type of instance where there are people who have been victims of sexual offences and where the perpetrators are released and are engaging.  I will 100% make sure that that covers it.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the longer the custodial sentence, the shorter the maximum period of the monitoring post release.  If that is the case, it is absolutely crazy.  We are saying that the more heinous the crime and the higher the severity of the custodial sentence, the less time the person can be monitored post release.  I hope I have interpreted it wrong but that is where I am coming from in this amendment.</p></speech>

Therefore, if the maximum sentence is ten years and he or she serves five, the prohibition is five years.  In a lot of the serious cases, it is life imprisonment, so it means it would apply for life.  This refers to where it is not a life sentence.  As I said, if it was a particular crime where the maximum penalty is ten years and somebody serves five years, then the maximum that can be applied in terms of an outright prohibition is five years to bring it up to the ten.  In the most severe cases, a person will generally receive a life sentence.  Obviously, that means he or she goes before the parole board after 12 years and goes through that whole process, but that would mean it is an outright ban for life, irrespective of whether he or she gets out after 15 or 20 years, or whatever other length of time.</p> <p>  This is set out in the legal advice as to how this must be applied.  There are obviously other mechanisms.  If it is a sentence that has a maximum of ten years, as in the example I have given, there are obviously other mechanisms in place so an offender must still inform his or her employer that he or she has been convicted of a sexual offence.  There is also a Garda vetting process and anybody who engages with children will have to go through that process if they are being employed, be it by a charity, a community, a school or any other type of environment.  There are those built-in mechanisms separate to where somebody is serving a life sentence, where it would apply for the remainder of the person's life.</p></speech>

First, in terms of the register, is there a limit to how long they are on the register after release from prison?  Can there be a situation where the person is on the register following release from prison but not precluded from working with children, and it is only that they have to inform their employer?  Could a situation like that arise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-26a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2022042600002#M01500"><p>No, there is no timeline for being on the register but people have a constitutional right to work and to make a living, and outright restrictions impede on that constitutional right, so if there is a ten-year sentence, the outright ban constitutes a further penalty and we cannot go beyond the maximum sentence.  If it is ten years and the person serves eight, we cannot apply it for another five because that goes beyond the maximum penalty.  As I said, any type of abuse or assault is a serious case, but where life is given as the sentence, this would apply for life.  I can only assume that in all circumstances where somebody applies for a job and gives the information that they are a sex offender, they are unlikely to get a job where they are working with children or in contact with vulnerable people.  Obviously, that is up to the employer but I would assume that is the case.  There is also a Garda vetting process so if somebody is a danger or a risk, that would clearly be made known to the employer as well.</p> <p>  There is a legal element to this.  The advice we have been given is that we cannot go above the maximum penalty.  An outright ban is a penalty.  It impedes on people's constitutional rights so that is a much bigger question around the constitutional right to earn a living.  If somebody has served their sentence, the same as with any other type of offence, they have a legal right to get on with their life, to try to earn a living and to make their way.  While we are talking about sexual offences, which are particularly heinous crimes, and it is very difficult to comprehend how someone has the same rights and mobility as with a different type of offence, the law is clear in that regard.  In the vast majority of these cases, a life sentence is often the sentence that is handed down and that would mean the outright ban.</p> <p>  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from, I really do, but it is very clear in terms of the law and the Constitution what we can actually do here.  However, through the Garda vetting process and through the explicit need to inform the employer, we have tried to put other mechanisms in place.</p></speech>

What we are saying here is that if a person squats in a premises or declares themselves homeless, then they cannot be tagged or the tag they have on has to be removed.  There is an incentive there for someone to make themselves homeless in order to lose the electronic tag that they have.  We must remember that those individuals who are going to be tagged are only those who are considered at high risk.  I think we are providing a loophole in the legislation to allow high-risk sex offenders who should be electronically tagged a way out of not being electronically tagged on the basis that they are squatting somewhere, or have declared themselves homeless.</p></speech>

We cannot put equipment into somebody's house without his or her permission and that is what this allows for.  If a convicted offender is staying in a property, be it rented or otherwise, we must seek the permission of the owner to install this equipment.  The legal advice is that it is important this happens.</p> <p>  Regarding what Deputy Naughten has said about those who are more likely to reoffend, the evidence we have is that it is more likely that people who want to reform will take an electronic tag.  It is often part of the terms of an agreement for early release.  If an offender is released early, it is often on the basis that he or she wears an electronic tag.  If this is breached and the offender does not wear it, he or she is put back in prison.  Particularly in female cases, there is a higher percentage who would present for this type of an approach because it means they have an opportunity to be released sooner.  They are obviously monitored and that presents a better outcome.  However, I go back to my previous point about psychosexual treatment.  If someone does not admit his or her guilt and does not want to reform, taking part in therapy or wearing an electronic tag will not change his or her behaviour.  The tag means we know where he or she is but it does not necessarily prevent something from happening.</p> <p>  The section itself is very much dealing with the need to make sure a person is happy for particular technology to be put into his or her home, rented property or apartment in which somebody is staying.  If an offender does not comply with the actual restriction of movement and the use of electronic tagging, he or she is simply put back into prison because he or she is in breach of the terms of release.</p></speech>

I can be tracked anywhere through my mobile phone and there is nothing in my home that is included in that.  Surely it is quite easy to put a tamper-proof bracelet onto someone's wrist or ankle, similar to that device, that does not require anything to be put in the home.</p></speech>

Perhaps technology will evolve, but if it is at the stage where something, albeit something small, needs to be installed, then the Bill allows for that.  This does not really do anything other than ensure there is permission from the homeowner.  If somebody is released from prison and he or she cannot comply with release commitments that include wearing a tag that is working effectively, then he or she is in breach of the release conditions and will be sent back to prison.  That is very clear and is set out in the Bill.</p> <p>  As I said already, the evidence that has come back to us is that those who actually engage with this in other jurisdictions are more likely not to reoffend because they want to get out early and get on with their lives, although I appreciate that does not apply to everybody.  It is a challenging issue.  Electronic tagging does not prevent somebody from committing a crime but it means we know where he or she was when the crime was committed.  Obviously, somebody being in a particular place at a particular time does not mean the offence has been committed; it just forms part of the evidence.  Deleting this section would remove our ability to make sure this can be applied wherever a person is residing.</p></speech>

We can put a microchip on a tractor and trailer that has a very small long-life battery and that can be monitored remotely from a satellite.  There are probably hundreds of such devices across the Minister's constituency in County Meath.  The same would not be true of mine and Deputy Kenny's constituency, where there are only small tractors and trailers that are not worth robbing.</p></speech>

I accept the 50 electronic tags the Irish Prison Service obtained a number of years ago may require this type of legislation but technology has moved on.  I do not think there is a need for this provision in the context of the type of technology that is now available.  If we can monitor tractors and trailers using equipment that does not require a base station, surely we can do the same with sex offenders.  I will leave it with the Minister and she might consider it further.</p></speech>

It does not mean there is a requirement for permission for anything else.  If nothing needs to be installed, then no permission is needed.  The provision is there in case permission is needed.  I accept that technology has moved on, but at the same time, if some element of technology is required, this will cover that and make sure there is no issue with getting somebody's permission.</p></speech>

An offence under section 2 of the Act of 1935 (defilement of girl between 15 and 17 years of age).&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This proposed amendment seeks to reinsert two offences into the Schedule that were previously removed in error.  I thank Deputy McNamara for drawing my attention to this during the Second Stage debate.  I propose inserting an offence under section 1 of the Act of 1935 - defilement of a girl under 15 years of age - and an offence under section 2 of the Act of 1935 - defilement of a girl between 15 and 17 years of age - into the Schedule of the 2001 Act.  This amendment is on foot of legal advice received by the Department arising from the identification of a lacuna in the Sex Offenders Act in which both of these offences had been removed from the Schedule through the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.  Neither offence now appears in the Schedule to the 2001 Act and this amendment will restore both to the Schedule.</p></speech>

I accept these are two specific pieces of legislation but I ask her to assure us this does not have implications in terms of the defilement of a boy under the age of 15 or between the ages of 15 and 17.

An anomaly was brought to my attention by a colleague in the UK who has been highlighting an issue with regard to deed polls, which are being used to change individual's names to try to circumvent the sex offender's register there.  As sure as night follows day, if a loophole is being exploited in the UK, that same loophole will be exploited here, either by individuals convicted here or, because of the common travel area, individuals convicted in the UK who subsequently reside here.</p><p>Sex offenders change their names to make it more difficult for members of the public or for the Garda to track and monitor them.  I highlighted on Second Stage an example of a sex offender, Mr. Terry Price, who conducted a string of sexual offences over three decades and changed his name five times, including on one occasion when he was in prison.  One of his victims waived her right to anonymity to highlight the issue and Mr. Price went on to change his name again.  Sex offenders should not be allowed to change their names and definitely should not be able to do so while in prison.  That right should be revoked in the case of convicted sex offenders.  However, at a very minimum, as I have set out in this legislation, there is a responsibility on the authorities to inform the Garda of the change of name.  As the law currently stands, it is the responsibility of the sex offenders to inform the Garda that they have changed their names.  I believe this will be used to circumvent the monitoring legislation we have before us.  It will lead to the abuse of victims in the future and I believe this particular loophole needs to be closed off.</p></speech>

Following our most recent engagement, we asked if further legislative provisions are needed and the Garda authorities have assured us that the Sex Offenders Act 2001 is clear that it is an offence for offenders to change their names without notifying the Garda.  If they are giving their personal details, including their names and addresses, on a regular basis, as they are required to do, the Garda will become aware of any change.  If the Garda is not notified or given that information, the sex offender is in breach of the Act and subject to an investigation by the Garda and potentially in breach of the conditions of their release.  The sex offender may then be sent back to prison.  It is already an offence for a sex offender to change his or her name without notifying the Garda.</p> <p>  People who have served their time in prison, as is the case with respect to any offence, have a legal right to change their names.  However, sex offenders cannot do so without notifying the Garda.  We have gone back and forth with the Garda on this point to see if there is anything further we can do to strengthen the position.  The Garda has said the legislation in place is strong enough for it to be able to do its work.  In the absence of high-risk offenders, this is something that would be noted quickly due to the notification requirements that are set out, and the court website publishes any changes to names anyway.  People cannot hide the fact they have changed their names because those changes are published on a court website and are there for people to see, including members of the Garda.  I appreciate the situation is not perfect when the individual concerned is required to notify the authorities but if he or she does not do so, it is a criminal offence and the offender is potentially in breach of his or her terms of release.</p></speech>

It is a register in name only.  Even though we have such a lax sex offenders register in this country, the Garda comes across at least one person every week who is in breach of it.  The Garda usually comes across them for other offences and as a result of that, the offender is charged for the breach of the conditions relating to the sex offenders register.  The offender has either changed address and not informed the Garda or never registered in the first place.  We are talking about people who are not compliant with the terms and conditions that are being placed on them after their release from prison.  Enforcement is quite lax at the moment.  We are now asking those individuals to inform the Garda if they change their names.  We know that their peers in the UK are not doing that and as a result, convicted sex offenders who have changed their names are not being monitored by the police in the UK.  Some such offenders have been identified in this country in the past.  People who are on the register in the UK have not registered here despite residing in this country.  It is not good enough for us to leave the onus with convicted sex offenders, who for one reason or another are trying to avoid detection, to inform the Garda that they have changed their names.  There needs to be a strengthening of the legislation in this area.</p></speech>

The amendment requires a report to be placed before the D&aacute;il within six months of the passing of the Act.  The Garda has said that what is in place is strong enough.  We cannot prevent people from changing their names when they have served their time because that is what applies in other types of criminal offence.  The only thing we can do is to ensure it is a criminal offence for the Garda not to be notified.  The penalty is obviously a severe one if somebody breaches that order.  I am not sure what we can do when the Garda is saying that what it has is strong enough, save banning people from changing their names, which is not something we can legally do.</p></speech>

I am suggesting that legal provision should be put in place so the Courts Service must check if someone is on the sex offenders register and then must inform the Garda that individual A has changed his or her name to individual B.  There would be an obligation on the Courts Service to check if an individual is on the register and if so, the local Garda station must then be contacted and told the individual's new name.  That is what I am looking for.</p> <p>  The difficulty arises because the way people change their names at the moment means I cannot draft an amendment.  I would have attempted to draft such an amendment otherwise.  I have submitted this amendment so we find a mechanism to oblige the Courts Service, as part of this process, to check with the Garda if an individual is on the sex offenders register.  If the individual is on the register, the Courts Service must inform the Garda of any name change.  With email and everything else, this should not be difficult to do.  It would ensure that the Garda has access to this information and is not relying solely on a sex offender to provide the information.  The situation now means that if the offender does not provide that information, the Garda must compile a file, submit it to the Director of Public Prosecutions and secure a conviction.  The Garda has to go through a long and drawn-out process to enforce such a breach when a simple email could circumvent all of that.</p></speech>

We are both saying the information is there.  If people change their names, that is registered on the court website and if they do not notify the Garda, they are in breach of their obligations.  Perhaps there is a way outside the legislation for that notification to apply.  I do not know if that is possible.  As it currently stands, I cannot accept the amendment.  I appreciate from where the Deputy is coming but the Garda has said it feels the law in place is strong enough.</p> <p>  He said that the situation in the UK is that people are not complying and it is not being followed up on.  We expect that the Garda, in applying the legislation, will ensure that serious offenders report and engage with the Garda on a regular basis.  If it transpires that the requirements are not being applied as they should be and as they are clearly set out, we can amend the legislation, as is the case with all legislation.  It is simply a matter of linking two pieces of information together and making that information clear and accessible.</p></speech>

This practice is happening.  It is happening across the Irish Sea as we speak.  The authorities there are trying to close off this abuse of the loophole in the legislation.  My point is that as we are dealing with this legislation, now is the time to deal with this anomaly and to address it once and for all.  Perhaps the Minister might think about this before Report Stage.  I withdraw my amendment, with leave to reintroduce it on Report Stage.  I will be bringing in my boxing gloves the next day.</p></speech>

I flag now that I will be bringing further amendments on Report Stage, including to revise the text of subsection 7B of the principal Act regarding the extension of the time between notifications.  Under subsection 7A, the amendment would clarify that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of inspector, may specify a period of more or less than three days, where he or she is satisfied it would be appropriate to do so.  However, that member of the force is not required to inform the person of such variation.  Such informing can be done by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  I will also be bringing forward an amendment which will require persons convicted of sexual offences to provide their previous addresses since the date of conviction.  I also mentioned earlier that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had flagged some concerns regarding the sharing of information with other police services.  I sought legal advice concerning specific circumstances, and I will be bringing forward amendments on Report Stage with the aim of balancing the disclosure and information requirements.</p></speech>
