I thank them both for making themselves available for this meeting.  We have been holding our pre-consultation budget hearings since April and these have included engagement with: the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO; the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC; the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI; and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI. I have just realised that this list includes just about every collection of alphabet soup one could have.  We are delighted to be joined by two nationally recognised economists in order to hear their perspectives on budget 2020.</p><p>Before we take opening statements, I will attend to some of the usual housekeeping duties with our statement on privilege.  I advise those in attendance of the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice members to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019062500002#Q00100"><p>Yesterday, I circulated some notes and I will now run through a few points very quickly.  It is my view, and it is a view that I am sure committee members have heard from the entire alphabet soup referred to by the Chairman, that really we probably should have tightened budget policy a few years back as the recovery matured.  We are now in a position where if things get troublesome we will not have as much latitude as we might have had.</p> <p>  Government spending can be financed by raising tax revenue, selling Government debt or, if a country has its own currency, it can get its central bank to buy government debt or just print currency.  Since we abolished the currency in 1999, essentially we have been using an external currency so we cannot create liquidity for the Government via the Central Bank.  This is a constraint.  The implication of this is if the Government ever does wish to run deficits, and there are perfectly good reasons it might from time to time, those deficits can only be financed through the sale of Government debt in the market.</p> <p>  We all remember that back in 2010, despite two years in which the Government did everything it could think of, as it raised taxes and cut current and capital spending, we failed to retain market access and ended up in an IMF troika programme, as committee members know.  The trouble with leaving ourselves in this situation is we end up having an austerity programme that is not really of our choice and the timing of which is not of our choice.</p> <p>  This is year six of an expansion.  The economy began to recover almost six years ago.  The budget is balanced again, as the Minister for Finance pointed out in his statement earlier this afternoon.  This is true, and it is tempting to argue that expenditure increases or even tax cuts can be afforded.  The difficulty is there are various icebergs out there.  There will be a public finance crisis at some stage over the next number of years; there always is.  The reasons for expecting a slowdown include the end of the recovery phase, the difficult external environment and Brexit.</p> <p>  The point about recoveries is that they end.  One can recover only once.  We started off with a 16% unemployment rate and it has reduced to 4.5%.  We cannot repeat this.  We cannot use spare capacity in the economy more than once.  There are already labour shortages in many sectors.  More than 300,000 jobs were lost during the downturn and we had net outward migration and very high unemployment.  A period of very rapid employment growth, as we have seen, eventually exhausts the excess labour supply.</p> <p>  We know about the external environment.  There is the risk of a trade war.  A slowdown in the USA, should it happen, and the recovery there is pretty mature also and the US economy is pretty close to full employment, would hit Ireland a bit harder than elsewhere.  One of the reasons we have done well in recent years is because the US has been doing well.  The US is a big export market for Ireland and it is also a big source of inward investment.  This cuts both ways and if things slowdown in the US it will hurt us at little bit more than it would hurt others.  The medium-term prospects in Europe are not very encouraging and, of course, Ireland is very exposed to Brexit.</p> <p>  I am now showing the committee a slide of the unplanned component in recent spending increases.  It is from the recent report of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  This is a particularly worrying feature of recent budgets.</p><p>The economy was clearly recovering quickly three years ago.  Arguably, we should have tried to move the fiscal position into a stronger place as long ago as 2016.  One can see that there have been big spending increases in each of these years over and above what was voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  These are the unplanned increases which had to be funded by Supplementary Estimates.  The big worry, which was highlighted by IFAC, is corporation tax which is very volatile.  Corporation tax could revenues could weaken for cyclical reasons or because there are changes in the international corporate tax regime.  Along the way, steadier sources of tax revenue have been proposed and these have been sacrificed, particularly water charges.  The residential property tax, which was introduced, has been kept at very low levels.  These are, however, stable sources of tax revenue.</p><p> Another issue is that we tax cars on purchase quite heavily.  We have VAT when one purchases a car but we also have vehicle registration tax.  The number of new cars sold in Ireland fell by two thirds during the crash with several hundred million euro vanishing in purchase taxes on cars.  There is an alternative where one can tax fuel or one can tax cars annually.  We do both of these things.  When we were trying to remove the volatility from tax base, one of the proposals that was considered but was not implemented was to get rid of the big purchase tax on cars and push up fuel tax and the annual tax to make up for the lost revenue.  That does not deliver any extra revenue, which will remain the same, but it will be less volatile.  It is worth reminding ourselves of that as new car sales virtually disappeared from early 2008 until 2010.  It was not as big a collapse as with stamp duty on commercial and residential property but it is a transactions tax.</p><p> There are other similar taxes.  Inheritance tax is a kind of transaction tax as a lot of it is related to the realisation of property assets on death.  Capital gains tax is a tax on the realisation of capital gains.  There are good reasons for having taxes on capital and wealth but there are still quite a few taxes in the Irish tax code that are transactions-type taxes.  We need to move away from them.</p><p> There is a risk in current policy.  People who draw attention to the high level of outstanding sovereign debt and contrast that with the very low level of sovereign debt which did not save us.  The last time we got into trouble the opening level of sovereign debt did not save us because we had borrowed so much so fast and the banks went bust.  We ended up in an IMF programme anyway, even with a very favourable starting position relative to where we are now.  The people who are saying that we should have been more cautious about budget policy in the last few years and should continue to be now are not saying that there are not occasionally reasons to run budget deficits, but on the other side of the coin is that one should be running budget surpluses when things are going really well and when one has full employment.  The benefit of doing that is that one will avoid the imperative of unplanned and badly timed austerity down the road.  That is the big risk.  The last two Governors of the Central Bank, various people in the ESRI, the OECD, the IMF, and all sorts of people, have been pointing this out for the last few years, that because Ireland is now a heavily indebted country, and because these very low Government bond interest rates are not going to last forever, we are vulnerable if there is an international slowdown, and particularly if there is a resumption of trouble in the eurozone bond market.  That is the case for being cautious about budget policy and for lamenting that we have not been cautious in the last few years.</p><p>It is not because there is anything wrong with deficits.  It is fine to have an active stabilisation policy but we need to ensure our balance sheet is in a position to sustain it and ours is not.  We ought to have reassured the volunteer lenders, on whom we will have to rely unless we want to go into another IMF programme, that we have the budget in small surplus and will try to keep it there.</p></speech>

I have relatively similar points to make as Mr. McCarthy so I will not repeat what he said, with which I agree wholeheartedly.  However, if two economists are in a room, there is not one opinion; there are probably three.</p> <p>  I wish to place where we are now in its international historical context and to discuss things this committee can push for in terms of the budget scrutiny process for the Government.  Elva Bova and her IMF colleagues looked at the fiscal impact by crisis type for many different types of crisis, so crises of state-run enterprises, their percentage of GDP costs and subnational governments when they get into trouble.  This is a data set from 1970 to today from across the world.  Two things are very clear.  The average cost of a crisis is about 3% of GDP across all different types.  The financial crisis is the most expensive in terms of the fiscal cost - the actual cash cost - to the taxpayer.  As Mr. McCarthy rightly said, this did not come because we printed a load of money.  We did not get out of it that way; we got out of it by simply borrowing more.  The graph shows Ireland at 39% - the total cost of bailing out the banks and everything else.  It is the fourth largest bailout of any kind anywhere in the world.  That is the first and most important point to recognise.  We tend to be relatively insular when it comes to our debate here.  I want us to understand that this is the scale of the crisis we wish to avoid.</p> <p>  The same data are than ranked by time rather than by type.  In 2008, the dot above Ireland is Iceland.  I have done much work comparing the crises in Iceland and Ireland.  One would imagine they would be relatively similar, but when one digs into the detail they are very different stories.  Iceland in particular is a story of firms that built up too much debt, whereas Ireland is a story of households.</p> <p>  To echo Mr. McCarthy's point, I will look at the volatility of the various tax categories from 1984 to 2017.  This comes from the Parliamentary Budget Office, one of the excellent new institutions that have been founded in recent years to increase the amount of economic analysis we can do.  This compares the mean rate of growth which is on the vertical axis with volatility.  Treating the tax category like a financial asset and comparing its rate of return with its risk - volatility is a way of measuring risk - we see capital taxes are up at the top.  Corporation tax and stamp duty are also way out there, but excise duty, income tax, customs duty and VAT are at the bottom.  The most predictable, most stable and least volatile categories are down in the bottom left hand corner.</p> <p>  The problem everyone has highlighted is that corporation tax is highly volatile.  The problem is that it has been volatile upwards; it has been continually growing.  Based on figures from the Department of Finance 2010 to 2013, inclusive, as the rate of tax revenue has come in, the rate of expenditure has levelled up to match it.  The concern everyone has is that there will be a shock to corporation tax, but everyone is talking about a negative shock.  I think an almost greater risk is with a further increase in corporation tax in the future.</p><p>We tend to think in terms of negative or downside risks, but there are also upside risks.  If the rate of increase in corporation tax yield continues for the next two, three or four years, Ireland could be in the position we were in 2005, two years ahead of stamp duty receipts reaching an all-time high in 2007.  Let us imagine we were there in terms of our corporation tax yield and we were facing into another two years of it growing.  With that unsustainable growth, the level of expenditure growth would increase and then the bottom might drop out of it.  That is the concern I would have.</p><p> The next slide shows our sources of tax revenue over a 30-year time period.  Every time we have faced a period of crisis, income tax is used to flex and make the economy work.  Successive governments as they have come into periods of growth have weakened the income tax lever and revenue has magically appeared from other areas, for example, stamp duty and then obviously nowadays corporation tax.</p><p> The next slide on the uses of revenue shows we essentially spend our money on paying people and current tax transfers.  Despite all the noise about the national development plan and everything else, it is essentially a payments system.  While that is a pity, it means by definition decreasing Government expenditure automatically hammers transfers, resulting in increasing inequality.</p><p> I really like the next chart and not just because it took me ages to make it, but because it puts Ireland in our international perspective.  Ireland is shown in the middle.  It shows we spend a fair amount of our money on social protection.  I stress that there are categorisation issues, as the OECD always has such issues.  Ireland spends 32.7% on social protection, a fair amount on health and then there is everything else.  We are a traditional northern European state in this sense.  However, we do not spend as much on social protection as other states.  When we come to talk shortly about automatic stabilisers, I would like members to keep this in mind.  We do not spend as much on lower-income households as other wealthy states.</p><p> What can this committee do?  Essentially this committee exists to increase the amount of budget scrutiny.  The Minister for Finance should never stand up and say something where the rest of the Cabinet say, "What?  Is that really so?"  We should not have that as an outcome.  We want a far more stable budgetary process.</p><p> In the 1960s Richard Musgrave came up with a framework stating that the public finances should do three things: stabilise the macroeconomy; have an efficient resource allocation; and redistribute resources.  The previous slide showed how we redistribute our State's resources relative to the rest of our economy.  It is difficult to compute the efficiency of the resource allocation element.  We know there will be a macroeconomic stabilisation element to what we have to do in the coming period.  We know this will be a problem - Brexit or otherwise.  The summer economic statement, which was published a couple of hours ago, makes considerable mention of this.</p><p> The next slide has a blue box showing where we are in the budget cycle.  We are at the budget preparation stage.  However, I would like to see this committee sponsor far more analysis around the budget cycle.  This is a really important point.  The level of economic analysis we can do now is far greater than in 2005 or 2006 as highlighted in the Wright report.  However, we still have not filled out the institutional architecture that countries like the Netherlands and the United States have.  We still do not have, for example, dynamic scoring.  It is not possible for a political party to propose introducing a wealth tax and be able to know how much it will cost; these things are not done yet.</p><p> In particular we do not have a study that shows if corporation tax yield drops by 5% how much it would cost and where will we get the money to fund overruns in education and health.</p><p>We cannot do fiscal stress tests.  I really believe that this committee should sponsor fiscal stress tests.  It would also be useful to sponsor the development of policies around automatic stabilisers.  By this I mean that we need to get away from this discussion, that is, talking about the &euro;2.8 billion that is left after we pay for everything or talking about the budgetary envelope around the fiscal space.  We need to get away from debate centred on the extra increment.  We should be debating the larger issues of the day.  This can be done by establishing an institutional architecture that is largely independent of the budget cycle, in other words, the particular process with which the Executive deals.  We should find a way to integrate the climate advisory group, the fiscal advisory group, and the national risk assessment.  It would be excellent if the knowledge from all three, which talk about aspects of the same function, could be brought together under this committee and if this committee could sponsor that work.  It would be excellent because they are, in a way, the same thing.  With a bit of extra costing, the development of budgetary strategy into the future could be informed.  </p><p> Figure 7 presents the picture based on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's excellent report.  It refers to GDP by volume which, if one looks at the vertical axis, ranges between 120 and 140, with 2015 constituting the base value of 100.  The range of outcomes is extremely broad.  Communicating that level of uncertainty to the public is the job of this committee and of Members of the Oireachtas.  As somebody who, as members might imagine, talks to people about the economy a fair bit, I am not convinced that people really understand the likely downsides of this for them.  I firmly believe that people are still waiting for that understanding.  Saying that it is going to be bad or that it might be bad is not precise enough for most people.  I will stop there.  I thank the committee very much.</p></speech>

We use the term "witnesses" for some strange reason.  I thank them for their service over the years, particularly Mr. McCarthy who has done the State some service over decades.  I will start with an observation or two on what Dr. Kinsella said.  In some of the work we have done over recent months, the committee has picked away at the common themes that have been coming up over the past two years.  These include our exposure to corporation tax receipts, doing something about the carbon tax in last year's budget and equalising duty on petrol and duty.  That is what I like about this committee.  It is important for us to try to be objective, although we have political differences.  The politics comes in when we go back to our parties.</p> <p>  Dr. Kinsella is right that there have been missed opportunities with regard to stable sources of revenues.  The local property tax is one example, as he indicated.  Objectively, these issues have been fudged.  We have asked how one can tell that the corporation tax take will decrease.  The most recent group we asked was IFAC but we have also asked the IMF in informal discussions.  The answer is that, given enough time, it cannot do anything but drop.  That response is just not scientific enough, although we all believe it is going to happen.  The IMF was the only group to gesture to any kind of modelling having been done in this regard.  I take Dr. Kinsella's point and, if we have time, we should try to model the consequences of a 5% drop in corporation tax receipts and to ask how we will fund ourselves in the absence of that money.</p> <p>  We are getting a slightly better picture of why corporation tax receipts have ballooned in the past two years.  Do the witnesses have any insight into the scenario beyond 2020, excluding aspects that are obvious to laypersons like me, for example, American pressure on corporation tax policy?  Can they offer us any insight we have not been offered before with regard to the likely longevity of the current level of receipts?</p><p>The revenue in this regard dropped last month.  We are told that May is the biggest month and June the next biggest, so we will be watching out for the June statistics.  Is there anything the witnesses feel needs to be said to this committee about corporation tax which has not been said?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019062500002#V00200"><p>Dr. Kinsella was careful to avoid predicting what is going to happen to corporation tax revenue.  This is the big point Seamus Coffey and his colleagues were making.  These receipts are inherently very volatile.  In the 1990s we decided to have a low rate of corporation tax.  We used to have a 40% rate for services companies and a 10% rate for manufacturing companies.  That had to go and it was decided to do two things simultaneously.  One was to have a low rate for everybody.  The rate chosen was 12.5%.  The second thing decided at that time, which people have forgotten, was to close many of the loopholes.  There used to be a magnificent stunt one could avail of under section 84 of the Finance Act.  Under this the banks, and many others, did not pay the 40% rate.  We had a pretend rate of 40%, which many did not pay.  The decision taken in the 1990s was to introduce a low rate of corporation tax with the snag that it must actually be paid.  Many European countries pretend to have high rates of corporation tax but, if one looks at the data, they do not collect as much as one would expect given their high nominal rates.  There is a lot of hypocrisy about corporation tax internationally.</p> <p>  In the period since the rate was introduced, for reasons on which I am not an expert, with the benefit of lots of lawyers and tax accountants, corporations have found endless ways to not pay even the 12.5%.  They have also managed to route profit through Ireland, much of which really belongs to the US Department of the Treasury.  There are weaknesses in the US tax code and, using international tax treaties, quick detours through the Dutch tax system, and so on, these outfits have been able to route a lot of taxable profits through Ireland, paying us some money while avoiding paying somebody else even more.  This was not the intention of the corporation tax reforms introduced in the early 1990s.  It is not what we set out to do but it is what has eventually happened.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Lahart's question, these receipts are just very volatile.  Mr. Coffey and his colleagues have said that a portion of the bonus unexpected receipts in recent years should not have been put into the State budget at all.  We should have said "thanks very much" and used the money to reduce indebtedness.  I agree with Dr. Kinsella that in the longer term we should seek to not be so dependant on this volatile type of revenue.  The way to reduce dependence on it is to do precisely as has been suggested, that is, to use the unexpected corporation tax revenue to pay down debt.</p> <p>  On the other point about volatility, staff in the Parliamentary Budget Office have written some very interesting papers about volatility in tax revenue.  Dr. Kinsella mentioned one of them.  They have looked at a seven-way breakdown of tax heads, such as VAT, excise duty, and income tax, and at the volatility in each one.  They could be broken down a bit further.  There are a few volatile tax heads lurking inside some of these aggregates about which something could be done.  I mentioned VRT.  This could be substituted with fuel taxes and so on.  </p> <p>  My final, very quick, point is that if the Government succeeds in getting everybody to drive electric cars - the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced last Monday that we will all be driving electric cars in ten years' time - it will be a disaster for the Exchequer because electricity cannot be dyed green in the same way as diesel.  The fuel tax component of tax revenues will become problematic if cars are powered by electricity.  As I understand it, there is nothing technical that can be done about that.  We are also now providing huge subsidies.  We can afford to subsidise electric cars with benefit-in-kind relief and so on as long as nobody takes up the offer.</p><p>If people start saying that is a great idea and everybody races off and buys electric cars, those subsidies will have to be withdrawn.  We will have to dream up a new way of taxing road transport.  I am not against significant taxes on road transport at all but the way we do it will have to be reviewed.  The tax strategy group mentioned this in its mid-year report last year.  We may have to look at congestion charges, more modern methods of tolling and so on because we may end up without a big slice of the fuel tax.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019062500002#W00200"><p>I will pick up on two points.  The great value of this committee is that it is strategic.  It is able to think beyond the day to day and if I was going to advise it to do anything, it would be to be cognisant of three issues.  The first is that these fiscal stress tests matter.  For example, if half the country wakes up tomorrow and decides not to pay their property tax, it will have no impact on the budgetary surplus of the State because it amounts to less than &euro;1 billion.  If half of the corporations wake up tomorrow and decide not to pay corporation tax, we will not be able to afford to run the health system.  It matters which taxes do not get paid and where the volatility is.  Fiscal stress tests should be part of what this committee reports on.  They are not difficult to do and the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, can do them.  The committee has had the International Monetary Fund, IMF, before it.  The IMF has developed methodology that is not difficult and that can be done with an Excel spreadsheet.</p> <p>  Second, it is important that we understand that corporation tax the one that is volatile now.  Via the base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, process, it looks like we will have a co-ordinated tax system in five years where we are forced to have our corporation tax go up from 12.5% to, let us say, 17% and that is true of everyone.  We may end up flush with corporation tax revenue which is an upside risk.  We still should not spend that massively because we do not understand the tax elasticity.  We do not understand the responsiveness.  If corporation tax that a small number of corporations pay is jacked up, we do not understand the impact that will have on their behaviours.  We are going to be an interesting experimental case study for that but only to those studying us in the future.  It is going to suck to do it in the present and politics is, of course, of the present.</p> <p>  The final issue relates to automatic stabilisers.  The economic statement is two budgets.  One is business as usual and the other means we allow automatic stabilisers do the job and go into deficit, which is grand except that Ireland has a poorly developed set of automatic stabilisers.  We have unemployment assistance and jobseeker's allowance and so forth, as the committee will be aware.  We do not have the kinds of stabilisers that kick in when unemployment reaches 7%, 8%, or 9%.  We do not have, and have not designed, such policies.  We all now know that it takes nine to 12 months to design one of these policies properly.  If they are not ready to go before the crisis happens, it will take nine to 12 months to introduce them.  This is a fundamental issue.  These policies cannot be done right away.  The committee knows better than anyone that the system takes a long time to do things even in a crisis.  I urge the committee to think carefully about the sorts of automatic stabilisers that are out there.  There is much new thinking about this topic.  One particular stabiliser is an automatic offset for the motor tax.  If it turns out that two thirds of new cars are electric vehicles, there is an automatic offset so the State's finances do not automatically get walloped in one way.  During the crisis is absolutely the wrong time to develop these policies; now is the time to develop those policies before the economy starts overheating. </p></speech>

One does not need to be particularly bright to suggest that there is no reason that ought to change.  It looks as if it will continue to be characterised by chaos.  Dr. Kinsella mentioned the Government's twin budget approach.  To a layman, it looks as if there is only one option to be taken.  Brexit will be chaotic into the future and it seems as if it will be disorderly at best now for a period.  Can our guests give us any insight into the impact that has had on the economy in respect of withdrawn or suspended investment?  What would they do if they were advising the Government about the budget in October in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019062500002#X00200"><p>I thought late last year that the economy might have begun to show a little weakness by now because of the maturity of the recovery.  This is year six of recovery.  The most recent unemployment rate was 4.4%, which is not far off the all-time lowest rate.  I thought there might be a bit of a slowdown but recent figures do not show that.  The economy seems to be trundling along just fine.</p> <p>  The UK economy has weakened.  In particular, there has been a weakness in business capital formation in the UK which is a vital number for the long haul.  That is probably due to uncertainty about Brexit.  It was not very strong to begin with and it has weakened since the referendum.</p> <p>  I do not have a clue what form Brexit will take.  I do not think anybody in British politics has a clue either so I guess I can be excused.  I do not know what the impact on Ireland will be.  I fear that the impact, even if it is a soft Brexit, will be negative.  It is difficult to see any Brexit outcome that will not leave scars on the Irish economy and, of course, on the British economy.</p> <p>  There should be no giveaways at all in the budget in October.  There should be no tax cuts or generous expenditure allocations to anybody, no sweets or gifts for everybody in the audience as happened in the past three budgets.  If that is done, there will be some extra latitude to deal with the fallout of Brexit, which is unknowable at this stage.</p></speech>

I work at the University of Limerick and we are successful at getting in European research and development money through Horizon 2020 and its successor Horizon Europe.  We have colleagues with whom we work in Oxford, Cambridge and the University of Warwick.  These are very fine, world class academics, none of whom is part of the projects that we are putting in right now for 2020 and 2021.  That is a good, simple, concrete example that tens of millions of euros that would go to the UK economy that simply is not going.  Even if the UK turned around and said there will be no Brexit at all, that money still will not go to there.  That is a permanent decrease in the UK's GDP.  It is a small but perfect example of what I mean.</p> <p>  If I was advising the Minister for Finance, I would be far more specific about the nature of sectoral bailouts.  In the event of even a soft Brexit, as Mr. McCarthy said, there are agrifood producers who will be walloped.  I would love for there to be comfort for people in those businesses and sectors that they will be looked after and will be okay.  There is one line in the summer economic statement that says the Government will have a look at bailing some people out.  I want far more detail on that and I would disclose more on that.  I presume that the good officials in the Department of Finance have those sectoral bailout plans built and ready to go and I am sure committee members are privy to them but, if they do not, I would apply shoe leather to areas of their bodies to ensure they get designed.</p><p>These plans, again, cannot be done in five minutes.  It takes time to develop them properly.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the dangers and threats they have outlined, do they believe there are certain problems that must be addressed and that they will cost money?  If the Government works within the discretionary fiscal space it is talking about, the amount available is not enough to deal with those problems.  I do not need to list them as we know what they are.  They are issues in the areas of housing, childcare, primary care, water infrastructure, public transport and I can go down through the list.  There are many demands or urgent necessities in which we must invest, yet we have only a small fiscal space available.  The witnesses seem to be pointing in that direction, namely, that we must find extra sources of revenue.</p></speech>

What would Mr. McCarthy say about financial transactions taxes and wealth taxes?  He pointed to this when referencing the opening up of loopholes.  Our committee has started to examine this.  Generally, a great deal of discussion focuses on what will be spent in current and capital expenditure but much less attention is given to tax reliefs, credits and allowances.  We are starting to examine those and there is major scope in that regard.  We should be as forensically focused on those tax reliefs and allowances as we are on budgetary expenditures, on which there is a great deal of focus.</p></speech>

That is our best medium to long-term insulation against some of these vulnerabilities we have.  Dr. Kinsella mentioned the agrifood sector and said we should design supports.  There is a good case for that but, on the other hand, one might argue in the context of climate change that we need to scale down parts the agrifood sector and rather than bailing those sectors out, we should think about how we can get a just transition for the people working in those sectors into more sustainable, diverse forms of agriculture.</p></speech>

In the context of fiscal space, there is some according to the Minister's statement earlier.  It is important to remember that there is a real resource constraint in the economy.  If the Government did not have a large amount of debt and if we had a strong balance sheet and we could readily and safely borrow a heap of money, it must be realised that we do not have a heap of real resources to reallocate with that money.  To put it another way, if a few thousand guys are going to head off up the mountains of Ireland with trenching machines in order to install broadband, they will not be available to build houses.  The idea of financial balance for the Government is the mirror of the balance in real resources for the economy.  Even if we there was not a financial constraint, we could not summon non-existent resources out of thin air.  It is important to bear that in mind.  The ESRI hinted at that in some of its recent reports.  If we want to spend more money on, for example, the provision of care services, we must increase taxes and tell people to stop buying ice cream because some of the folks who make the ice cream will have to go and work for the social services.  There is a real resource constraint that is mirrored by the financial balance requirement to which the Government must adhere.  That would not be the case if we had piles of underemployed resources and a capacity to borrow.  If, however, IFAC is right and we are running out of underemployed resources, we must make choices.  The choices may well relate to the fact that we want to spend more on various items of the type the Deputy mentioned, but this means that we must increase taxes and hit consumers in their pockets in order that they will stop buying ice cream or whatever else it is they currently do.  We must always bear that in mind.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about more reliable sources of tax revenue.  There are many possibilities and I mentioned some of them.  We still have a fairly low level of residential property tax.  At last we have a residential property tax.  Residential rates were abolished in 1978 and we have finally got them back but they are at a fairly low level.  Most people in the United States pay a few thousand dollars a year in local state and municipal property taxes.  People in most parts of Europe also pay them.  They also pay for water.  There are certainly those possibilities.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned doing away with tax loopholes.  There are tax loopholes but we would want to be careful about some of them.  If, as Dr. Kinsella stated, we compare our overall spending on social transfers with the remainder of western European countries, we discover that it is higher than some and lower than others.  However, some of those countries have state run pay-related pension schemes.  In Germany, people pay a slice of their income into it but they pay pay-related pensions.  In Ireland, that is done privately so the money is not in the Government's accounts.  It could be put into the Government's accounts, but we do not do that.  There is a comparability issue in this regard.  We offer certain tax breaks for people who make private pension provision.  If we did not, the State would be doing it.  We must always bear that in mind.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about wealth taxes.  We could have a wealth tax.  Every country in the world that has introduced a wealth tax, France being the most notable example, has ended up not collecting much money from it.</p><p>Ireland has a partial gross wealth tax which is called property tax.  There is huge resistance to it, including, bizarrely, on the political left which it is a source of great merriment to many people.  There could be a higher property tax, or wealth taxes of various kinds.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019062500002#AA00300"><p>One could just do a site value tax.  It would be hugely unpopular and it would stop any asset bubble developing in property.  It would also generate a huge amount of money.</p> <p>  On a financial transaction tax, I thought it a poor choice when it first came up on my radar.  I have since become very aware of the scale of the shadow banking system in Ireland which is absolutely phenomenal.  It is on a scale comparable to very few other economies.  The gross flows in and out of this economy are comparable to much larger economies.  We facilitate the transfer of money in and out of different types of investment fund.  This generates very few jobs and the social benefit to us is really low.  Therefore my thinking on a financial transaction tax has changed substantially.  I think it would be a good thing and view it the same way as I would regard a pollution tax, in that it should be done to discourage a certain type of behaviour.  The scale of this sector is eight to 11 times the size of the Irish economy, it is absolutely massive.  I would welcome the introduction of such a tax but it would have the down side of being extremely volatile.  </p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we do need to diversify the economy and scale back, however one never wants to be in the situation where one is scaling back in the middle of crisis.  If a State wants to do it, it must be done in a strategic way with policies, it should not be done as part of a crisis.  Strategically, the right way to think about it is what form local taxes and site value taxes should take.  Do both of those things increase the democratic control felt by the average citizen?  They fund local services but most importantly they discourage bubble-type behaviour.  These are all positives. </p></speech>

They might be asking are we heading for bust again.  Mr. McCarthy's presentation today is about avoiding unplanned austerity.  It is timely given our current position in the cycle.  I welcome his presentation and that of Dr. Kinsella.</p><p>My time is brief, and it is a pity we do not have longer, but we have to discuss the summer economic statement.  I will begin on that topic.  We can only work with the statistics provided.  If I look at the summer economic statement, and I am sure that the witnesses have glanced through it, table 3 gives budgetary projections for 2018 to 2024 which set out the key fiscal metrics consistent with SPU 2019.  These projections represent the basis for the summer economic statement.  However, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, says:</p> <blockquote> 	The expenditure forecasts are not credible: they are based on technical assumptions which do not reflect either likely future policies or the future cost of meeting existing commitments.  The technical assumptions used imply an implausible slowdown in expenditure growth, overstating the likely budget balance.  </blockquote> <p>This is extremely frustrating.  We have a document here that is fantasy.  We look at expenditure, budget surplus and so on and we are having a debate, which Dr. Kinsella says is the wrong kind of debate, about the &euro;700 million which the ESRI says is not there and IFAC says is fantasy.  The Government tells us that these voices are being listened to but it is nonsense.  What is the witnesses' view on this?  It is the basis from which we need to build up and consider policy choices and options to see where the threats and risks really are.</p></speech>

Once upon a time, before we had a fiscal council, the role of grumbling about budget policy was that of the Governor of the Central Bank.  Successive incumbents did that to no great effect.  I am really pleased that we have a distinct State agency to grumble about fiscal policy and that the Central Bank is left to supervise the banking system, something in respect of which, as the Deputy might recall, it did not do a very good job.  It is displacement activity for central banks to whinge at finance ministries about budget policy.  We now have a better allocation of functions.</p> <p>  The IFAC report is technically a terrific piece of work.  I read this kind of stuff for a hobby and it is one of the best documents that has been produced by the Irish public service for a long time.  I am sure Dr. Kinsella would agree.  It did make the comment quoted by Deputy Pearse Doherty that the fiscal projections were not credible.  Since then, we have learned that an overshoot is coming in health this year, a matter about which IFAC did not know of when it compiled that part of the report.  It also pointed out that Christmas is going to happen this year and that there is a so-called Christmas bonus in some of the social transfer payments which is not provided for even though it is the intention of all that it be paid.  Some things are unpredictable, but Christmas is not one of them.  It is unfortunate that the figures in the strategic programme update had to be described by IFAC as not credible.</p></speech>

It is a highly valuable thing.  The report cannot be dismissed as mere grumbling, because it is IFAC's function to sound these alarms.  I would like to see a formal reply from the Department of Finance setting out why it believes its assumptions to be credible.  I have not seen this to date.  Having gone through the report very carefully, IFAC's arguments look valid but we have not seen a reply from the Department of Finance, or at least I have not read one, to say why the council is wrong.  That is a very important point.</p> <p>  The notion of a fiscal space is mandated by the European semesterisation process.  However, having experienced it for five years, I am of the view that it is nonsense.  Suddenly, when needed, &euro;1 billion gets found down the back of the couch.  It is not an actual constraint on our behaviour, as a polity, and that is not a good thing.  If we are to compute these things and talk about them seriously, the first thing that we must do is assess the level of credibility of the budget envelope.  One thing that I would seek from the Department of Finance in the future - I will discuss this at the national economic dialogue tomorrow - is this precise function.  We need to debate our assumptions a little, particularly as we move into a very uncertain time.  There will be a period in the future when even computing these things for a small open economic will not be that credible.  Forget about whether the amount of money coming in matches the forecast, we must recognise that the forecasting methodology for a small open economy probably will not be right.  We are being forced to treat the Irish economy the same as the German economy which is just nonsense.  For those two reasons, I would like to see a much healthier dialogue between IFAC and the Department of Finance.  Currently, it seems to be the case that the dog barks and it is ignored.  I would like there to be some sort of conversation.</p></speech>

IFAC also said that last year's projections were not credible - it has used stronger language in this case - and last year it was proven to be correct because there was a &euro;1.2 billion increase in expenditure year on year.</p><p>It is important to note that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council believes more money will be spent than has been projected because the projection of &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.4 billion to 2021 is nearly half what was spent over the past two years and is simply not credible.</p></speech>

We know the multiple causes of overheating which led to the last crisis, at the core of which was commercial rather than residential property.  NAMA, which is a commercial property vehicle, is a manifestation of that.  Commercial property is overheating and I am concerned that a bubble may be emerging in it.  I wrote to the former Governor of the Central Bank more than a year ago on this issue.  In fairness to Professor Lane, this week the Central Bank published important work which addresses some of the issues I raised.  We gave examples of the leveraging of some funds and the sharp exit from the market, the impact it could have on commercial property and the possible knock-on effect on banks and the wider economy.  What are the witnesses' assessments of commercial property?  Given the pressures in terms of housing and construction workers, would the appropriate tool be to again increase stamp duty on commercial property to try to divert construction workers from commercial property into building social, affordable, cost rental and rental housing for the domestic market?</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy pointed out that certain things cannot be done twice, such as unemployment rates and so on.  One must focus on less low-hanging fruit and look at labour force participation rates.  The summer economic statement indicates that the rates are dropping marginally, particularly in the case of women.  Do we need to look at other levers, such as the cost of childcare, and invest in them to support and increase labour force participation at a time when we will repeat some of the cycle previously experienced?  Investment will be required in that regard.</p> <p>  On the health overspend, the Parliamentary Budget Office has indicated that there will again be a significant overrun in health this year.  The Christmas bonus not being factored in is another obvious matter that should be considered.  These figures are not credible.  In addition, the spending that transpires over the year is completely different from the voted expenditure.  How should we deal with that?  If one budgets in an unreliable way and does not provide enough resources in the first place, it will be deemed an overrun and can also be deemed as under-provision in the first instance.  We need to get that right.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into the detail of the important issue of how we look at the fiscal stabilisers and set ourselves up as a committee.  I ask Dr. Kinsella to send us the names of individuals with whom he considers the committee ought to engage.  It is an important point.</p> <p>  One of the ways in which our budgetary position has improved, apart from the fact that we are relying on corporation tax receipts that are at windfall level, is that the cost of debt has significantly decreased.  This year, we will benefit in the amount of nearly &euro;500 million from the fact that the cost of debt has decreased.  It is not a factor of the domestic economy.  Something could happen in Italy, for example, and very quickly cause things to spiral in regard to debt costs.  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?  The ECB has indicated that debt costs are likely to remain static and that we are in a golden position in terms of costs.  How vulnerable are we in terms of a spike in costs as opposed to the magnitude of our debt?  Obviously, Brexit is an issue that has been talked to death and we need to plan properly in that regard, but there is a serious vulnerability that may be outside our control in terms of an increase in the cost of debt.  It will not remain at the current level in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

It is true that the annual debt service cost that goes into the current accounts is several billion lower than we all thought it would be a few years ago.  The Deputy referred to &euro;500 million for this year.  If one looks back at what people expected five years ago would be the debt service cost in the current year, the difference is &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion.</p></speech>

We have been very lucky.  However, that happened in part because of the promissory note deal done with Mr. Mario Draghi, who managed to atone for some of the sins of his predecessor, Mr. Trichet, and took some of the debt service costs of the promissory notes off the Exchequer.  In addition, as a result of the quantitative easing operated by the European Central Bank, the NTMA has been able to replace more expensive debt with cheaper debt and has managed to sell some longer-term bonds and manage the maturity structure quite well.  It has done a good job.</p></speech>

It is not very short term.  There will be some rollovers in the next few years and they are not trivial, but it could have been far worse.  The NTMA has managed to push some of it out further through borrowing money over ten or 15 year terms at very low rates.  Short-term interest rates in Europe may go the wrong way because of a screw-up in Italy.  The upcoming election in Greece could threaten stability there.  The real danger is not that our annual running interest bill will suddenly shoot up.  It cannot do so because most of it is fixed.  The real risk is that the market could go bananas, as it did in 2010, 2011 and, in particular, in 2012, when various countries could not borrow at all as the borrowing market froze.  That is a bigger risk to us.  The fixed coupons cannot be increased, but there is roll-over risk because we have significant rollovers in the coming years.  Ireland was a Mediterranean country a few years ago.  One did not notice the temperature changing.  It has now been reclassified, perhaps somewhat undeservedly, as a northern European country, but our classification could very easily begin slipping southwards again if people start looking at the numbers.  On the numbers, our ratio of debt to tax revenue is not as bad as that in Greece or Italy, but it is close.  We have been labelled as the best boy in the class to a greater extent than we deserve.  People will start focusing on those numbers again if things get messy.</p></speech>

Reform of the higher education system is also required.  A friend of mine very much wants to go back to college, but cannot do so because I cannot tell her when her lectures will be and, as a result, she cannot organise childcare.  The higher education system is not sufficiently flexible.</p> <p>  On the connection between voted and actual expenditure, the answer is programme budgeting.  If expenditure was broken down by section such as radiology or oncology, rather than a load of money being allocated for the health system, one would be able to see which sections are performing and which are not.  Programme budgeting has been around in the United States since the 1960s.  It is the way forward and we should utilise it.  I will send the committee a list of people it may wish to consider inviting to appear.</p> <p>  On the cost of debt, the debt is large, but it is far away.</p><p>Unfortunately for us, the roll-over risk is quite great because we are very easily classified with other small open economies.  That is something we need to manage.</p><p> If I were to pick one thing for the committee to take away, it would be the idea of sponsoring research into programme budgeting.  We can do this; it is not rocket science.  If we take that approach, we would know which parts of the health system work and which do not.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Edward Storey, Eir's director of strategy and corporate communications.</p> <p>  I do not propose to take members through a history of Eir, but I wish to outline that it is the principal provider of fixed line and mobile telecoms services in Ireland.  We have approximately 2 million customers and operate the most extensive network in the country.  Open Eir is the largest wholesale operator in the country, providing products and services for over 40 wholesale customers and more than 400,000 end users.  We are also a major contributor to the economy, spending over &euro;1 billion annually and employing just under 3,500 people directly.</p> <p>  There is often much public commentary on or speculation about Eir's investment, an issue to which I will turn shortly, but it is important that facts are not overlooked and that the committee be made aware that in the past five years Eir has invested more in its network than any other telecoms operator in Europe relative to its size.  That is illustrated in the accompanying graphic.</p> <p>  In its investigation of the NBP the committee has heard opinions from multiple delegates about Eir's investment of &euro;250 million in rural areas.  It relates to the deployment of high speed gigabit fibre technology that has passed 300,000 rural premises with no State subsidy or taxpayer support.  Today we have passed more rural premises with high speed fibre broadband than the 300,000 originally planned and expect to pass approximately 340,000 premises when we close out the programme this summer.  This was and is a significant private investment in rural areas.  As someone who was involved at the beginning of this investment, I am very proud of the work done by the Eir team in every county in Ireland to bring fibre to the home to rural communities.  The investment in the 300,000 programme provided for premises from 885 exchanges.  We have rolled out over 27,000 km of new fibre, replacing 69,000 poles along the way and installing 110,000 four-port splitters - the black box that can be seen on many poles in rural areas.  Beyond that, we have had to upgrade 202 exchanges with fibre backhaul.</p> <p>  There are a number of myths and misrepresentations about this investment and I want to address some of them.  At the time Eir was deciding the next phase of its investment, we had completed a considerable investment in fibre to the cabinet, FTTC, bringing fibre technology further out into the regions, towns and villages.  Fibre to the home, FTTH, was a natural follow-on from this.  To that end, we publicly announced our intention to extend fibre to the home into the rural footprint in 2015.  It is often overlooked that at the time the Department asked all operators to detail their investment plans for the period ahead.  We informed it about our rural fibre to the home plans.  Ultimately, Eir was the only operator to enter into a commitment agreement in respect of this investment.  We will have passed 340,000 premises with high speed fibre before an NBP contract is signed.</p> <p>  Removing the 300,000 premises from the intervention area had two impacts on the NBP subsidy.  It removed the potential revenue from these customers which drove up the subsidy.  It also removed the capital costs associated with passing and connecting those homes with fibre, which drove down the subsidy.  The committee has heard much about the former from previous delegates, but less attention has been paid to the latter, while the question of the net impact of both on the subsidy has not been addressed at all.  Helpfully, the KPMG single bidder solution assessment report answers it for us.  Page 37 of the report states the budget model in April 2017 predicted a &euro;787 million subsidy.  That was after the 300,000 premises had been removed from the NBP.  This is lower than the subsidy projections of up to &euro;1 billion reported in the press as early as 2015.  We believe the removal of the 300,000 premises should have led to a reduction in the overall subsidy for the NBP.  This appears to have been confirmed by KPMG.  Our fibre network in rural areas was built with a specific intention and at an additional cost to Eir so as to allow the eventual NBP winner to share the fibre in order to traverse the 300,000 premises region.  It now appears the decision taken by the bidder not to re-use the existing fibre infrastructure but instead to duplicate and overbuild our fibre across the 300,000 premises region has driven up costs and the associated subsidy.</p> <p>  Appendix 1 in our submission contains a sample map demonstrating how the 300,000 fibre to the home network was rolled out.  We are happy to discuss the map in detail if members believe it would be of benefit.  In designing the figure of 300,000 we firmly believed we were assisting the future NBP when we took the decision to terminate the 300,000 ribbon with a more expensive termination unit that would have allowed any NBP bidder to connect to and fully utilise the asset we had deployed.  It is important to note that while we were able to pass the 300,000 premises commercially, our knowledge and experience of the NBP process suggests the extra costs and complexities of the NBP contract mean that they would have required a subsidy to pass if they had remained in the intervention area.</p> <p>  On the issue of network access, there has been much public commentary on and debate about the potential revenues Eir might receive for the rental of its poles and ducts.  Eir's prices are regulated, published and based on a modest return on the significant cost of the 1,000 plus engineers who work all year round in all weather conditions to maintain Eir's network and replace its poles.  Eir's investment to support the roll-out of the NBP could be as high as &euro;200 million in the early years and &euro;900 million over the life of the plan.  It is important to note that this is not a quick return for Eir.  In the first few years of the programme Eir will be making a significant capital investment to make ready the infrastructure for National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  As such, we are taking on significant risk and operating at a loss for the term of the actual roll-out phase; nor does this represent incremental revenue to our existing revenue from our copper network since this network will be decommissioned after fibre is deployed.  Therefore, the rental revenue is replacement revenue to fund the cost of maintaining the poles and ducts.</p> <p>  We would also like to remind the committee that Eir is not a monopoly provider of network infrastructure and that the State has already made it possible for publicly owned infrastructure to be used to deploy high speed broadband.  The preferred bidder has stated its intention to use ESB and other infrastructure where it makes sense for it to do so and I expect it to do so.  However, as I have just stated, rural networks are very expensive to maintain; therefore, the committee should not expect the ESB to be a free option.</p> <p>  Finally on this topic, I point out to the committee that the only cost talked about in detail in respect of NBI&rsquo;s engagement with third parties is a reported &euro;1 billion figure attributed to the cost of accessing the Eir and ESB networks, which accounts for only 20% of the overall project costs.  The other 80% of the costs to be paid to privately owned and unregulated project subcontractors have not been subject to the same scrutiny or attention as in the case of Eir, even though the access cost in respect of its network is and was always known and is independently regulated by ComReg.</p> <p>  The committee asked us to reflect on three themes in its correspondence ahead of the meeting.  In respect of the roll-out time, we have always been of the view that deploying fibre technology across the entire intervention area is a project of such scale that it was always going to take a number of years to complete.  We believe seven years is a challenging but achievable target.  As the only company building fixed-fibre infrastructure in rural areas we know how long it takes and how events outside our control can delay deployment.  We believe our experience from the 300,000 premises deployment has been invaluable to us and the Department.  It has allowed officials to prepare for and anticipate issues that are likely to be faced by NBI in its deployment.</p> <p>  On the issue of value for money, I do not believe it is appropriate for Eir to make determinations on what is or is not good value for money for the taxpayer in respect of the NBP.  While there may not be a commercial case for providing fibre for every home, there may well be a case for society as a whole, but that is a question for the Government.  However, it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is envisaged in the plans as outlined at the same levels of quality and service as for the 300,000 premises.  There is no secret in this.  Eir could complete the NBP, based on its approach to the 300,000 premises rural roll-out, for under &euro;1 billion.  At the time of Eir's departure from the bidding process my predecessor, Mr. Richard Moat, wrote to the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, outlining our reasons for leaving the process but also offering to discuss with the Department alternative ways of achieving the Government&rsquo;s stated policy objectives.</p> <p>  To keep costs down, Eir built its rural fibre roll-out with the intention of providing access to its 300,000 premises fibre.  We offered a product that would allow the preferred bidder the traverse the 300,000 premises area to reach the intervention area.  The plan, as it stands, is not to use this product but instead to build fibre alongside parts of the 300,000 premises network.  The logic for this is not clear to us, but it is also not a question for Eir.</p> <p>  Eir does not have a view on the issue of ownership as it is a matter for the Department.  However, as a former bidder, ownership of the network at the end of the 25-year period would have to be factored in to the business case for any bidder.</p> <p>  As a private company, Eir believes strongly the private sector can deliver high quality essential services to customers at a lower price than can be delivered through the public sector.  As a regulated entity, we believe this can be done in a way that opens the market to competition and delivers the lowest cost to society.  While the private sector gap funding model has failed to deliver a competitive outcome for the NBP procurement process, this need not have been the case had different choices been made along the way.  We believe there are other models and structures such as a universal service obligation that could have delivered high speed broadband faster and cheaper than the existing process.  However, we remain ready to support the NBP with our infrastructure, if it is required, whether it be via a private sector or public sector solution.</p><p>It remains a source of regret for Eir, and for me personally, that we ultimately found ourselves in a position where we could no longer remain in the national broadband plan bid process.  Having been personally very close to the process and the dedicated staff, current and former, who worked on it, I assure the committee it was not a decision taken lightly or in haste.  We entered the process in good faith with one aim: to win it.  We continue to be engaged with the preferred bidder and with the Department.  I want to make it clear that we completely support the policy of 100% connectivity for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the very significant private sector investment in telecommunications over recent years.  It is has been very important for the country.  Eir has recognised that fibre is the best technology and that while a seven-year roll-out is challenging, it is achievable.</p> <p>  I listened to a podcast Ms Lennon did with the technology journalist, Adrian Weckler, about the national broadband plan.  In that interview she stated that &euro;3 billion sounded about right for the roll-out of the plan.  Over the past 24 hours we have heard it stated in the media that this could be done for &euro;1 billion.  I would like to get some clarity about that figure and a breakdown of what it would mean.  When the Department appeared before this committee in May, its representatives stated that it would cost approximately &euro;1 billion to physically pass all premises.  There is a distinction between physically passing premises and actually connecting them.  What does Eir estimate it would cost to connect all homes?  What does it estimate it would cost to maintain the network over the 25-year period?  Is VAT included in that figure?  Will Ms Lennon break down that figure of &euro;1 billion?</p></speech>

I was quite surprised by some of the headlines today because Eir and its former CEO put on record, in the letter which was released on foot of a freedom of information request, that we could have delivered the national broadband plan for a fraction of the cost.  That letter was issued in January 2018.  The cost of &euro;1 billion would be achieved by building that fibre network on the same basis as the network we have almost completed for the 340,000.</p> <p>  As for what I mean by that, we would use the fibre and the connection points in place for the 300,000.  We would not be overbuilding.  When we designed the network for the 300,000 we were still an active bidder for the NBP.  As we were hoping to win it, we spent extra on the build for the 300,000 in order that the network could be rolled out into the intervention footprint.  We would use our own poles and ducts.  We own them so we would use them.  We would use our own access network team and our contractors to build and plan the network.  We would use our own wholesale team to sell it.  We would apply the same connection charge in the intervention area as we have applied for the other 300,000.  The connection cost would be the same as it is in the rest of the country.  We would apply the same service level agreement, SLA, and regulated pricing in the intervention area as we do in the rest of the country.  </p> <p>  We are just about to finish rolling out broadband to 340,000 homes in rural Ireland.  We are the only people who have done that and the only people who have that experience.  Based on that experience, we are certain that we could roll out fibre to the rural homes within the intervention footprint for less than &euro;1 billion.  That is the model we use, but that is not the NBP model.  The NBP model is a gap-funding model that requires a separate wholesale division, a better SLA than applies in the rest of the country, differentiated pricing, and cheaper connection charges.  All of these requirements and the additional complexity drive up the costs.  </p> <p>  I was asked why we decided to pull out the last time I was before the committee.  In the end, we decided to pull out because we could not make a commercial case to continue in light of all those costs.  The big factor for Eir is that whatever is going to happen in respect of pricing, connection charges and so on for that 20% will affect pricing for the other 80% of our business because we are regulated and not allowed to differentiate pricing for different parts of the country.  That was a massive risk for us and was another factor in our decision.  This is being treated like new news but it is not.  Anyone looking at Mr. Richard Moat's letter would see that he said this could be done for a fraction of the cost.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

It will go up every road and through every field for less than &euro;1 billion.  It will connect to the home, as opposed to just passing it.</p></speech>

It is exactly the same model as used for the other 300,000, which also connects to the home.  We were looking at the numbers today.  Our rule for connections is that we will only do overhead connection.  We will not dig underground ducts for people.  If people want underground rather than overhead, they have to dig the duct themselves.  If they have an underground duct which is blocked, we will not unblock it.  If a duct is fine we have no problem pulling fibre through it, but it if is blocked we will ask the owner to unblock it.  Applying those rules to the intervention footprint, we can connect all homes for less than &euro;1 billion.  We were checking the number of people who have refused a connection or refused to put in ducting or to unblock existing ducts.  That has happened in 2% of cases when we went out to put in a connection and we have passed that information on.  That is not what is envisaged in NBI's plan.</p> <p>  It also proposes to charge a cheaper connection fee within the intervention footprint than the regulated connection charge Eir levies for the 300,000.  We charge a connection fee of &euro;170.  My understanding is that NBI proposes a charge of &euro;100.  The service level agreement NBI proposes includes repairing 90% of faults within two days.  The percentage in the national SLA is in the 80s.  The reality of including a goal of 90% in the SLA means that engineers will be sitting around at home in north Donegal or west Kerry waiting for a repair to be required.  They just do not come in in those volumes.</p></speech>

As we covered in our statement, we currently make revenue on our copper network in the intervention footprint in rural Ireland.  We use that revenue to maintain our ducts and poles.  When NBI rolls out its fibre network in the intervention footprint, our copper customers and the revenue they generate will migrate from our copper network onto NBI's network.  NBI will get the revenue but we will still have to maintain the ducts and poles on which NBI is to build its network.  That is where the &euro;1 billion over 25 years for maintenance of ducts and poles comes from.  If we were to build the fibre network we would still use our ducts and poles so the revenue we lose from copper customers would be recovered from fibre customers.  We would use that revenue to maintain the ducts and poles as we do today.</p></speech>

Because the number of other homes we are connecting has increased from 300,000 to 340,000, the number of rural homes has reduced to 420,000.  We can pass and connect those 420,000 homes for less than &euro;1 billion.  We are absolutely certain of that.  We are just finishing the 300,000.  This was always the case, however.

If we kept the machine we have used to connect the 300,000 going and kept rolling with all the same connection costs, SLAs and so forth, we could do this for less than &euro;1 billion.  That is not the procurement model in place today, however, which requires much higher SLAs, lower connection costs and lower pricing.</p><p>When all those, as well as a new wholesale team, are factored in, it drives the cost and complexity, and that is when it starts to get nearer to &euro;3 billion.</p></speech>

In our case, we would use our current existing wholesale team to sell it, and our current existing access team to build and plan it.

When the State got advice from KPMG and PwC, they advised that the gap funding model was the best way forward because it would provide a competitive environment.  Looking at the marketplace, they identified Eir, ESB, and others.  They referred to the amount of infrastructure that was already there, and the capacity of the State to expect a competitive environment because bidders would leverage their existing infrastructure.  That was the guiding principle upon which this was established.  Ms Lennon has said that despite Eir's efforts to leverage that infrastructure, the NBI procurement process as it was constituted effectively prevented Eir from making savings based on its existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

The intention was to have competitive tension, but in reality, the decisions ended up being about making it a level playing field.  Therefore, the advantages we had in that we owned the infrastructure, were building the 300,000 network, and had a wholesale team, were negated as part of that process, and that drove extra costs and complexity for us.</p></speech>

All those who pitched in had a level playing field, but in the knowledge that raising that bar for everyone meant neither Eir nor the ESB could use their existing infrastructure, and so the taxpayer was effectively on the hook for an additional &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

That is the cost side of it.  What does having a procurement process that requires everyone to create a completely new infrastructure do to the roll-out period?  What is the timeframe from the get-go to completion?  Take the example we discussed, of that string of developments that already has Eir's 300,000 broadband.  What kind of timing are we talking about, in order to overlay that again or find its way back into somebody else's back hall?</p></speech>

For two years, the Government has been saying that we cannot interfere with the current process in any way.  When both Eir and Siro pulled out, I raised concerns with the then Minister, and he said we had to keep going, because if anything was done to stall this process, we would lose two years.  In essence, it is the way the procurement process is put together that loses that time because it requires whoever wins it, including Eir, to go back and build-----</p></speech>

However, our 300,000 network is what we call a passive product, and a successful bidder could use the spare fibres and connections we built in when we were building that, but the remaining bidder has decided not to do that, and to build through the 300,000 instead.  That decision could be revisited, and they could decide to use that passive product, which would save some time because they would not have to build through the 300,000.  However, I never felt a three-year build time for the NBP was realistic.  To give an example, we are just now finishing our 340,000, which took us three years.  While the NBP is not triple that, the reality is that one needs three times the amount of fibre for the intervention area we had to do, so if we multiply that it could take it up to nine years.  It will not take that long because it will get some more synergies, but between five and seven years is realistic.  The majority would be done in five years, but the tails and the hard-to-reach places would bring it up to seven.</p></speech>

It is on track in terms of our business plan, so we are very happy with it.  When we last released the percentage, which I think was about six or nine moths ago, it was 14%.  We measure by quarter.  The houses we pass in the first quarter would be more than double the overall take-up.   We go into an area, there is pent-up demand, it comes on board and over time it continues to grow.  The averages bring it down because every quarter we are adding new quarters into it.  We are happy with the uptake and we are confident that it will continue to grow.</p> <p>  Eir is a wholesale network and all of the operators are on our network.  When we rolled out our fibre to the cabinet network, Eir was the first on and the first to bring in customers.  Vodafone came onto the network and uptake increased again and then Sky came onto it and it increased again.  When there are a lot of people advertising it, awareness levels increase and, as we know, a rising tide raises all boats.  Vodafone is selling fibre to the home on that network.  We expect Sky to do likewise so would expect uptake to continue increasing.  We are very happy with it.  We have no issues with it from a business case point of view.</p></speech>

The map we provided might be helpful to members.  We have our own exchanges.  When we first started building out from our exchanges, we built fibre to the cabinet.  We took fibre from the exchange to the cabinet and then copper into the rest of a house.  We did that for 1.6 million homes outward from the urban areas.  Through the exchanges there are ribbons into the rural areas.  The 340,000 area goes into those rural ribbons and Mbps continues those rural ribbons.  Our fibre to the cabinet is, as I said, only fibre to the cabinet.  We are in design mode in respect of over-building the fibre to the cabinet network to bring fibre to home to all cities and pretty much every town with more than 1,000 premises.  We are currently designing that model and hope to have the first homes passed in January 2020.</p></speech>

In terms of effort, when we are building rural we complete, on average, 30,000 per quarter.  For the same effort in urban and suburban, we complete approximately 75,000.  As the houses are closer together the fibre lengths are shorter and it is a more efficient build.  The challenge for the intervention footprint is the distance.  For example, to connect 440,000 rural premises will require approximately three times the amount of fibre required for the 340,000 area.</p></speech>

The team had engaged with the Department for 18 months as the gap funding model evolved and developed and we understood what it meant.  It was not a retail issue for us: it was a wholesale issue.  The Department, as part of that level playing field, did not want our established wholesale business to sell in the intervention footprint.  It wanted Eir to set up a new wholesale business to sell in the intervention footprint, which would have involved new staff, new systems, etc.  That was one issue.  The Department also wanted us to offer better SLAs in the intervention footprint.  In terms of cost and complexity, recommending that to the board was difficult.

Mr. Moat wanted to flag those issues in advance of that submission, which he did.  We then submitted the technical bid and we waited for the next version of the contract to come out, hoping that some of the commercial issues we had been highlighting had been addressed.  A new version, comprising 1,400 pages, came out in January.  While a few minor changes had been made, unfortunately, the commercial issues we had raised had been addressed.  The next stage involved Eir submitting its commercial bid.  In doing that, we had to confirm that we were accepting all of the commercial terms and conditions.  We could not in good faith do that.  Mr. Moat then sought a meeting with the former Minister, met him and told him that Eir was pulling out.  The Minister expressed disappointment and asked him to have think about it.  At the end of January, Mr. Moat wrote to the former Minister telling him that Eir would not be changing its mind.  I saw some media coverage today, which suggested that the issue was the new shareholders.  It had nothing to do with the new shareholders; they had not bought Eir until April.  The old board made the decision.  It was very close to this process because we were before it a lot explaining it to them.  The view was taken that if in 18 months we had not achieved any changes we were unlikely in the month or so remaining before the final bid to get any changes that would enable us to accept the commercial terms and conditions.  In the end, as we were not going to be able to secure any changes, we pulled out.</p></speech>

It was a technical bid - Eir's technical solution.  In that bid, we included all the costings that were required, including the cost of the ducts and poles and the cost of the wholesale team.  We included all of the costs as part of it, which made it an expensive bid.</p><p>We were still hoping to get those matters addressed.</p><p> The other issue was that we made some assumptions around uptake.  I do not know what the assumptions of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, around uptake are but in preparation for bidding for the NBP, we did a survey of the intervention area to try to understand how many of the homes were occupied because uptake depends on people living in the properties.  According to the data we got back, about 25% of the houses were not occupied but were holiday homes and so forth.  We based our uptake assumptions on that figure of 75% rather than 100%.  That is obviously a factor with regard to the gap funding model.  That was part of the technical submission showing how we were going to do it.  Getting down to the negotiation was meant to be in that final commercial bid when one signed up to the terms and conditions.</p></speech>

Ms Lennon intimated that in respect of its current arrangement regarding the 340,000-area zone, Eir uses overhead wires where possible.  If someone wants to ducting installed, he or she must pay the additional cost.  Is it Ms Lennon's understanding that the NBI scheme also involves overhead wires or is there a higher percentage of ducting involved?</p></speech>

We set ourselves strict rules in what we do.  My understanding is that NBI will be open to ducting but plans to charge &euro;100 for it regardless of how big a person's driveway is.  Our price is higher.  It is a regulated price but is &euro;170.</p></speech>

That would be a policy direction from the State with ComReg setting out the basic rules.  That would not breach EU competition rules.  In a sense, that would give a wholesale monopoly or a continuing or extended monopoly to Eir.</p></speech>

I do not think it would breach the rules.  Universal service obligations have been used for this purpose in other countries.  The funding model and rules would have to be agreed.  ComReg would have to come up with the rules and it would have to be monitored in terms of what was done.  However, we have a universal service obligation in place with regard to the fixed access side.  I think we would all agree that broadband and fibre broadband is probably much more relevant today than the fixed access product given that many of us use mobile telephones.</p></speech>

We pulled out and said we could do it for a fraction of the cost.  There was no further engagement with us.  We got on with our own plans.  We were invited to appear before the committee and we did so and set out our stall.  We were also invited to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and told it that this could be done more cheaply.  We have said that any time we have been interviewed.  We are back before the committee and we have answered its questions on cost, roll-out and ownership.  We are now outside the NBP process and, to some extent, paddling our own canoe in terms of what we are doing on the plans and supporting NBI in terms of access to our infrastructure.  We are getting on with our job and leaving the NBP to the Department and the remaining bidder.</p></speech>

We did that and we have now set up rural hubs in Sligo, Limerick and Cork.  Certainly when we were transitioning from the outsourced provider, we had extremely long call answering and waiting times.  We launched the centre in Sligo, which I visited last week.  Waiting times are back to 90 seconds.  I apologise profusely to customers but I believe the long-term strategy of having people who look after our customers working for us is right.  Unfortunately, when one closes a contact centre in Dublin, one cannot expect people to hang around until one has other centres ready to go in Sligo, Limerick and Cork.  It has been really unfortunate but I believe we are back on track now and it is the right way forward.</p></speech>

It is the job of this committee to get to the bottom of that.  One could also look at this in another way in terms of Eir pulling out of the tendering process in 2017.  Did Eir not get what it wanted at that stage?  It was allowed to cherry-pick the 300,000 most lucrative homes in rural Ireland.  Could it not have been this that derailed the whole process?</p></speech>

The Senator might say it was cherry-picking; I would say we picked the next most commercially viable homes because we were making a commercial investment.  I remind everybody that the Department wrote to every operator in the country, told them it wanted to finalise this intervention footprint and asked them whether they had any plans to do more commercially.  A number of operators submitted plans but the only operator that was willing to sign a commitment agreement and actually went ahead and delivered all those plans was Eir.  That project involves &euro;250 million of our money.  If nobody goes on to the network, it is my problem.  I take all the risk.  If nobody connects, it costs &euro;250 million.  That has moved Eir from the provision of rural broadband up to the top percentile in Europe on the back of our investment.  I take the Senator's point regarding service but if she looks at the chart we have presented, she will see that we have spent a higher percentage of our capital on investment in infrastructure in Ireland over the past number of years than all of the big telecommunications companies in the country.  We are putting in the money and it is improving infrastructure in Ireland.  As I say, if we were Google or Facebook, there would be a statue to us.  We have history and people are sceptical but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  A total of 315,000 properties are covered but 340,000 farms, businesses and families will get access to fibre to the home on the back of Eir's investment.</p></speech>

The lack of investment is very visible in rural Ireland outside the 300,000 homes.  How much is Eir getting for the use of the poles and ducts?</p></speech>

It will cost us &euro;900 million to replace, repair and look after those ducts.  In the initial seven years, we will spend about &euro;200 million upfront to get that done.</p><p>From what I have read in the papers, that seems to be more than the equity investment of NBI.  We make a regulated return.  Our ducts and poles are set at prices decided by the regulator and they are cost orientated.  They are based on the costs required to maintain a pole and duct network in rural Ireland.  They are not set by me.</p></speech>

When Storm Ophelia hit two years ago, we had to replace 2,500 poles.  There is much work to get ducts and poles ready for NBI to use that network and that-----</p></speech>

There is some confusion about this but it is not incremental revenue.  We make money out of copper customers on that network today.  We will lose that revenue when those copper customers migrate onto NBI's fibre network.  If that happens, we will be making no money in that intervention area to maintain those poles and ducts.  We will make that money through renting the poles and ducts to NBI and, over 25 years, we will get paid &euro;1 billion and will spend &euro;900 million, so we will make a small return.</p></speech>

In 2016, the public spending code benchmark figure for the deal we are talking about was set at &euro;800 million and today's State subsidy stands at &euro;2.97 billion.  Is it not fair to say that the reason for the cost to the taxpayer spiralling out of control was, in fact, a consequence of the deal that Eir secured with Fine Gael in 2017 to provide services to the 300,000 households?</p></speech>

People have taken out the revenue associated with the 300,000 households but left in the cost, whereas we have actually picked up the bill for the costs and have gone ahead and have built the network.  We have actually built infrastructure to service 40,000 more households, so another 40,000 can now be taken out of the intervention footprint and there is no cost to the taxpayer because we have already done them.  The KPMG report backed that up.</p></speech>

They gave two reasons for this.  They said the remaining bidder would have no guarantee that it would be able to use Eir's infrastructure in that part of the intervention area and would therefore have to build its own network side by side that of Eir in order to reach the homes that Eir chooses to reject.  That would come at a considerable capital cost.</p> <p>  Second, they said the remaining bidder would be prohibited from selling their products to any consumer in Eir's intervention area and therefore the State could not generate any revenue in that area even though it had to build a network through it.  What sense would that make to the remaining bidder?</p></speech>

I talked earlier about the passive product of the spare fibres that were built in when we were building the infrastructure to service the 300,000 households.  Exactly the same rules apply to that passive product as apply to the poles and duct product that the bidder was happy to use.  I do not understand why the bidder would say it did not want guarantee or rules on one product.  All those products are regulated so exactly the same rules apply to poles ducts and NBI is very happy to use Eir's poles and ducts product so I do not understand that one.</p></speech>

Since Eir has already rolled out to the 300,000, I do not think it would be reasonable to subsidise NBI to connect customers in that area.  I think that applies to all state aid subsidy.</p></speech>

That was all at Eir's cost, which amounted to &euro;250 million without taxpayer or State subsidy or risk to the State.  All the risk is on us if nobody goes onto that network.  We answered a request from the Department, made a decision, delivered what we said we would, and I am proud of the work we have done there.</p> <p>  The reality is that we would have built it anyway, whether we had signed a commitment agreement or not, but the Department is very keen for us to sign a commitment agreement and agree to just over 300,000 specific postcodes.  If I was doing it again, I would not agree to 300,000 specific postcodes because, when one gets out to build in rural Ireland, one finds there are things which stop one going down certain roads and it can be time consuming and not as efficient as picking the most effective 300,000 households.  At the time, the Department was keen for us to sign it and we did.</p></speech>

I am looking at Eir's map of Castlecomer.  Why has Eir gone a long distance out one road?  I understand that, from where Eir was supplying the broadband, it could go 2 km either way.  Why has one leg gone completely down one road?  I noticed that.</p> <p>  To be clear, Ms Lennon was saying that the way in which they are supplying the 300,000 people means the customer pays &euro;170 whereas, under the national broadband plan, that figure will be &euro;100.</p></speech>

Secondly, Eir is bringing it through wire.  I know that and, if a person brings it by duct to where the pole is, is Ms Lennon saying that, under the national broadband plan, there was a clause that it had to be brought to within so many metres of a house, or brought right to the house in every case?</p> <p>  Third, for clarity, if Eir has &euro;200 million in its back pocket, rocks up with the gear and decides to put broadband somewhere, must it go for a licence to get authority or can Eir do it of its own initiative?  The reason I ask is that we sat in for 83 or 85 days of Government talks and were told categorically during those talks that Eir would not get the contract it was looking for because it would affect the overall project of the whole national broadband plan and a licence would not be issued.  Can Ms Lennon clarify whether we were being misled?  If I have the money and the infrastructure, can I decide what part of Ireland I want to go to and provide broadband?</p> <p>  At any stage over the past two years, before Eir came out of the process and when it highlighted the situation about which it was not comfortable, was there any negotiation with the Department?  Was the Department willing to change or was it just stuck on this set of rules they had?  If the whole scenario changed in the morning, as other Deputies have asked, how quickly could we have the likes of Eir's roll-out system put into place with guarantees of delivery?  If the situation at the moment was put on pause and someone sat down with Eir or another provider, how quickly could it be put in place?  Would it be another two years, looking at each other and wondering when another announcement would come?</p> <p>  I want to be clear about the following.  Is Ms Lennon saying that, under the procurement document on which the Department was working with Eir, the company would have its business on one floor of its building and other people would have to be put up on the next floor as a separate entity, and the entities could not really talk to each other?</p><p>That would require extra staff, a new set-up and a new building away from everybody because it was the national broadband plan.  While Eir has been rolling out broadband to the 340,000 homes over the past year or 18 months, how much of a problem did it have with councils in terms of licences?</p><p> We have a major problem across rural parts of Ireland.  Years ago, when Telecom &Eacute;ireann or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs workers came around an area, people let them put poles along their ditches, fields or whatever.  I refer to GAA clubs, people who might be widening a road or somebody building a house.  The first problem they face is to get someone from Eir to come out and do the work.  The second problem is the prices it is charging at the moment.  It is disgusting to see the way people who provided ground years ago before Eir bought the business are being treated.  Councils trying to revamp towns might want to widen a bend in a road, remove ESB cables or whatever and it is costing them a phenomenal amount of money.  Why has a goodwill gesture not been made to make sure those jobs can be done in communities that are struggling for funding?  I ask Ms Lennon, as the CEO of Eir, to consider looking at that, especially in terms of rural areas.</p><p> If Eir was to get a contract in the morning - we live in a fantasy world - how long would it take it to roll out broadband to the 540,000 houses being talked about?  Also, was Ms Lennon disappointed more with the Minister or the Department when they did not come back to Eir to try to resolve the issues that arose?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked why one blue line on the map was shorter than the others.  We are trying to get the roads with the most density.  We had a budget of &euro;250 million and we agreed to do 300,000 homes.  It is all based on density.  If the Deputy looks at the map he will see the yellow pin, which is our exchange.  The yellow circle around it is our fibre to the cabinet footprint, and he will see what looks like ribbon rolls coming out of that.  In every exchange, we asked what would be the maximum we could pick up across that exchange.</p></speech>

The reality is that if it was not tough luck, I would have been building a 400,000 network.  I would have been over my &euro;250 million budget, and I would be delayed.  Every day I get requests from people to extend it a bit but the problem is that if I extend it for one, I have to extend it for the other.  In reality, we did extend it because in the end we will do 340,000 homes, but that is the reason.</p> <p>  The next question was on the connections.  The connection charge is charged to the operator.  We charge the operator &euro;170.  The operators then decide if they will pass on that connection charge to the consumer.  Some operators, as part of their propositions, have a free connection.  Others pass on some of the charge.  Our connection charge to the operator is &euro;170 and our understanding is that the National Broadband Ireland, NBI, connection charge to the operator is &euro;100.</p> <p>  On the licence, we do not need a licence.  If we decided tomorrow that we wanted to do another 100,000 connections, we need licences to open roads and for other issues.  Instead of going back into urban and suburban, we decided that if we wanted to go further into rural, we could make that decision and do it.</p></speech>

We were told at the time that Eir would not be given the licence.  It came out later on that the EU forced the Irish Government to let Eir do what it said it would do for the simple reason that it would not be allowed to include it in the intervention area.</p></speech>

It would take the minimum of a year to come up with another way of doing this and to get the ducks in a row to get started on it.  In terms of any involvement we would have in future in rolling out in rural Ireland, we would be leveraging our 300,000 bills, the additional fibres that are in place and the additional connection points.  That means we could get going from that point.  In terms of going to all those exchanges, we have fibre backhauls to many of those exchanges.  That can be a big chunk of work but we have done a lot of that already as part of our rural 300,000 roll-out.  Unfortunately, coming up with a new model and getting people around the table does not happen as quickly as many of us would like it to happen.</p> <p>  On the duplication of wholesale, currently, our wholesale team sells our network throughout the country.  The idea would be that we would have a separate wholesale team.  We did not discuss separate buildings but having a line between them and that they would be the only people allowed to sell in the intervention footprint.  For example, the IFA is a customer of ours.  Its farmers are among the 300,000.  A chunk of them are in the intervention footprint and there are some in the suburban areas.  We offer an overall service to them with an account manager who does all of that for them.  In this new model, some of them would have been looked at in the new wholesale division, which looks after the intervention area, while some of them would have been looked at as part of the 300,000.  Offering that customer an all-country solution, which we do today, was going to be a challenge, never mind the cost.  The other bidders did not have that.  They did not have established wholesale businesses like ours so they did not have that loophole to get through.</p> <p>  We did have some difficulties with licences for councils.  We have about 315,000 homes today.  We have not delivered to some of the original 300,000 we signed off with the Department.  They will be delivered over the summer, but much of that was to do with way leaves and licences.  I believe we got some unreasonable requests.  One council would not give us some way leaves until we finished work it wanted us to do in an urban area, even though it was about a rural piece or whatever.  That is an issue.  Some are better than others.  Some move matters on-----</p></speech>

We were disappointed with the engagement with the Department over the 18 months because we thought we were raising valid issues that should have been resolved.

We were disappointed not to get more engagement with the Department.  We spent more than &euro;17 million on this bid.  We were in the process for a very long time and we wanted to win it.  We obeyed the protocol with the Minister so we did not have that much engagement with him on the subject.  When we were pulling out, as a courtesy, the former CEO, Richard Moat, requested a meeting and then communicated with him.</p></speech>

I just wanted to explain that.  I missed some of the presentations, so if I repeat what has been said, please forgive me.</p><p>I ask about the &euro;1 billion that we have heard a lot about.  Will Ms Lennon break down exactly where that figure comes from and how Eir estimates that the build-out would be &euro;1 billion?  I refer to the build-out connection.  Does that include maintaining the service for 35 years, if Eir went with the contract through?  Does it include VAT?  Does it include all the aspects of the bid?  Was that &euro;1 billion in the tender documents that Eir submitted on day one?</p></speech>

We would use the additional fibre that we built as part of our 300,000 roll-out and we would use those connection points that exist to extend out further into the intervention area.  We would use all our own poles and ducts.  Obviously, they are in place.  We would use our access team, our build and design team, and the current contractors we have in place, and we would use our own wholesale team to sell the products.  We would apply the same connection model that we use for the 300,000, that is, we would charge and operate at &euro;170.</p> <p>  Our connection rules would apply.  For example, if a person wants a connection in our 300,000, we will do an overhead connection for the customer.  We will not build duct for the customer.  We will pull fibre to an existing duct, but if it is blocked, we ask the customer to unblock it.  If a customer does not want overhead and wants underground, we will ask the customer to supply his or her own duct.  We would apply all of those criteria.</p> <p>  We would also apply the same repair service-level agreement, SLA, to the intervention footprint that we have for the 300,000 and the rest of the country, and we would apply the same regulated pricing.  We are just finishing 340,000.  We have a very good grip on the costs.</p></speech>

The gap-funding model was picked at the start because the view was that would give the best competitive tension and outcome.  In reality, because it created a level playing field, advantages that someone like Eir has because we own infrastructure - we have it there today to use - were taken away.  That is okay.  The Senator might say that is fine, it is fair or whatever, but that drives the costs.  It is not for me to decide whether that is right or wrong, but that is what happened.  In reality, I would be certain that if I had a &euro;1 billion cheque tomorrow, I could build and connect those homes because we are just coming to the end of having done it for 340,000.</p></speech>

We pulled out of the national broadband plan because the process was not working for us in terms of the complexity, the cost, the overhead and the risk into the rest of our business.  As long as that process still exists, we will not be part of that and will focus on our national build.  I refer to the question we were asked by the committee.  We were asked to comment on the cost of doing this, how long it will take and the ownership, and we have done that.  When we pulled out, Mr. Richard Moat wrote to the Minister and told him that we could do this for a fraction of the costs that were talked about at the time but the Department decided to continue with that process because that is the process it wanted to use.  That is for the Department to decide.  It is not for me to decide.  I am only telling the Senator, based on my experience of building in rural Ireland, that if I apply exactly the same rules - I accept that they are not the same rules that are in the NBP process - I can pass and connect those homes for less than &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

If we are honest about the issue, that is mainly what was connected.  For example, the constituency I would service is 130 or 140 miles long.  It extends to Castletownbere and beyond it into Allihies, and I start at Kinsale.  We are talking about a considerable geographical area.  When it comes to houses not connected, my area is the most peripheral of them all.  Looking at what is being proposed here for vast areas of country and population, and Ms Lennon spoke about 350,000 houses, the area that has been connected in my part of the world cannot be compared with the area that has not been connected.</p></speech>

It is not all clustered.  We have strung 27,000 km of fibre.  If they were all grouped in clusters, we would not have needed 27,000 km.  This is rural, and it is down those rural ribbons.  I agree with the Senator, however, that in the next tranche, the intervention footprint, the distribution is much more scarce.  It is the point I made earlier.  We will have to string three times the amount of fibre as before to cover those homes.  That gives a sense of how much more dispersed and spread out they are.  Of course, that drives the costs and it drives the time to do it.  It will drive some harder connections as well because some of them will be much more remote.</p> <p>  I would hate people to think that the 300,000 were urban.  They were not.  They were quite rural.</p></speech>

However, I refer to places, such as Mizen Head, which are very remote.  To give Ms Lennon an idea of what we are dealing with geographically, it takes me three hours to drive the constituency.  There is a slight difference here.  Are we on target for the 350,000-plus houses to be delivered?</p></speech>

We have delivered 315,000 but some of the original Eircode postcodes that we agreed with the Department have not been delivered yet because we have had some way leave and access problems.</p><p>We have done all the civil engineering work, the poles and all that, and we just have to splice.  By the end of August we will have 340,000 done, and that will be everything that was in the original agreement with the Department, plus close to another 39,000.  That will all be done by the summer.  To be honest, we have spent all our money now.  The splicing is the cheapest part.  As we only make money if we get people connected to the network, it is in our interest to get it finished now and we are also doing the design work for our national build, with the first homes being passed on a national build in January.</p></speech>

KPMG came before the committee three weeks ago.  If I am wrong about that the Chair can correct me.  I am open to clarification, but the spokesperson informed us that in her opinion, if we were to start the retendering process and to go through the entire process it would take five years from start to finish.  Based on the timeline we were told about at the hearings, would Eir retender?</p></speech>

If the project was parked and restarted with a different funding model that was suitable to Eir's requirements as a company, what would prevent Eir's parent company from saying, three years into the process, that it should forget it?  Eir was bought in April and its new French owner commented that its focus is on urban development.  As a company, it is possible that perhaps based on what has happened in this committee that the project could be retendered but who is to say that some time into the project, Eir could walk away?  Is that not fair to say?</p></speech>

Today, we make money on the customers on our copper network and those ducts and poles.  That revenue pays for the maintenance of our ducts and poles.  The prices are regulated.  The regulator sets them based on cost.  If tomorrow, we were to build the network, rather than someone else, we would migrate those copper customers onto the new fibre network and the revenue we would get for them on the fibre network would pay for the maintenance of the ducts and poles.</p></speech>

It is better with lightning and water so it will offer a much better experience.  We would migrate those copper customers onto the fibre network and we would have that revenue and use it.</p></speech>

We have applied exactly the same model that we applied for the 300,000 if we wanted to build the national broadband plan.  In a world where NBI is successful and goes on to build the network, it would migrate our copper customers onto a fibre network.  We would lose that revenue as we would no longer have it to maintain our ducts and poles but we would get rental revenue from NBI and that is what would cover it.  We would lose revenue in terms of copper rental but we gain revenue from renting our ducts and poles, again, all at regulated prices.</p></speech>

The 300,000 we picked absolutely were the next most commercially viable.  We have never apologised for that.  We were asked by the Department where we were going to roll it out commercially and we told everybody.  That is absolutely the case.  As for whether the Department took revenue out of the NBP business case, yes, but it should also have taken cost out.  The revenue was taken out but the cost was not.  We are not saying it will cost us the same to pass a home in the intervention footprint, what we are saying is we will do all the things the same that we did in the 300,000.  We will charge the same connection charge.  We will charge the same connection criteria, overhead rather than underground.  We will use the poles and ducts</p></speech>

Theoretically and logically, the State money could be siphoned from one arm of the company to another.  Eir is a private company, but Ms Lennon is also a citizen of Ireland.  Would she not view it as a serious issue if any amount of taxpayers' money given to a large company over a long period went into other parts of the company where we did not have oversight of it?</p></speech>

We are completely regulated.  Every year, we produce regulated accounts that are scrutinised.  Neither NBI nor any of the other bidders do.  I would have thought that the State would have maximum visibility over our costs and accounts, and much more so than with the other operators.</p></speech>

We are the least risky of all those.  The other option was the universal service obligation, USO, model.

I would remove the 40,000 premises in rural areas that we have already handled.  That would save &euro;40 million.  I would not focus on the urban infills.  Commercially, they will be delivered over time.  Some of them have probably been delivered already.  As part of our national build, we will pick some of them up.  I would focus on the rural homes that are left.  If we narrowed the process down in that way, it would be more achievable in the timeline in question.  I see no need for a rural SLA that is better than the national SLA.  It is inefficient and I do not know anyone running a network who would recommend it.  I see no reason to have a smaller connection charge in the intervention footprint than in the roll-out to the 300,000 premises or the rest of the country.</p><p>I see no reason for the bidder not to use the passive product to get to the target of 300,000 premises.  If all of those changes were made, a decent amount of money would be saved and the people receiving the service would not really be any worse off than they are.</p></speech>

It  makes little difference, except that it is completely inefficient.  There are people such as engineers who are sitting around waiting for requests to carry out repairs to come in.  It makes no sense.  No one running a network would agree to this and it is not particularly beneficial to consumers either.  I would strip it all back because if I was living in rural Ireland, I would want to have a fibre connection.  I would be happy enough with a &euro;170 connection charge, as applies in the rest of the country, and I with an 85% SLA figure, as applies in the rest of the country.

As somebody who comes from rural Ireland, I am enthused by Ms Lennon's presentation.  We have had three or four public announcements on broadband going back over seven years.  In rural Ireland, in particular, people are sick, tired, angry, annoyed and fed up with the past two Governments, in particular.  I do not want to politicise the issue, but they are upset because in many areas they have been left without any service.  Ms Lennon has fielded every question.  She has had difficult questions asked of her and it is every member's right to ask such questions.  In my constituency of Roscommon-Galway people will be watching these proceedings and will pick up on them in news programmes later this evening.  They will be enthused by what Ms Lennon is saying.  I get the feeling that Eir wants to become involved, that it wants to bring the product into rural Ireland and that it wants to deliver it to people.  At one stage in recent years people involved in import and export businesses such as Westward Scania in my home town of Strokestown where Eir is active in installing broadband had to take it that material had to be sent quickly to Scania in Sweden in order that it could be sent the town of Mullingar without delay.  These are the problems with which we have had to deal.  It is an absolute scandal that we have allowed this situation to continue year after year.  I know of another case where somebody had to switch their business from north-east Roscommon to Longford.</p> <p>  Let us deal with the facts of what people have had to suffer during the years.  People living in rural Ireland and involved in businesses are saying they want broadband.  One interesting point that arose in the recent local elections campaign, in which I canvassed with various candidates, was that in many cases high speed broadband was not needed.  That is what people were saying on the doorstep.  They were saying they wanted reliable broadband.  As one person said to me, he or she did not want the broadband service to break down when making a passport application online.  In the case of a person who employs five people where their wages are being paid electronically, he or she does not want the service to break down on a Thursday evening.  That is what people want.  From where Ms Lennon is coming, she is giving some us hope and enthusiasm.  In fairness to Deputy Dooley, I know that he has been talking for some time about Eir or a company like it delivering such a service.</p> <p>  Where Eir has reached the edge of towns and villages and there are more than 300 houses if one moves a quarter of a mile in any direction, can Eir do anything to connect them?  I am talking about many parts of east Galway and Roscommon.  There are cases where there are quite a number of houses and broadband is provided to the edge of a village or town and no further, which is a disaster.  Can Eir continue the connection to bring some hope to those who want to be connected to broadband?  By the way, the broadband connection is horrific in parts of east Galway and Roscommon.  Some of the people affected are involved in businesses, but they also include many ordinary householders who are looking for a service.  As things stand, can Eir give me any hope or do anything for the people concerned?</p></speech>

I know that is not the answer he wants.  People write to me and contact me about this issue every day because we are closing out our rural builds.  By the end of the summer we will have the 340,000 premises done and will start our national build.  We could just keep on going, although it would be into the intervention footprint, which would cause more problems.  In that scenario, the figure would not be 340,000 but 400,000 and I would be over budget and behind in the national build.  I know that is not the answer the Deputy wants, but I would rather be honest with him than give false hope.  We are involved in some fixed wireless trials in rural areas to see what the opportunities are.  We have built the technology in four areas and will make it available to some customers.  Depending on how it works, there might be an opportunity in that regard, but in the case of fibre broadband our focus will turn to the national build once we finish the 340,000 premises at the end of the summer.</p></speech>

As I said, the original number was just over 300,000 premises.  Part of the additional 40,000 came on the back of requests from broadband officers.  We have also attended a number of events with them and get some feedback from them.  In some areas where they are particularly proactive it is much easier for us to get licences and some of the things we need to do done.  When things works with the broadband officers, they work well.</p></speech>

I was looking at what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il today.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	It seems that the &euro;1 billion bid about which Eir is talking would involve passing homes but not connecting any of them and does not cover maintenance costs for 25 years.  Therefore, it would be pretty useless to anyone. </blockquote> <p>I would like to hear Eir's response for the purpose of having absolute clarity.</p></speech>

Eir is regulated to provide a telephone service, regardless of where in the State people are.  It is also regulated to provide telephone books and telephone boxes.  We believe that is right and fine, but Eir pays the entire bill which is &euro;10 million per year, even though in many cases the service is provided for people who are not its customers.  We are happy to pay the percentage of the bill for Eir's customers, but the other operators that benefit from the USO should pay the percentage of the bill for their customers.  We have, therefore, challenged the regulator on the basis of fairness, as &euro;10 million per year is a lot of money.  We have no issue with the USO.  Eir will pay its fair share, but other operators should also pay theirs.</p></speech>

It was set up, probably during the era of Telecom &Eacute;ireann, when it had a monopoly.  To be quite honest, I believe it is ridiculous in this day and age to spend money to provide telephone books and telephone boxes.  It costs us &euro;10 million per year to provide them.  If the State wishes to keep the USO to provide voice services, it must be remembered that ours is the only utility to which it applies.  If a person wants to have an electricity supply in a remote location, he or she must pay the bill.  We have told the regulator that the USO is fine but that Eir will pay the bill for its market share - 50% - and that other operators, the customers of which benefit from the service, should pay their share.  I believe that is completely reasonable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Darragh Walshe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019062500002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chair and Members of the Oireachtas for the opportunity to provide detailed scrutiny of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill 2018.<br/><br/>By way of introduction, ICOS serves and promotes co-operative businesses and enterprises across multiple sections of the economy, making it the leading organisation for registering new co-operatives in Ireland and for providing reliable, experienced advisers on co-operative rules and governance.  Our core business is to provide leadership to the co-operative movement in Ireland.  We use our collective voice to put the needs of the co-operative movement and our member co-ops to the forefront of what we do.  We draw upon the pioneering and innovative spirit of our founding members to help strengthen the co-operatives operating in today's ever-changing and competitive world.<br/><br/>Starting from the agricultural co-operative path set in 1894 by our founding president, Sir Horace Plunkett, ICOS has evolved to serve the co-operative sector in seven core categories: multipurpose dairy co-operatives; livestock sector co-operatives; store, trade and wholesale co-operatives; service-related co-operatives; community-orientated, culture and leisure co-operatives; food, forestry, fishing and beverage co-operatives; and advisory and education-related co-operatives. <br/><br/><b><i></i></b>ICOS member co-operatives, their subsidiaries and associated entities collectively have more than 150,000 individual members owning shares in them, employ more than 14,000 people in Ireland and a further 24,000 abroad, and have a combined turnover of almost &euro;15 billion.  A significant proportion of this turnover is spent throughout Ireland on employee wages, payments to suppliers such as farmers and other small rural businesses and payments or dividends paid to the 150,000 co-operative members.  In addition to the economic benefits, co-operatives place great emphasis on enhancing the skills of co-operative staff and management.  They do this via the ICOS Skillnet training programmes, which allow co-operatives of all sizes to avail themselves of a wide variety of training resources in order to develop the skills of their personnel.<br/><br/>The Bill proposes a reduction in the minimum number of members from seven to three.  ICOS has reservations about the proposed reduction of special members for a number of reasons.  We are of the view that it does nothing to materially promote the seven principles of co-operation in the manner that the current figure does.  For example, the existing requirement of member numbers encourages the principles of voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, member economic participation and concern for community by simply requiring more people to be involved from the start.  Co-operative societies are sustained best where market failure drives collectivism and loyalty.  To mitigate this market failure and drive collectivism, there needs to be some level of scale.  In ICOS's experience, though not a guarantee of that necessary scale, the seven-member requirement is at least a strong indication of it.  ICOS has a degree of concern that the reduction could lead to what we term &quot;cosmetic co-operatives&quot;, where a business operates as a limited company while holding itself out as a co-operative in order to artificially gain good public relations and goodwill.<br/><br/>If there are to be benefits for co-operatives, whether in statute or Government policy, for the very reasons of promoting the original market failure and the logic of achieving together what cannot be achieved alone, to reduce the minimum membership opens up greater risk of abuse by individuals who would otherwise pursue another type of company vehicle.  If, as a result of the review of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, it transpires that the existing provision for seven is reduced to a lower number, we would strongly advocate that access to establishing co-operatives at that reduced number must come with strict criteria to mitigate the risks I have just outlined.<br/><br/>As an aside, in ICOS's experience of establishing co-operatives, the member limit is not a barrier to successful co-operative establishment.  What is a bar to successful establishment is start-up co-operatives not qualifying for certain supports, such as innovation vouchers, which are currently widely available to companies.  This in turn discriminates against the co-operative model and thus reduces the number of co-operatives being established.</p><p>Section 14 relates to the annual return exemption and the filing of statutory accounts to the registrar.  ICOS continues to support the transparency of filing accounts and the annual return, through AR15, to the registrar.  However, it also supports audit exemption for co-operative societies subject to specific criteria.  Over the past number of years, ICOS has received an increasing number of requests for assistance from small to medium-sized affiliates in respect of their increasing compliance burden.  In addition, we have lost potential new co-operatives due to the prohibitive cost of a statutory audit having to be carried out.  This results in them being unable to pursue their preferred corporate model and thus losing out on the co-operative benefits.  While recognising the key role that a robust regulatory framework plays in providing stability and fairness in the economy, ICOS is in favour of a statutory audit exemption provided that clearly defined criteria are set out in legislation as follows: the society&rsquo;s turnover not to exceed a stated amount; the society's balance sheet total not to exceed a stated amount; the number of employees not to exceed a stated number; and the society's membership not to exceed a stated number.  In addition, the society's rule book must provide for the exemption and require an appropriate periodic approval by an appropriate majority of the membership for the society to implement the exemption for the society's accounts.  Regarding the latter, we strongly advocate that the fundamental points advocated are varied only by an amendment to primary legislation.</p><p> The strength of a co-operative is that its members own and oversee the organisation.  Co-operatives are answerable to their members and to future generations of members.  It is essential that this strategic involvement is facilitated and promoted by any changes to legislation. </p></speech>

Co-operatives are jointly owned and democratically controlled businesses that provide goods and services to their member owners who work together for mutual benefit.  They act as a means of facilitating collective action in many sectors of the economy, including financial services; housing; food processing and marketing; retailing; community, health and other social care services; and enterprise and development.   The International Co-operative Alliance, an apex body for co-operatives, estimates that it represents close to 1 billion members of co-operatives, which employ 250 million people and generate more than US$2 trillion in turnover across the world.</p> <p>  The intention of the proposed amendment to sections 5 and 9 is to reduce the number of members required to establish a co-operative from seven to three.   As mutual organisations, a distinct feature of co-operatives is that a group of people come together with a shared purpose to meet their common needs.  In many cases, this will necessitate a comparatively large group of people, such as for agricultural processing or marketing, the provision of utilities such as water or housing, or retailing, where a large membership base may be needed to achieve economies of scope and scale and the services provided by the co-operative to members, or potential members, are likely to be in considerable demand.  However, in other situations, the number of initial members needed to form a co-operative is likely to be much lower.  For example, in the case of worker or employee-owned start-up co-operatives, which can operate in any sector of the economy, the initial membership base may be more similar to conventional, non-co-operative start-ups.  There is some evidence that a requirement to have a minimum of seven members is high for groups wishing to operate as a co-operative, and it is likely to be higher than the average numbers involved in start-up companies in Ireland. </p> <p>  Consequences of the requirement to have seven members at the outset for such co-operatives may include potential co-operatives choosing other models of incorporation that may not align with the co-operative ethos and practice or with the ideals of the owners, and the use of proxy members.</p><p> By way of international comparison, the co-operatives unit of the International Labour Organization, ILO, which is an agency of the United Nations, UN, collates the minimum number of co-operative members required to register a co-operative among member states.  Of member states, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Spain, Germany, Finland, Japan, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Uruguay have a requirement for three members.  Other countries require a higher number but many require three.  Work in progress by the International Co-operative Alliance reports that in the countries where worker co-operatives are well developed, the minimum number of founding members is low, such as two in France, and three in Italy and Spain.</p><p> The proposed amendment will bring the legislation more in line with international practice and companies legislation in Ireland.  It will also address ILO recommendation No. 193 of 2002, which applies to all types and all forms of co-operatives.  The recommendation indicates that "cooperatives should be treated in accordance with national law and practice and on terms no less favourable than those accorded to other forms of enterprise and social organization";  that "governments should provide a supportive policy and legal framework consistent with the nature and function of cooperatives and guided by the cooperative values and principles"; and that they should "establish an institutional framework with the purpose of allowing for the registration of cooperatives in as rapid, simple, affordable and efficient a manner as possible".</p><p> Co-operatives in many sectors of the world and many sectors of the economy are diverse, may develop in novel ways in the future and should not be hampered from doing so.  Worker co-operatives are few at present in Ireland and perhaps not sufficiently attended to in the current legislation.  Changing the minimum number may be helpful and is unlikely to have much of a cost implication.  A counter argument could be made, however, that reducing the number to three could lead to misinterpretation of what a co-operative is, namely, an organisation committed to providing solutions on a mutual and voluntary basis, open to all who can use its services and share in its benefits.  In this context, three would make little sense for many co-operative sectors aiming to provide a service widely, such as the traditional sectors of credit and agriculture.  As I mentioned, however, there are cases where a requirement for seven members sets the bar quite high, such as in enterprise development or new areas that might include youth employment initiatives, which are of particular interest to the committee.</p><p> It is important to remember that the proposed legislation, and legislation in general, is just one piece of the jigsaw of co-operative development.  A range of other supports and easily accessible information on co-operatives is required to facilitate better use of the model.  When promoted by co-operative development unit in the 1980s and 1990s, with support from the Government, trade unions and others, there was a marked uptake of the model.  Similarly, support from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta over the years has seen a community co-operative sector emerge.  Countries that provide such supports tend to have a vibrant co-operative sector.</p><p> On balance, we support the proposed amendment to reduce the number of members required to establish a co-operative to three.  It will make registration easier and we do not envisage any significant unintended consequences.</p><p> The intention of the amendment to section 14 is to make regulations exempting specified classes of society from the obligations to file annual returns and other specified documents relating to the annual returns.  The Bill's sponsor, Deputy Clare Daly, has acknowledged that part of the amendment will require some rewording or redrafting.  In a small but recent study we conducted at University College Cork, we examined co-operative start-ups, how people use the co-operative model, what facilitates them and what barriers they have experienced.  We found that members of small-scale co-operatives felt that what was required of them in respect of audited accounts and returns was disproportionate to the scale of operations and was scarcely different from the application of larger co-operatives.  The audit requirement can be a costly, administrative burden on small societies but there are clear benefits to having audited accounts, such as transparency and trust.  We recommend retaining the requirement for annual returns and audited accounts, while allowing specified societies to apply for an audit exemption under certain conditions, which might include an asset size or turnover threshold, or the criteria as outlined by ICOS, as is the case in companies legislation.</p><p> We need not spend much time on the use of electronic communication.  As of December 2018, the RFS online portal has been available and I believe that takes care of it.</p></speech>

The ACCA supports 219,000 members and 527,000 students in 179 countries.  We support 12,000 members and 8,000 students in Ireland.  The association was invited to make a submission to the committee on the Bill.  In that submission we identified that it was a limited scope amendment to old legislation and our comments are limited to the matters being amended.</p> <p>  We identify two substantive issues the committee should consider and some minor technical amendments.  Overall, we welcome the Bill as it will serve to reduce the administrative burden for industrial and provident societies.  The first substantive issue is that industrial and provident societies should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, GAAP, similar to the requirements in companies legislation.  The requirement for an annual return is substantially undermined if the financial statements attaching to the annual return are non-standard.  The Minister should be given the power to prescribe the form and content of financial statements for industrial and provident societies by way of regulation.  There is no evidence of abuse in the area but we have anecdotal evidence from our membership of different approaches being adopted for disclosure by various industrial and provident societies.  This leads to a lack of comparability and potential obfuscation of details that might be important to the shareholders.  Prescribing a set of rules to follow, as is done in company legislation, will ensure consistency.</p> <p>  The second substantive issue is that audit exemption should be available to industrial and provident societies on a similar basis to companies limited by guarantee.  This will serve to reduce the administrative burden for the smallest industrial and provident societies while also allowing any single shareholder to demand an audit.</p> <p>  A more technical concern is that section 14A(2) does not appear to be linked to section 14A(1).  The subsections will allow the Minister to grant exemption from public filing of annual returns and financial statements for certain classes of industrial and provident societies.  The exemption under section 14A(1) should be available only where the generality of section 14A(2) is met.  The two subsections need to be linked and the committee should consider changing "may" to "will", thereby requiring the Minister to provide an alternative when he or she provides an exemption rather than making it optional.</p></speech>

As a result, there is a consistency of the accounting treatment and of the disclosures in those financial statements.  Currently, there is no equivalent prescription in the Bill, which means that any industrial or provident society could make its own determination on the accounting treatment or the disclosure, rather than what would be generally acceptable.</p></speech>

While the ACCA commented only on the annual returns and audits elements of the Bill, the association and the Centre for Co-Operative Studies are broadly in agreement on the legislation.  There is an acceptance among those putting forward the legislation of the need for amendments to clarify the annual statements dimension.</p> <p>  Our guests from ICOS will have listened to the presentation from Ms Carroll.  I appreciate that the organisation is focused heavily on the area of agriculture and food.  Does it accept her point that ICOS's model of co-operatives, along with that of credit unions, requires a wider membership base or economies of scale for it to succeed?</p><p>There are other models of co-operatives that could, and would, need a reduction in the minimum number of seven.  The witnesses will be aware of the international comparison in this regard.  In a previous hearing, Deputy Clare Daly argued the ceiling here is a barrier because in comparison with other countries where the threshold is lower, the co-operative model is not working in Ireland.  I would like to hear the witnesses' response to those arguments and to the points raised by Ms Carroll from the Centre for Co-operative Studies.</p></speech>

We have always managed to get seven members.  There may be a limited number of areas in respect of which the minimum number needs to be reduced.  While there are countries that have a lower minimum, one would need to examine the principles they are following and whether they are successful co-operatives.  The purpose of a co-operative is economies of scale and the common purpose.  The question is if that is feasible with three members.  Seven is ideal because it means there are more people to help promote the purpose for which people have come together - the common goal.  As I said, based on our experience there is no need to lower the minimum number.</p></speech>

Dr. McCarthy said earlier that on balance the Centre for Co-operative Studies supports the amendment to reduce the number of members required to establish a co-operative to three but it has some reservations in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-25a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Olive McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019062500002#M00800"><p>Our thinking is that while three might be a minimum it should not necessarily be a target.  Growth is particularly important.  In the area of worker co-operatives, many start-up companies would have one, two or three people establishing those companies and so to put the worker co-operative on an equal footing three would be an ideal number to enable more worker co-operatives to get started.  We are not of the view that the minimum should remain at three forever.  Perhaps what a worker co-operative should be trying to do is to grow its numbers and become much bigger over time.  We see examples of this in France, where worker co-operatives start-up with three members but, on average, over the last four years, there have been 70 worker co-operatives wherein the numbers have grown to almost 21.  We would see three as a starting point to facilitate the set up of co-operatives, but not necessarily as the number at which the minimum will always be set.</p></speech>

I would like to raise a couple of issues.  Dr. McCarthy in addressing the issue raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn went some way towards addressing an issue I want to raise.  Obviously, one size does not fit all.  A workers co-operative is a very different entity to an agricultural co-operative or a retail co-operative.</p><p>The point has been made that when they start, they start small.  Perhaps then some of the concerns raised could be addressed by some of the terms and conditions for exemptions.  In other words, the number of members in a co-operative would be influenced by its turnover.  As the co-operative gets bigger, the minimum number has to increase.  This Bill seeks to ensure that a workers co-operative can start and benefit from co-operative status such that innovation and enterprise is not limited only to those who have money to invest.  We need to encourage the worker-owned co-operative principle, which is a good principle.</p><p> On the innovation voucher, as I do not know much about it the witnesses might elaborate further on it and explain why start-up co-operatives do not qualify for it but businesses do.  Auditing and filing accounts is an integral part of any business.  Auditing is very expensive and so the criteria around it obviously need to be reviewed.  This could be addressed in the Bill through amendments.  Filing of accounts is a must.  Everyone in business or involved in a co-operative should concern themselves with ensuring that accounts are being recorded properly and that there is no room for issues arising, as has happened all too often in this country in so many different organisations, big and small.  People need to be protected.  Not everybody in a co-operative, small or big, is gifted with the expertise to spot problems arising, and so they depend on professionals for it.  I would welcome more information on the innovation voucher and so on.</p></speech>

It is one of the supports offered by the local enterprise offices.  It has been brought to my attention on a couple of occasions in recent months that co-operatives are being deemed ineligible for such a support for the reason that they were co-operatives.  They are being advised to set up as a private company or a company limited by guarantee.  Support can be the difference between an idea getting of the ground or a co-operative getting to the next level or not.  The level of support is relatively small, but for co-operatives operating on this level, it could be a percentage of turnover or, as I said, it could be what gets them off the ground or to the next level.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment to section 14 of the principal Act, which deals with audits, recommends retention of the requirement for annual returns and audited accounts while allowing specific societies to apply for an audit exemption under certain conditions, which might include an asset size turnover threshold, as in the case in companies legislation.  I note Mr. Walshe spoke a little on this issue but I would welcome Ms Carroll's and Mr. Murtagh's thoughts on it.</p></speech>

This is an issue for co-operatives and it also came up in research we were doing.  We do not propose to get into the criteria except to say that some of the criteria mentioned by ICOS seem very sensible.  What we were alluding to in our recommendation is that this provision already exists, although not willy-nilly for everybody.</p><p>It applies in specific circumstances.  I suppose that is what we could look at in terms of a level playing pitch.</p></speech>

That already exists under the Companies Act.  In terms of ensuring that stakeholders are protected insofar as is possible, those criteria have already been established within company law and they relate to turnover, assets and number of employees.  Those criteria are reasonably substantial thresholds within company law.  However, there is also a protection.  In the context of something that would potentially be analogous, if we consider the position of companies limited by guarantee where we are looking at protecting our membership in that respect, there is the override that if there is a single member who is not comfortable with the fact that a company is availing of an exemption, that member can require an audit.  Commercially, in terms of what is protecting stakeholder interests, the exemption thresholds are appropriate provided that safeguard is in place.  Our issue here is that there should be a correlation between the Bill and the provisions in the Companies Act regarding the numbers.  If there is a change, it should not necessarily be ignored.  There should be a direct impact of that change such that if it is deemed that the thresholds should be larger, this would trigger a review of the thresholds relating to industrial and provident societies and <i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Mr. Gary Martin, Ms Theodora Corcoran, Mr. Tommy Murray and Ms Caroline Kiernan.  Apologies have been received from Ms Breda Power, assistant secretary with responsibility for the Department's commerce, consumer and competition division.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The Department made a previous detailed submission on this Private Members' Bill on 10 May in which we addressed the issues raised by the joint committee.  I will therefore confine my remarks today to the main provisions of the Bill.  This submission will deal with the framing of the Bill as an amendment to the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2018; its scope as determined by the proposed reduction in the number of members as a condition to form industrial and provident societies in section 2; the proposal in section 5 regarding exemptions by regulations for specified classes of societies from the requirement to file annual returns or certain specified classes of documents that would otherwise be required to be included as part of an annual return; and the proposed registration of industrial and provident societies and filing by electronic means as set out in section 6 of the Bill.  My submission will draw, among other things, on stakeholder submissions to the public consultation on the operation and implementation of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 to 2014, recent submissions to the Department on the issues raised by the Private Members' Bill by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, or ICOS, and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, or NFGWS, as well as on examples of the way these issues have been addressed in co-operative legislative frameworks across Europe.</p> <p>  The Department understands that the Bill aims to make the process of establishing and registering a co-operative much easier.  The Department recognises fully the continuing importance of the co-operative movement throughout Ireland and is undertaking a root and branch review of the legislation with a view to consolidating and modernising it to make it easier to understand and navigate.  The committee will be aware that the Department has conducted a public consultation on the operation and implementation of industrial and provident societies legislation.  The ten submissions received on foot of that consultation highlighted the need for a consideration of a wide range of issues, including providing co-operative societies with a distinct legislative identity which reflects the co-operative ethos, revising the provisions on debentures, the need to provide for a consolidated rule book, registration and electronic attendance and voting.  Issues raised by the Private Members' Bill also featured in some of the submissions.</p><p>The Department is considering other issues, including modernising the language, removing references to other jurisdictions, governance and the powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, RFS.  Following the completion of the comprehensive review of the legislative framework, it is proposed that a general scheme of modernised and consolidated legislation will be brought forward later this year.  This will consolidate into one statute and modernise all existing legislation relating to industrial and provident societies in order to ensure a level playing field across co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities.  It will also provide a conducive framework for realising the full potential of the diverse range of organisations that use the co-operative model.<br/><br/>I refer to the proposal to reduce the minimum number of members of a co-operative.  Section 2 proposes to reduce from seven to three the minimum number of members required as a condition of registration of industrial and provident societies.  The sponsors of the Bill indicate that the rationale for reducing the membership criterion to three is based on the average number of employees in SMEs, which they put currently at 3.87 per business.  The sponsors also noted that the proposed minimum membership criterion prevails across other European countries and that the reduction in the minimum number of members has not resulted in any unintended consequences.  As part of its review of industrial and provident societies legislation, the Department has analysed the submissions received, conducted research on practices across Europe and is engaging in bilateral discussions with stakeholders to explore the various policy options relating to this issue.  While three of the ten submissions to the public consultation have suggested a reduction in the minimum number of members, there was no consensus on what this minimum number should be.  For example, the Centre for Co-operative Studies at UCC suggested a reduction to three members, Co-operation Works proposed a minimum of two members and Co-operative Housing Ireland requested a reduction to either two or three members.  In addition, recent submissions to the Department from two of the co-operative umbrella organisations, ICOS and National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, do not indicate support for reducing the minimum number of members to three.  While the NFGWS, which has over 400 affiliate group water scheme members, had no difficulty with reducing the minimum number of members, it considered three to be a low number given the community nature of these societies and the vital importance of proportional representation, in particular when a society is being established.  ICOS, which represents 130 co-operative societies, was strongly of the view that the current requirement of seven members had never acted as an impediment to the establishment of a sustainable co-operative.<br/><br/>Different approaches have been taken across Europe in respect of the minimum number of members required to form a co-operative, ranging from one in Finland to ten in Poland.  Research on co-operative legislation indicates a trend in co-operative law to reduce this minimum number, which, according to the <i>International Handbook of Co-operative Law 2013</i>, is three on average across European jurisdictions.  The Statute for a European Co-operative Society requires five or more members for a co-operative straddling more than one EU member state.  In considering the proposal to reduce the minimum number of members required to form a co-operative from seven to three, regard must be had to the need to ensure that the reduction in the minimum number of members does not act as an impediment to the establishment of viable and sustainable co-operatives with members who have the necessary skills to run these entities.  While the Department fully recognises the importance of creating favourable conditions for encouraging a range of start-ups, including co-operatives, and is open to reducing the minimum number of members, the optimum number of members required to establish a sustainable co-operative will need to be carefully examined to ensure it meets the needs of Irish co-operatives.  As part of its review process, the Department is engaging bilaterally with stakeholders in order to establish, among other things, the optimum minimum number of members.<br/><br/>I move now to the proposals relating to certain filing exemptions.  Section 5 provides for the Minister to exempt, by means of regulation, specified classes of societies from the requirement to file annual returns or certain specified classes of documents that would otherwise be required to be included as part of an annual return.</p><p>Section 5 provides for the Minister to exempt by regulations specified classes of societies to file annual returns or certain specified classes of documents that would otherwise be required to be included as part of an annual return.  The Bill provides that these exemptions may correspond to exemption provisions applying to companies.</p><p> None of the responses to the public consultation requested exemptions from filing annual returns, as the Bill proposes.  However, five out of ten responses requested the introduction of audit exemptions for co-operatives in line with the approach taken in the Companies Act 2014.</p><p> The concept of an audit exemption applicable to companies derives from EU law.  The threshold criteria which apply are set down by the EU.  Private companies which satisfy certain conditions can be exempted from the requirement to have their financial statements audited.  There is no similar regime on audit exemptions at EU level in respect of co-operatives.  The available information indicates that member states provide audit exemptions which could be based on the exemption thresholds applying in EU company law or nationally set thresholds.</p><p> We note that at the meeting of the committee on 11 June, the sponsors of the Bill indicated that their intention was to seek audit exemptions rather than exemptions from filing annual returns.  In light of that, I have not gone into any detail about the provisions on exempting co-operatives from filing annual returns as drafted in the Bill.  The issue of introducing audit exemptions for co-operatives is being considered under the current comprehensive review.  The Department is supportive of introducing audit exemptions for co-operatives and is working with stakeholders to establish the appropriate criteria for exempting co-operatives from having to have their accounts audited.</p><p> Section 6 of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill 2018 provides for the registration of industrial and provident societies and filing by electronic means.  While these are clearly worthwhile provisions, they have been overtaken by events.  The Industrial and Provident Societies (Forms) Regulations 2018, which provide for the introduction of electronic filing for the most frequently filed Registry of Friendly Societies, RFS, forms came into effect on 13 September 2018.  The RFS online facility was launched on 6 December 2018.  It allows for the registration of new entities online and filing by electronic means of annual returns, amendments, including partial and full rule amendments, making online payments for filings and ordering documents online.  The electronic forms are available on an optional basis.  The fees for the RFS submissions were also changed in August 2018 to bring them in line with similar fee types used by the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  The new regulations included a provision for the reduction in fees for documents filed online.</p><p> The Department recognises the important role of the co-operative model.  It is clear there is support from stakeholders of the goal to modernise the legislation and align it with the realities of the 21st century business and regulatory environment.</p></speech>

We are planning to bring forward the general scheme of the Bill towards the end of this year.  It will include provisions such as the audit exemption.  While the Department is supportive of introducing an audit exemption, the matter needs to be analysed further with stakeholders.  We have conducted research on arrangements in other countries.  What they have applied varies and it is not set out in EU law.  Stakeholders have a different view, particularly as regards the safeguards which should be applied with an audit exemption and the specific criteria for the thresholds to be applied in terms of the numbers of members and employees, as well as turnover and balance sheet.  That will have to be explored in further detail.</p></speech>

The question is to what it should be reduced.  As I outlined, even from the stakeholders, there is a diverse range of opinions.  The National Federation of Group Water Schemes represents a third of the current societies registered.  We actively sought its views because it had not responded to our consultation process.  It indicated that while it would support a reduction, three may not be the correct number.</p> <p>  The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, has strongly stated it would not like that minimum number to be reduced and outlined its reasons for that, while others have indicated they would like it to brought down to three.  We will have to explore that further bilaterally with some more of the stakeholders, including Co-operative Housing Ireland which put forward the case in a consultation response for it to be reduced.  We are planning to meet it in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

We seem to have a general consensus that the Department is supportive of introducing audit exemptions, as are the witnesses.  It is to be hoped some common ground can be found on this matter.</p> <p>  On the reduction of members required for registering a co-op from seven to three, all co-operatives are different.  Whereas three may work for some, it might not work for others.  Seven could be too many for another.  A threshold of five was not used at all.  Could that be a way forward?  As Senator Humphreys said, the average number of employees in a SME is 3.5 people.  Seven may be a burden for some co-operatives.</p><p>It may not be burdensome for people on group water schemes, which may have dozens of houses.</p><p> The fact that the Department is engaging is very welcome.  The committee's job is to scrutinise this Bill and, in fairness, the document we received from the Centre for Co-operative Studies is excellent in setting out the issues.  On balance, it supports the proposed amendment to reduce the number of members required to establish a co-operative to three.  The task of the Department is to prove now that having three members may not work.  On balance, people feel that having three members will work.  I am involved with many committees and I see three as a small number.  If the choice was between three members and seven, I would consider having five.  The more people there are at the coalface of an organisation or a co-operative, the more helpful it would be.  I accept, nonetheless, that there may be times when, in the context of setting up a specific co-op relating to food or agriculture, it may not be possible to get more than three members.
