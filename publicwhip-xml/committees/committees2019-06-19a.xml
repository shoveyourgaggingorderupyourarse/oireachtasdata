They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the committee for the huge amount of work they have put into developing the concept of a climate action strategy that will help us achieve the targets we have set.  I also take this opportunity to thank my officials who are here, Mr. Brian Carroll and Mr. Eoin McLoughlin, and the many other officials in other Departments who have contributed immensely to the development of this plan, which is determined to raise our ambition and deliver on the expectations that children and future generations are putting upon us.</p> <p>  The past ten years have seen Ireland achieve a great deal.  In many ways, those things would have been unthinkable in the past.  We changed our Constitution and we brought our economy back to full employment.  However, we can and we must do the same for the greatest challenge facing humanity today, namely, global warming and the impact it is having on our society and the sustainability of civilisation and the natural world, which so many people are looking to us to protect.</p> <p>  Ireland is far off course and very exposed.  We set a target of reducing emissions by 20%.  Between 2013 and 2020, the impact of the recession brought us below the curve but when the economy started to recover, it was very clear that we failed to break the link between economic prosperity and carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.  We have to act now to make ourselves resilient in the face of this perilous threat facing the globe.  The longer we delay taking the necessary action, the harder it will be and the fewer opportunities will be available to our people in the coming change.</p><p>Like many of those achievements, we started by developing a determined resolve across our community.  That is the significance of this Oireachtas committee bringing forward, on the basis of the proposals coming from the Citizens' Assembly, a detailed worked-out strategy based on hours of hearings.  As with other challenges we faced in making change in this country, that has created a solid foundation.  It is something that can allow us to bring the community together behind this effort.  It is not without significance that the committee's report was endorsed unanimously by the D&aacute;il, in that process declaring a climate and biodiversity emergency.  That has created an important backdrop for the work we are now seeking to do.</p><p> This effort is integral to the vision that we have for Ireland in Project Ireland 2040 of a country that is regionally balanced and that is compact, connected and sustainable.  There is much work to be done to realise that vision.</p><p> I accept fully that Government has major and central responsibility in bringing forward this plan and designing the roadmap for achieving our targets.  In doing that, we have sought to design a pathway that is both sensible and fair, sensible in the sense that we have selected areas which represent the least burden to our community in making the adjustment.  We have gone to great care to evaluate the different options and different technologies and how they might evolve over the next ten years and picked a pathway that represents the least burden and the most opportunity.  We have also been at pains to ensure that those who are most exposed or least equipped to support the change necessary will be supported as a part of this plan.</p><p> I suppose what makes the journey difficult for people is that we all have to make a big shift in our priorities in how we spend our money and how we live our lives.  It is important that we engage with citizens as leaders of this community to persuade them that this is the right course and that the future resilience of their children, farms, enterprises and homes depends on us making changes that adapt to this new reality.  There are actions expected of every section of Irish society and one will see these are detailed in the chapters on electricity, enterprise, agriculture, transport, the built environment, waste generation and the circular economy; on the public service leading by example; and on the international stage.</p><p> I am confident that when we determine to make a shift, we build on this shared determination, and we put in place the structures that we are putting in place here that are legally underpinning this and overseen with the leadership of the Taoiseach's office.  We can deliver this change.  The committee will recognise in much of the plan its own fingerprints and the work that it has put in.</p><p> We are supporting the European Union aim to be net zero in 2050 and undertaking the work to show how Ireland can contribute to that.  We are aiming for 70% renewables in electricity.  We are aiming to deliver the 30% reduction in the non-ETS.  We are adopting what I might call a "precautionary principle" in doing that.  We are not relying on high oil prices to do the lifting for us or switching from the ETS sector to make less adaptation in the undertaking.  Of course, the reason we are doing this is that the period to 2020 is the start of the change we must make if we are to reach net zero in 2050; the pace of change will increase in that second period after 2030.  It is right that we try to do as much as we can in this early period when we get a much bigger payback in terms of the overall impact.</p><p> We are adopting carbon budgets, with a target range assigned to each Department and sector.  This is a powerful tool to change the way Departments and Ministers think about their responsibilities.  We are all used to living within the financial resources that are given to us.  We must now be conscious that we must live within the carbon resources that are afforded to us in a fair way.  That is also something this committee was determined to see.</p><p> We have adopted a model of a climate implementation board in the Taoiseach's office so that we have that central not only co-ordination but impetus and momentum of accountability to the very heart of Government.  We are strengthening the Joint Committee on Climate Action, as the committee itself recommended.  We are updating our legislative arrangements so that the responsibility and accountability will be clearcut.</p><p> I hope the committee sees in this plan something that it can support and adopt.  It deals with an issue that is contentious for some, namely the pricing of carbon.  I am an absolute believer in the pricing of carbon.  It is important to recognise that the emission of carbon dioxide damages our environment and at present people do not pay for the damage that is created.  In any trajectory of change, we must recognise the polluter pays principle and the damage has to be included in the price if we are to make the right decisions.</p><p> We have here something that is workable and deliverable.  We have 183 actions that get this project off to a strong start but I assure the committee that this will be a rolling plan.  We will be taking on board new ideas and new suggestions.  We will be adapting it based on experience and we will be seeking to make this a rolling, adaptive and sensitive approach to what is an important challenge.</p><p> This is a test for all of us, particularly those of us who are policy makers.  It is a test for citizens as well.  I believe that the spark of creative power is strong in Ireland and that if we can kindle that, we will deliver this change and ensure that we pass on this country, but also the globe, in a better condition as a result of the actions we initiate from now on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee at such short notice, in fact, in the same week that he launched the all-of-Government action plan.  Members are eager to discuss the measures in this plan with him.  It is the most ambitious plan ever to come from Government addressing climate change and how to reach our targets.</p> <p>  The Minister has listened to us as a cross-party committee.  He has adopted many of the committee's recommendations, some of them word for word which is quite unusual for any Government action plan.  We all look forward to working with him over the weeks and months ahead to ensure that these measures are rolled out.</p> <p>  In the area of governance, the fact that the Minister has adopted our recommendation on governance is central to this whole plan, ensuring that we, as a standing committee, will have the oversight, in relation to implementation, accountability and transparency, for all Departments and State agencies in reaching their targets.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister.  This is an all-of-Government plan and the Minister made reference to the fact that, as then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, he had an all-of-Government action plan on jobs.  What are the learnings from that process in 2011, where the Minister had to reduce unemployment from 16% - it is now down to below 5%?  From working with the different Departments and pulling the different Secretaries General and officials together, what are the learnings from that process that the Minister could use in implementing this ambitious climate action plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#C00300"><p>I refer to the learnings that I mentioned among which accountability from the centre is crucial.  If one has 15 distinct Departments and they all are working to their own priorities and within their own silos the needed change will not be achieved unless one has not only a verbal commitment to deliver but it also becomes a priority within that silo</p><p>When things do not work as intended, there will not be quick adaptation and responsiveness within the different sections of government.  Having the central authority of the Taoiseach overseeing these targets and the reporting on them on a quarterly basis will ensure this becomes a top priority.  That was a feature of the action plan we had.</p><p> The other very important element is the capacity to continually adapt to the experience, new suggestions and finding where the boot pinches, if one likes, in trying to achieve the change.  We must carry people with us.  It cannot all be about imposing change on people.  We must talk to people, understand and work with them in order to make changes.</p><p> The scale of this challenge is different.  In trying to deliver employment growth everyone started with a shared objective.  In this area there will be more of a tendency for people to ask why someone else is not making more of an effort.  One of the challenges is to ensure what we will ask of different segments of the community is fair and balanced.  That is a challenge on a scale that is different from what we experienced with the Action Plan for Jobs.  In recognising the difference we have put much more legislative infrastructure behind this.  We recognise the role of the committee as being really powerful and the need for the accountability of individual Ministers to the committee.  While we are building on the previous model, we are adapting it in the light of the work of the committee and the scale of the challenges we are seeking to meet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.  As we dig deeper into the report, it becomes evident that while it is clear on why we need to do what must be done - we are all aware of this - it is about setting out clearly what needs to be done to reach the targets we have set and moving towards net zero emissions by 2050, but it is relatively light on how we are going to do it.  In saying that, we need to look at costs.  I know that there was a discussion yesterday about this issue at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, but is there clarity on the cost, on the one hand, and, on the other, savings to be achieved based on the actions and what needs to be done?  Will the Government set out how much of the cost of the new climate plan will have to be carried by the Exchequer and non-Exchequer sources?</p> <p>  On accountability and targets, will the Department provide information on implementing the committee's recommendations?  We need some more information on this aspect.  </p> <p>  On the just transition in detail, for example, our recommendation was clear.  We indicated the need for a just transition task force.  The plan only identifies that a just transition review will be carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which is already carrying out some research in the area.  If we are serious about the impacts of the actions that must be taken, there will be a significant effect on certain parts of the country.  There was much talk here about the impact on the midlands of the non-use of peat in any aspect of the economy, not just on the electricity side of things.  There is a target to end the burning of coal at Moneypoint by 2025, while the plan speaks about moving away from fossil fuels in the heating of homes.  That will have an impact on those who are servicing the industry.</p> <p>  There will be a significant transition required in the various sectors and I do not know how it will be catered for from the Government's perspective.  The more I read the report, the more I gain an understanding of what the Taoiseach spoke about in "nudging" the public along, rather than hand-holding them through the process, which I believe is necessary.  If people are only nudged along in the areas where jobs will be affected or even taken away, they will be left behind.  We were very clear at this committee during the various hearings that we should not end up in a rust belt scenario, as was evident in the United States or other countries where there had been a move away from traditional industries.  I would like to hear much more from the Minister about how that process will be managed.  We can have all the accountability we want and oversight by the Taoiseach's office, but unless we have the work done contained within, it will just be a box-ticking exercise.  The Government will have to take a much more involved role.</p> <p>  On the energy side, we very much support the idea of getting much more of our energy from offshore wind energy projects.  I would like to see detailed plans in place to assist that sector and recognise how there can be a dividend from being part of the early adoption of these technologies and developing them to the point where there can be a new industry for us.  </p> <p>  Also on the energy side, will the Minister explain why it will take two years to introduce the feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaics, PV.  The plan indicates a pilot microgeneration grants scheme for solar PV will not be in place until 2021 which is quite a distance out.  Will the Minister confirm that community-led development and citizen participation will be supported in the first round of the auction under the renewable energy share, RES, scheme, on which we really need to get moving?  Part of it is getting citizens to participate.  These are measures in which people can and want to participate.  When people contact us, they say microgeneration is a big issue.</p> <p>  On the housing side, is there any available information on the cost per home in various sectors?  As we know the building system and models used for houses in different times, has there been any analysis of the cost per house of a deep retrofit?  We all use these terms that slip off the tongue, but somebody will have to pay for it.  I am certainly concerned that if we are depending on citizens to make these changes in order that we will make these binding targets, we will place a huge burden on the shoulders of homeowners.  We need to be up-front with them at an early stage and indicate what will be the cost.  Will they be able to afford it off their own bat or will the State have to do more to support them?</p> <p>  Our report requested the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to produce a plan for the agriculture sector to align it with meeting our Paris Agreement commitments, including a review of national land use under agriculture schemes and extensive public engagement.  The Minister's plan makes no such commitment, nor does it provide any of the detail of the ongoing review and revision of Food Wise 2025.  Will he mention some of the reasoning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#D00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his constructive contribution throughout the debate both in the Chamber and here.  </p> <p>  On costs, we have &euro;30 billion in the national development plan assigned for this purpose, including investments in retrofitting, the grid and so on.  It includes the climate action fund.  There is significant money being set aside to achieve this.  We have learned that we must be more innovative in using some of the money.  This relates to the Deputy's final question.  We rely largely on subsidies given to individuals to undertake retrofitting, but that model will not deliver the scale and aggregation we need to achieve.</p><p>We must think in terms of targeting wider areas, aggregating and scaling up work, using smarter procurement for more cost-effective professional advice and installation work and developing smarter finance and easier payment methods.  We recognise that we need to use our money more innovatively.  Almost &euro;4 billion has been set aside in that area and we must ensure that we use that in a targeted way which has the greatest impact and delivers quicker than the current model.</p><p> In delivering this, we had to consider a range of policy instruments for every sector.  We cannot expect the Exchequer to fund all change.  We had to ask in which cases regulatory changes are appropriate as a means of creating an obligation for people to make those changes.  This approach tends to be adopted where the case for not making the change is very weak and the changes are necessary because they stand out as sensible both economically and in terms of climate.  That is why we are discussing the options of obliging employers with more than 20 parking spaces to have electric charging facilities, requiring new homes to be built to a net zero energy standard and eliminating the use of oil boilers from 2022.  In some cases, we are making decisions to impose requirements where the cost must be borne by the people.  We will choose those areas sensitively and they will evolve over time and recognise the difficulties that will be encountered, for example, supply chain issues.</p><p> It is important that carbon pricing is recognised as a means of changing the payback period for people contemplating changes.  If there is a trajectory for carbon prices, people will choose to adopt changes earlier than would otherwise be the case.  Everyone who has considered this challenge and advised on it, including the Climate Change Advisory Council, has recognised that.  Incentives also have a role.  That can often be important, particularly in introducing people to technologies they might not otherwise consider.  Significant supports have been available for deep retrofitting, the adoption of electric vehicles and so on.  A mixture of policy tools will have to be developed and adapted over time to shape the share-out of cost.  In addition, money raised through a carbon price will be available for disposal.  The Minister is consulting on how that might best be done.  This offers an opportunity.</p><p> Approximately 75% of the measures we have chosen pay for themselves.  They would be good for the country, even if there was no climate crisis.  It is important to recognise that.  There is not a net cost to all these measures, some of which are very justifiable, especially in areas such as electric vehicles, retrofitting work and elements of agriculture.  The selection of measures and their sequencing were based on a recognition that some of them will be economic today, while in the case of others, for example, batteries, technology will bring down the price at a certain point such that they become economic.  This is an evolving area where we must adapt policy and ensure it is delivering the targets.  There is no perfect foresight where we can see a curve with a series of fixed elements for which an exact share-out of the sort the Deputy suggests is available.</p><p> The just transition should be integral to the implementation of the plan.  Having the NESC issue strong advice that will be core to the implementation of the plan, which will be run from the Taoiseach's office and my office, is the right way to do it.  It makes the NESC integral to the plan.  We will have to use the new opportunities creatively, for example, retrofitting and microgeneration, to ensure they recognise areas of pressure, including the bioeconomy and the renewables sector, to which the Deputy referred.  We will need to use the regional enterprise funds, the urban and rural funds and climate action funds in a way to support the transition.  </p><p> The decision on achieving 70% renewables was very important.  The Deputy is correct that we will need detailed planning to achieve this and that planning is being undertaken.  We can absorb up to 65% renewables on the grid at the moment and we are developing plans to push that figure up to 75% and subsequently to 90%.  We must make changes in the grid's capacity to make much higher shares of renewables possible.  </p><p> The committee has been conscious that we must adapt the Foreshore Act to provide for offshore wind capabilities.  The Deputy is absolutely right that detailed planning is needed and that is already under way.  The plan will extend to dividends for the community.  We anticipate community gain and participation and the first round of the renewable energy share, RES, scheme will include a pot to be allocated to community bids.</p><p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has done a great deal of work on how much it costs to retrofit homes and how one incentivises people to retrofit their homes and come together to have work done.  The authority has developed sustainable energy communities and various grant schemes, including the warmer homes scheme which provides grants of up to 100%.  As the Deputy will have seen, while it costs approximately &euro;14,000 to undertake external wall insulation in a typical home, cavity wall insulation costs approximately &euro;2,000.  There are significant differences in the cost of improving the fabric of a home depending on the starting point.  Heating control systems cost around &euro;1,000 but they have a rapid payback in terms of the impact on heating bills.  Grants are also available for heat pumps and solar installation.</p><p> We have a fair idea of the costs involved in retrofitting homes and different houses will have a different menu to choose from.  The ambition is that 500,000 households, or approximately 30% of the 1.75 million homes in the country, will have made significant investment in the fabric of their houses by 2030.  I acknowledge that this requires people to change what they regard as the priority for their home.  They will have to view future-proofing their homes for the changes taking place around the globe as beings as important as other items on which they spend money in their homes.  The State will have to change its approach achieve this because the current model is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

It is one of our priorities.  It is integral to moving from where we are on a more accelerated basis.</p> <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council has indicated that it is doing work on agriculture and land use, and we look forward to the outcome of that.  It will be integral to the design of the Common Agricultural Policy which is also in evolution in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is no doubt that land use and how we manage land can make a significant difference.  Even in this iteration of the plan that will run until 2030, land use, agriculture and forestry will contribute more than 40% to the amount of abatement, including the legacy of the forestry we already have.</p><p>It is really important that we make decisions in this regard and there will be big changes in farm practices, as well as diversification over time and an ambition to nearly double the amount of forestry that we are planting.  Delivering in those areas will be integral to the plan.  </p></speech>

The whole-of-Government approach and reaching out to communities will be a very important means of engaging with everybody.  There is no doubt that citizens now are very aware of what we need to do and being a small island, we need to show this kind of leadership.</p> <p>  Are there details on how people can access the smart finance?  Sustainable energy communities and microgeneration often came up as being very positive when we were thinking about our recommendations for the plan.  How will the planning restrictions be handled for rooftop solar panels?  Will they be changed?  Can the Minister give us more detail on the midlands retrofit scheme?  I am a member of the transition team in Offaly which is a cross-stakeholder group led by Offaly County Council.  It can bring a lot of learning to the table and it would be useful to engage with it.  The Minister might be able to give me some information on that.  It is very important that the board be based in the Taoiseach's office from a governance point of view but how will that work in practice?  Who will form part of that board?  How will the just transition review group work?  Will it, for example, engage with the transition team in Offaly or how will that go within the National Economic and Social Council, NESC?  </p></speech>

Someone asked me why we put it in as the last chapter rather than the first.  That is a reasonably well-made point.  I suppose the idea was to outline the scale of the challenges in the sectors and then see how we ensure that communities can participate.</p> <p>  I omitted to answer Deputy Dooley's question on microgeneration.  We do need to consider planning restrictions.  That is one of the areas.  We need to consider the pricing. The Citizens' Assembly recommended a wholesale price and there is an EU obligation on us to pay.  We are conscious of the need to think that through because some of the schemes elsewhere have run into difficulties of equity as between people who are selling into the grid and those who are not and the share out of the cost of running the grid.  We have to make sure there is an equitable scheme there.  We aim to have that worked out by the end of 2020, which is ahead of the legal obligation of 2021.</p> <p>  The sustainable energy communities are great exemplars.  They have run from small to very large scale.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has very good experience in this.  It has mentors and the opportunity to develop a plan and there is support for that.  It then has the opportunity to implement that plan and there is another layer of support for that.  The sums of money can be quite big.  They require partnerships.  It cannot be just the local authority.  It has to involve multiple sectors within the community.  The plan envisages that the number of those would grow sixfold over its course.  We want to see far more people getting involved in that, as well as the sort of community participation that Deputy Dooley was talking about.  </p> <p>  The details of the smart finance and the area-based schemes have yet to be worked out.  There is no doubt that the local authorities and the housing associations are critical players or obligated entities, as they are called, which now support some of the sustainable energy communities, employers, funders and the State and the SEAI.  We will have to design a package that can aggregate that work, take on the professional expertise in an effective way, reach out to communities in a way that is more effective than the one-off application form model and develop easier payment methods.  We have seen the ability of the State in partnership with financial institutions in microlending to bring down that cost.  It may involve the State taking a layer of the risk but we need to evolve that model.  We are starting that work as a priority.  </p> <p>  The full make-up of the implementation board has yet to be decided but we must make that the Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of my Department are at its core and that reporting is to the Taoiseach.  Experience shows that creates a level of accountability that guarantees a much higher response rate to the actions we are putting in place.</p> <p>  The area-based scheme in the midlands is evolving and will involve local authorities, housing associations active in the area and other energy entities in the area, funders, employers, community groups.  We need to get a group that is effective but also a model that can deliver effectively and the design of that is under way.  The Government recognises that we need to do that and that proceeding on the present basis with subsidies will not get the scale of change we need.  </p></speech>

We have that creative capability.  It works best when we work in collaboration.  We have political consensus on why we need to do this and what we need to do.  We have to work out the how and that is an iterative process.  There is really important work in this plan which echoes the work the committee did on that process and the way we pulled together to do it.  That is the good news and the key story.</p> <p>  The committee work has been based on the understanding that we have a 100 million tonne gap.

Is that contingent on the European Union as a whole agreeing it?  Are we agreeing it now?  What is the status?  If we are agreeing it, the 7% per annum decrease in emissions would, presumably, have to be 8% or 9% after 2030.  </p><p> Everything that I have read about the transition is that it is cheaper sooner rather than later, deferring is much more expensive and stranded and wrong investments are risked in that path.  What is the Minister's response to the criticism that 2% per annum is not ambitious enough given that it leaves us with between a 7% and 9% decrease in subsequent decades?  That annual reduction would be an incredible challenge.  Are we committing to 2050?  How can one justify 2% now and putting off the larger gains until later?</p></speech>

That work will be done over the remainder of the year but we are joining the coalition to see this ambition set.</p> <p>  We must consider the technology that we can be reasonably sure about, and we do not have that level of foresight to envisage these changes.  The measures that will help in that later journey are not all economic at this point, whether it be carbon capture, carbon reduction, fossil fuel alternatives to  back-up our electricity grid and so on.  We have started with the 2030 target, which is a legal obligation, but we are way off course.  The latest figures from the EU suggest that we are running at close to 20% off course and, therefore, we will not deliver anything close to the target.  We have sought to get ourselves on course for 2030 but consistent with net zero emissions in 2050.  Where there is a stand-out indication that we should adopt a technology early based on reasonable knowledge of its direction, we are including it in the early phase but where that is yet to be there, we are not bringing forward those.  While it is cheaper the sooner one acts, that is not true for every action.   There are plenty of very expensive actions but if one sought to do them now before the technology had evolved, they would prove very expensive.  One must judiciously choose the pathway based on the information available.  We got help to identity the direction of travel of the technologies and that is why there is a greater emphasis in the plan on electric vehicles.  There is strong confidence that the technology will quite quickly reach a tipping point for the adoption of electric vehicles.  There is an imperfect knowledge of the future that one must weigh against acting in an early basis.</p></speech>

One of the key recommendations made by the committee was to use a land use plan akin to what was done in the UK.  Lord Deben was very clear about the benefits to be gained from a land use plan and I specifically sought this measure.  There are many references in the agriculture section to some of these issues that we are talking about yet it is not specific and clear.  Action 110 on page 54 states: "We will develop a roadmap by the end of the year to ensure the future development of agriculture and land use, including the forestry sector, will be built on environment sustainability and contribute fairly to Ireland's climate, air and energy targets."  That roadmap could, and should, be a land use plan in the sense of not telling what every acre is going to be.  The Government says it wants to increase afforestation from 5,500 ha to 8,000 ha but it says nothing about how many of those hectares will be new continuous cover forestry or a continuation of single species, clear felling and fast rotation.  It is vital to have that detail because a biodiversity emergency and not just a climate emergency has been declared.  I recall when our adviser, Professor Peter Thorne, an eminent scientist said that we have to seek win-win solutions.  Land use is the biggest area for win-win solutions though the rewetting of bogs, the diversification of farming, and changing of the current farming model of just beef and dairy production at all environmental costs and these opportunities could be stitched in this.  That has to be mapped and based on a land use plan.  Action 110 states that other key stakeholders will be involved.  They should include the environmental community such as the National Wildlife Trust and others that have an interest because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to tackle the biodiversity crisis as well as the climate crisis.  That can only work when one has a proper land use plan that operates from the top down.  Is my interpretation of the roadmap correct?  Will a land use plan be devised?</p></speech>

Part of it came from the climate advisory committee and Mr. John FitzGerald is undertaking work in this area.  The Department is also committing to engage with all stakeholders, not just the farming stakeholders, to evolve what it describes as a roadmap.  The Common Agricultural Policy must also be evolved.  As I have seen from the comments of the Commissioner, there is a very strong appetite within that.  Indeed, it is written into the new policy that 40% of the money must be assigned to work that improves the environment and improves carbon emissions.  That body of work will incorporate the ambitions that the Deputy mentioned.  I am not sure whether that meets what he described as a land use plan.  I cannot say that this exactly what he has in mind.  The ingredients are the same and there is a clear ambition that we need to see the evolution of our agriculture sector in a way that futureproofs family farm income.  If family farm income does not recognise that the world is changing, that the expectation of consumers are changing and that we, as a farming country that exports 90% of our output, must be conscious of what those who buy our product expect in respect of the certification of the environmental standards being applied.  I know a little about that from being on trade missions and being responsible for presenting the case of Irish produce.  I envisage that the roadmap is very close to what the Deputy has outlined and, therefore, I think it will meet that.</p></speech>

There is a complete lack of ambition for change or for efficiency and long-term decarbonisation.  The Government is sticking with our current transport plans and converting diesel cars into electric vehicles.  While I very much support electric vehicles, the change is not sufficient.  First, rather than just saying there will be 860,000 electric cars, the Government should make car sharing happen.  The State may achieve the same reduction in emissions and the same transport service by only buying half, a third or a quarter of those cars, which may be much more achievable.</p> <p>  Similarly, I refer to the lack of any other vision for a switch away from our current road-based transport system, which has led to further sprawl.  It is fundamentally unsustainable and impossible for us to meet our 2050 net zero target if the State continues with what the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is overseeing, which is a massive continuation of long distance commuting and sprawl, a major use of resources and ever increasing building out and out, and a road-based system that can never be climate ready even if the entire fleet comprised electric vehicles.  The Government must address the gridlock we are facing and the social and environmental costs of consumption of an individual car-based system.</p><p>I accept and welcome the Minister saying it is an iterative process.  However, the first thing that has to go in that context is the transport section.  This or another Government will have to come back with something completely different as this does not deliver.  I have set out some of the reasons why at the transport committee.  It completely fails to address the scale of the challenge.  What was the level of co-operation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  Why did it not come back with anything other than, in effect, a daft scrappage scheme for which there is no detail and a congestion charge hint that does not mean anything.  It is just about certain electric vehicles.  After two or three years in everyone's crosshairs, this is the one Department which is failing completely to address this issue.  Why has it come back with nothing else?  Why is it failing so clearly in its responsibilities?</p></speech>

That is part of the problem we face.  When we looked at and got the professional advice on the degree to which modal shift would contribute, the unfortunate answer was that the contribution of modal shift to the reduction of carbon emissions will be surprisingly low.  I was surprised myself.  We have to focus to a great extent on changing the type of travel that occurs while moving to electric vehicles which represent a very strong opportunity for us to meet our carbon emissions targets within an early period.  I do not accept Deputy Eamon Ryan's view that modal shift is not a major part of the change that is coming.  While it may not have a great impact on carbon emissions, it can have a huge impact on quality of life, in particular in our towns and cities.  There is a very welcome change in the new strategies that will emerge on park and ride, cycling and the new capacity of local authorities to introduce measures in their own areas to improve the modal split and the environmental soundness of what is happening in transport locally.  We look forward to those five-year strategies that will have to be published before the end of the year or early next year in respect of cycling, park and ride and so on.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will also make the point that if one compares new public transport at, from memory, &euro;8 billion with new road spending, which is much smaller at &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion in the plan, the comparison is not far off the 2:1 proposal.  However, 2:1 is not the way we should be planning infrastructural choices of this nature.  One of the important decisions in the plan is that anyone planning any public investment will have to price carbon on the basis of a trajectory reaching &euro;265 per tonne by 2050.  That will undoubtedly change the type of investments chosen within the national development plan.  However, there are needs with regard to roads.  Other Deputies will indicate that there are needs at critical points where new road investment is needed.</p> <p>  Transport will continue to have to make significant changes.  For the first time in this plan, we have a very ambitious target for transport to reduce its emissions.  Members will have seen over recent years that transport has consistently expanded its emissions.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is right about that happening nearly throughout the whole period.  Even before the recovery started, there were signs that transport emissions were increasing.  This is a massive change in the direction of travel to which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has committed with regard to the carbon emissions the sector generates.  There are major commitments to improving public transport while also changing fuel use and developing strategies to align travel to a greater extent with compact living, which we all desire to see.  In BusConnects, we see the ambition that exists not only to improve bus services but to add 200 km of safe, separated cycling.  There is a significant ambition regarding a shift from where we have been.  I commend the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for stepping up to the plate and for taking responsibility in this area.  As with every other sector, we expect the Department to deliver on what it seeks to achieve here.</p></speech>

As I usually do when we deal with this issue, I refer to the IPCC report.  It is worth couching everything we do at the committee in the words of the report which stated that we need far-reaching, unprecedented and radical change.  When the fanfare dies down, one has to look past the layers of green clothing that mask a business opportunity for industry, corporations and, in particular, private finance.  The Government's report referred to the phasing out of our reliance on fossil fuels.  Is the Government going to continue to block the Bill calling for an end to the issuing of exploration licences?  Can the Minister explain how, if we are to phase out our reliance on fossil fuels, we can continue to support the development of runways and airports?  Indeed, the report does not look at the aviation industry at all.  There is no measure within it regarding the aviation industry's contribution to emissions.  We are supporting new runways and the development of LNG terminals.  That contradicts fundamentally the aims set out in the report.</p> <p>  An issue that really jumped out at me is the absence of any attempt to put the burden of dealing with the crisis on global corporations in the fossil fuel and food industries which make billions in profit.  The burden is entirely placed on changing individual behaviour, including individuals who are as well off as the Minister or as poor as the Travellers I met this morning who are dealing with fuel and energy poverty at halting sites.  The Government has committed to attracting data centres to Ireland and it is estimated that 30% of our energy production will go to keeping those centres open.  The solution proposed is to urge and plan for corporate power purchasing agreements, which are described as long-term contracts under which a business agrees to purchase electricity directly from an energy generator.  Where did the idea come from to litter the country with data centres using up 30% of overall energy production and most of our water while being powered privately by energy companies dotted around the State?  It did not come from the Citizens' Assembly or the joint committee.  Did it come from someone the Minister knows such as a former head of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or a Secretary General in the Department of Finance?  It strikes me as a business plan writ large that would do more to damage our capacity to reduce emissions.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on the woeful attempt to deal with public transport.  In fact, there is no attempt to deal with it.  I heard the Chairman explain that on TV3 last night by saying it was all contained in the capital development plan.  However, that is not so.  That plan commits itself only to BusConnects which, for example, only puts a couple of hundred more buses on the roads in Dublin than were taken off the road during the austerity years.  There is nothing there to help us deal with what is required, namely a massive increase in frequent, free, or at least much cheaper, public transport in every town and village and not just in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  Unless we provide that, people will rely on their cars.  They have no choice.  During the election campaign, I listened to Saoirse McHugh, who became a very popular figure overnight because she was so radical and passionate about climate change.  She was a Green Party candidate in the west in the recent European elections.  She described her life on Achill Island noting that there was one bus out in the morning and one back in the evening.  Her house is 200 years old.  She asks how she can cut down on her carbon emissions if she does not have proper public transport and help to retrofit her house.  It will continue to require burning coal to heat her home and diesel to run her car.  That is where the bulk of Irish society is at.</p><p>Despite all the commitment to private financial loans being available left, right and centre to people, the vast majority of people in this country - in middle Ireland, as it is often described - cannot afford to take out loans of &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 to retrofit their homes.  Middle Ireland cannot afford to borrow to buy an electric car in the morning and start paying back the loans.  Most people struggle to pay their mortgage, rent and to get to work in overly expensive private transport because public transport is not available to them.  This is a disaster of a plan.  I will quote a part of the Minister's plan which sums up the attitude of his Department:</p><blockquote>	... those inflicting the damage do not pay the cost of the damage they inflict.  This is the rationale for charging a carbon price for carbon emissions which reflects the growing damage that they are inflicting.  This serves to discourage emissions and to make carbon abatement more profitable. </blockquote><p>I would agree with that statement if it applied to the fossil fuel corporations and global corporations that abuse this planet through the overproduction of plastics, goods, oil and gas and then force us all into situations in which we use these products.  However, it does not refer to them but to ordinary people in this country who the Minister says must change their behaviour, while giving them no help to do so except to tell them to go to the private financial market.  The IFSC will gloriously come up with innovative ways to deal with this.  Was it not great when it came up with innovative ways to help companies to evade tax and to create Ireland as a tax haven?  This is a very damaging document when one looks at the lack of an attempt to really deal with the problem.  Colleagues have spoken about electric vehicles but I do not understand how, in ten years, the Minister is going to get almost 1 million electric vehicles into this country.  The production and importation of those vehicles somewhere on that planet, though maybe not here, will create a massive amount of carbon.  We instead need a massive amount of public transport that is frequent and free.<br/><br/>With regard to retrofitting homes, three families came to me in my clinic on Monday.  I have written to the Minister about this and have his replies.  In one case, the family is earning &euro;5 per week more than what would qualify them to be determined as living in fuel poverty according to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  They are not entitled to a fuel allowance because of &euro;5 extra per week.  In the other cases, it was &euro;7 and &euro;7.50 extra each week, yet they are families who live to the pin of their collars to try to heat their homes.  They must turn on the gas, burn the coal or the peat briquettes because they have no other choice.  In most of those cases, they also have varying health issues such as arthritis or lung disease but they do not qualify for an allowance.  Nothing in the Minister's document deals with them or with the Traveller community which launched a report on fuel poverty among Travellers this morning.  I was the only Deputy who attended that.  They invited four different Ministers and they were all unable to attend.  It was a disgraceful abuse of a community that we celebrated in this House just a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>The best thing that we could do, instead of passing a motion that declares a climate emergency, is to pass a legislation, as the Government passed financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation during the financial crisis.  Let us pass climate emergency measures in the public interest that will allow us to borrow massively at a very cheap rate for the country to invest in publicly-owned renewable sources, not to put it out for tender to the private market to see what company might be able to build offshore or onshore energy generators.  Have we not learned about private tendering from the broadband and children's hospital examples?  If one wants something done in this State, the State must take it by the short and curlys and do it itself.  This document does nothing about that.  It throws the responsibility entirely back at the market which is responsible for putting the globe in the danger that it is in already.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to specifically address where the idea came from that date centres would somehow be a great solution to reducing emissions or helping our society or economy.  Where did the idea of corporate purchase power agreements for electricity come from?  In ten years, how will the Minister deal with the question of nearly 1 million electric vehicles being purchased in the country when the majority of people cannot afford to buy one?  Will he comment on the lack of any mention in this document of aviation emissions and the support he is giving to introducing new runways?</p></speech>

The Deputy said that there is no help to do anything except to go to financial institutions and then she made a pitch for an adjustment of the means test on a scheme that provides 100% assistance to people in fuel poverty to do exactly what the Deputy is asking for.  There is clearly State support to help people.  Some 32,000 homes undertake retrofitting every year and all of that receives support from the State.  People are changing to electric and hybrid vehicles.  That has increased sixfold so far this year and the State is supporting those people in that change.  There is a grant of &euro;5,000 from one's vehicle registration tax, VRT, a &euro;5,000 subsidy and a subsidised electric vehicle charger.  Many people are making that choice.  As technology becomes available and the price of changes reduces, more people will make that change.  The State will design a scheme to make it easier for people to take on the retrofitting challenge.</p> <p>  We are devising ways of doing this that will help people to make the change.  That is the right thing to do in this situation.  Many people recognise that and we have taken advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council which was established to help us to do this.  We are taking up much of its advice and the advice of this committee.  That is how electric vehicles will be taken up.  We purchase 280,000 vehicles each year so our aim is that 960,000 of those would be electric vehicles by 2030.  That is achievable.  I believe that technology will make that possible and people will not only have a better environment but also cheaper costs.  The cost of running a petrol car is eight times that of running an electric vehicle.  There are savings to be made.  People will make decisions that are in their long-term interest.</p> <p>  The evolution of data centres is not an invention of this document.  The reality is that data centres are being established here.  We need a strategy to manage the demand that is coming from data centres which is part of the evolution of the digital society.  We need to manage it in a way in which it does not put excessive strain on the targets that we are trying to achieve.  This is about better regional allocation of such investments but also seeing that those companies would seek to make their own arrangements for securing sustainable renewable energy to serve their needs, so that the needs of those multinational companies would not all fall back on the State.  As the Deputy rightly says, they should carry some of their responsibility.</p> <p>  The airline industry is part of the emissions trading system.  It is not a sector where we have a legal obligation to make changes in Ireland.  It is part of a global European emissions trading system.  We will support changes in that emissions trading system to demand more contributions from those airlines in making the change.</p><p>I hope I have responded to all of the points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#K00200"><p>Following on from the good work of this committee and the expert advice that we should take pride in being a leader in Europe in terms of climate action, unfortunately, our competition is very poor.  If we are the leader and we are facing fines then the rest of the world is in a sad, sorry state.  This action needs to be immediate and robust if we are to retain our ranking and maintain the world as a safe place.</p> <p>  A number of people have touched on transport and, in particular, the implications of transport emissions on public health.  Has there been analysis of the likely reduction in air quality in city suburban rings from the expanding park and ride facility, which is lauded as a way to ease congestion and to encourage people to use public transport, which often does not have the capacity to cater for them?  I refer the Minister to a study on congestion charges, nitrogen oxide levels and carbon dioxide increases in the suburbs where commuters were converging to park their cars in London and other cities throughout the UK and I ask him to comment on it.</p> <p>  Another transport-related issue is the Shannon Foynes waterway, which was committed to some years ago.  There is nothing in the report that might result in a waterway conclusion for sustainable transport policy.  Has there been a feasibility assessment of the use of the Shannon Foynes waterway for waterborne barge freight as per the terms of reference for a sustainable transport review?  Like many of my Dublin colleagues I have been involved in the BusConnects consultation.  This project is a &euro;2 billion investment that would take seven or eight years to complete, if it were to be agreed.  It is nowhere near agreement at the moment and the plan is to continue to purchase a diesel-only bus fleet.  We have to change the record and draw a line under that.  Time and again, I have raised this issue with the NTA but it is sticking to a diesel fleet, which means that even if BusConnects goes ahead tomorrow, in 2028 this city would still be serviced by diesel bus transport.  We need to change this as it is reflective of the seriousness with which we view transport pollution and the quality of our air.  </p> <p>  On a fair transition, which the Minister talked about earlier, the International Labour Organisation, ILO, has laid out a framework of the steps needed in regard to that transition, which has been included in Sinn F&eacute;in's minority report.  It provides a template of what is needed for a fair transition that is understood by workers and communities, not just in the Portlaoise area but throughout the country.  For example, in regard to the electric vehicles, EVs, which we are all being encouraged to purchase, affordability aside, we need to know who will maintain and repair these vehicles when they break down.  I presume it will be a person qualified in electronics rather than a car mechanic.  Is this skills provided for in the apprenticeship programme?  Are we specifically training people to perform that task?  Under this plan, boilers will become defunct in a couple of years' time.  Are we likewise training people in the skills necessary to maintain and repair heat pumps?  To achieve the just and fair transition that we need, we will have to encourage the 300,000 young people who left this island, taking their skills with them, to return and upskill others in this area.  </p> <p>  The cost of retrofit was touched on as well.  The cost of retrofitting a large home is estimated to be &euro;60,000.  One would not see a return on that amount for 33 years, which does not incentivise lending in this area.  I am not sure what we can do about that.  Roof and attic insulation is cheap and effective.  Every building could be brought up to that standard without too much financial outlay.  We must be careful not to scare off householders that would not have &euro;40,000 or &euro;60,000.  Following completion of that work, we could move to the next level of insulation to reduce emissions as well.  </p> <p>  I would welcome a response from the Minister on those issues.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that park and ride and, as mentioned by Deputy Eamon Ryan, car-sharing, can contribute.  This is a low-cost way of delivering change.  All of these alternatives need to be developed.  This plan is open to sensible suggestions as to how those can emerge.</p> <p>  I confess I do not know if the Shannon Foynes waterway is part of a plan.  We did not get down to that level of individual project.  On the bus fleet, from 1 July there will be no diesel-only buses purchased.  I know there are complaints about BusConnects but the central strategy of providing for a more integrated system, albeit requiring people to make changes at certain points on their journey, is attempting to integrate-----</p></speech>

From 1 July, however, no new diesel-only buses will be ordered.  Any of the buses that are being bought at the moment are replacing buses that have a far worse carbon and air quality impact.  As we move towards electric vehicles, one of the advantages, apart from the carbon, will be the reduction of the air pollution that goes with fossil fuel burning vehicles.</p> <p>  On the transition to new sectors, the Senator is right that we do need to develop the apprenticeships and traineeships.  To be fair, we have been through a much larger transition in terms of the sectoral make-up with the collapse of the construction sector from 12% of employment to 1% or 2%.  It blew away a lot of apprenticeships and traditional opportunities.  We have managed to see these people retrained and absorbed into other sectors.  We now have a much more robust mix of sectors.  We have to do the same now in terms of moving from some of the more traditional fossil-dependent sectors to new sectors.  We have the capacity, with a just transition strategy, to make those changes and to support people to make the changes.  We will be well able to meet the needs of people in terms of retrofit of their homes.  These are skills that can be learned.  They are largely blue-collar skills and there will be a tendency for some of the new technologies to displace blue-collar workers.  There is an opportunity for identifying opportunities in microgeneration and retrofitting, as well as in the bioeconomy and so on, that have a skill mix that can be very positive for those who need to redeploy into new areas.  This is central to the plan.  The education and training boards, ETBs, the institutes of technology and the bodies that are transitioning to technological universities will have to step up to the plate in this area.  As an aside, we need those agencies to take on more mature people rather than gearing up their systems for only younger people coming out the schools.</p> <p>  The Senator is right that some retrofitting can be very expensive and some can be very cheap.  The Senator is right also in advising that we start with the shallow retrofit.  In adopting an area-based approach, we can do that on a scale and make it easier for people to take on.</p><p>If all they want to do is the shallower retrofit, that can be possible, but, of course, we will need to see people moving to carrying out deeper retrofits over time.  The figures are on the SEAI website if the Senator is interested in seeing them.  It is less than &euro;2,000 for a cavity wall for a very strong improvement in the fabric.  The figure for an external wall is &euro;14,000.  It is much more expensive to achieve the same thing.  Clearly, there is a rationale for us to start with cavity walls and move to deeper interventions as a system evolves.  The Senator is right to suggest we do the sensible things first that will yield a result.  We should not seek to scare people off by bigging up the most expensive possible retrofit to a very large house in a very isolated area with very bad heating systems and so on.  For a lot of people, the changes will be more modest and affordable with a quicker payback.  However, over time we will need to accommodate the deeper changes such as moving to heat pumps, heat controls and deeper retrofits.  Once we start this journey with a credible model which we need to design, we can ramp it up.</p></speech>

We looked for the sectoral targets and commitments and the governance structure, all of which are welcome.  Straight lines of accountability and measurements give us something on which to work.  We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% at an absolute minimum by 2050.  The clock is ticking.  With the plan, we should have a minimum of 20% done within the next 18 months, but, obviously, we are not going to do that.  By 2030 we are looking at a 20% reduction.  That will leave us with a 60% reduction to be achieved within the following 20 years.  There was such a thing as the swinging 60s.  People refer back to decades in which there were major changes or upheavals.  I think the 1970s were supposed to be socialist, although, unfortunately, they were not.  We will have a big transition to make in the 2020s.  Even allowing for a brown to green revolution in the 2020s, there will be a massive catch-up required in the following 20 years, about which we have huge concerns.  I welcome the sectoral targets and governance commitments because for the first time they give us a straight line in terms of accountability and oversight.  During the debate on the low carbon climate action Bill five years ago, I pointed out consistently, over and over again, that it was a fatal weakness of that legislation.</p> <p>  On a just transition, I see Portlaoise mentioned in the plan, which is good.  It should be a test case or trial for what can be rolled out in other towns.  It should go past the two prisons and the two hospitals.  There are communities that need to be brought in also.  </p> <p>  On the midlands and support for the regional transition team, we have to get away from putting task forces in place when an event is happening or has happened.  We have argued from the beginning that we need a just transition commission.  A range of things are going to happen.  Motor mechanics who have upskilled and completed their apprenticeships will find that their skills will be out of date.  Apprentices this year will be okay as most of them will have the required skills.  There is Moneypoint, as well as several other places where a transition will be made.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.  </p> <p>  On retrofits and a just transition which are mentioned in two separate parts of the document, in the midlands and other parts of the country a lot of workers will be affected.  On the other hand, we have this great need to do a lot of expensive work in retrofitting.  There is the question of financing it.  A lot of households do not have the earning capacity, while others that do have it find it is soaked up by childcare and commuting costs and in paying existing mortgages from now until kingdom come.  They will not be able to access the &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 in finance required to undertake the retrofitting.  We need to deal with that issue.  These are big challenges for us.</p> <p>  Another challenge is finding the skills and labour required.  There are still about 160,000 people unemployed.  I do not want this to be taken up the wrong way, but I deal with a lot of foreign workers who are doing fine in working here.  They have brought skills and energy, which is all good.  However, we do not have houses to house people.  We were caught in a perfect financial storm ten years ago and are now caught in a perfect storm in providing housing.  We do not have the skilled workers required to build or retrofit them.  If we bring in more workers, we will not have places in which to house them.  We are caught in a bind.  There are probably a number of parts to the solution.  I suggest the Oireachtas needs to make a decision on the 160,000 people who are unemployed.  We need to decide to train and upskill a section of that workforce.  As the Minister said, we have SOLAS.  We also have the education and training boards, ETBs, which have been modernised and are working better than the old vocational education committees.  We have major training centres, including in the midlands.  We need to move ahead to start upskilling those workers to fill the vacancies and carry out the work of retrofitting that will be need to be carried out across the State.  We have big semi-State companies, some of which are diversifying.  Bord na M&oacute;na is going to move towards producing green energy, but that will not replace jobs.  The morning I started working in Bord na M&oacute;na there were 95 others starting with me.  That will not happen in the industries it is moving into.  I am not arguing against the changes, which have to be made.  However, it has a great history of offering apprenticeships.  Some of my family were trained as apprentices in it.  It is an area we need to consider as it is a company with a history and the infrastructure to do it.</p> <p>  Biogas is dealt with on page 41 of the document which we received today.  The actions include "carry out a public consultation"; "develop and update a feasibility study"; "set a target"; "assess potential impacts"; "consider" and "examine the potential" of something else.  It is a little fluffy and does not do the business.  I published a microgeneration Bill over a year and a half ago and it is now before the committee.  I ask the Government not to hold it up by stating a money message is needed or any other last minute booby trap.  We are wide open to amending it.  My party brought it forward deliberately to kick start the debate and also to try to get legislation in place.  As I said, we are wide open to working with those on the right and the left, in the centre, the Greens, or anyone else to get it moving.</p><p> I attended the Committee on Budgetary Oversight meeting yesterday because it was dealing with these issues.  I raised issues with the panel in attendance, including Professor John FitzGerald.  I am sorry but I forgot to make a point about retrofitting.  There is a demand for housing but according to the ESRI, with the current workforce, every nine houses we retrofit results in one less house being built.</p></speech>

The ESRI believes that up to 20% of electricity can be produced from biogas because of our large agricultural sector.  I have a constructive suggestion to make to the Minister.  That issue needs to loom larger in terms of our plans to meet targets relating to dispatchable electricity generation because the wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine at times when there is a greater need for electricity such as very cold nights.  We need to develop renewable gas and put that issue centre stage.</p></speech>

The Deputy is asking the same question Deputy Eamon Ryan asked earlier, that is, whether we are we leaving too much for the 2030 to 2050 period.  I will give the Deputy the same answer.  We do not have the same certainty around the costs and the choices in technologies needed to make to make those decisions now.  We could make bad calls by picking wrong technologies and sinking many resources into technologies that do not evolve.  We have taken the best advice on the evolving technologies and have picked the ones that show we can deliver by 2030 with the least burdens being imposed on people.</p> <p>  The next phase will need more work.  I have told Professor FitzGerald, and I am sure he has said this to the Deputy, that we need more research to be done on that next phase.  We will start to do that work ourselves but much work is probably needed to identify the sort of technologies that should be adopted over that 20-year period from 2030 to achieve the net zero.</p> <p>  On the issue of just transition, I was gratified that when the difficulties arose for Bord na M&oacute;na, under the regional enterprise strategy I was party to putting in place, which was to have regional enterprise strategies in every sector, the midlands regional strategy immediately moved to adopt decarbonisation as a central plank of its strategy.  It is using the regional enterprise fund and the network it has developed to deliver that.  I found it heartening to know that something decided upon in tougher times when we were simply talking about trying to get jobs off the ground is in place to deal with adaptation which is occurring.</p> <p>  I also make the general point that in the space of ten years, we have come from an economy that lost 120,000 jobs in construction and created well-nigh 500,000 jobs in other sectors.  That was a phenomenal transition.  I have read the stories of people who lost their job, took on Springboard, took on a traineeship, reinvented themselves and are back in that economy.  We need to make that easier for people to do.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s belief that the education and training boards, ETBs, are very well placed to do that.  We will be relying on them to respond to the change so that as retrofitting starts to take off, they are responding with the skill base.</p> <p>  I would argue with my former employer, the ESRI, saying that every nine houses we retrofit results in one less house being built.  Many colleagues I talk to say that there is not much house construction going on in many counties and constituencies.  There is capacity for people to do retrofitting in some areas not experiencing that sort of acute demand for housing and house building, and it does not have the displacement effect the Deputy spoke about.  However, I acknowledge that there is a capacity and we need to plan for it.  We are committed to doing that.</p> <p>  The Deputy should not say that everybody will have to face a bill of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  If someone has a cavity wall, they can do that for &euro;2,000.  If one does not have one's attic insulated, one can do that for &euro;1,000.  One can put in heating controls.  Many things can be done that are not those huge asks, so to speak.  I agree we have to start to do deeper retrofits but we want to get one third of the houses retrofitted by 2030.  We want to get on a roadway where people are doing more of that.  For many homes that will be possible, and we will support them to do shallower things on a journey over time to deliver that.  We should not put people off by saying they might suddenly have to face a huge bill.  We can evolve that and develop the system.</p> <p>  On biogas, it goes back to the point made at the outset.  The reason we are reticent and saying we need to assess this is because, on the cost basis, it does not look as if it is in the area of the curve where we need to move immediately.  It is further up that curve and until we test and assess its capacity, we need to do more work to see the role biogas will play.  Many people say that burning biogas in a power station is not a good policy.  We are supporting it in combined heat and power situations where one is getting a much better bang for one's biogas buck.</p></speech>

He is correct that there is not much house building in some counties but in many cases the workers in those counties work in construction in the cities.  In the midlands, for example, there is a fairly high unemployment rate but there is not a ready availability of construction workers.  I am pointing out to the Minister that builders cannot get construction workers.  We need to upskill those workers.</p></speech>

They are already doing it.  I ask employers who are having difficulty to come forward and take up the apprenticeships.  When I was in that Department we were evolving new and old apprenticeships but not enough employers were coming forward to support them.  Employers need to recognise that they have a responsibility to share in taking on apprentices and creating those possibilities for young people.  There is an appetite and a desire to deliver apprenticeships.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#M02000"><p>I wish to acknowledge that this plan is the most substantial and comprehensive environmental and climate action document produced by any Government in this country.  There is a great deal of joined-up thinking in it because of the comprehensive consideration given by this committee in producing its report, the Citizens' Assembly and the work done by the Minister and all the Departments with which he worked.  Notwithstanding that, it will be a massive challenge to achieve what the Minister is trying to achieve, which is to take carbon out of our economy and our lifestyles and, as a consequence, provide cleaner air, cleaner water and all the other good things that can flow from this.  We only have to look to Canada and Prime Minister Trudeau's green agenda, the <i>gilets jaunes</i>movement in France and the row-back on carbon tax.  This can be even more divisive than climate change, not to take from the changes in climate that result in catastrophes around the world.</p><p>The very people who say we should do something about climate change will not help one bit.  They do not have any solutions.  They are full of criticism.  While we can understand that the ordinary person can be fearful of so many changes and their cost, no solutions are being provided by the detractors.  That is the truth.  That is where dialogue is needed.  We have to remember that dialogue is about just transition.  How do we make it fair?  How do we balance it?  If we agree that something needs to be done - and it seems there is a general consensus to that effect - it is no longer enough to point the finger at agriculture, some other sector or somebody else.  This is tough and difficult.</p><p> This comes back to the issue of dialogue with the public.  A report prepared by NESC a couple of years ago examined delivery of renewable electricity.  One of the most significant issues was not cost but community acceptance.  It all goes back to that.  This is about how people feel about this in their individual communities and how it impacts on their lifestyles.  The Department of Finance is working on carbon tax and how it might look to facilitate that dialogue.  We are trying to find innovative ways to engage with the public.  At the moment, however, pursuant to our national planning framework, the regional assemblies are charged with the delivery of regional economic and spatial strategies.  We are talking about fundamentally overhauling lifestyles based on fossil fuels and the technologies emanating therefrom, including the internal combustion engine.  We have not invested in renewable energy.  This means that renewable electricity is now more expensive to deliver than electricity from conventional sources.  Can a specific climate change element be added to the ongoing process of developing regional spatial plans under the national planning framework?  That way people can be encouraged to engage.  This could be brought down to the level of local authority areas' development plans and co-ordinated with the regional climate change offices the Minister has established in the regions.  That joined-up thinking could help us determine where to put charging points, what we need to do and where to put infrastructure.  We must think about the bigger picture.  </p><p> Second, now that the all-of-Government climate action plan has been produced, will the Minister amend the draft national climate and energy plan he submitted to the European Commission in December, which is now in draft format?  I understand the Commission is to revert to the Department with its views.  In what way might that be changed?  There is a lot more consideration of and focus on climate change than ever before.  I would like to see how one document fits into the other. </p><p> Returning to the issue of communities, there is a lot of talk about microgeneration.  It is important that people feel they have a stake.  We will have to acknowledge the reality that most communities do not have the money to develop renewable energy projects.  We have to find other ways for people to enjoy the benefits.  I know the Minister's Department has a code of practice for wind farm development.  These projects are being developed at the moment.  Unfortunately, the envisaged community benefit is a lump sum per MW to the benefit of the community.  It gives no recognition to the fact that some people live beside wind farm infrastructure.  There needs to be another layer which benefits individual households.  I live near the Oweninny power wind farm, a joint venture of Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB Networks.  The community accepts it.  However, it is a sparse rural area.  The households immediately beside the site will get no particular gain.  They are looking for reduced electricity prices.  ESB Networks runs a near-neighbour scheme but there is no Government guidance on it.  The local authority does not seem to be able to deal with it.  </p><p> We have to recognise that some people will be asked to bear more of the burden than others.  There must be more than a community gain whereby money is given to a community centre 15 km up the road, which most people are never going to use.  I will bring further details to the Minister.  I have put it to the Chair that the committee must examine this issue in more depth, but I want to flag it with the Minister.  There is a deficit in the code of practice for wind farm development.</p><p> I commend the objective of decarbonising transport.  There have been a lot of contributions from the city folk among us.  I can see that if I lived in Dublin or Galway I would need public transport.  However, when the commentary turns to rural areas, it sounds like a parallel universe.  We need roads to put the buses on.  We will not get a bus every ten minutes as one can do in a city.  It is not enough to rubbish the idea of electric vehicles or say they are insufficient.  We need roads so that all the development and economic and social growth does not end up in the cities.  There are whole regions, the west and north west, which did not get roads during the Celtic tiger era.  They are acknowledged as being disadvantaged as a result.  This veers into unreality, like some of the talk about agriculture.  The idea of not spending money on roads is crazy.  We will not be putting a train into every village and up every b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n in rural Ireland.  It is one thing to tick a box.  There is no comparison with something running every ten minutes.</p><p> The best initiative for rural Ireland is the national broadband plan.  Broadband means people will not have to get into their cars.  The sooner that can be rolled out the better.  There is a lot of talk about the market, commercial investment and intervention.  They has all been tried.  We should support the national broadband plan.  It is not commercially attractive and that is why the Government has to spend money on it.  There has been so much warped commentary on the plan when it is exactly what is needed for connectivity in rural Ireland.  That is not just relevant to economic growth; it also pertains to medical interventions in the future, remote diagnosis, etc.</p><p> I refer also to the SEAI and its better energy warmer homes scheme funding.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, the most disadvantaged people in our society, who qualify for fuel allowance, get their homes retrofitted 100% free of charge, which  is welcome.  I want to ask the Minister about a current issue that I have flagged and that has not gone away-----</p></speech>

I know of private sector contractors doing this work.  Plenty of people are willing to do it.  I do not know what the deficit is.  Not only is future work being put on hold, contractors are not being paid for the work they have done.  They wait for months.  There is a problem in the SEAI, and I would like a clarification on when they will be paid.  People are looking for their houses to be retrofitted.  When will that be done?</p> <p>  Finally, I welcome the approach taken in agriculture whereby we will seek to implement the objectives in the Teagasc report, which provides a roadmap for this sector.  Agriculture is big in our county because we do not have heavy industry.  That is why it accounts for so much of our emissions.  Several members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I had occasion to meet delegations from China, Russia and other countries outside the European Union.  They do not have a bit of interest in carbon emissions reduction.  They wanted to compare notes on the experiences and challenges of farmers.  Their farmers do not have the equivalent of the CAP.  However I would like further strides to be made in recognising the efforts made to date by our farmers in the dairy and beef sectors and across the board in reducing carbon emissions per unit.</p><p>Our farmers should be championed for more carbon-efficient production.   Food is not an optional extra.  We need to eat and we want our food to be produced in the most carbon-efficient way.  Our farmers should be championed for their efforts in that regard.  There will be a big challenge in terms of our farmers being crucified over climate action while countries with which we compete and which are bigger markets into which we sell really do not care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019061900002#O00200"><p>I welcome the support, passion and insight of the Senator on this issue because it is not easy and she rightly homed in on community acceptance.  We are seeking to do several things to build that up.  One is that every public body, such as local authorities and the HSE, is being asked to adopt a climate change mandate.  I hope that public leaders in every community will adopt a strategy and attitude in their interactions with clients, suppliers and workers that this is a change we need to make.  The Senator's local authority is taking a leadership role in that regard and has an ambition to have a carbon-neutral strategy.</p> <p>  Her suggestion to use the regional spatial strategies to embrace the physical change is a good one.  If I announced 100 years ago that an underground tank containing highly inflammable fuel was to be installed in every village and that people would be expected to dip into it to fill up their cars, there would be a huge reaction against that proposal, but petrol stations are now part of the furniture.  There is a garage with a forecourt in every town and village and people do not bat an eyelid.  This will involve change.  We are not used to the technology or infrastructures we need to be sustainable.  Rather, we are used to the infrastructures that make us unsustainable.  As the Senator pointed out, there is a real issue in terms of how we socialise that structural change in our society.  We are trying to maximise community gain and participation, including local people being close to facilities that are being provided having sustainable energy communities and having mandates for every public body.  As a result of the green schools programme, many children go home and lecture their parents on the weaknesses of some of their behaviour.  We are starting to wheel that scrum, but there is far more to be done.</p> <p>  We will amend the national energy and climate plan, NECP, such as in respect of the new target we are adopting for renewables.  In the previous NECP we put our hands up and admitted that a target of 75 million tonnes was to be met, that 16 million tonnes of the target would be met from what we were doing and that another 58 million tonnes had to be found.  We will show how we hope to find those 58 million tonnes across various areas of activity.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the Senator that balanced regional development constitutes a real and sustained challenge.  On the national broadband plan, the reason we made that decision was not to bring ire on our heads about the cost of the project but, rather, because we believed that &euro;2.5 billion spread over the next 25 years is a correct investment to future-proof rural Ireland.  I will defend that decision to the last.  It is the right thing to do and we will be proven right in spite of the short-term push-back which exists.  It is right that everything be cross-examined and due diligence applied but we are making the right decisions.</p> <p>  Like every other scheme, a budget was allocated for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme and the SEAI must stay within budget.  There is no doubt that one of the features of 100% grants is that demand grows exponentially when such grants are available.  We need to move to area-based schemes which involve big blocks of work being done together, some of parts of which will be 100% grant funded while other parts will receive lower levels of contribution.  It will be a better model when we develop that alternative.</p></speech>

It is absolutely in the interests of Irish family farms for farmers to continue to drive on change to reduce the carbon impact of what they are doing and look at all of the options they can adopt to do that.  In the long term, that will secure family farm income in a better way.  If we make early changes in farming, we will be more fortified for the changes that are coming, as will be the case in other areas.  The Senator is correct that the Teagasc map gives a very practical menu of measures people can start to take.  We need more people to adopt those measures and verifiably show that they have been implemented.</p></speech>

Will the Minister commit to having the heads of the Bill published before the end of 2019 in order that we can start the review process on it?</p> <p>  The plan does not incorporate many of the recommendations of the joint committee, particularly on rural transport, in regard to which there is only a vague reference to a plan to be developed and no timeline or targeted emission reductions.  I ask the Minister to explain why the recommendations of the joint committee on rural transport strategy, developing the Local Link service and shared mobility were not adopted.</p> <p>  On agricultural measures, it is business as usual.  The plan states that the Teagasc plan report will be delivered.  Most of these measures are cost-neutral and represent savings to farmers, but have not been implemented to date.  Why is the Minister confident that these technological and efficiency measures will suddenly become so effective as to deliver emission reductions of up to 2 million tonnes by 2030?</p></speech>

There is a commitment in the area of rural transport.  Of course, this is only a starting point and we will evolve the strategy over time.  This is the start, not the end.  </p> <p>  On the Teagasc changes, it has been very made clear that under the next Common Agricultural Policy, 40% of the money will be linked to identifiable environmental and climate improvements that are adopted by the sector.  There will be an incentive connection between making changes and drawing down CAP supports.  That is one of the reasons we can expect change.  In addition, farmers understand as well as, if not better than, other sectors the need to change and that if we want to pass on our planet in a better condition to our children and the next generations, we must manage it well now.  Farmers are closer to understanding that.

That is the direction in which we are moving in every sector.  In order to future-proof the farming sector, just like every other sector, we need to see new standards becoming common practice.  Currently, we may only have pioneers, as the Deputy rightly said.  There are many pioneers doing great things.  We need to see those pioneers being mainstreamed with more people following in their tracks.  We need farm leaders to be to the forefront of advocating for that.  We need those buying products from farmers pushing for that need.  Their capacity to sell produce, particularly on international markets, is closely connected to their ability to show there is certifiable good environmental practice.  It is not only about money, rather there is a convergence of what the market and consumers need, the expectation of the community around them and what their pioneer leadership is seeking to do.  We will have to combine all those because the taxpayer cannot pay for everything that has to be done.  That is the same in every sector.</p></speech>

Yet there is no mention in the report of measures to protect biodiversity and wildlife and all the forestry recommendations are existing proposals; nothing new has been proposed.

What is the Minister's view on that?  The joint committee report recommendation was that we would have a specific strategy for those regions whereas the Minister is proposing to pass the topic over to the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which can only give advice, rather than establishing a multi-stakeholder body that would be empowered to make decisions and access State resources.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the Commission's response to his report?</p> <p>  This is my final question.  Our committee's report was strong in its call for nature-based solutions for climate action, which would help in our effort to address the climate and biodiversity emergency declared by the D&aacute;il on 9 May.  Specifically, our report recommended the development of a national hedgerow conversation strategy to ensure the conservation of these important features in the Irish landscape, which are extremely valuable to birds, pollinators and mammals.  There is no coherent approach to protecting hedgerows in Ireland.  There has been inappropriate management, including cutting during a period when it was illegal to do so.  The destructive removal of hedgerows is the number one complaint BirdWatch Ireland receives annually from members of the public.  There is no mention of the recommendation to develop a national hedgerow conservation strategy in the climate plan 2019.  Why not and can it be inserted at this stage?</p></speech>

Separate work is being done on biodiversity.  There are elements here where the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Minister, Deputy Madigan's Department, has made significant contributions directly connected to improving the carbon sequestration of wetlands or so on.  This document does not purport to be everything that needs to be done in the environment.  We do not deal with biodiversity.  Likewise, it does not purport to be everything that needs to be done in energy.  We have not dealt with energy security, for example.  What we are trying to do is to meet particular challenges.  It is not substituting for the line responsibility that continues for many elements of environmental improvement or risk abatement.</p> <p>  As I said, the NESC, with its experience and social partnership make-up, is very well placed, given the sort of work it has done in the past, to advise the implementation board but it will be the implementation board, on which the Taoiseach and my own Department will be represented, that will devise the annual strategies and actions that emerge from that thinking.  A just transition is at the heart of this and will be a responsibility of that core implementation board.</p> <p>  The response to the closure in the midlands has been strong.  Board na M&oacute;na has demonstrated that a State company has been pioneering in identifying new opportunities as it moves away from being virtually an entirely fossil fuel company to developing renewables, resources, material management and alternatives.  That is exemplary.  As I said, the midlands regional enterprise strategy, which I established a number of years ago, has been in place to take up the challenge of developing an effective strategy to move the midlands into developing opportunities in the decarbonisation sector.  That structure which we put in place is taking up that challenge.  It is the number one of its priorities.</p></speech>

I was chairing a meeting of another committee.  I thank the Minister for attending.  I hope we can have a further engagement with him on a line-by-line basis, if time allows, at some future date.  Our committee has 42 recommendations, whereas 183 actions are outlined in the Government's report.  I perceive a gap between the all-party committee's recommendations and the Government's position.  Notwithstanding the positive aspirations in its approach, I hope the entire Government can work with the joint committee to iron out some of the gaps.  One such gap relates, as Deputy Pringle indicated, to the relevant legislation.  There is a sense of urgency on the part of the joint committee in respect of the need to put in place, sooner rather than later, a legislative base for the legally-binding targets leading to 2030 and, thereafter, the net zero target for 2050, which is one of the recommendations.  I am a little concerned that the Government's approach means that a Bill might not be published until next March and that it would not be enacted until the end of 2020.  Another year could conceivably pass before we address the binding targets.  The Minister might comment on that point.</p> <p>  The second and probably more important aspect relates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 60 million tonnes to 33 million by 2030.  In the Government's plan, I do not see clear metrics on how we will do this and adhere to the 2030 targets.  Respectfully, having worked with the Minister in other Departments and knowing what he has delivered, I am worried that there might be slippage and that we might overshoot the 2030 targets in favour of an aspiration to net zero by 2050.  By 2030, however, we may still be far off target for our commitments under the Paris Agreement of 2015.  I wonder whether there should be a greater sense of urgency for clear, bespoke actions.  For community energy, rural transport, active travel and the rewetting of peatlands, for example, my fear is that within the Government, there will be a siloed approach, without a proper reporting mechanism or smacht for individual Departments to deliver on those actions.  If there is not a properly overarching Cabinet sub-committee or a robust climate action delivery board, I worry that Departments will slip in their obligations to deliver on climate action.  Respectfully, it is not enough for the Government to appear before the committee and say it is for, say, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to examine the rewetting of peatlands in view of the fact that we already have evidence, through our deliberations in the committee, that only 1% of peatlands in Ireland are under rehabilitation or restoration.  I would like to hear the whole-of-Government approach to that rather than having to wait from the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

What is the legislative basis to enforce the legally-binding targets?</p></speech>

I see the process as iterative.  If Oireachtas recommendations need to be developed, we will work with the committee to develop them where they can be shown to be cost-effective in a transition.  It is important we choose to make the changes in the correct order, as we have taken great care to do.  The only reason we were able to bring every Department with us to sign up to the targets we set is because we showed they were based on the least burdensome approach.  We have been able to tell people that if they wish to have their obligation waived, they should know they are opting for a more expensive change to be made in some other sector.  That approach has been important to bring everyone to the starting line.  Even if there is something else we could do, as the Deputy suggested, we must ensure that it is done in the right order.  There is no reluctance to bring forward legislation.  From hard experience, however, as the Deputy will know as well as I, having legislation processed through the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the committee and so on is slow.  It will be challenging to meet the objectives.</p> <p>  We do, in fact, have a binding target.  It runs until 2030 and penalties are attached.  In the plan, we have set sectoral targets and Ministers will be accountable for achieving them.  The legislation will slice the targets into five-year blocks and provide for more forensic analysis.  Sectoral targets are already included in the plan. </p> <p>  The Deputy is worried we are not making sufficient effort in the period to 2030 but I have adopted what one might call a precautionary principle.  I have not assumed a trajectory of high oil prices to pretend we do not need to make changes but rather that oil prices will stay low and, therefore, we have to plan for more structural change, not less.  Moreover, I have not banked on the &euro;18.8 million flexibility, where one can switch from earnings we would receive in the emissions trading system, ETS, sector to offset changes we ought to make in non-ETS sectors.  It is a real, demanding target that outlines the detail of what changes need to be made to underpin it.  There will be an obligation on Departments.  In the coming weeks, there will be a delivery board within the Department of the Taoiseach overseeing the delivery of the 183 actions.  We will not wait for a legislative underpinning to put in place that type of accountability.  There will also be the Estimate.  In any year where an obligation is put on the State, if we do not meet the target, it will not be shown in my Department, as is now the case, but in the relevant Department.  It will be more closely attached, therefore, to the sector that falls short.</p></speech>

They are frightened and afraid about what the future holds for them.  They would not mind if the plan was practical and introduced gradually but it sets targets and deadlines without providing proper funding to people to implement the changes the Minister says they will have to make.  People are telling me that the reason for this urgency and hullabaloo is that the Green Party won a few seats in the local and European elections and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are tripping over themselves to be greener than the Green Party.  The people are going to be sandwiched in between and will suffer.  A very honourable, fine gentleman in the village of Brosna told me at midnight the other night that people could listen, accept changes and try to do their best but he asked why the other larger economies and countries are not being asked to do the same.  Why do they not face the same deadlines and targets?  He told me that Ireland has 0.06% of the world's population while China and India have 40% between them.  There are no deadlines or targets on them.  Why are we being targeted?  Why is our little country being targeted?  They are the questions I am being asked.</p> <p>  This is going to hurt farmers and self-employed people in rural Ireland because they have to travel.  People are used to heating their houses with turf they have cut themselves and because they have to travel long distances to go to work or wherever else, they have to use cars.  They have no other transport.  People in rural Ireland will not be provided with public transport.  They will need their car.  They will also need their tractor.  On my farm I have a 1995 tractor, so it is coming up on 30 years old.  I am no different from anyone else.  That is what they have.  A tractor is a long-term investment for a farmer.  I have not seen any electric tractors so I do not know how practical they are.  Who is going to subsidise people to buy them?  Farmers are only barely surviving as it is.  They are not going to be allowed to cut turf or burn timber when there are trees falling down all around them.  This plan is not practical.  If it was practical people would listen to it.  Farmers have invested great sums in slatted tanks and environmental measures.  They are now being told that they will have to reduce production.  Looking back, they were told every day that they would have to increase production to stay viable.  Will I finish?</p></speech>

We will be delayed if I go on.  There are a few things there.  Why does the Government not remove the VAT from low-emission slurry spreading equipment?  The Minister says that forestry eats up carbon but at the same time there is a great deal of marginal land in south Kerry and other parts of the county but farmers will not be given grants to plant on it.  They will be given grants to plant on good ground - green ground, as it is called - but they will not be given grants to plant on marginal ground.  There is also a problem in that when storms knock down the forestry, as has happened, there is no grant to replant it.  If the Government was serious about planting trees, it could help people in that regard.  There are people who cannot cut down their forestry.  They get their last grant payment 15 years after planting but it is not viable to cut it until 30 years have passed.  It is there and is doing the country good but, as a farmer who came to me the other day said, the farmers are getting nothing for it.</p> <p>  There is also another type of farmer.  At one point in February there were 140 farmers who could not take out their timber and replant because they were prevented from getting planning permission for roads by serial objectors.  I have asked this question in the D&aacute;il; what is going to be done about these serial objectors?  These are real issues.  </p> <p>  There is also the issue of designations, such as that for the hen harrier.  A farmer cannot establish forestry on land that is designated for hen harriers.  At the same time, right on the other side of the ditch, forestry that was planted 20 or 25 years ago is growing fine.  The hen harrier has no problem going into the forested area.  There are ridiculous rules such as these.  Another thing is-----</p></speech>

We are all under the same sky.  We have to be realistic.  What the Minister has suggested today and over the past week will have a serious devastating effect of jobs.

There are no such obligations in this plan.  Those who are shocked or frightened should be reassured by that.  Equally, however, we have to recognise that we are starting on a journey of change on which Ireland and the people whom the Deputy represents are extremely exposed.  Many of our enterprises, farms, towns, villages and homes are at risk in a world that is changing rapidly.  One only has to listen to young people coming home and saying that our generation is failing to understand that this is real.  It is real in Kerry, just as it is real in any other area.  If farmers want a future and want strong family farming to survive, they also have to start thinking about the changes that need to be made to copper-fasten the future of family farm income.</p> <p>  The sort of changes they are being asked to make are absolutely sensible.  Many of them will pay for themselves over their lifetime.  A new Common Agricultural Policy is coming and 40% of the income support for farmers under it will be dependent on farmers demonstrating that they are making changes that will improve the environment and reduce carbon impact.  There will be recognition of farmers who are making the pioneering change but by making that pioneering change, they will also be better placing their farms to thrive in the future.  I have been on trade missions and the people who buy our products are asking about their environmental certification.  We are being asked to show evidence that the methods we use are sustainable.   That is what is being asked.  If we want premium margins for our agricultural produce because of its quality and Origin Green certification, we have to make these changes.  These measures are in the interests of our communities, whether rural or urban.</p><p>In many ways they are more in the interests of rural communities, because of the exported nature of much of the produce of rural Ireland.  The figure is 90%.  They are dependent on these international markets.</p><p> Reference was made to the question of China and India.  China and India are part of the United Nations agreement.  They are making the changes but they are starting from a position of a far lower impact on global carbon emissions and greenhouse gases than we are.  They are far below us.  For us to say we are not willing to make the change because people in poor countries that are at a far earlier stage of development and that have not been part of the fossil boom should make more changes than us does not stand up to scrutiny.  If we went to Europe or the UN and tried to advocate that those of us in Ireland, which is one of the wealthy countries, are going to sit on our hands waiting for China and India to make the changes, others would rightly say that it was a contemptible position to take up.</p><p> We have to be part of a change that has to happen globally.  There is no easy way around this.  If we want to pass on our environment in a better state to our children and the coming generations, then we have to start making these changes now.  The window of opportunity to do that is narrow.  A tipping point is coming when the environmental damage done by carbon emissions is going to accelerate, not decelerate, and these changes are upon us.</p><p> It is entirely wrong for Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's friend to suggest this part of an election result.  This committee and the Citizens' Assembly have been working for months in detailed hearings.  This was nothing to do with an election result.  Having said that, the election result perhaps does reflect the importance this issue has for our world and our country.  It is timely that we, as a political grouping of all parties, are showing that we are facing up to this.  We unanimously adopted the plan produced by the committee, including the Deputy.  There was not a single dissenting voice in declaring a climate emergency or in adopting the plan that is highly influential in what we are doing.</p><p> I believe these are the right things to do.  We will try to ease the passage for people, whether farmers or householders.  There will be supports from the State but we cannot pay for everything.  We are going to have to try to design policies that help people to make these changes.  At some point we will have to say it is time to stop doing X, for example, stop putting oil boilers into new houses.  That is the sort of change I have in mind.  It is sensible.  Why commit or lock down houses into a fossil system that will become more and more expensive for households to run?  We are asking people to do sensible things that are part of a pathway to help our communities to be resilient in future in a rapidly changing environment.</p></speech>

People who are burning coal, turf or oil are creating environmental damage for which everyone in the globe must pay.  By saying a price will be put on the damage that is done, we are following a long-established principle.  People would understand this if the carbon being emitted was visible as a huge plume of smoke and we could see it.  Let us suppose I said to the Deputy that he was going to have to stop producing it or that if he was going to continue producing it, then he would have to pay for it.  Since carbon is not visible in that way, we do not see the damage.  It is more difficult for people to say that they are doing damage because they do not see it and it is not visible, but it is happening.</p></speech>

I am learning something here.  I want to focus on agriculture mainly and on the custodians of the land and the opportunity that may be there for them in future.</p> <p>  Forestry has been mentioned as one of the major methods of sequestering carbon.  There is a vast amount of forestry in Leitrim.  We have more than our fair share at this stage.  Almost 30% of the land is covered at this stage.  The forestry is mainly Sitka spruce and there is monoculture and so on.  I do not intend to get into that discussion with the Minister.  I want to talk about some of the issues that could make a major difference but are not currently.  For example, every farmer in rural Ireland gets Pillar 1 payments through the Common Agricultural Policy.  They are required to submit a map that shows the land parcel.  Each land parcel is divided by hedgerow.  Farmers submit the land parcel map.  They have so many hectares for payments.  Then, a photograph is taken from outer space.  If the hedgerow happens to be growing out wider and the farmer loses half a metre along the length of the hedgerow, he is penalised and could lose up to 20% of his payment.  That is probably 20% of the farmer's income.  Indeed, in some cases the payment from Europe is more than 100% of the farmer's farm income.  A simple change would be to say that a clump of whins on the side of the field can be included as part of the land parcel rather than immediately punishing farmers for it.  Everywhere I go around the country I see hedgerows cut to the stump.  Farmers do not want to do that but they are being penalised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for not allowing them to grow.</p> <p>  Another issue I want to raise relates to new sectors.  It has been mentioned that we need to develop new sectors in agriculture.  The plastics sector is one possibility.  Plant cellulose could be used to make plastics that are biodegradable.  This will not happen by farmers doing it on their own.  To develop a sector large enough to be sustainable in future, farmers need to work in partnership with big business or Government.  Will the Minister leave it to the market to find that solution?  Is the Government prepared to play a role to ensure that these sectors can develop?  Hemp is one obvious material.  The hemp sector could provide income for farmers and provide a solution for our biodegradable plastics problem.  It could also provide a solution for carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  Another issue is the question of solar panels on the roofs of farm sheds.  While I acknowledge it is in the proposals, is the Minister talking about paying for that electricity?  At what level will it be paid for?  I will leave it at that because I understand we only have a short time.</p></speech>

I appreciate you letting me in, Chairman.  I realise I am not on the committee.  My colleagues had to go away.</p> <p>  Does the Minister believe it is realistic to say that we can be carbon neutral by 2050?  I accept that we, as a nation, have to do something.  Does the Minister accept that there is a need for major investment in the rural transport system?  For example, the Local Link system could be expanded rapidly.  Unfortunately, many people in rural areas have to rely on cars.  I am glad that the Minister clarified that people will not be forced out of their cars and will not be forced to do certain things.</p> <p>  It has been reported that the National Transport Authority purchased 200 diesel buses last year.  Is that going ahead?  Will they be used despite the fact that we are trying to change the attitude to climate?  We will have these dirty diesel buses around.  Can the Minister clarify that?</p> <p>  Can the Minister comment on job opportunities in the midlands and the demise of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na?  Different methods of farming will change things.  There will be a serious challenge for jobs and job creation.  Will we focus on that at some stage?  I had another question but I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I can see the point Deputy Martin Kenny is making about perverse hedge cutting.  I will have to pass that on to people who are better equipped to address it.</p> <p>  There will certainly be new sectors.  Enterprise Ireland is tried and tested in helping start-up companies.  It supports high-potential start-up companies and commercialisation of technology emerging from our colleges.  We have one of the best support structures for emerging technology of any country bar none.</p><p>Added to it, we have the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the climate action fund.

Enterprise Ireland companies have grown to scale.  They start as high potential start-ups.  Enterprise Ireland puts in its own capital and attracts venture capital.  There is a very good model for developing technologies, for which I have been responsible, and I do not see anything better in any of the countries to which I go.  Where a state decides to do it, it creates rigidity that is hard to replicate.  Bord na M&oacute;na is an exception because of its long history, but it is looking for technologies to adopt.  It is a State company that is diversifying and looking for new technologies.  We should not say the State is going to go into a new wheeze we have identified.  Let it emerge in the usual way.  The price of electricity offered to microgenerators or community renewable electricity support schemes in an auction will have to be decided over time.  It is not set at this time but will have to evolve.</p> <p>  It will be a challenge to be carbon neutral by 2050, but if we start to make the changes required and evolve the technologies, it is possible.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is not the most radical in this area states the price of a tonne of carbon in 2050 will be $265.  If we factor in this figure to some of what we are doing today, we can see what a radical change it will represent.  Things will change rapidly and we have to be ahead of it.</p> <p>  I accept that rural transport is an issue.  It is recognised in the report, but, as Senator Mulherin said, we will not have trains running up every boreen.  We have to come up with innovative solutions, whether they be shared services, pooling or other innovative ways, to do it.  We need to explore them collectively.</p> <p>  The 200 diesel buses were purchased, but I assure the committee that they are low emissions diesel buses and replacing vehicles that are far worse.  They were bought as part of a previous procurement framework.  A new procurement framework will be put in place on 1 July and there will be no more diesel buses purchased.  That will be the policy from here on.</p> <p>  Job opportunities in the regions will continue to present a huge challenge.  That is why I am a big advocate of the national broadband plan.  I do not want to ask members whether they are, but we need to do things like this.  We need to have regional enterprise strategies and hubs that will look at emerging technologies, as Deputy Martin Kenny said, that we will need to try to develop using our own resources.  I accept that we can do better in this area, but we have some of the infrastructure required on which to build.</p></speech>

I thank them all for making themselves available to meet the committee today. As part of our pre-budget consultation process, we are holding two sessions today to meet selected national stakeholders.  We will hold further sessions in September.  We will ask each of the witnesses to make an opening statement and then members will ask questions.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Healy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As not everything can go into the opening statement, we would be happy to deal with any issues people want to pursue in the questions that follow.<br/><br/>On the surface Ireland is performing very well on a range of issues: our economy is growing and unemployment is low.  On closer analysis, there are some very serious issues.  We have a housing crisis; we have persistent poverty and social exclusion problems; we have a long waiting list for healthcare; we have major issues relating to climate change and so much else that would actually bring into question how well Ireland is performing overall.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise that budgets are about choices.  In making these choices Government is shaping the society of the future.  It is putting in place the various components of what it considers to be a good society, the infrastructure and services that shape the future.<br/><br/>Budget 2020 should be designed so that it is both economically sound and socially fair.  These twin objectives are both realistic and achievable.  However, they need to be underpinned by a clear policy commitment and by budget decisions aimed at achieving both.<br/><br/>I will address the overall fiscal position.  The fiscal space is a critical issue.  Government has the freedom in budget 2020, and in any future budget, to generate additional taxation revenue, from raising taxes in one area, and then spending or investing this money elsewhere.  For us there is an issue about the transparency of the budget where the fiscal space is concerned.  <br/><br/>We note with concern that the table setting out the available fiscal space for the next budget which was previously included in the stability programme update has been omitted from the Draft Stability Programme Update 2019 published in April.  To facilitate informed comment and engagement with the budget process the details usually contained in this table should be made available in the public arena.<br/><br/>On public expenditure and Exchequer receipts policy, Social Justice Ireland believes that in the coming years policy should focus on increasing Ireland's total tax take.  A move in this direction is unavoidable if we are to deal with the existing gaps in infrastructure and social provision, and if we are going to deal effectively with the other issues that emerge and the bills that have to be met in the period immediately ahead.<br/><br/>Using GDP, GNI and GNI* is problematic in setting targets.  We propose setting a new total tax take target on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  The target is that Ireland&rsquo;s overall level of taxation - not just income tax - should reach a level equivalent to &euro;15,000 <i>per capita</i>in 2017 terms.  This target should increase each year in line with growth in GNI*.  We calculate that the difference between the level of taxation by continuing as things are and what we propose would be &euro;3.5 billion in 2019.  <br/><br/>Increasing the overall tax take to this level would require a number of changes to the tax base and the current structure of the Irish taxation system.  Increasing the overall taxation revenue to meet this new target would represent a small overall increase in taxation levels and would be unlikely to have any significant negative impact on the economy.  It would still keep Ireland as a relatively low tax-take country.<br/><br/>Demography will have a significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary position.  Ireland&rsquo;s growing and ageing population will require increased spending at certain stages in all levels of public expenditure, from early childhood education and care, through education, healthcare and pensions, and obviously care and social care for older people.  These issues should be part of the framing of Ireland&rsquo;s overall fiscal position.<br/><br/>In the broader context we believe that windfall gains in taxation should be used to provide investment for non-recurring infrastructure projects such as the provision of social housing, primary healthcare centres, rural broadband etc.  Once the houses are built, they do not need to be built again next year; it is one-off expenditure.</p><p>Delivering a just taxation system requires three actions: an increase in the overall tax take, adoption of policies to broaden the tax base, and the tax system to be developed fairly.  To achieve a budget that is economically sound and socially fair, other issues have to be dealt with besides taxation.  Issues relating to social, economic and environmental development, in particular, have to be addressed simultaneously.  We believe the budget should seek to develop five overall goals, including a vibrant economy, decent services and infrastructure, just taxation, good governance and sustainability.  We spell out each of those goals in a series of proposals, which we can break down and so on.  These proposals are set out on page 3 of our policy briefing, Budget Choices, which we circulated to the committee in advance of the meeting.</p><p> I draw the committee's attention to the fully costed set of proposals in the briefing.  We have also identified how those proposals can be paid for and the impact they have on the overall budget.  We set out all of our taxation proposals and what the income would be from those proposals on page 16.  We spell out all of our expenditure proposals and what they would cost on page 17.  We then balance the books on page 18.  We are being totally transparent in that every proposal we make is costed and we show how it can be financed.  We recommend this document as a set of proposals for a fully integrated approach, socially, economically and environmentally, where the decisions are taken simultaneously and, therefore, one is not dealt with without the other.  We can be as specific as the committee would like on any of these proposals.</p></speech>

However, this is likely to change before the end of 2019 in the absence of a negative external shock such as a disorderly Brexit, which could quickly catapult us in the opposite direction.  The various Brexit permutations mean that short-run forecasting is particularly uncertain.  Nevertheless, the medium and long run sustainability question should continue to guide the fiscal stance taken by the Government.<br/><br/>The overall fiscal position is reasonably solid, at least ostensibly, with a neutral headline general government balance, GGB, of 0.0% of GDP in 2018.  In addition, our view is that the structural or cyclically adjusted balance was marginally in surplus in 2018.  Effectively, the public finances are now in balance, notwithstanding our high debt level.<br/><br/>Baseline average output growth of 4.5% is feasible over the 2020s.  This sets a baseline for sustainable average annual nominal increases in public spending net of discretionary revenue measures.  When we take into account demographic and inflationary pressures, the real per person increase will be close to just half this amount.  Regardless of what form it takes, Brexit will marginally reduce potential output growth over the 2020s and this will, therefore, impinge on the annual fiscal space available to Government.  However, the effect of Brexit on the amount of fiscal space available each year can be overstated.  I am happy to talk about that further later.<br/><br/>The other major source of uncertainty relating to the budgetary position is the sustainability of corporation tax receipts.  The surge in receipts in recent years caught policymakers and analysts by surprise.  Changes to the treatment of corporation tax at EU and international levels, which are likely over the next two years, may undermine the flow of revenue from this source, at least domestically.  it is, therefore, contentious whether some of those corporation tax receipts should be considered part of our structural tax base at the moment.  This suggests a more cautious fiscal stance until we have greater certainty regarding future revenue yields.<br/><br/>NERI has produced a number of papers in recent years showing that Ireland's <i>per capita</i>public spending and <i>per capita</i>Government revenue are both below average compared to peer high income EU countries, which refers to all of the other countries in the EU with a GDP <i>per capita</i>of 30,000 or greater.  I refer the committee to the accompanying submission and I am happy to discuss this in greater depth. <br/><br/>Given increasing demand pressures, Ireland's position in the economic cycle and the negative implications for inclusive growth and public services, a package of discretionary revenue measures that reduces net Government revenue would be an unwise course of action for budget 2020.  Ireland faces a number of emerging challenges as we approach a new decade.  These include Brexit, climate chaos, precarious work and inequality, housing and homelessness emergencies, a two-tier health system, the fiscal implications of a growing and ageing population, and the fragility of an industrial strategy based on tax-sensitive US multinationals.  In particular, the risk of a no-deal Brexit has increased since the start of this year.  Now is the time to invest in our people, public services and infrastructure.  A substantial increase in productive investment, which will happen over the next few years, is the only way we can ensure our future prosperity in a sustainable and inclusive way.  Brexit does not change this fundamental reality.  Fundamentally, Brexit should not change budgetary policy in Ireland over the medium term.  Good policies will remain good policies.<br/><br/>ICTU advocates for a radical progressive vision for Ireland's economy and society.  Its submission for budget 2020, which is currently being finalised and will be submitted over the summer, will outline a series of proposals that will start us on the journey to realising that vision.  Congress has consistently argued for an inclusive equality-proofed budget that places the welfare and betterment of the majority at its very core and prioritises higher living standards, particularly for workers and their families, to be delivered through a transformative programme of investment in infrastructure, services and service delivery.  In particular, the budget submission will articulate the need to invest more in a wide range of different areas, including social and affordable housing, healthcare, childcare and education, clean and renewable energy and public transport.  Achieving these goals means abandoning attempts to cut taxes on a net basis.  Such policies will help overheat the economy and will harm workers in the long run.  Congress proposes new taxes on capital, particularly on wealth and property stocks, to raise money for productive social and economic investment.<br/><br/>In principle, Congress supports an increase in the carbon tax but that is contingent on an accompanying and linked climate justice fund that would channel the revenue raised in the form of a dividend for every person living in Ireland.  Our plan would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while the average household in the bottom half of the income distribution would see their purchasing power increase<i></i>after the introduction of the linked carbon tax and annual dividend, that is, they would receive more in the form of a dividend than they would expect to pay in carbon tax.  Households who change behaviour and opt for less carbon intensive modes of consumption will see their gains increase.<br/><br/>We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

First, what areas have the potential to cause that overheating and, second, how do we combat them?  All the reports to date that I have seen suggest that the potential for overheating comes from the construction sector, but on the non-domestic side - hotels, office blocks and so on - rather than the housing side.  How do we combat that?</p><p>There is a difficulty since we are not meeting the substantial demand for housing with enough supply.  What is the likelihood, if we start to ramp up our housing programmes, that it could lead to overheating in the economy?  How do we address the skills shortage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#F00200"><p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for his questions.  Why would the economy overheat?  The cyclical position of the economy is not something that one can observe directly so we look at a range of indicators.  A series of models underlies that and ultimately the various forecasting houses and institutions come to a judgment about the cyclical position.  It is a notoriously difficult area.  I am being humble in a sense by saying that it is difficult to know at what point an economy overheats.  For example, the Irish economy is now moving to an unemployment rate of between 4% and 5%.  That would normally suggest an economy that is close to capacity.  However, other economies, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and the Czech Republic, have been managing with unemployment of below 4% for some years now.  With regard to our employment rate and labour force participation, we still do much worse than a number of other countries.  Our inflation rates and wage rates suggest that we are not quite there yet.  Having said that, the economy has been in a cyclical upswing for close to seven years.  We are starting to arrive at a point where there are skill shortages in the economy.  We are seeing wages increase and it is likely that we will start to see an acceleration of that process over the next 12 months, with a big asterisk of Brexit.</p> <p>  What is likely to cause overheating?  One of the distinctive features of the construction sector is that it tends to respond with a lag effect to other demand factors in the economy.  We are starting to see a ramping up of housebuilding in the economy and, as the Deputy pointed out, there are skill shortages.  That ramping up of housing based on private funding and public funding will, in our view, start to push the economy into a position where it starts to overheat.  That would be consistent with us moving towards a trade deficit, higher normal wage growth, higher inflation and so on.  To prevent overheating from occurring, one normally responds through fiscal and monetary policy.  One could do it through fiscal policy by increasing taxes, for example, or perhaps by cutting public infrastructure spending.  Unfortunately, our infrastructure spending has been so low for so long now that cutting it is clearly not an option for us.  We have infrastructure deficits in many areas compared with peer countries.  That implies caution in other areas of fiscal policy.  That points to current spending but also to taxation.  We would be very cautious and worried if a stance was taken which involved significant tax cuts, particularly on a net basis, including VAT and income tax.</p> <p>  With regard to non-domestic overheating, it is true that much construction activity in recent years has been on the non-domestic side.  We expect that to change somewhat in coming years in response to demand.  The rise in house prices has made it more viable to make profits in the private sector with increased intervention on the public side.  Having said that, it is an issue and the answer to the question about overheating is completely contingent on what happens with Brexit.  A disorderly Brexit will be a major shock to the economy.  With regard to fiscal policy, there is a structural surplus of perhaps 0.1% of potential output.  The implication is therefore that the fiscal space should be used each year, which keeps the country where it is with regard to the structural budget.  That is non-contractionary and non-expansionary.  The budget should not feed into these overheating effects but should also be cautious about cutting against the grain, particularly since the budget will happen a few weeks before any potential Brexit outcome.  I would be cautious about budget 2020 being too contractionary in advance of a potentially significant shock which could propel the European economy into a recession.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Nugent want to address skill shortages?</p></speech>

We hear much about our expenditure and how Government is trying to control spending while all of the Opposition parties are seeking more spending.  We hear very little on the other side about tax.  We hear about widening and broadening our tax base but very little about corporation tax, tax breaks for banks, tax incentives, tax avoidance and trying to address such areas.  Do the witnesses have a comment on that?  Dr. Healy might be able to comment on that at a time when we have so much need and increasing levels of abject poverty and a housing crisis.  How feasible is it to continue to give tax breaks to banks which are making millions?</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Eamon Murphy, will set it out.  We provided a document which has many pages setting out all the details but Mr. Murphy will provide a summary.</p></speech>

As Dr. Healy said, this document, Budget Choices 2020, is on the website and I believe a copy was sent to all committee members.  Pages 4 to 7 deal with our proposals on taxation.  Pages 5 and 6 deal with many of the issues that the Deputy mentioned.  He hit the nail on the head by mentioning the need to broaden the tax base and to do so in a sustainable way.  Corporation tax has a substantial role to play.  Most of the revenue raising proposals that we have made in that area are about reform rather than increases.  It is well documented that several large multinational companies based in Ireland are paying effective rates of corporation tax well below the headline that we have set out of 12.5%, which is such an article of faith in Irish politics.  One of the proposals that we made in our budget submission was to set a minimum effective corporation tax rate of 6% to ensure that those corporations are making a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the feasibility of allowing banks to continue with what is effectively a corporation tax holiday.  We believe that there should be a limit to the ability of corporations to carry their losses forward, limited to ten years, and that the cap on that should be returned to 50%.  We are being fair about that.  We acknowledge that there is a need to remove the bank levy if that is to be the case.  That would see upwards of &euro;100 million being raised in 2020 alone.  The extent to which banks have been allowed to roll those losses forward effectively penalises the Irish taxpayer twice for the actions taken by the banks during the 2000s.  These institutions would not exist in the current format if it was not for the taxpayer and they should now start to make a proper contribution to society.  Overall, we think that Ireland needs to take a leadership role with regard to the international moves that have happened over the last few years, including setting minimum effective levels of corporation tax and creating a consolidated corporation tax base.  We need to get ahead of what is really an inevitability.  There is a time-limited aspect to the current system of Irish corporation tax.  We need to get ahead of that and take a lead on setting a Europe-wide minimum to create a fairer system.</p></speech>

An argument that is given to those of us who call for the corporation tax holidays to be lifted is that there could be unintended consequences.</p><p>Are there any of which the witnesses are aware were we to deal with the issue of the banks and the tax breaks they get?  </p></speech>

The IFAC has been trying to estimate the potential losses in revenue to Ireland and is coming up with figures of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion.  That figure is too high; I do not think it will be that high.  If the CCCTB comes into force, it will impact the public finances to the tune of close to &euro;2 billion and it would be wise for the committee and Government to bake that into their figures.</p> <p>  Regarding the impact of getting rid of those particular breaks on the banks, in principle, the NERI and ICTU have consistently taken a position that, broadly, one should move to a system where tax expenditures full stop are squeezed out of the system.  They tend to be economically inefficient, regressive and non-transparent, and are a form of public spending that is never acknowledged.  Having said that, if we get rid of existing tax breaks, it is important to give a window or time or notice because often, the business will have assumed that those tax breaks are in place.  I am not saying it is an existential risk but the risk is that a bank could suddenly be plunged into another crisis.  I am not saying that would happen.  What I am saying is that when a tax break is in place, particularly when it relates to the business sector - and that is pretty standard - it is a good idea to introduce the legislation to take effect a few years down the line rather than immediately because of the short-term implications.  I could not give the committee an answer on the immediate impact of making those changes on the banks.</p></speech>

The Commission on Taxation devoted its longest chapter to tax expenditures.  It is very insightful.  We need to keep pace through two measures that should be introduced.  As part of the budget process, there should be an annual update of what tax expenditures are costing us.  We have all this expenditure in the budget on areas such as health and education.  We count all that and have all the lines and so on.  We should do the same with tax expenditures.</p> <p>  Second, there should be a sunset clause on every tax expenditure so that it must be reviewed.  It does not mean it must end but it must be reviewed before we renew it.  That would be a positive step in the right direction.</p></speech>

In respect of Social Justice Ireland's recommendations on childcare and the expense of it, it is effectively a second mortgage for many families.  One of the issues holding back a more equal and just society is the lack of access to affordable childcare.  I understand what Dr. Healy said about widening the tax base and increasing taxation but what are his views on childcare provision and what needs to happen next?</p> <p>  I would also welcome his views on legislation that has passed Second Stage in the House but has stalled.  It was a suggestion to share current entitlements.  This is a question for both witnesses.  Approximately 50% of the population is female.  There are more barriers to getting back into employment, sustaining higher-paid employment and working full time because of childcare and because the way the system is set up means that caring responsibilities tend to fall more to Mum than Dad.  One of the issues, particularly for women who are self-employed or in public life, is they do not get maternity leave but cannot transfer maternity leave to their partners so, effectively, the family loses leave that is available.  What are the witnesses' views on allowing a mother to transfer all or part of that leave within the family to cater for women who are self-employed, running their own businesses or in public life who do not have access to maternity leave?  We need to start thinking outside the box.  Paternity leave is fantastic and, obviously, the gold-plated standard, which we wish to attain, is a year at home with baby for Mum and Dad.  That is what we want to attain but the Government is looking to increase paternity leave by between two and seven weeks in three, four or five years - whenever it happens, we just do not know - but it is a long, slow and dragged out process.  Easing that burden now so that women would be better able to access the workplace would benefit everybody, not just women.  Could both witnesses respond to that question?</p></speech>

If one looks at it in terms of the life cycle, the period during which one faces this significant cost burden is quite short but it is an area that requires significant investment.  The challenge is because the sector is quite fragmented and we rely on private provision.  Private providers are struggling between paying their employees a decent wage and expanding their services and meeting the ratios.  One of our proposals is to consider how we might address the funding element so that we separate the wage element from professionalisation of the sector.  It involves looking at parts of the ECCE scheme, which is for children aged three years and over, and how we might apply that to children aged between zero to three, how the State might support the sector in terms of professionalisation, quality and affordability for families and how we might expand and improve the model.  We are seeking &euro;85 million in the current budget for this.  In addition, we need to look at how we might expand the sector to incorporate other elements, particularly childminders for those living outside urban settings, and how we deal with the informal care element.</p> <p>  With regard to sharing current entitlements, the legislation that is going through and the potential for a self-employed woman to transfer maternity leave, in principle, this would be a positive step if it led to the broader issue of care being more equal because, as the Deputy noted, the burden of care of children and older family members tends to fall on the woman in the household so that we would take a more holistic approach to care.  We would certainly like to see something along the lines of the Swedish model so that if this leave was transferred, it would have to be used because all the literature shows that what is in the best interests of the child is being in the care of its parents in the first year of its life and, in principle, to support women, particularly self-employed women, and their families to care for their child as they would like.</p></speech>

We have an issue that for women who are self-employed and running their own business or in public life, dad gets two weeks and immediately they are wondering who is going to mind the baby because the woman has to get back and open her shop or open her accountancy practice, or whatever it might be.  It seems an undue burden.  It seems silly because there is leave there but we have somehow decided that only one parent can take it and the other cannot.  Parents are immediately faced with paying for very expensive childcare, as Dr. Healy rightly pointed out, and many of those facilities will not take a child of that age.  Why do we keep this extra pressure?  We are all in agreement on wanting to increase leave overall and sharing the caring responsibilities.  To be fair to new fathers, we only give them two weeks and we do not allow them to take any more, so how can we have that culture change and that shift in mentality if we do not have anything for people to change to?</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Murphy's comment that, in principle, she welcomes the idea.  I want to be very clear that I am not suggesting we take leave away from mothers.  However, in situations where the leave is not available to a mother in any event, would it not be better for her, the father and their child to use existing entitlements at no extra cost to the Exchequer while, in the short, medium and long term, we work on increasing leave overall?</p></speech>

They have been at this for 20 years and their results have shown that the more evenly split leave is between fathers and mothers, the more beneficial it is for the children in the long term, as well as in terms of educational perspectives, and it also gets fathers into the habit of playing an active role in parenting, as Dr. McDonnell will tell us.</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will have that research out by the end of this year or early next year, looking at the specific reason for gender pay gaps.  It is a related point.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's point on sharing, I completely agree and I would echo what Social Justice Ireland has stated.  One of the things that is stark in the Irish data is that, while we all know about the costs, female labour force participation in Ireland trails very badly behind the rates in Nordic and other northern and western European economies.  What we effectively do is cut off women's careers while they are in their prime, which leads to gender pay gaps and leads to lower labour force participation and lower levels of confidence.  Having a fairer burden, if "burden" is the word, is obviously a progressive policy but, in the long run, it would also lead to higher employment rates across the economy.  Therefore, not making some of these investments in childcare should be considered as a false economy because it takes people out of the economy, which means lower tax receipts and lower spending in the economy.</p> <p>  There is, of course, the issue of the affordability and quality of childcare.  These are not directly related to the point the Deputy is making but it is a point NERI made a couple of years ago, as did Social Justice Ireland.  I referred earlier to an economy being able to grow 4% to 4.5% a year but, in fact, that can be changed either up or down through policies.  A policy that increases labour force participation and the employment rate pushes that up and allows us to have a permanently higher level of public spending.  Therefore, there are macroeconomic issues as well.</p></speech>

The obvious thing to do would be to remove the barrier.  As part of the research into the gender pay gap, NERI might take the following example.  If a 30-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man are attending for interview for a job, in the back of the mind of the employer is that she is likely to take six months off whereas he is not.  The minute that leave is shared-----</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make is that once we remove that as a consideration for the employer, we break that glass ceiling, we address the gender pay gap and we level the playing field.  I ask NERI to make part of its research the responsibility for childcare - "burden" is the wrong word - and the maternity leave requirement, which is a factor.</p></speech>

If the second best candidate gets the job as opposed to the best, that is bad for the economy and society as well.  Therefore, removing those biases from the jobseeking process and job-hiring process is also good for the economy in the long term.</p></speech>

We would also address this issue in the context of the new work-life balance directive that we have to transpose by 2022, which contains many good provisions in regard to care.  Many things are left open for Ireland to decide, such as whether we want to go down this route.  This is something we will have to look at in the coming years.</p> <p>  On childcare, I refer to the draft country-specific recommendations that came out on 5 June.  In the context of the second such recommendation, a point we wanted to flag up is that the Commission is recommending that Ireland increases access to affordable and quality childcare.  While we welcome this in principle, we would just say that last year's recommendation talked about increasing access to affordable quality childcare compared with affordable and quality childcare this year.  I make the point that affordable childcare may not be quality childcare.  It might be pedantic but these things matter.  We believe it would have been preferable if the Commission had stayed with last year's recommendation to implement affordable quality childcare.</p> <p>  We have to acknowledge that one of the big problems we face in the context of childcare relates to the low pay and conditions of workers in the sector.  They spend years acquiring the qualifications to work in the sector, they get there and they are still earning just above the minimum wage - I think the going rate is about &euro;10.50 per hour.  Nobody who has spent all of this time is going to stay on that rate.  It is an issue.  We will not get the kind of quality childcare service that children deserve unless we address the issue of pay and conditions.</p></speech>

Just before this meeting began, during Question Time in the House, the Taoiseach was extremely bullish about the desirability of tax cuts, particularly for middle and upper-income people and about moving the point at which people enter the higher rate of tax.  We had tax cuts last year.  I want to ask the representatives of both organisations whether they think we have room for tax cuts.  In the context of the recent advice from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, will our guests outline their thoughts on that at this point?  The Taoiseach really was quite emphatic about the desirability of tax cuts so I would like to get their views.</p> <p>  On a related point, I was glad to see the Social Justice Ireland reference to a minimum effective tax rate, something for which I have long advocated.</p><p>A Labour Private Members' Bill has been before the D&aacute;il for nearly two years that would establish what effectively would be a standing commission on taxation to examine in a coherent way on a year-by-year basis at the issues of tax expenditure.  This committee has done much work but this commission would look at the area in a broader way, considering who would gain or lose out from certain kinds of tax structures.</p><p> With regard to financial institutions in Ireland, there can be no argument against a minimum effective tax rate of half the corporation tax rate, for example.  That would be approximately 6% and one could move to that over a period of two years.  Without a doubt, our European Union partners are changing their approach and we are going to have to change.  They may pick a rate of 12.5% or 15% and we will have no autonomy in the matter unless we begin to make policy that indicates our own position.  There was also a reference to the trade-off on the bank levy.  When we were in government, the bank levy was our proposal to mitigate the impact of the zero-tax companies.  Where is that now in the context of the international organisations with which the witnesses have contact?  What kind of progress has been made on it?</p><p> We are all interested in pay rates and the Government is clearly softening up public opinion to lift the cap on top bankers' pay, which runs around &euro;500,000, with additional elements relating to pensions.  On a comparative basis, is now the appropriate time to lift that levy on bank pay?  There is a great deal of lobbying in financial services to have it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#J00200"><p>The standing commission on taxation is a very good idea.  Tax changes and the impact of tax expenditure etc. must be kept under constant review.  That should be done professionally, with people of real expertise doing it on an ongoing rather than one-off basis.  Mr. Murphy spoke about the minimum effective corporate tax rate earlier.  We see this as critical and we suggest a rate of 6%, given Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate.  As we move along, this seems to be on the agenda of the OECD now, and there has been quite an amount of publicity about that in recent times.  That is not bad.  We have heard much negative reaction from some sectors in Ireland but there needs to be a fundamental overhaul internationally, not just in Ireland, of the whole approach to corporate taxation.  Minimum effective corporate tax rates are part of that solution.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about top bankers' pay.  We would find it very hard to go along with the idea that a banker does not have enough income when he or she is receiving &euro;500,000 per year.  It is mostly a "he" I suppose, although not always.  The minimum wage is less than &euro;10 per hour and the rate of poverty is 15%, with 250,000 children living in such poverty.  Increasing banker pay at the top end would not be a priority for us.</p> <p>  Money will be available and there is the overall issue of whether this should be allocated for tax cuts rather than other matters.  Our preference is for that to be invested in infrastructure in areas like social housing, water, public transport and broadband.  Part of the available amount should also go towards improving our services in healthcare and education, as well as addressing matters like childcare, as raised by Deputy Lisa Chambers earlier.  That is in addition to other issues we have discussed.  Our preference is to move in that direction rather than giving tax cuts.</p> <p>  There are some points to be made about tax cuts if there is an insistence on going that way.  On page seven of our budget choices, we have produced the results of a study demonstrating seven different options for dealing with income tax and the universal social charge.  It is interesting as only two of the options would turn out to be fair, as the other five would benefit the better-off more than those with low to middle income.  There are two options that would spread the benefit fairly across all people.  The first increases the personal tax credit rather than the tax band, as widening the band is not an effective way of being fair.  The second option is a combination of reducing the 0.5% and 2% universal social charge rates.  The results are in the document and we can provide more detail if people are interested.  There is a broader question that Mr. Murphy might like to take up.</p></speech>

Our preference is for available resources to be used for investment and improving social infrastructure and public services, we understand there is occasionally political pressure to introduce income tax cuts.  Unfortunately, most of the proposals we have heard from the current Government have been targeted at people who are on above-average wages or significantly higher than that.  Part of the reason for moving from a system of tax allowances to tax credits almost 20 years ago was to create a system whereby the Government would have the mechanism to introduce fairer tax cuts across the board, meaning everybody receiving a cut would receive it at roughly the same amount.  That is why we believe any decrease to income tax should come through the tax credit system, rather than tinkering with bands and rates, which typically only benefit people on higher incomes.</p> <p>  This brings a need to introduce a system of refundable tax credits.  I do not have a screen behind me as I normally do when I talk about this but I could show the committee a table from our analysis of last year's budget demonstrating the effects of the welfare and tax changes on people of different incomes.  It shows a very interesting trough effect, with people earning between roughly &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000 received almost no benefit whatever in the last budget.  The reason is that without refundable income tax credits, the Government does not have a mechanism by which it can target that population.  Bringing in that system of refundable tax credits would mean that everybody would benefit from a change in tax credits, regardless of income.  That is in contrast to the current system, where people earning below &euro;16,000 or &euro;17,000 are benefitting very little or not at all.</p></speech>

All that does is stimulate the economy even more.  In any event other than an absolutely disastrous Brexit, one would not consider tax cuts of any kind under those circumstances.  The implicit tax rate, or the amount of tax revenue over the tax base, on labour is higher in the European Union average than it is in Ireland.</p><p>It is 36.1% there and 32.7% here.  We would have to increase labour taxes, which include PRSI, by about 10% just to get up to the EU average.  On the higher rate, what actually matters is the effective rate and the amount of tax someone actually pays.  A single earner or a couple with one income and two children on the average wage pay much lower amounts of tax in Ireland than they do in the northern and western European peer countries we talked about.  One of the reasons is that they have to pay for so many things in Ireland, such as childcare and healthcare in some cases, when it is private.  It is not good policy in the long run.  On the consequences of our lower levels of taxation, my colleague and I looked at per capita revenue in Ireland relative to the other rich countries of Europe and we were the second lowest in aggregate receipts.  The per capita gap was &euro;1,256 less revenue per person which implied a scale gap of &euro;6 billion over the economy.  The idea that we are overtaxed is just factually incorrect.  People think they are overtaxed because things are more expensive in Ireland.  We have a cost of living crisis, not an overtaxation problem.  As it turns out, most of the difference is on the employer PRSI side, which brings us to issues about social wage.  The consequence of all this is that in 2018, looking at those ten countries, our per capita spending excluding interest was &euro;15,791 per person, which was the second lowest of all those countries.  We would have to increase public spending by 10% just to get up to the average, so no, I do not think this is the right time to cut taxes.</p><p> On minimum effective tax rates, there is a social contract.  Everyone should pay a minimum effective rate.  The difficulty in getting minimum effective tax rates for corporations is that they are not consolidated in terms of tax law in the way an individual is.  Until we have a common consolidated corporate tax base across the EU, for example, it will be very difficult even to establish what that effective rate would be.  What is "the company" when there are all these subsidiaries?  It might pay a very low effective rate in Ireland or a higher one in a different country.  They are engaging in tax games to minimise the burden overall.  The point of a consolidated base is to deal with that.  Finally, I do not believe the optics on the political landscape would be at all positive from removing pay caps for bankers.</p></speech>

At the moment in Dublin and in Ireland generally, land speculation is back where it was about 20 years ago.  What is the advice of our visitors?  Ireland has always failed to dampen speculation on building land.  In terms of an affordable three-bedroom house anywhere in the Dublin region at the moment, the land cost per unit has probably now gone past &euro;60,000.  In more desirable areas, I reckon it is up around &euro;100,000 per plot.  That is why in many areas, including in my own constituency, we are seeing well finished A-rated houses but they are not terribly big.  The cheapest of them is about &euro;450,000 but a lot of them are &euro;550,000 to &euro;600,000.  I think a lot of Deputies will have the same experience.  The crisis for many people is that this is what is supposed to be affordable, never mind the issue in respect of social housing.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on how we could limit or prevent the spectre of this massive return to land speculation?</p> <p>  On the climate change documentation, the thing I was most disappointed about was that there has to be a fairly exact quid pro quo to anyone whom Mr. Murphy was mentioning earlier as being on a lower income threshold, in terms of fuel poverty, such that the carbon tax would be offset by a corresponding increase, certainly for people-----</p></speech>

If constructed properly, that would produce a cash benefit for the bottom 50% of the population from an income distribution point of view.  Our view is that a carbon tax increase should be conditional upon that happening.</p></speech>

Before the last era of land speculation, never mind the current one, we were advocating a variation on approaches that had been talked about back in the 1970s.  A mechanism for getting control of the costs involved would be that rezoning could be done only on land that was already owned by the local authority.  In other words, it would buy the land and there would be a top-up profit margin for the person who had sold it but then it would be in the ownership of the local authority, which could rezone it, and it would not create a windfall profit.  We have other ideas.  It is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#K00900"><p>On households and energy poverty, obviously if we increase the carbon tax we have to look at how to support those households.  Not only do they have to be supported financially but also, in the longer term, we have to consider how we will move them out of energy poverty.  We will need to retrofit their homes so they are able to choose more energy efficient options into the future.  The payment is critical but, beyond the payment, it is about what we do to get everyone to reduce emissions and how we target particular households and make sure they are retrofitted and energy efficient, so they can move out of energy poverty for the longer term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#K01000"><p>Dr. McDonnell said it should be a precondition that the lowest households do not suffer from the carbon tax and that they see some benefit.  Should retrofitting people's homes not also be a precondition?  Before there is any question of additional fuel costs, the mechanism should be made available and the resources provided to achieve it, to ensure they do not suffer as a consequence.  The fear people have - I certainly have it - is that the carbon tax will go up but the person in an old council house with poor insulation and damp, as the case in a lot of social housing, will be hit with this while it will be years before there is a retrofit programme.  At an absolute minimum, any hit that people might take in that regard cannot happen prior to the retrofitting of their home so that they have the opportunity to reduce their energy costs.</p> <p>  I wish to raise something that is never talked about and is never an objective of budgets, although I know the witnesses all think about it.</p><p>Interestingly, an exit poll in the recent elections said that something like 85% to 90% of people thought the gap between the haves and the have nots should be reduced.  That is an overwhelming majority.  It is never an objective in budgets to try to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor and to look at how that will be achieved, although it is beginning to be debated everywhere, even in the United States interestingly.  They are starting to debate this because the gap between rich and poor is growing everywhere and even when there is economic growth and slight improvements to people's incomes, the gap is growing and growing.  Should that be a budgetary objective?  If it is, what should be done to begin to redistribute wealth?  I see mention of wealth taxes.  I do not know who put those ideas forward and I welcome it but they are quite modest.  For example, 1% on assets over &euro;1 million is suggested.  Those assets are probably accumulating additional value at about 3% or 4% in reality.  Should we not be more radical and ambitious in trying to have wealth taxes that will redistribute wealth?</p><p> I have a specific question on childcare.  I was at a Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, briefing earlier on where it was pointed out that one of the impacts of the national childcare scheme is that, because it will do away with other targeted supports for vulnerable parents who get some support for childcare through childcare employment and training support, CETS, schemes, and community childcare subvention, CCS, schemes, those parents will lose dramatically because of the national childcare scheme as the targeted supports for them will go in favour of the universal scheme.  Are the witnesses aware of that and do they have any comments on it?</p><p> There is a general acceptance that our over-reliance on foreign direct investment, FDI, and a small number of multi-nationals and the corporation tax receipts coming from them is a vulnerability.  How can we diversify away from that?  Into what should we be diversifying?  To use one example, our committee has said we should look at a research and development tax credit.  Some &euro;700 million, which is rising, largely goes to a small number of multinationals.  If we are to diversify, do we not need to dramatically reduce that and redirect those research and development funds towards the sort of areas that would give us a more sustainable economy such as public education, public research and development and other strategic areas of the economy that would be more sustainable.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?</p></speech>

As we said earlier, if it is designed correctly, there should be a net gain for the bottom households if every man, woman and child in the country gets the same dividend.  An Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report said a couple of weeks ago that the average house in the bottom 10% is likely to be looking at a &euro;2 per week increase in their consumption bundle and it is about &euro;3 for the next decile.  That is not huge but people are still living on the margins and there is an issue there if that comes in the form of a cheque at Christmas, although that might also be something people will buy into.</p> <p>  The carbon tax will not work unless there are viable alternatives and any retrofit programme that is successful in any way will be a function of resources and political will.  We have had very little so far in terms of hitting targets that have been set up.  There are other ways we could reduce the impact on low to middle income families as part of a wider investment package.  Public transport would be one of the big areas.  We should seriously ramp up investment in public transport and have viable options for families who probably have to have a car but cannot afford it and other people in that space.  The carbon tax by itself will not bring about the change that we need to bring about to hit our targets and to avert climate catastrophe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#L00400"><p>There were four questions there and I refer to the last question on the broader point about changing industrial strategies and enterprise strategies and moving away from the current model if it is under threat, even if it is a desirable model.  One of the consistent points we have made in recent years is how low the level of <i>per capita </i>public spending on research and development is in Ireland compared to peer countries.  For example, in 2017, Sweden spent &euro;461 per person and we spent &euro;190.  Denmark spent &euro;544 and we are spending one third of that.  We need to develop a proper innovation system, including the universities and Government, along with enterprises.  High potential start-ups should be spinning out.  We are not investing in research and development and in the innovation economy.  We need to do that and that is fundamental to the type of strategy the Deputy is talking about, as well as areas such as education and building up human capital.  I completely agree on that.<br/><br/>I mention the equality budgeting as we sometimes call it, to reduce the gaps between the top and the bottom.  There is always a focus on income but the greater inequality is in wealth and matters such as property taxes and wealth taxes.  The most effective taxations we have for that are inheritance tax, gift tax and capital acquisitions tax, which are riddled with tax reliefs in Ireland.  There are 90% reliefs for all sorts of assets in business, agriculture and so on.  The ultimate yield ends up being between &euro;400 million and &euro;500 million.  A vast amount of wealth essentially goes to the next generation without any taxation.  If one is a nurse or a construction worker, one could be paying a marginal rate of almost 50% but if one is sitting home and inheriting money, one gets its for free.  That is clearly inequitable and the studies show internationally that most assets are inherited.  What is happening is that wealth is going through the generations and it is unearned.  That is the real definition of passive earnings.</p></speech>

In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, jobs strategy that came out last December, it spent two years looking at labour market performance in terms of employment rates, inequality and productivity, and what policies produce the best labour market outcomes.  One of the conclusions was around good collective bargaining.  It found that the countries that are best in employment rates, of which Dr. McDonnell mentioned some such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Austria, they have collective bargaining systems that work very well.  One of the principle recommendations is that all countries, including Ireland, should put in place legal frameworks that support social dialogue and collective bargaining.</p> <p>  I am looking at the European Commission's innovation scoreboard that came out last Friday and the countries at the top of it are Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands.  The big difference they have compared to Ireland is that they have proper systems of social dialogue and collective bargaining.  It is probably the best way to tackle the issue of income inequality.</p></speech>

The challenge is that the focus is on carbon tax whereas it should be on carbon policy.  Carbon tax is one element of that policy.  Homes cannot be retrofitted overnight so people will have to be supported through the tax credit and welfare system while the retrofitting is being ramped up and the houses that are in energy poverty need to be targeted first.</p> <p>  On childcare and the new national childcare scheme, care must be taken with the potential impacts on same, particularly as all the supports are being rolled into one to create a universal system.  We have to ensure those families that were reliant on additional targeted supports do not lose out.  Care will have to be taken with that when this is introduced in the coming months.</p></speech>

For years we have been doing analysis of budgets.  On page 4 of our budget choices document we have supplied to the committee today, we provide a worked out impact assessment of the last three budgets and the distribution of the gains.  It is quite clear that the people who have gained least are single unemployed people and those on lowest earnings.  There is obviously a serious problem.  There are two things that need to be constantly kept in focus, the first of which is that the payments of the people depending on welfare should be index linked so that they do not lose out.  We show how that can be done on page 4.  If we were to bring it to 27.5% of average incomes, which is where it should be benchmarked, we would need an increase in the coming budget of &euro;9 per week for a single person.  The second focus is the working poor, the more than 100,000 people who are in jobs but still live in poverty.  We must consider the most targeted way of getting to them and ensuring that gap is reduced to give income tax credits and to make the two main tax credits refundable.  Both of those things could be done and we have shown how in our document.  </p><p> There is one other point on foreign direct investment that Mr. Murphy will deal with. </p></speech>

It could be seen as people asking us for a total game-changer, not just in terms of retrofitting but with all the changes to transport, food, housing and so on.  The people I represent are very suspicious of the intent in this.  Some regard the Green Party as a party of the right and have always so regarded it.  They see this as a regressive policy.  They are suspicious because NERI's and ICTU's analyses of past taxation show that it has been very unfair.  There was a huge reliance on consumption tax.  It could be said that our reliance on excise taxes which affect the family car etc. discriminated grossly against working class and lower income households.  There is a huge suspicion that we are being led by my constituency colleague, Deputy Bruton, and others, into a new world, that we do not know where we are heading but it will be much more expensive for ordinary citizens.  We mentioned fair mitigation in the report.  Will it be serious or will it be the little people who carry the can?</p> <p>  That is the problem.  One proposal is the five-year carbon budgets.  Would there be merit, for example, in having a five-year general budget so that we know where we are going overall or that the next Government after the election will know where we are going five years down the road and we can see all the analysis?  That comes through very strongly.  We pick it up in the media and on the doorsteps and so forth.  </p> <p>  Dr. Healy first alerted the committee very strongly to the consistent underestimation of the health budget.  We know that unfortunately in the coming days we will face this again.  We are not prepared to put enough expenditure into that area.  Is Social Justice Ireland able to show the Minister for Finance exactly what it wants him to do, as we in parties and as individuals do, for example, last year I advocated equalising diesel and petrol, and picking up &euro;150 million here and there.  Is Dr. Healy saying of those "lucky enough" to be earning over &euro;100,000 a year that we should go for a 45% or 48% rate on those lucky 300,000 tax units?  We have been watching with interest Jacinda Ardern and the government in New Zealand talk about a budget and economic evaluation based on well-being.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Education and Skills he pushed the idea of well-being in our education system for teachers, pupils and parents.  Has any of the witnesses done any work on this and what extra resources or expenditure it would involve if we really wanted for nobody to be homeless?</p></speech>

There are many individual items in it but there are no timeframes or costings and we are in danger of the outcome that Deputy Broughan is pointing to, that vulnerable people will carry the can, will be hit hardest, and that we will not have a genuine, focused, integrated plan that affects everybody's capacity to contribute.  That is what we need.</p> <p>  It is critically important to recognise that the pieces of this plan-to-be have to travel simultaneously.  Ms Murphy made this point in the slightly different context that we must be prepared to ensure that vulnerable people, whether they are rural dwellers or people in fuel poverty or whatever, are protected from the consequences of what we talk about.  All of the various elements of the mitigation have to be in place if we are to move forward with the climate change plan.  Otherwise, there is a real danger of the vulnerable being the victims.  </p> <p>  For several years we have shown what the situation was in the health budget overspend.  It has always been a situation in which maintaining the level of existing service has not been fully provided for in the following year's budget and as a result it automatically goes over budget.  There is a danger of that happening in other areas as well.  It is critically important that we do not go that way and to prevent that happening we need to be transparent and the numbers need to be on the table.  That was the point I made earlier about some of the numbers that have been removed or omitted from the spring statement this year that have been in spring statements for several years previously.  We need a transparent process that recognises the numbers during the year but also that we have them all the time and can make those adjustments so that people who are trying to work out the future or what should be in the budget are not left in a situation of not being clear about the various components. </p></speech>

If New Zealand has a proposal for a well-being budget, that is great, but we recommend that each policy be tagged with the sustainable development goal to which it relates, as set out in our document.  We have been making the point for a couple of years that the Government should do so for every line of the budget and each item of legislation that is brought in.  We would also like it to be done at EU level.  The question for us is, if the legislation, policy or budget measure being brought in is not related to a particular sustainable development goal, to what does it relate?  All aspects of human well-being are covered by the 17 sustainable development goals we outline.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Broughan that environmental, inequality and economic impacts should be considered holistically as part of a budgetary process that does not climax with a big reveal in October but, rather, is constructed through a consultative process with stakeholders throughout the year and with time given for academics, researchers and the Parliamentary Budget Office to carry out the required inequality, carbon and economic analyses and feed that to the Department of Finance, other Departments and other stakeholders.</p></speech>

Such proposals are not always popular.  Its purpose was to give choice and ownership back to families and to reflect the fact that in modern society many people no longer work nine to five.  It is probable that most of those at this meeting do not work nine to five.  Conventional commercial childcare operations do not work for the majority of people.  Deputy O'Connell and I are still working on that proposal.  What are the views of the delegates in that regard?  For me, it is about giving ownership back to parents in terms of quality childcare which they deem suitable for their children in their home or another environment.</p> <p>  On affordable housing, there was a very good meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government yesterday, which was attended by representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and which dealt with affordable housing and its complexities, with which I am very familiar.  Some of our cost rental models are being subsidised by in the region of &euro;40,000 or &euro;80,000 depending on where in Dublin they are and the cost of land, topography and complexities that go with that.  The delegates referred several times to the situation in Scandinavian countries.  The Vienna model is seen as the panacea in terms of affordable housing.  Cost rental has been established there for a very long time, whereas we are only at its pilot stage. We are looking at ways of bringing down the cost of rent, particularly in the affordable sphere.  Obviously, the delegates were not in attendance at yesterday's meeting and may not have seen it.  One of our pilot schemes is likely to involve rents of approximately &euro;1,200 as a result of hitting granite during the construction of underground car parking, as well as other complexities on the site.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions around affordable housing, affordable purchase or cost rental of which we may not be aware or of which they may wish to remind us?  </p> <p>  On the help-to-buy scheme, almost 12,000 people have availed of it and far more subscribed.  The construction industry needs certainty and consistency.  Obviously, there is a skills shortage in this area and much investment must be made in apprenticeships and so on, especially when we are looking at new technologies in building.  The help-to-buy scheme is due to finish this year.  If it were to be extended - I do not know whether it will be - would it be preferable for that to be announced prior to the budget such that the construction industry can plan ahead in that sphere?</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Murphy's comments on people not having to travel to Dublin for work.  The statutory Project Ireland 2040 plan is all about investing in our cities, compact growth and encouraging the opportunity of growth around employment and education in areas such that people do not have to travel to Dublin.  I agree with him about rebalancing the country.</p> <p>  On costing a climate plan, there was a very good meeting of this committee yesterday at which it was highlighted that some costings were not in the plan because they will be borne by the individual who may be buying an electric car or retrofitting his or her home.  Do the delegates have ideas regarding the retrofitting of people's homes?  Could it be done in a manner similar to the help-to-buy scheme?  Could one avail of a tax rebate over several years?  Are there models such as that which could be replicated?</p> <p>  On costing a climate plan, there was a very good meeting of this committee yesterday at which it was highlighted that some costings were not in the plan because they will be born by the individual who may be buying an electric car or retrofitting his or her home.

Deputy Boyd Barrett and I were members of the council at the time.  Money recovered from the sale of council properties was invested in the renovation of other council properties.  Several deep retrofitting schemes involving wraparounds, etc., were carried out.  The council has been very proactive in that sphere for many years and will continue to be so.  Council houses with energy ratings of A1, A2 or A3 are now being delivered.  I recently visited a development of more than 50 units in Fitzgerald Park in Monkstown.  The standard of home being delivered there is exceptional.  However, exceptional is expensive.  How do we rebalance that?</p></speech>

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, produced a document with the help of NERI some months ago on the possibility of rolling out a trainee scheme and an information campaign through Bord na M&oacute;na for homeowners and residents of the midlands first and foremost.  The midlands could develop capacity in that depressed central region in the area of retrofits.  There is evidence of a significant number of inactive ex-tradespersons who were affected by the financial crisis.  It would not be too big a jump to reskill some Bord na M&oacute;na workers in addition to some of the glut of inactive former workers.  That could be of benefit to the roll-out of a State-led and funded scheme to retrofit the entire public housing and social stock, as well as schools and so on.  The properties could be fitted with solar panels and a scheme put in place to allow the energy generated to be sold back to the grid.  These are things that have been talked about for a long time but on which there has been little movement.</p> <p>  On the group of households a little further up the income ladder, in some countries low-interest loans are available from the state, although I do not have the detail with me.  Grants have been made available here but they are not being taken up at a rate which will lead to us reaching any of our targets.  The State could front-end the cost, which could then be recovered from electricity bills over the course of 20 years if we got sign-up in that regard from some of the semi-State bodies.</p></speech>

All of these policies will eventually have a downward effect on rents across the board, particularly when housebuilding is scaled up.  However, that will take time.  One would not expect a reduction in rent levels as a result of a single pilot scheme or that it would happen overnight.  Unfortunately, this can only be resolved by a satisfactory and sufficient level of housebuilding in the State, which will have to exceed long-term average demand for several years and reach a level of, at least, approximately 40,000 per year for a sustained period of time.  The expectation is that much future job growth will be in the greater Dublin area, which will lead to further population pressures and greater demand for housing there.</p><p>Again, the cycle of high rents will continue.  There is no silver bullet there, unfortunately.  If there is a special purpose vehicle with sufficient scale to borrow at very cheap rates, that can also have a marginal effect on rents down the line.</p><p> I would like to speak about the help to buy issue.  As I said earlier, tax expenditures are rarely the optimal option in public policy.  In my view, they merely act to stimulate demand.  At the very least, a high level of deadweight costs is associated with them.  My view is that the scheme should be ended.  I agree that the Department and the Minister should give an advanced signal if such a decision is to be made.  This goes back to the point that the budgetary process should begin on 1 January, if not the previous year.  Signals of decisions about much matters should be given in the first half of the year, rather than having a big reveal in October.</p></speech>

If we are to give choice back to families, the first thing we should focus on is expanding the availability and types of childcare that families can access.  Investment should be first.  Then we can look at how we support families.  It is important that we make the tax credit refundable to ensure the credit reaches every family.</p> <p>  I would also like to echo what Mr. Nugent has said about retrofitting.  We have made a proposal that seeks to target social housing, in particular.  It is based on a Dutch model that involves retrofitting at scale.</p></speech>

We have done a lot of work on cost rental.  We have been doing it for a number of years.  We made a presentation on how this might actually work to the Dublin Economics Workshop in Wexford two or three years ago, when this was not on anybody's agenda.  We have developed our proposals now.  I would have been more optimistic about the scale of the impact of our proposals if a special purpose vehicle had been established to keep the actual amounts off the budgetary accounts.  We have worked out how that could be done involving various agencies like the European Investment Bank, the Government and social housing organisations.  We have done a lot of work in this area.  We are quite happy to share it with the committee at any time.</p> <p>  In our view, the help to buy scheme should not be extended under any circumstance.  Basically, it is contributing to the escalation of cost increases.  We are very much of the view that rather than subsidising the person who is trying to buy the house, there needs to be a focus on the provision of housing and on elements that will bring down the cost of housing.  If the person is being subsidised to buy the house, it will always result in the price of the house going up by the same amount of money.  We are negative about anything that involves pushing up the price.  We are negative about the proposal anyway.  We would be quite happy to see it end at the end of this year.</p></speech>

I regard most of the witnesses as left of centre thinkers.  I would like to ask them about affordable housing.  Which option do they think is better?  I am not looking for a "Yes" or "No" answer.  I ask them to consider the options.  The Chairman and I were members of the same local authority for a number of years.  The housing assistance payment can be up to &euro;2,000 a month in the South Dublin County Council area.  That is &euro;24,000 a year or &euro;48,000 in two years.  Would it be better to invest that in a way that enables the State to take equity in an affordable home, rather than continuing to pour it into the big black hole of rental?  I say that as a genuine response to what Dr. Healy has said.</p> <p>  I always look out for the themes that emerge in advance of the budget.  I take Dr. McDonnell's point about budgetary transparency.  Over the past two years, it has been frustrating for the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, having heard the themes that have come up in advance from the various players, to see the Government finding &euro;500 million or &euro;1 billion under the mattress the night before the budget, thereby giving us no opportunity to scrutinise it.  Every Government does this.  We have tried to make the point to the Government that the budgetary process needs to be more transparent.</p> <p>  Two themes seem to be emerging from the witnesses.  I will take them on board and watch out for them.  At an informal briefing approximately a month ago, the IMF flagged the issue of demographics with us in the context of this country's ageing population.  It did not feature in any of the briefings we got last year.  Climate change, corporation tax, carbon taxes, and petrol and diesel equalisation were last year's issues.  A number of them were fudged.  The issue of VAT on tourism was dealt with.  Every piece of advice we get with regard to spare money or windfall money involves banking it.  That message was reinforced by officials from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council when they appeared before us last week.  They spoke about the establishment of a prudence fund that would be available in the event of a downturn.  That is completely contrary to what today's witnesses have been saying about non-recurring capital expenditure.  It has been argued that we should stow away some money, particularly from corporation tax, in a prudence account.  In one sense, it is like the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.  I am convinced by that argument because it has been made by so many informed players.  I am not pre-empting anything, but I would be really surprised if it is not part of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's report to the Minister.  The witnesses have been the first to say that windfalls should be spent on something else.</p> <p>  The other point that needs to be made about demographics relates to early childhood education.  I will be watching out for these two areas.  I do not understand why the State, since its foundation, has taken an arm's length approach to preschool education.  I do not know why it has not got involved.  I have said for a number of years, as a councillor and as a Deputy, that the school building programme provides great opportunities for preschool facilities to be co-located with primary school facilities.  That would be exceptionally time-saving for parents.  It would enable all after-school facilities to be provided on one site.  Dr. Healy spoke about quality.  There could be a mixture of degree-trained primary school teachers, who are qualified to work in preschools.  We are not doing this.  Alternatively, a commercial or private enterprise could be brought in to provide the education, with the State owning the buildings.  In my constituency, I find that the cost of leasing and making repayments on the infrastructure that has been bought by preschools is the biggest single contributing factor to the fees they charge.  I have made my points.  I will not come back in again.  I appreciate what the witnesses are saying.  They might respond to the questions I have asked.</p></speech>

We have argued this endlessly.  We consider HAP to be almost out of control at this stage.  We are spending extraordinary levels of money that are not producing the kinds of housing we need.  We are still stuck with the housing problem at the end of the day.</p><p>We would be much happier to start moving in the direction of having that invested in social and affordable housing.  We would argue that the cost rental proposal, which I just talked about, would help the situation along the way.</p><p> On the spare money issue and the question of whether to spend it or bank it, we make a provision in our budget costings for the rainy day fund.  We believe a certain amount should be set aside.  However, we also believe the country should not repeat the mistakes we made before.  Ten years ago, when we had an extraordinary crash we took a very tough austerity route to deal with it, as did much of the rest of the world.  There is agreement among most international economists of note today that it was the wrong way to go.  The critical issue that we should recognise is that we have serious deficits and they need to be addressed.  We get opportunities to do that.  There are two types of opportunity, the first of which is the type that arises after a crash when, for example, a large number of people who were involved in construction are unemployed.  It would have been easy to employ many of these people to address the gap we had in social and affordable housing.  Today, we have an opportunity to do something with windfall money.  Dr. McDonnell from the Nevin Economic Research Institute pointed out that the investment levels in Ireland are low by international standards.  In fact, they have been extraordinarily low.  If one takes the previous decade, State investment levels are very low.</p></speech>

We heard at the European semester that we attended that state investment has dropped, on average, by 20% in Europe since the crash because states cannot afford it.

What frightened us was not so much that we were at the lowest level, but that if we doubled our level of investment, it would still be the lowest in the EU.  That shows how far we have fallen behind over the past decade.  We are closing the gap somewhat.  I do not deny the investment that is taking place but there are significant gaps in infrastructure in particular that are one-off in the context of expenditure.  We should use the opportunity presented by windfall income from corporation tax or wherever else to address these gaps, rather than putting that money away.  The danger in the event of another crash &ndash; I hope there will not be another one &ndash; is that we would repeat the mistake we made in that we would be likely to spend all of that money rescuing vulture funds rather than protecting vulnerable people.</p></speech>

As they will be aware, IBEC is the country's main business representative organisation.  Its members employ 70% of the private sector workforce.  IBEC represents 40 sectors of the economy.  As the committee can imagine, there is a broad range of issues about which our members are concerned in advance of budget 2020.  However, we are seeing an increasing coalescing on four issues about which I will speak briefly in the course of my opening remarks.</p> <p>  The first and by far the most important is the challenges we see for the economy as a result of significant global tax reform.  The second which is connected is how we urgently need to broaden the enterprise base and do much more to support entrepreneurship and the SME sector more generally in the economy.  The third is what we see as the urgent necessity for the delivery of much needed infrastructure and housing to address quality of life concerns.  We could not have this session without speaking about the fourth, the ongoing challenges presented by Brexit and the mitigation measures we need to see being taken in budget 2020 from a business perspective.</p> <p>  On the issue of international tax reform, there is unprecedented change under way in the global tax environment.  Recent developments, most notably the ongoing changes under the OECD-G20 base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative, will have a major impact on how the foreign direct investment, FDI, model will evolve in the future.  It will have significant implications both for industrial and fiscal and budgetary policy.  We have recently seen the publication of the G20 BEPS programme of work on global tax reform.  The proposals, if implemented, as we think they will be, represent the most significant and fundamental changes in global tax policy in a century.  Some of them, in particular, those that pursue a minimum effective global corporate tax rate, will pose significant challenges to Ireland's FDI based model.  The decisions we make in coming budgets will probably be the most important for industrial policy for decades.  For the moment, the FDI-driven growth model continues to deliver the resources we can use to help Ireland to transition to a new model.</p> <p>  Cumulatively, in the past four years we have taken in &euro;14.3 billion in unexpected corporate tax receipts.  That is the scale of the corporate tax surprise in the space of four years.  The significance of this issue is widely under-appreciated in the public policy debate.  The significant resources and investment this trend continues to bring to the country is a once in a generation opportunity to prepare for a future in which, ironically, other parts of the business investment toolkit will become relatively more important.  Managed well, we could use these significant resources to ensure sustainable growth in Ireland's business substance, matched by improved public infrastructure, a thriving indigenous sector and improved standards of living for households.  However, thus far, we have used the majority of the &euro;14.3 billion corporate tax surprise to fund unplanned Supplementary Estimates.  This trend has to stop.  </p> <p>  Starting in budget 2020, we will have no choice but to follow through on the promises of previous decades and finally make a concrete effort to grow the indigenous enterprise base.  It should include an intense focus on productivity, innovation, skills and helping companies to export early.  The prospect of a no-deal Brexit adds significant urgency to this need and must provide a moment of clarity for all policy makers.  We must make Ireland a much more attractive country in which to start and grow a business.  We must also ensure the enterprise base in the future will be much more balanced than at present.</p> <p>  On infrastructure delivery, Ireland has a long history of focusing cuts on productive spending during a downturn.  We now have an opportunity to break that cycle and deliver significantly improved quality of life into the future.  We strongly believe any additional unexpected windfall in corporate tax revenues in future years should be set aside in a designated strategic investments fund which should be used to guarantee the funding of capital projects included in the new national development plan and other key pieces of national innovation infrastructure and provide much needed funding for the cash starved third level education sector.  It is imperative that planned capital projects in the NDP be delivered as quickly as possible and that they do not fall victim to either administrative or process responses to recent high profile project overspends or the re-profiling of capital spending.</p> <p>  On the challenges presented by Brexit, it is clear that the risks to the economy and Irish businesses have not gone away.  Many IBEC members spent millions of euro in preparing for the March and April Brexit dates.  They have incurred significant business costs, many of which were unnecessary.  We continue to hope the withdrawal agreement will be finalised and that an orderly Brexit can be achieved.  However, businesses must also plan for the worst.  They need to continue to make preparations for every scenario.  The Government must also do more in order to provide clarity on meaningful mitigation and support measures that would be implemented in order to preserve jobs and enterprises in the event that there is a disorderly Brexit.  These measures must be timely and substantive.</p> <p>  In summary, business believes budget 2020 will be one of the most important budgets in recent times.  It must respond to the exceptional nature of corporate tax trends.  This issue for the economy is probably more important than the risks posed by Brexit, to which we might come back over the course of our conversation.  We want to see the budget provide for much stronger discipline in current spending to help to broaden the enterprise base and deliver much needed investment in infrastructure, housing, the education sector and innovation, all of which would help to preserve our future growth prospects and national prosperity.</p></speech>

The issue we are here to discuss will be covered in our budget submission, which is currently in draft currently and to which I will refer throughout this statement.</p> <p>  The construction industry underpins the competitiveness and productivity of the domestic economy, therefore, ensuring Ireland has a dynamic construction industry with the capacity to deliver efficiently and cost-effectively is critical. </p> <p>  Where the policy and regulatory environment has made construction financially viable, the industry has responded, delivering high-quality construction for private and public sector clients.  The large increase in student accommodation over the past five years and the ongoing high growth levels in commercial property are examples.  In areas such as private residential outside the greater Dublin area or in social housing, securing finance is more challenging and this has limited the industry&rsquo;s ability to deliver the required output. </p> <p>  Getting the policy and regulatory environment right is critical.  The national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, Rebuilding Ireland, social housing targets, the Action Plan for Jobs, the regional and rural action plans, the apprenticeship action plan, the deep retrofit programme and Ireland&rsquo;s climate action strategy require a dynamic construction industry. </p> <p>  As it stands, without proactive measures from the Government to build capacity in the industry, Ireland will not achieve any of these targets. </p> <p>  The ambition in the &euro;116 billion outlined in the NDP, in developing Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo as an economic counterbalance to Dublin and in delivering 35,000 homes annually, is being stifled by blockages, challenges and constraints on the industry to deliver these laudable aims. </p> <p>  In the area of civil engineering, the objective is to deliver the infrastructure that connects regions, improve people&rsquo;s daily lives and enable housebuilding.  This sector of the industry has had nine consecutive months of contraction in the Ulster Bank purchasing managers' index, PMI, survey.  The commencement of NDP projects is out of sync with the declining state of the civil engineering industry.  In delivering major infrastructure, the time between announcement, commencement and completion of works can be decades.  The timeline for infrastructure projects is predictably uncertain, yet, despite a huge immediate economic and social demand for infrastructure, and a commitment to invest, the relatively small spends on preparatory works are not prioritised.  This will delay projects unnecessarily and ultimately will cost the Exchequer as inflation erodes investment. </p> <p>  After a decade of underinvestment we welcomed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to infrastructure in the NDP.  In normal times this would provide companies with a clear and certain pipeline of work giving the industry the confidence to invest in people, plant and technology. </p> <p>  However, we are not in normal times, that confidence is not present as the civil engineering industry has never really recovered from the recession.  Investment in key strategic projects should begin now to mitigate delays that will invariably occur.  Collaboration at an early stage is the key to unlocking progress. </p> <p>  The second key area for focus is housing.  While significant progress has been made, our housebuilding sector is reporting that a lack of infrastructure is limiting the development of much residentially zoned land.  The CIF and its constituent association, the Irish Home Builders Association, is urging Government to increase the provision for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF and simplify its implementation. </p> <p>  This initiative has played a major role in opening up development lands for housing and playing its part in increasing housing output by 25% year-on-year for the past couple of years.  What is needed now is more consistency in how LIHAF funding is allocated by local authorities across the country to make essential development financially viable for housebuilders to deliver private, social and affordable housing. </p> <p>  The other key policy measure the Government can take to maintain momentum in housing delivery is the extension of the help-to-buy incentive scheme for first-time buyers of new homes.  This scheme is due to expire on 31 December 2019.  It has had a profound impact on the rate of commencement of new residential scheme units, with a resultant increase in the rate of new housing completions since the introduction of the scheme. </p> <p>  Many housebuilders report that between 40% and 70% of sales of starter homes in their new developments are sold to qualifying first-time buyers who are dependent on the help-to-buy scheme to help assemble the required deposit under the Central Bank macroprudential rules.  Without this incentive scheme, the rate of commencement of new homes will fall, as hopeful buyers will fail to have the required deposit to secure their residential mortgage. </p> <p>  Should the Government shelve the help-to-buy scheme, it must then be replaced with an alternative scheme mirroring the shared equity loan scheme that has operated in the UK.  This has been a success for both first-time buyers and for maintaining levels of new house building.  </p> <p>  The third key area which our submission will cover is people, that is, ensuring we have enough skilled workers in the industry.  In mid-2016, SOLAS forecast that the industry would require about 100,000 additional workers over three years to replace those retiring or emigrating and to meet the targets set out for housing in Rebuilding Ireland and in the public capital programme, as it was known.  Since then, we have been hiring an additional 1,000 people per month into the industry, coming to around 35,000.  The shortfall can only be addressed by increasing the numbers of people entering the industry through the CAO and apprenticeship route, increased use of productivity-enhancing technology and building methods, and sourcing people from outside Ireland and through the diaspora. </p> <p>  Of course, it is equally important that we retain those who are already in construction and to that end, we believe that pursuing the highest standards in health, safety and well-being are essential and should be a core requirement for public contracts. </p> <p>  At present, we believe we have exhausted the live register as a source of labour.  We are targeting the diaspora to get people to return home and finally, we are increasing our efforts to attract more young people into construction through activities at primary, secondary and third level, including a national awareness campaign and school competition to be rolled out in 2020. </p> <p>  This is very much a long-term play for our industry.  Our budget submission outlines several steps the Government could take to increase the numbers entering the industry in the short term and to enhance the level of technology and modern construction practices in the industry.  At the outset, due to the importance of the industry to the wider economy, the Government should allocate surplus funding from the National Training Fund to support technology adoption such as building information modelling, BIM, lean and off-site construction and support SMEs in training and upskilling their staff in addition to increasing the numbers of apprentices in the industry.  DIT recently surveyed industry to identify why the number of apprentices remains low, particularly in areas such as plastering, despite a large increase in activity generally.  The survey highlighted that in some trades, such as plastering, the apprenticeship model is broken and must be recalibrated.  In these trades we recommend that the Government reinstate the student levy for apprentices to allay some of the costs to the small builder who would traditionally have hired the bulk of apprentices in the industry. </p> <p>  Finally, I must sound a warning about the divergence in activity between the greater Dublin area and the regions.  The various crane counts show that there are ten times more cranes visible on the Dublin skyline than in Cork, Limerick and Galway combined.  This sort of imbalance is concerning on several fronts and demonstrates the huge challenge the Government has in its attempt to deliver on Project Ireland 2040. </p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is warning that a slowdown is inevitable, yet there are sectors of the construction industry and regions of the country that still feel the cold air of the recent crisis.</p><p>Without more connectivity and activity in the regions, we will not have the sorts of dynamic construction companies operating locally to make the NDP and NPF a reality.  We can address these challenges but we must do it together and we must start now.</p></speech>

I thank them for their contributions.   I strongly agree with them on some of the points they made and disagree with them on others.  I fully agree on using the surprise corporate tax receipts to fund key strategic areas of infrastructure and diversify the economy.  The witnesses may be surprised to learn that this approach would be the thrust of the industrial policy of People Before Profit.  There is, however, a contradiction between that view and the concern the witnesses expressed about a potential minimum effective corporate tax rate.  We do not know how long the bonanza will last but it will come to an end at some point.  Would we not be better off facing that reality?  From a moral point of view, we should address that issue in any case because much of this tax income is from a small number of corporations whose long-term value to the economy is a little questionable as we are vulnerable to what they might do.  Would we not be better off closing down some of the tax reliefs they get and redirect them precisely into the areas the witnesses advocated, for example, diversifying the economy and ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to do so.  An obvious example, which was mentioned earlier, is research and development tax relief, which has jumped to &euro;700 million and overwhelmingly goes to a small group of IT companies.  Would it not be better to redirect that money into ramping up our ability to produce the apprentices that have been mentioned or developing the infrastructure necessary for more balanced regional development?  I will not list all of the things we could do with the money.  Even if we took half of the &euro;700 million and redirected it to some of those areas, it would be very good for developing a more sustainable domestic economy that would act as a better buffer in the long term against the ups and downs we may experience.  I put those questions to IBEC.</p> <p>  The Construction Industry Federation has issued a stark warning and we should all take it very seriously.  Its claim that we will not meet the Rebuilding Ireland targets because of various bottlenecks and problems is very worrying.  I ask the witnesses from CIF to elaborate on that point.  Before the meeting, I spoke informally to them about this issue and I am not sure how to get out of this dilemma.  As I pointed out, despite buying land from NAMA at relatively low prices, developers and builders are having extreme difficulty making a profit when they build on this land.  I know some have bought land at the more inflated prices that have developed lately.  Even where they bought at very low prices, however, it seems to be very difficult for the construction industry to build and sell at a profit.  Maybe that explains the low level of output.  Mr. Lucey gave the stark message that the current level of output will not increase much more and will certainly not reach the level we need unless something changes.  My solution is that if the developers cannot do this, the State must intervene.  Would it not be better for developers to have the State decide to contract them to develop what we need to build?  The State must accept that we need a certain level of output come what may.  This means asking developers how much it would cost to build the amount of housing needed because we have no choice in the matter.  What seems to be happening at the moment is that delivery of housing is dependent on whether developers can make a profit.  Consequently, housing is not being delivered to the scale required and, according to the CIF, we may hit a wall fairly soon.</p> <p>  I am very interested in apprenticeship, not least because my son has just started an apprenticeship to become an electrician, which I am delighted about.  Is the problem with apprenticeships that it is too expensive for builders to take on apprentices or is it that there are not enough young people who want to avail of apprenticeships, or both?  What can we do to address the problem?  I am slightly worried about the suggestion that we should reinstate the student levy.  Would students have to pay the levy?  Surely we should make it more attractive for young people to go into the trades.  Perhaps the State could give an additional subsidy to improve pay rates for first and second year apprentices.  They might then view apprenticeship as an attractive option rather than being required to pay an extra student levy to take the pressure off the builder.  I take the point that was made about builders.  I read that a relatively low percentage of builders can afford to take on apprentices.  However, loading the cost on the apprentice does not seem to be the best way to deal with the problem.  The State needs to employ more apprentices or at least support them in order that apprenticeship becomes more attractive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#S00400"><p>I will respond to the questions on corporate taxation and research and development.  The corporate tax trends in the last couple of years have been by the far the most significant phenomenon in the economy.  They are probably more significant than the challenges posed by Brexit.  I will give a potted history.  Ireland has a longstanding tradition of offering a competitive corporate tax rate.  This has been successful as an economic model driven by foreign direct investment, FDI.  There was a fundamental shift in the nature of that model.  Mr. Lucey mentioned the cranes that we observe in Dublin.  This is all connected.  In 2015, the OECD introduced the BEPS 1 reform which fundamentally changed how companies structure themselves and where activity sits in the global economy.  BEPS 1 meant that corporates had to fully align substance and profits.  Ireland has a long history of substance and has always had the substance.  Intel and its predecessors have always done significant research and development, evolving their business model and reinventing what they were doing here.  Some companies have been here for 50 years but they are doing something completely different now than they were 50 years ago.  We have always had that model.  There is real substance in the Irish FDI sector but other countries did not have substance.  Many other islands offer a tax rate but not much else, whereas there has always been substance in the Irish economy.  In 2015, when we drew up the BEPS 1 reform, we saw a significant increase in the nature of the roles and the decision-makers coming into Irish businesses because they were the new rules of international tax.  The decision-makers had to be sitting here.</p><p>We are now seeing many more European and the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, headquarters here, who predominantly are the people behind those cranes.  It is not Irish debt or, by and large, Irish banks funding housing when we observe those cranes.  It is this hyper-globalisation of the Irish economy, very significant investment and a long-term commitment to the economy from largely Irish international global corporations.  What they are doing here is cutting edge and world leading.</p><p> Many countries are not happy with the success of the Irish economy.  Predominantly, they are European countries.  It seems to us now that some of the major international blocs are coalescing around a new reform of this global tax.  They do not like the answer they got the last time in base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS 1.  They are going back again and their core objective will be to shift some of that tax revenue not to where the value is created or to where the substance is happening in Irish operations, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and technology but to where they have the consumers.  This is a global war for tax revenue and the countries that are big have the might.  They have the consumers.  They want more of that revenue because they are arguing effectively through the OECD that the value in many of these corporations is created where the consumer interfaces with the product that is being developed.  This is not a digital or technology issue.  It is happening in respect of the value of brands and other intangibles.  They want to redesign the global corporate tax system.  They want to put that revenue in the countries where the consumers are, not in the countries where the innovation is happening and the value is being created.</p><p> We have a good deal of merit in terms of what we are arguing for but I agree with the Deputy.  I believe there is a global momentum here in that we will not have the same competitive advantage on tax in the future.  We have to prepare for that transition.  To prepare for that transition we have to use the opportunity we have now and the proceeds that are at our disposal to invest in the innovation and the education.  I sat in for part of the last session and I heard some of the numbers discussed around our innovation spend.  It is pitifully low.  We do not have a world-class infrastructure.  Colleagues from the CIF will talk about that in terms of the blockages and how that is impacting on the wider business community.  We do not have a world-class education system.  Of the &euro;14.3 billion we got in the surprise, &euro;11.5 billion of that went on Supplementary Estimates in just four and a half years.  Almost all of it went to day-to-day spending.</p><p> We could look at the past four years and say that we have blown a golden opportunity but this is not done yet.  We could still have some upside.  I am saying we have to reset the entire budgetary process.  We must be absolutely clear that the upside we get from here on is put into those strategic investments.  That is what protects the model for the future.  If we lose our corporation tax advantage today, we have not put the building blocks in place to be competitive on issues like the skills, the innovation and the infrastructure.  We are not at world standard on those so we will not prosper.  We need to use this transition opportunity but invest in the future.</p><p> I might ask Mr. Brady to speak about the research and development tax credit because that is an example.  The latest figures are approximately &euro;500 million, which is worrying for us.  Companies are doing less research and development from the position a couple of years ago, which is a concern.  It is well proven that that scheme has brought additional and mobile research activity into Ireland, with a significant return to the State, that would not have happened otherwise.  Mr. Brady has conducted a fairly extensive study on this particular scheme so I might ask him to give some of the findings on the economics on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061900002#T00200"><p>There was a recent consultation with the Department of Finance on the research and development tax credit.  The figures show that the &euro;700 million it went up to in 2014-15 has come back down in recent years; we are back down to about &euro;500 million a year.  That has been falling in the past two or three years, which is worrying because it means less qualifying research and development is being done.  We have looked at the studies about research and development tax credits and how effective they are worldwide.  In some countries there is a question about whether it is more effective to give a tax credit or a grant.  There are some studies that show that subsidies are better and others that show a tax credit is better.  The studies in Ireland show that, by a long margin, a tax credit is much better.  For every &euro;1 we give in a subsidy, we get about &euro;2.5 in research and development in private companies.  I guess the reason for that is that there is a double benefit of the research and development tax credit.  On the one hand, it is attractive from an inward foreign direct investment point of view because one gets the tax credit itself but on the other hand, it takes the cost out of research and development.  We have seen big challenges in that regard.</p> <p>  The big challenge on the research and development side is, first, direct funding on which I totally agree with the Deputy.  Direct funding should be much higher than it is currently which, as Mr. O'Brien said, is pitiful.  Second, many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, do not use the research and development tax credit because it is too difficult for them to use administratively.  The UK, Norway, France and other countries have separate research and development tax credits for small companies that give them cash.  They are refundable.  They are paid quicker.  Administratively, they are much less burdensome and one sees much better results out of the research and development tax credits.  If we want to get more value for money out of the money we are already spending, we should try to make it easier for SMEs to use it rather than shift it completely to subsidies.  Along with the research and development tax credit, we believe the Government should be putting money into innovation anyway and using this corporate tax as the opportunity.</p> <p>  I will make one comment on apprenticeships.  We would ask that there would be some offsetting and not only in construction.  In almost every company we talk to the take-up of apprenticeships has been low across the board.  Much of that is due to the fact that they are losing a member of staff for two days a week and still paying them.  We are saying that some kind of subsidy may have to be offered to encourage companies to take that up, for example, a tax offset against corporation tax or a direct subsidy.  We do not care which model the Government goes down but that it takes some of the cost off smaller companies in particular which cannot afford to pay someone for six or seven days and only get their services for three or four.</p> <p>  On social housing, there are real challenges in that regard.  The cost of land is a big issue.  The cost of construction is procyclical in Ireland.  It will only go in one direction while the economy is getting stronger.  We have seen some signs in that regard and talked to many developers.  We believe, and we agree with the CIF on this, that the pace of the delivery of new housing will continue to increase but it will slow in terms of the growth.  There are two reasons for that, one of which is that affordability has reached its limits, particularly in urban areas.  Last year, approximately 90% or 95% of households were more than 3.25% in loan to income ratios in Dublin, which means that there is not a lot of space.  If incomes are growing by 5%, we cannot have house prices growing by 10% or 15%.  That cannot continue.  That sets a top on the market in terms of what people can afford.  In terms of land prices, we are competing with industrial, commercial or public buildings in some cases so land prices are increasing.  The cost of construction is increasing and because more people are being hired there is more competition.  We are low in terms of the unemployment rate.  That will squeeze margins and make it more difficult in future years to deliver housing.  We believe we may see 20,000 or 21,000 houses delivered this year.  That is not anywhere near the rate of growth we need to be at to get to the levels we will need to reach.  </p> <p>  In terms of social housing delivery, we have been before this committee on several occasions and have said over the years that we need a much bigger scale of social housing direct delivery.  We are cutting out the developer in the middle but in terms of the construction sector and the workforce we need for apprenticeships and some of the trades, we will still need those people to deliver it regardless of what happens.  That remains an issue.  Even if the State decides to deliver it, who do we get to deliver it?  That will be the big challenge.</p> <p>  We have heard from members in other sectors that workers go into construction but not at the rates we would expect in previous years, particularly in the mid-2000s when many people moved from manufacturing into construction.  It is not happening at the same rate but it is happening.  I agree that that trend is probably the main place left.  I do not believe there are many workers left on the live register with trades; it may be fewer than a couple of thousand.  They will have to be found from other sectors, which builds up costs for many other businesses and will probably be a challenge for other sectors also.  I agree that it is difficult to see how that can be fixed quickly.  That is a major challenge for employers as well.</p></speech>

I will pass the housing question to Mr. Parlon.  I will start with the apprenticeships because it is a great topic.  I am delighted to hear Deputy Boyd Barrett's son is training to be an electrician.  It is a fabulous way of life and a skill one can travel with.  It is a skill one gets and never loses.</p> <p>  To address the issue of the funding, we are suggesting the reinstatement of a levy that was removed in the budget of 2014.  I refer to phases 4 and 6 of the apprenticeship programme.  When the participants were in the institutes of technology, SOLAS used to pay parts of the money for the training from the national training fund, NTF.</p><p>That was taken away in the 2014 budget.  We are advocating that it should be reinstated to help them.  Regarding what we can do about this issue, there is much happening.  One of the greatest problems we have is that builders need confidence.  They need confidence that there is going to be enough work in front of them to take on apprentices for the duration of a four-year programme.  Unfortunately, that confidence is not there.  The work that is happening is largely driven by multinational companies putting private money into construction taking place mainly in the Dublin region.  We need more than that.  There is not enough certainty in that for builders to invest in apprenticeships.</p><p> Everybody has been through the most awful recession.  People are scared to invest.  They do not want to be as big as they were and they do not want to earn as much money as they did back in the good times.  They just want to make a decent living.  There is a confidence issue here which really does need a sustained release of work in order to try to encourage growth again.  What can we do with the apprentices?  We have to attract them into the industry.  I do not know if anybody present attended the Ireland Skills Live event that took place in March at the RDS. We were one of the sponsors.  It consisted of those in 25 different apprenticeships taking part in a competition to find the best apprentice in each of the 25 areas.  That took place in public at the RDS, with the apprentices competing against the clock and each other in joinery, hairdressing, heavy machinery maintenance, aircraft maintenance, welding, etc.  It was absolutely fantastic.  School pupils came to the event in busloads.  Some 11,000 students came from all over the country on the Thursday and Friday.  There is nothing like seeing the excitement on the faces of the younger generation looking at the opportunities in front of them.  There was something for everybody.  One individual was working on a small helicopter in front of the students, while in another area someone else was working on a jet engine.  There were also people welding behind red see-through boards.  It was possible to see what they were working on.  People were also involved in bricklaying and  hand-painting competitions.  Everything was there.  On the Saturday, we were concerned that the footfall might go down because the schools were closed.  That morning, however, carloads of families showed up.  Mothers and fathers came in with their children to see what the event was all about.  One of the questions we were asked many times was where was it possible to find more information on all of this.  There is no one place to find out about it.</p><p> The Ireland Skills Live event was a brilliant success and that came from collaboration between the industry and the State bodies that have been organising similar events in this area for a long time.  For years, however, something like the joinery competition would have taken place in the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, with nobody looking at it.  A couple of years ago, however, people went to the world championship in Azerbaijan and saw the Irish winners taking part there in a public competition.  It was felt that the Irish competitors were disadvantaged.  The industry here got together with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and SOLAS.  Everybody was a little afraid as to whether this new approach would work.  The industry sponsored the event, the agencies got behind it and it was a tremendous success.  I recommend that all of the members attend the Ireland Skills Live event when it takes place next year.  If nothing else, they will get a lift from it.</p><p> We have a job to do to convince the younger generation that they do not have to go on to third level in order to get pieces of paper in whatever discipline.  We want them to understand that we want them to do what they are good at.  The current model of success is based on the school league tables.  That model seems to rate success as being the number of students that schools get into universities.  We would like to see a different model of success used, one whereby schools shepherd their students into what they are good at and what they want to do.  If my local school produces the local electricians, engineers, painters and hairdressers, that is success to me.  In that context, we are putting together a campaign to attract people into every area of the construction industry.  We do not favour people going into one area over another.  People should go into the areas that are a good fit for them.  We speak to the professional bodies all the time, including Engineers Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  All of those professional bodies support what we want to do.  As already stated, we will not discriminate.  People should go into whatever areas are a good fit for them so that-----</p></speech>

There is certainly a conundrum regarding the cost of producing a house, namely, the incentive for the builder to take a risk and get a profit versus the ability of somebody to buy the house.  I am told by two different house builders active in the market that it is possible to go onto any site in Dublin today and get a house to buy.  Supply has caught up with the ability to buy.  That is a dilemma.  Whether the discretion available from the Central Bank is running out or whatever, that is where matters stand.</p> <p>  We have been lobbying very hard.  Goodbody Stockbrokers issued a report over the weekend which favoured the continuation of the help-to-buy scheme.  We find that is a major factor in the context of a first-time buyer being able to buy a house.  One of the builders yesterday told me that he had a list of 400 potential buyers.  He had to go through every person on that list to sell 12 houses.  One person was very enthused about getting a house but he was &euro;10,000 short when he added to together his deposit, his mortgage and the few euros he had in cash.  Without that &euro;10,000, unfortunately, that was that.</p> <p>  There might be some notion abroad that if we can press down the price of houses, they will then become more affordable,  Unfortunately, the margin for and viability of building is tight, particularly in view of the costs involved.  That is only going to slow down building.  I know of two large players that have actually slowed down production because the buyers are not coming along.  That is a dilemma we are going to have to deal with in the next budget.  Costs are increasing.  Sometimes the discussion about inflation in construction is exaggerated.  There is certainly some inflation on the labour side.  There has also been much commentary on some of the big projects.  I refer, for example, to the national children's hospital project and the fact that inflation has been blamed for the price escalation.  That is not quite the case.  Initial underestimation of the costs was a major factor.  There are many areas that need to be dealt with.  We see the continuation of the help-to-buy scheme as a priority, as well as the LIHAF scheme whereby infrastructure is introduced by local authorities.  That could be water, roads, access, etc.  The announcement of substantial funding for that scheme was very positive.  However, only a fraction of the funding announced has been drawn down.  It is extremely complicated, very slow and is certainly holding up some development as well.</p></speech>

I have also read the submissions from our guests.  I will return to some of the things I mentioned in the previous session.  As a member of this committee, I certainly look at common themes arising at this time of the year.  Earlier, the representatives from NERI put forward a view completely contrary to what we have just heard regarding subsidised housing and the help-to-buy scheme.  The contribution from the NERI delegates came just 20 minutes ago and it is interesting to hear the arguments that have been made.  Mr. Parlon's comment regarding the supply of housing having caught up with the ability to pay could make a headline.  That paints a particular picture.  The key word for me in that sentence is "ability".  The people we do not count in the homeless figures or those waiting to buy houses number approximately 250,000 adults.  They remain in the homes of their parents.  Politicians had an opportunity during the recent election cycle to knock on doors.  In my constituency, there was a house in Kingswood in Tallaght, a middle-class area, where a mother reported that all four of her adult children had returned to live at home.  They are all working.  One returned home to save for a deposit, another because of difficulties affording rent and the other two for similar, if more complex, reasons.  People in the construction industry, particularly Mr. Parlon, need to take cognisance of cuckoo funds and this big push towards build-to-rent developments.</p><p>The witnesses' organisations need to help the Government and politicians to address this.   I met a couple in Elder Heath, which is a fine new development in Kiltipper in Tallaght.  They had &euro;90,000 of a deposit for their home.  They were paying &euro;1,800 a month in rent but when they got their deposit and bought their house, they found their mortgage is &euro;975 a month.  That is a saving of almost &euro;1,000 a month that was going into a black hole.  The witnesses' organisations have as much a responsibility as policy makers in this regard. </p><p> I ran for election in a by-election in 2014.  We were still emerging from the crash at that time and I remember reading a SIPTU paper on apprenticeships.  It was very much ahead of its time in its thinking on them.  It was produced in 2013 and now in 2019, only 4% of our apprentices are women.  Some 39% of apprentices in Northern Ireland are women and the number of female-male apprentices in Scotland is almost equal.  Mr. Lucey mentioned jobs in sectors such as hairdressing, front-desk jobs, tourism related business right across to sheet metal working which were flagged six years ago.  Investment in apprenticeships is a theme that has emerged from a number of contributors who have appeared before the committee.</p><p> In Denmark, 11% of its workforce are apprentices, 45% of those on its apprenticeship programmes are women and apprenticeship programmes are open to people from the age of 18 to 60.  There is constant retraining and developing of ability among its people to do work in the apprenticeship sectors.</p><p> This discussion has nudged forward the conversation on apprenticeships.  I would be as passionate as Mr. Lucey about this issue.  I am particularly struck when the leaving certificate results come out in August and the talk is all about the Central Applications Office, CAO, points system.  Sean O'Rourke's programme and Pat Kenny's programme are full of it and only 30 seconds of those programmes are devoted to apprenticeships.  </p><p> In the UK, an apprentice forum has been set up headed by a captain of industry, and its objective is that every parent in the UK would consider an apprenticeship for their child.  We have become over-educated in Ireland.  Those channels we assumed that traditionally catered for the student with physical skills started offering business and marketing degrees.  I refer to the institutes of technology.  Those were bullshit courses in terms of what they qualified people to do.  The proof of the pudding was in the eating when those students emigrated; they found they were qualified for nothing.  As Mr. Lucey said, the students who qualified as electricians, plumbers or carpenters and emigrated got a job the day they landed in another country, but we want to keep those people here.  I would encourage the witnesses to keep banging this drum.  It requires change on the part of parents and the education sector in terms of the way apprenticeships are viewed.  When I was in school many of my classmates left post-intermediate certificate and went into apprenticeships and they studied alongside doing that.  That does not happen any more.  We laud the fact that people no longer leave school post-intermediate certificate.  This is a channel that needs to be open.  We are not bearing the fruits of that now because we do not have the necessary workforce.  I am 100% behind the witnesses on this issue.</p><p> Unexpected revenue windfalls were mentioned.  Interesting themes have been raised today.  We heard from representatives from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  The witnesses before us are on the same page on that issue as the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU and the Nevin Economic and Research Institute, NERI.  The representatives of IFAC said this must be squirrelled away into a prudence account.  The representatives of NERI and ICTU have said there should be no once-off unrepeatable capital projects.  The witnesses before us are saying the same that it should be earmarked for capital projects and to ensure the delivery of the national development plan.  The way we should spend revenue windfalls has been a common theme for this committee for the past three years in advance of those budgets.  </p><p> The witnesses have not commented on demographics.  That theme arose in the context of the way our ageing population may affect the workforce.  I am keen to develop apprenticeships.  I will be pushing for that in the contribution this committee will make to the Minister.  I welcome comments from the witnesses on those points. </p></speech>

We had some discussion with Deputy Boyd Barrett on that.  The other issue is the broader view on apprenticeships.  We are very clear on the corporate tax surprise.  I will repeat the figures involved.  It is &euro;14.3 billion in four years, &euro;11.5 billion of which has gone into Supplementary Estimates each year during the past four years.  That is the cumulative figure.  These are decisions that have been taken collectively during the past four years.  They have not been good decisions.  They are putting real risks on our fiscal stability.  The excessive corporate tax reliance to fund day-to-day spending gives us a greater risk of a significant fiscal crisis than our reliance on stamp duty did more than a decade ago.  That is the risk we see in the economy.  We must make a transition away from that to a new enterprise based model with much greater support for the indigenous sector, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and entrepreneurship, but we must invest in the building blocks.  We are not hitting our marks in innovation.  We are not delivering the public capital infrastructure at the pace we need to be delivering it.  We are not supporting our education system.

We are seeing that now in terms of outcomes, student choices and, worryingly, in terms of perception.  If we are asking all these companies that are spending a great deal of money on our physical infrastructure and building wonderful facilities in Dublin to have their global intellectual property sitting in Ireland and we are not minding our own intellectual property in terms of funding our universities, these companies will quickly see we are not a serious player in terms of operating at a global level because we are not making smart decisions around investment.  We have been frittering this away in day-to-day spending, much of it into the health service.  When we consider the level of public scrutiny of the budget for the construction of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, there is not the same level of scrutiny of the day-to-day spending of the &euro;11.5 billion we have overspent in Supplementary Estimates in the space of four years.  There is very little scrutiny of that from what we can see.</p> <p>  On the issue of apprenticeships, my colleagues from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, may want to come back in on construction specific issues.  From a broad business perspective, as I said, there are 40 different sectors or trade associations in IBEC.  A number of those have been instrumental in getting new apprenticeships up and running in sectors such as financial services and manufacturing.  We are also examining options around retail, for example.  We are trying to broaden out the conversation on  apprenticeship options.  Uptake of them has been slow.  We are disappointed with the uptake of some of the apprenticeships we have sponsored through our trade associations.  As Gerard Brady said in a previous response, there is a cost issue in terms of small employers, in particular, that must examined but, collectively, we need to do an a great deal more to brand, promote and encourage young people to consider the options available.  Much of this is connected to education sector reform.  It is not only about young people making these decisions at the age of 16 or 17.  This must be addressed right through our education system in terms of our approach to learning, junior certificate reform and the way young people are being educated under the national school curriculum.  Many of our member companies engage on issues such as the gender challenge we face in certain sectors with the very low level of female participation.  They are visiting primary schools.  They know that by the time students move on to secondary school it is far too late.  This work must start at primary school level but a much more systematic and fundamental reform of our education system is required and part of that requires us to have a broad perspective on the opportunities in apprenticeships.  Compared to where we were five years ago, we have achieved an awful lot.  When I consider the new options we have in apprenticeships, we have achieved a great deal but the uptake of them has been disappointing and slow and we want to see some changes in that respect.</p></speech>

We have lost a culture of apprenticeships.  I am 54 years of age and that culture was very much alive when I was doing my intermediate certificate and leaving certificate.  Up to one third of my classmates left school after the intermediate certificate to take up apprenticeships.  They are not a sexy option now for students.  That is the first aspect that must be addressed.  I do not know if the witnesses have any ideas about addressing that.  If they listen to Sean O'Rourke's programme in the third week of August, I am not exaggerating when I say that 99% of his programme post the leaving certificate results coming out will be focused on third level, university and college education and only one minute will be devoted to apprenticeships.</p><p>How can we change that culture?</p></speech>

We wanted to find out why construction is not attractive.  We got a lot of information back.  We are not selling ourselves as well as the Googles and Amazons of this world.  The survey pointed us in the direction of the tools to change that.  I will stop there because I could go on for too long.  We are working on that.  I totally agree about perceptions.  Perception is a huge thing.  There are historical reasons for them which I could go on a bit about, but I will not.  I got one massive bit of hope from Ireland Skills Live at the RDS.  If we give the information to the mothers of Ireland they will make the right decision.  I have no doubt about it.  All that they are receiving at the moment is a wealth of information about going to university.  They know their children better than anyone, and if they are given options and an understanding of what is available they will point them in the direction of what works for them.  I am hopeful.  An awful lot of us agree about this.  Diversity is mentioned here.  It is one of the things we must battle with in construction.  It is not diverse enough.  That is part of our campaign.  As was said, we have to start the primary schools.</p></speech>

We are preparing a skills campaign and canvassing funds for it at the moment.  We are also fundraising in the private sector.  We would like an injection of help from Government agencies on that.  We are absolutely dead serious about this.  This is something we have to do.  We do not have a choice.  We need people to come into construction to do the work this country needs.  We will make it happen, but it will happen better if we do it in collaboration with the State agencies.</p> <p>  Sean O'Rourke will be missing a trick if he does not turn up at Ireland Skills Live next year and broadcast from it some morning.  He will see something different and get the news out on the airwaves that something different is going on.  </p> <p>  I have two other comments to make.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the State building houses.  We need a lot of different initiatives to overcome the problem we face.  A lot of the initiatives that have been pushed out have been working and we have raised the output.  As with any problem, however, we must have enough tools in our chest to approach this in the right way.  One tool is missing at the moment; the State is not doing enough.  We should not rely on any single thing.  We need a combination of public and private efforts.  The private sector will always take on entrepreneurial projects.  It will take a risk on things that the State will not do.  When it comes to solving problems however, we must all work together. </p> <p>  I refer to capital projects and unexpected tax funds.  People do not seem to realise that if they make a decision to go ahead with something today they will see a shovel going into the ground four years later.  It is no good waiting until next October to find out whether we face a hard or soft Brexit.  We have to be decisive and press the button on projects now.  Nothing happens tomorrow in construction.  Press the button today and four years pass before a shovel is in the ground, and that is with everything going right. </p></speech>

Has he ever heard of an Italian economist who teaches in London named Dr. Mariana Mazzucato?  She wrote a famous book called <i>The Entrepreneurial State</i>.  She showed how almost all the major entrepreneurial decisions in the development of the IT industry and electronics generally, including all the elements of the web, were made by the state and university sectors rather than private industry.  In fact, private enterprises like Facebook and Google ran with systems that had been put in place by the state.  I do not see where this is coming from.  I worked briefly in the construction industry when I was a kid.  The Ahern and McCreevy Government decimated the construction ability of city and county councils.  It ran down the workforce and got rid of apprentices and skilled tradesmen.  That is what happened.  We did not have the kind of State involvement in housing that had accompanied the private sector in the past.  I worked for contractors on both public and private estates.</p><p>Why is Mr. Lucey moaning about Dublin and the number of cranes on its skyline?  Should he not rejoice in that?  Most powerful economies tend to have a major capital city.  Some 40 million out of 125 million Japanese live in the greater Tokyo area.  Some 20 million Argentines live in Buenos Aires, out of 48 million in total.  Half the Austrian population lives in the state of Vienna, though there are historical reasons for that.  What is the big deal with this?  Should we not rejoice in the fact that when one goes to the top of this building and looks towards the south east, about eight or ten high-rise buildings are rising up over the fabric of the city and all those cranes are out there?  The same is happening in my own constituency of Dublin Bay North.  We face some changes in Limerick.  Limerick city and county will have one leader.  The newly enlarged Cork city has upwards of 200,000 people.  There is also Galway as well as Belfast and Derry in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  Why moan about this?  Why not just decide to expand on that and build houses, particularly in the Dublin region?  A lot of the high-rise buildings are commercial, such as the 24-storey building by the Liffey and other neighbouring buildings.</p><p>Mr. Lucey spoke about confidence and &quot;normal times&quot;.  When were there normal times?  All times have problems and issues.  The country is undertaking the national development plan, the national broadband plan and retrofitting.  The Construction Industry Federation told us that 50,000 houses would come on stream in 2023 and 2024.  None of us on this side of the room believes that supply and demand are in equilibrium.  That is fantasy.  It is not the case.  There is no question of that being the case because in my constituency between 7,000 and 8,000 families are on a housing list.  There are 20,000 such families in Dublin city alone and we believe the true figure for the whole country is almost 130,000.  There is no equilibrium.  We are miles from equilibrium because nothing was done for seven or eight years.  What more confidence does the industry need?  Even with Brexit we will have a lot of construction if there is a moderately soft landing, which there probably will be under the new Prime Minister.  Should we not be planning on that basis rather than worrying about confidence?  What is confidence?  Confidence was there in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  The problem is that the State abrogated its role in doing something about this after 2008 and 2009.</p><p>I agree with Mr. Lucey about the shared equity loan scheme.  That would be a useful development.  On the point of apprenticeships I note that we have given SOLAS the responsibility.  Even before the crash, as a Deputy I found that it was very hard to get sponsors after the introduction of the new system of seven segments.  Some five of those were awarded in college and a further two on the site.  One could still find young boys and girls getting four or five sections and struggling to get an employer who would take them over the line.  The Brits have elevated apprenticeships to degree level.  Things have changed in construction since I was assisting plasterers.  There are many big sites in our constituency, and I note the role that crane drivers are playing.  Walls and practically whole apartments arrive in blocks.  The technology is changing.  Construction is a high-tech industry.  These qualifications should be recognised as level 8 qualifications, the level of a basic degree.  Last week we gave the institutes of technology the power to award any degree they like up to doctoral level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.307" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>If one is a great brickie, one is at degree level in terms of construction.  Is that not the way to go?  One should equalise the thing and say that all these professions, whether that of economist or brickie, are equally necessary.  I do not see why there should be that type of problem.</p><p>As a company director, I am a member of IBEC.  Earlier, NERI representatives told the committee that of ten wealthier countries, we were ninth lowest in terms of public sector spending.  Clearly, we have supplementary budgets because the health budget is not sufficient to run a national health service, which is what we want.  Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany are Nos. 1 to 8, respectively.  We are coming in behind them.  If we are to get to their levels of public infrastructure, including transport, to meet the new carbon plans, we will, surely, have to spend money.  By the way, that will create confidence among builders.  We are going to have to do a great deal of building so it is hard to see why people are worried about confidence.</p></speech>

The Deputy was correct to say she is very strong on the role of innovation in transformative economic policy and investment in human capital, research and development and so on.  A significant element of our budget submission, which will be formalised in the next few weeks, focuses on the role of research and development and innovation in construction, linking education and training across the industry and sector.  Education is the primary activity of universities and institutes of technology and that feeds into skills development for the sector.  The production of goods and services is the primary activity of companies in construction.  Therefore, our ultimate aim is to have a designated centre for construction research, development and innovation which would be a bridge between academia, the research community and the construction sector.  We have committed to pursuing and progressing that agenda and have already established a joint industry-academic steering committee to work through the construction sector group in that regard.  In our submission, we will call for greater investment in construction-related research and development and innovation and, in particular, for a consideration of the existing research and development tax credit and how it meets the needs of construction SMEs.  It is often the case that the types of activities and services construction companies provide are difficult to capture in the black and white review Revenue conducts in respect of the construction research and development credit.  We need to continue to build links between the education and training sectors and industry so that, as Mr. Lucey detailed, our pilot scheme, which is to be launched in the autumn, can garner additional stakeholder support.  A focus of the scheme and many of the policies CIF is adopting are about embracing a whole-life career in construction.  It should not just be about the initial qualification that gets one a job but about providing tools and supports through employers for lifelong learning and career progression.  That will allow us to offer rewarding and sustainable careers to those choosing to enter the industry and to improve the diversity of the sector.</p></speech>

That is not the case.  The president referred to that.  It is part of a very important model, however, and it provides currently for a certainty of funding that is not coming from anywhere else.  A figure we came up with lately is that just 6% of our social housing is being provided by the State.  Otherwise, it buys it from the private sector.  While co-living has received a great deal of negative publicity, it has a place for a sector of the workforce.  There are young people who want to spend the minimum amount of time in living accommodation and to live and work in the city.  We need solutions in all those areas.</p> <p>  I note to Deputy Broughan that I did not hear anyone moaning.  If we gave that impression, it was certainly not intended.  We are delighted to have approximately 125 cranes in Dublin.  The point the president made was that there are fewer than a dozen elsewhere.  It is a massive discrepancy.  In numerical terms, the bulk of our members are all over the country.  Unfortunately, they are all commuting to Dublin and helping to clog up the streets, contributing to the congestion that exists.  It involves a great deal of extra cost.  If we had that extra infrastructure so that they could work in the general vicinity-----</p></speech>

However, there is a difference between having a 50:50 ratio with respect to economic activity in the capital, which might be acceptable, and a 90:10 ratio, which is the problem we have.

The Minister's recommendations are still not being taken on board.  We certainly need to increase the height.  Lest the notion go out that apprenticeships in construction are at a low ebb, electricians and plumbers are flying high.  This includes the very apprenticeship to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to in respect of his son.  There are thousands of people in each trade mainly because we have large contractor firms on the mechanical and electrical side which are working for the likes of Google and Facebook and building data centres, not just in Dublin and around the country but across Europe.  That is a very good model.  It is in respect of the wet trades, which are necessary currently for house-building, where the structure of the industry does not encourage employers to some extent.  We have a weakness on the employer side and a mega-weakness around creating an awareness among people who might otherwise choose an apprenticeship in these trades.</p></speech>

The witnesses have touched on workforce issues being key and stated that the live register has been exhausted.  The industry is now looking beyond that.  From a budgetary oversight perspective, we are heading into the next budget.  The summer recess will take place shortly and when we come back we will be fully into the discussions on budget 2020.  What are the witnesses' key asks for us to consider in respect of that budget?  I refer to addressing the workforce issue but also to the cost of building.</p></speech>

We are still having success through different training courses with getting people off long-term unemployment and into construction.  Going forward, we will have to bring more workers into the industry from among school leavers.  However, we will also have to look at the technology.  Off-site construction has become very prevalent internationally but we are getting into it more slowly in Ireland.  We have people who are willing to do it, but it comes back to that awful word "confidence".  If people want to set up a fabrication plant in Ireland, it means a very significant investment.  They will want to know they will be able to sell the output.  A huge part of what we need is to push the pipeline of work.  At the moment, a very significant proportion of that pipeline is coming from the private sector.  I read the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's document last weekend.  The funny thing is that when I got to the end of it, I did not feel all that great.  I wondered why I was not feeling good after reading this advisory document.  I looked at it again and considered the words it used.  The word "overheating" was used 39 times.  The word "shock" was in it 78 times, "debt" was in it 173 times and "adverse" was used 23 times.</p><p>It was a report that made people worried that everybody was saying something was going wrong.  Some parts of our industry, such as the civil engineering sector and the regions, have not really had the same crack of the whip as other parts of it.  We know that connectivity is a huge part of the social fabric of our regions.  Some parts of the country are not connected properly to other parts of it.  Dublin needs to go underground.  It has to go underground.  There is no more room on the streets.  If we want to have a fabulous capital city, we have to move forward with these projects.  The MetroLink project has been going slowly for a number of months.  We need these things to move forward quickly because we do not see big projects starting on the ground until 2020.  That will be the first of them if it starts then.  People are not being given the confidence to invest and use their skills to make a product that people will buy.  Pushing out the pipeline of work is probably one of the biggest things we need.  I ask the committee to support our campaign to bring people into the construction industry.</p></speech>

I agree with much of their opening statement, particularly in respect of corporate tax receipts.  We have discussed the unexpected and unexplained windfalls that have helped us to plug significant holes in supplementary budgets in the last couple of years.  Last year, there was an overrun of &euro;700 million in health.  If we did not have these corporate tax receipts, we would have been in much more difficulty.  This committee has had a lot of discussion about whether we should bank that money and use it for a rainy-day fund.  The witnesses have suggested that it should be used as a strategic investment fund to ensure capital projects are delivered consistently and are not hampered by any downturns that may come.  We know it is inevitable that there will be a downturn because that is the economic cycle.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on what Mr. Lucey has said about connectivity.  It is interesting that he mentioned this topic.  Irish Rail has just opened a public consultation process with regard to the proposed extension of the western rail corridor, which involves the completion of the second and third phases.  The first phase - the Ennis line - is complete and is up and running.  It is doing very well, contrary to what some people may have predicted about that line.  I would welcome Mr. O'Brien's thoughts on IBEC's position with regard to the second and third phases, into Athenry and Tuam and onto Claremorris.  People in the west of Ireland are very keen to develop the Atlantic economic corridor and the western rail link.  The connectivity about which Mr. Lucey spoke must be part of the bigger picture, which is a longer-term vision for the west and the north west.  How do we connect our major cities and growth hubs?  Under the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040, Sligo has been identified as the growth centre for the north west.  We want the western seaboard to be connected from Galway through Mayo to Sligo and on up to Donegal.  What are IBEC's views on the western rail corridor?  Will it support it?</p></speech>

We believe the forthcoming budget has to stop the pattern of recent years.  This money needs to be put aside for strategic investment in infrastructure, education and innovation.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers asked a specific question about regional infrastructure.  I share Deputy Broughan's sentiment that we need to build a world-class city.  The reality is that Dublin operates in a different division and needs to be funded at that level.  As a national organisation, IBEC believes that too much of this country's economic activity takes place inside the M50.  Over 40% of the country's economic activity is happening inside the M50.  This is suboptimal for Dublin and for the entire country.  For a number of years, we have been advocating an ambition that we should be planning for an all-island population of 10 million people.  Much to many people's surprise, the population of this island has hit 7 million.  When one rounds up the numbers, one will see where the all-island population has gone to.  This is becoming an island of scale.  It is a challenge to make sure the all-island economy is preserved.  It is becoming a market of scale.  Most businesses in construction and other sectors view the all-island market as a single market.  That is the way business predominantly works.</p> <p>  We believe there is a real opportunity to develop the Atlantic economic corridor as a counter-balance to Dublin.  Some of it is already becoming a reality.  We have spoken about the initiatives we have seen in Limerick about how that city is developing.  We see the connectivity piece from an employers' perspective.  Now that Limerick and Galway are connected by motorway and the travel time between them has been reduced to less than 60 minutes, the labour market dynamic between those cities has changed completely.  We can see people in Galway commuting to our companies in Limerick on a daily basis.  We need to make sure that commuting is of a more sustainable nature in the future.  We will still need the road infrastructure.  Our priority for the sequencing of projects is to make progress with a really ambitious Atlantic economic corridor that connects Dublin, Limerick and Galway and extends the whole way up the coast and all the way around to Belfast.  This kind of C-shaped ring will make the all-island economy a reality.  Rail will have a role to play within that, but we need to get the road infrastructure delivered.  Many of our members want opportunities to move commercial and industrial products by rail.  I think this approach will bring us some options, particularly in the context of climate challenge.  Investment in rail, including the electrification of rail, must be part of the solution.  Our ambition for supporting the western arc, particularly the Atlantic economic corridor, is incredibly strong.  The members of our national organisation want to see a greater spread of economic activity.  We cannot do this without investment.</p></speech>

We want a good road network and a decent rail network to give options to citizens.  Reference has been made to the climate issue.  The Government published its climate action plan a couple of days ago.  It is actively exploring the possibility of banning petrol and diesel cars from certain cities.  I am sure Galway will be included.  That is where the opportunity for rail really comes in.  There is an opportunity for commuter services to come from Mayo into Galway to try to get the congestion out of Galway.  This would help some of the businesses represented by IBEC, including those in Parkmore that are facing major congestion issues.  We have discussed this.  It is an ongoing discussion every year.  The industrial estates in Galway cannot get their staff or their products in and out.  We need to take the cars out of the city.  Rail presents an opportunity for us to do that.  Does Mr. O'Brien support the western rail corridor?  Will IBEC support the public consultation by putting in a submission to that effect before the middle of July?</p></speech>

My first point is addressed to Mr. O'Brien.  In its defence, this committee has proactively highlighted the overruns in current expenditure.  It has held hearings on and investigations into how they were being paid for.  We have probably been to the forefront in terms of making some of the points that IBEC got around to making this year.  Last year, Seamus Coffey made a great deal of the base erosion and profit shifting argument and he was quizzed extensively on it.  He was one of the first people I heard refer to this matter.  Interestingly, his view was that it represented a substantial threat to the Irish economy, even greater than Brexit.  He used exactly the same terminology.  His view was that that level of outcome was not as likely, if I remember correctly.  IBEC seems to have prejudged the outcome of the next round.  The Government and the Minister for Finance have worked extensively with the OECD on this.  It is a collective means.  We need to remember that Ireland is not alone in looking at the issue within the OECD context.  The view of certain countries, including the United States, on corporate tax is different from that of some of our EU neighbours.  This is obviously something that is recognised and it is on the Government's agenda as an issue of concern.  It is a matter that the committee has examined.</p> <p>  I wish to make one point to Mr. Lucey about the CIF presentation.  I nearly wondered at one point whether he and his colleagues had read the Project Ireland 2040 document or anything connected to it.  Much of what is in the document refers to curtailing growth in Dublin and shifting growth to the regions.  The CIF, its members and the Government at the time, as Mr. Lucey is well aware, contributed to the lost decade.  That is why it has taken ten years to get infrastructure projects back up and running.  The economy crashed and that is what we have been dealing with.  We forget sometimes that it was due to the efforts of the people of Ireland and the Governments that came after that are economy was restored.  However, we are still coming out of the aftermath of an awful crash.  It is very disappointing when I hear somebody say that their members do not want to grow back to the size they were and that they do not view either the chronic level of housing need that exists and an infrastructure project of the scale of that envisioned in Project Ireland 2040 as enough of an incentive to hire apprentices.  When I hear that, I begin to understand why I would be concerned about making suggestions to my child if I were telling him or her certain apprenticeships.  There are other more dynamic industries.  I hope the CIF submission will include information on research and development and changes.  In comparison with almost any other industry, construction is a complete laggard in terms of reform, changing processes and driving innovation.  If the CIF members shared some of that enthusiasm, it would be far more positive.  I would like to see it in any event.</p></speech>

The industry in which we are involved is cyclical in nature.  A bunch of us have been through these cycles several times.  We never seem to learn from the lessons of the previous cycle.  The cycle we have come through has been incredibly deep.  It really hurt people to the extent that they are extremely cautious now.  Many people went out of business.  When some of the big companies went out of business, their supply chains suffered and they did not get bills paid.  Many people were in trouble.  It is already a low-margin business.  Our main contractors earn profits of between 1% and 3% but they take on extraordinary risks in the context of the projects they undertake.  It only takes a couple of projects to go wrong to put the biggest companies out of business.  It is a very dangerous business from that point of view.</p> <p>  Incredible stuff is going on in construction.  We have people with the can-do and problem-solving attitude.</p></speech>

Our members in the Dublin area are not out of work.  However, if we go around to the regions all we hear is that there is nothing happening.  People are hopping into their cars and driving to Dublin.  They make long journeys into Dublin.  Now, they do not want to come to Dublin any longer.  They say they do not want to put up with the traffic.  They want to get work close to home.  There are many threads to this.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned innovation and the ability to be productive.  Our top 50 companies have 30% of turnover outside of Ireland.  That happens because the big private employers that use our companies rate them to be among the best in the world.  They take them to other countries to do jobs for them rather than using the local industry.  That is an incredible compliment to the people who work in the industry.</p> <p>  We must have a pipeline of work ahead of us at home that allows people to invest.  Right now, they are afraid.  Construction is not a fun business to be in at present.  It tends to get a good deal of negative press.  At the same time, however, when we put our people on site and we want to solve a problem, it is clear the sector is full of problem-solvers.  The difficulty is that the lead-in period to work commencing is so long.  I wish Deputy Lisa Chambers the best and I encourage her to push hard.  It will happen, but it is not going to happen quickly because that is the nature of the system.  We need to learn that in order to make things happen, we have to press the button early.  Each time we get to the end of a cycle, telephone calls come into the CIF from different politicians asking where the shovel-ready projects are.  There is no such thing as a shovel-ready project without four or five years of lead-in work to make it so.  The people who make these decisions are those holding the purse strings.  They allow the engineering, surveys and consultations and so on to take place on projects in order to enable them to become shovel-ready.</p></speech>

In the space of a year there has been a significant political change on global corporate tax.  When Seamus Coffey referred to the CCCTB, there was little chance of it ever happening purely because, as he said, we had a veto at European level, as did other member states.  At the OECD in the BEPS process, there is no veto.  In effect, power talks.  On those proposals which are risky for Ireland, every large country is on one side of the table while a handful of smaller countries, along with ourselves, are on the other side saying we need to make it work for small countries.  As Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Brien said in his opening statement, fundamentally, this is not about closing loopholes but about who pays tax where.  Big countries want more money paid into their exchequers because that is where the consumers are.  The politics of BEPS has changed significantly.  In particular, the US position on tax has changed enormously over the past year.  We would have regarded the US as being on our side of the table, along with Germany.  Those two countries have switched sides over the past year.</p> <p>  I would put high odds on there being an agreement at the OECD with two outcomes.  No matter the results of the negotiations, some of our tax under pillar 1 will go to other countries.  We reckon that could be as high as &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion in a worst-case scenario.

It is something for this committee to worry about because we have five years to get our act together in how we pay for this.</p> <p>  The other pillar is the minimum tax proposal.  It would effectively mean that there would be a global minimum corporate tax rate.  If one paid 12.5% here and the global tax rate was to be 15%, other countries would have the right to reach into the Irish company to take out that extra 2.5%.  In effect, it would mean the end of the attractiveness of the 12.5% rate.  There is still much debate to go.  It could end up being fairly benign if it is a low number, say less than 10%.  However, we have heard numbers as high as 18% and 20%.  There is still a long way to go but the big shift in the dynamic is that large countries want an agreement because the alternative is that countries will implement this unilaterally without an agreement.  That would be even worse.  We think there is significant risk but we have time to get ready for that.  That means investing in innovation, education and small and medium-sized enterprises to rebalance the economy.</p></speech>

I sit on the tax committee for business on the OECD and those are the kinds of numbers we are hearing.  For example, the US has already a minimum rate of 13% through its GILTI, global intangible low tax income, tax proposal.  It is unlikely to want to go much lower than that.  We are probably proposing a lower rate than that.  However, the power dynamic is difficult and there is a significant challenge for Ireland.  Some of our traditional allies on these issues have moved to the other side.  We need to prepare for it.</p></speech>

Along with my departmental colleague, Dr. D&oacute;nal Palcic, we specialise in infrastructure-related research into aspects of public procurement, including public private partnerships, PPPs.  We thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it this afternoon.  A detailed briefing note has been submitted to the committee and I will summarise some of the main points in this opening statement.  I wish to emphasise that we have had no direct involvement or advisory role in the NBP procurement.  Our access to information has been confined to that which has been placed in the public domain, much of which has been heavily redacted.  We wish to state upfront that having observed events and analysed documentation that is publicly available, we have formed the view that the procurement approach adopted has not satisfied the criteria necessary to ensure that the key objective of value for money will be achieved.  As the committee is aware, the procurement model being used for the NBP is a gap funding model which is essentially a type of public private partnership.</p> <p>  I will now examine the features of the PPP model and relate them back to the NBP.  PPPs can be defined as long-term infrastructure contracts between the State and a private contractor.  The main characteristics of a typical infrastructure PPP include: competition for contracts; bundling of the different stages of the project life cycle into one contract; risk transfer to the private sector; and a significant element of private finance.  Although the gap funding model possesses those characteristics it differs from other PPPs used in Ireland to date since ownership of the infrastructure will remain with the private contractor at the end of the contractual period.</p> <p>  The principal economic justification for adopting a PPP is that it provides scope for achieving value for money, VFM.  However, the achievement of VFM, in turn, depends critically on what may be referred to as key VFM drivers.  The main VFM drivers are competition for contracts and risk transfer and I wish to discuss both in the context of the NBP.  The importance of competition for contracts cannot be over-emphasised.  Competition creates incentives for bidders to reduce costs and delays and to develop proposals of higher quality.  The recommendation in favour of the gap funding model was based on the assumption that the market for the contract would be competitive.  However, once SIRO and Eir withdrew from the process the principal justification for continuing the procurement no longer applied.</p><p>In general, the potential negative consequences of continuing with an uncompetitive procurement are opportunistic behaviour by the bidder during contract negotiations, leading to price increases, and renegotiations after the contract is signed.  The international evidence on public private partnerships, PPPs, shows that these problems frequently materialise when competition for contracts is absent.  In this context, it is worth considering whether the evidence suggests that the lack of competition for the NBP contract has impacted on the project costs to date.  One development that raises suspicions in this respect is the substantial increase in projected costs that will arise due to the preferred bidder rolling out fibre in the 300,000 premises area that Eir carved out of the initial intervention area.  Would this have been agreed if there was real competition for the contract?  </p><p> Optimal risk transfer is one of the main drivers of value for money in PPP projects.  The available information indicates that the preferred bidder for the NBP will take on significant risk, particularly in terms of construction, operating and revenue risk.  I wish to focus on financial risk.  It is typical in privately financed PPPs for financial risk to be assumed by investors that contribute equity and loans to the PPP.  Both providers have skin in the game and this incentivises them to ensure that contractual obligations are met.  In the case of the NBP, we eventually learned that the level of private equity is &euro;220 million.  This is not a trivial sum of money, but it accounts for a very low percentage of total project costs.  The concerns expressed by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, were relevant in this regard when he noted that by 2028 the private bidder will have recouped most of its investment while the State will have invested &euro;2.44 billion at that stage.  In addition, the gap funding model for the NBP differs from earlier PPPs in Ireland as it appears that the special purpose vehicle is not borrowing significant amounts from banks or international capital markets.  Rather, it appears that it will work on a cashflow basis and rely on payments from the Exchequer as the project progresses.  As a result, unlike other privately financed PPPs, this gap funding model approach will not possess the advantages that arise from the due diligence and close monitoring of all aspects of the deal by experienced lenders.  Overall, it appears that some of the risk-sharing advantages that typically apply to PPP projects do not apply in this procurement model, which increases concerns that the procurement will not deliver value for money.</p><p> I wish to make some points about governance aspects of the NBP.  I will preface my comments by stating that the international evidence consistently shows that accountability and transparency are the critical conditions that must be satisfied if good governance is to be achieved.  There have been several problems with the governance of the NBP.  On the project appraisal stage of the NBP, I wish to highlight that there is very limited information about the cost-benefit analysis, CBA, in the public domain and the available data do not include detailed breakdowns of valuations, assumptions, etc.  It is reassuring that the CBA has been scrutinised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but the fact that the Department concluded that "the CBA is not credible and it is questionable whether it is consistent with the public spending code" is a matter of significant concern.  On the choice of procurement model, the principal point I wish to emphasise is that the financial appraisals underpinning the choice of the gap funding model are not publicly available.  It is not clear if these were subject to independent scrutiny by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the National Development Finance Agency, for example.  Nevertheless, I recommend that these be published in order to improve the accountability of key decision makers.</p><p> The governance problems witnessed during the procurement process have been widely discussed.  In economic terms, the fundamental weakness has been the decision to continue the process with one bidder.  Other issues have arisen regarding the changes in composition of the bidder&rsquo;s consortium, the drip feed of information about key aspects of the procurement, including the precise level of equity being invested by the preferred bidder, and controversy around interactions between the relevant Minister and investors in the consortium behind the remaining bid.  Overall, the governance problems that have arisen are such that the procurement lacks the required level of legitimacy, thereby eroding public confidence in the process.  There are legitimate concerns about the overall justification for the project, the chosen procurement model and the potential cost of the project and knock-on effects for other investment priorities.  It is our considered view that the current procurement should be terminated and more affordable alternatives explored.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Palcic, whose statement will build on the points I have raised.</p></speech>

I will summarise some of my main concerns.</p> <p>  One of the most important and controversial aspects of the debate surrounding the plan to date relates to the gap funding model that has been adopted.  A number of the assumptions made in the KPMG 2015 ownership report that underpinned this decision were questionable at best and appear even more dubious now, given the events that have unfolded since.  The original assumptions underpinning the recommendation of the gap funding model were essentially that placing the long-term ownership of the network with the private sector would allow bidders to leverage the use of their existing infrastructure and encourage them to continue to invest in the network to develop and exploit new markets; and that the aforementioned benefits would be reflected in the strategic value that bidders would place on winning the contract, thereby driving down the amount of subsidy required in a competitive tendering process.  Strong competition among existing industry players is highlighted by KPMG as one of the key drivers behind its estimation that the gap funding model would achieve the lowest cost to the Exchequer.  However, it is difficult to understand how KPMG could assume a strong level of competition when only Eir and SIRO could realistically be considered as having the ability to leverage their existing assets to deliver the NBP at a lower cost to the public purse.  Moreover, at the time that KPMG was making its recommendation, Eir had already announced plans to invest in approximately 300,000 premises within the intervention area.  The risk of Eir moving forward with its plans and the impact that this would have on the fundamental nature of the plan appear to have been ignored when the decision to proceed with the gap funding model was made in July 2016.</p> <p>  A number of the assumptions in respect of the other ownership options examined by KPMG are highly questionable.  For example, it stated that the design, build, finance, operate, maintain, DBFOM, option would involve significant additional subsidy as a result of the Government being likely to seek step-in rights to operate the network in the event of contract termination.  The fact that step-in rights will be built into the current contract with Granahan McCourt calls into question why KPMG assumed the cost of such rights would occur only in the DBFOM option.</p> <p>  In order to fully assess all the assumptions made by KPMG in its ownership report, it is imperative that the financial appraisal underpinning its analysis be published in full.  Without such transparency, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the assumptions made were engineered to deliver a recommendation for the gap funding model only, especially given the belief at the time that it could achieve an off-balance sheet accounting and budgeting treatment.</p> <p>  A critical juncture in the NBP procurement process was the signing in April 2017 of a commitment deal with Eir to remove 300,000 premises from the intervention area.  This development had grave consequences relating to competition for the contract and the cost of subsidy.  In terms of subsidy, the original estimated budget for the plan was between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  We know from KPMG&rsquo;s single bidder solution assessment report published in December 2018 that the estimated subsidy for the plan in April 2017 after the removal of Eir&rsquo;s 300,000 premises was &euro;787 million.  What remains unclear is the exact cause of the increase in the cost of subsidy since then.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and KPMG have recently stated that when Eir and Granahan McCourt submitted detailed solution submissions in September 2017, both bids included significantly higher levels of subsidy than the Department's budget model.  We have not been given any detail as to why the bids submitted were far higher than expected.  Since Eir withdrew from the competition it appears that the cost of subsidy to the Exchequer has increased further.</p> <p>  KPMG&rsquo;s 2018 report highlights how the major contributing factors to the increase in subsidy requested by Granahan McCourt are the decision to move from renting Eir&rsquo;s wholesale network in the 300,000 premises area to the NBP co-deploying its own fibre in that area, and an increase in the blended equity internal rate of return, IRR, reflecting an assumed higher level of risk.  Although Analysys Mason touched on this issue when it appeared before the committee last week, there are still serious questions regarding exactly how much additional cost is being incurred as a result of the decision to roll out a parallel fibre network in the 300,000 premises area and why Granahan McCourt is being allowed to do so.  The Department needs to clarify if this is being done purely so that Granahan McCourt can connect back to the metropolitan area networks for its backhaul needs and what the comparative cost of using Eir&rsquo;s regulated wholesale network and backhaul services would have been.  Unless the Department can provide convincing answers for why Eir&rsquo;s fibre cannot be used, it is difficult to see this as anything other than a very costly duplication of infrastructure paid for by the Irish taxpayer.</p> <p>  I wish to conclude on some issues relating to governance of the NBP.  The success or otherwise of the plan will critically depend on the appropriate implementation and governance of the final contract.  We have been told that an in-house unit will be established within the Department to monitor the contract and will require a budget of up to &euro;10 million per annum which will cover up to ten permanent civil servants and support by specialist external advisers.  However, given the sheer complexity and scale of the contract, it is worth asking how realistic the proposed budget is in terms of ensuring the appropriate level of governance and oversight that will be required.</p> <p>  Outside of the cost implications of establishing a largescale governance and regulatory structure for the plan within the Department, the decision to so do also had a significant impact on the competitive tension for the contract.  For example, one of the stated reasons for Eir&rsquo;s withdrawal from the competition was the fact that it would have to provide access to its network at prices below the regulated level set by ComReg in the intervention area.  As a regulated entity, Eir must ensure equivalence all over the country and would therefore be forced to offer access to its network across the country at the same lower intervention area price if it was awarded the contract.  Another factor affecting the incentives for Eir to bid for the contract was the restriction that winning the contract would impose on its wholesale market activities.  If it won the contract, its wholesale division, Open Eir, would not be allowed to sell wholesale products in the intervention area, whereas other operators would be allowed to offer wholesale products across the country, including the intervention area.</p><p>While the logic behind such clear lines of separation is understandable, the fact that Eir is already regulated by ComReg across the country but the Department has proposed setting up a separate regulatory structure for the intervention area with conflicting requirements for access prices, for example, made it very difficult for Eir to continue with its bid.  This again calls into question how KPMG and the Department could have assumed that there would be strong competition for the contract from bidders such as Eir that would drive down the cost of subsidy to the Government.  Our briefing note raises a number of other concerns that we have with the procurement process to date.  Professor Reeves and I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our observations and we would be happy to take any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

With regard to our experience, we have written a book about the privatisation experienced in Ireland which was largely centred on the story of Eircom.  That was published in 2011.  We subsequently published peer-reviewed papers on telecoms policy arising from the privatisation of Eircom which prompted much of our interest in this area.

We have published different peer-reviewed papers and, as Professor Reeves mentioned, a book on privatisation in Ireland.  That largely related to Eircom and the telecoms sector in Ireland.  From that point of view, with regard to policy and ownership-level regulation, I would say that we have a good bit of experience.</p></speech>

The documents and executive summaries they have provided set out a very clear picture.  There is very little further to question them on.  They have made it clear, using their academic position and experience in procurement, that while the process that was undertaken may have started out as a sound endeavour and there was a certain context to the gap funding model, it effectively evaporated as soon as the other potential bidders pulled out.  We have been concerned about that for some time in the committee.  From a policy perspective, it is clear that the tender process and consultative dialogue process should have halted at that point and we would not be in the mess we are in if it had halted at that stage.  It seems that if one follows the process and the position of the Department and Government, they just did not want this to fail.  It could not fail because it was too important even when all the fundamentals that underpinned the particular process had changed.  The top line issue of getting a broadband service to consumers in the intervention area was such that they had to keep going, which leaves us in a difficult position.</p> <p>  Professor Reeves spoke about opportunistic behaviour and the potential for such behaviour when there is no competition in the process.  That is certainly something that we identified here and the witnesses identified it with regard to the parallel building of the network.  Based on their examination of the information that has been published, do the witnesses have any idea what the additional cost of building the network out over the existing network, rather than splicing into it, would have been?</p> <p>  With regard to state aid rules, I acknowledge that the witnesses may not have expertise in this area.  Are they concerned that the additional taxpayer-funded network being rolled out in the area with 300,000 premises may not comply with state aid rules?  Do they believe that a contractual agreement can be put in place that will prevent the final bidder from using its network in that area?</p> <p>  I will leave it at that because the witnesses have given an exceptionally comprehensive and useful presentation.</p></speech>

We have no idea what the additional cost will be given that it is always redacted but it is clear that it is much higher than the Department's budget model, which assumed that it would be renting Eir's wholesale fibre product.  If one reads through Analysys Mason's technical assessment report and KPMG's single bidder solution assessment report from 2018, they highlight many other areas where there is an increased cost as a result of a redesigned network and redesigned solution being put forward by Granahan McCourt.  There is obviously a substantial additional cost and the extra fibre that will have to be laid will increase the timeframe.  That is partly why we have gone from a five year to a seven year roll-out.  There are other issues relating to the technology that has been chosen.  It is using next generation technology for optical equipment, which is different from what the Department had assumed would be the case, whereby the current technology would be refreshed in five to seven years as the industry evolves.</p></speech>

One of the reasons given for using the gap funding model was that the benefit to the State would be that the ultimate winner would continue to invest in the technology.  Dr. Palcic is saying that because there is no competition, Granahan McCourt is getting the latest generation of technology right now, funded by the taxpayer, rather than being funded from within the business.</p></speech>

It seems that to get the up-front capital expenditure, Granahan McCourt is putting in more advanced technology now, which means that the refresh will happen later in the 2020s.  Considering that such low take-up is projected in the early years, gold-plating the technology that it is putting in right now when it is assuming very low take-up would, according to Analysys Mason, represent a 25% additional cost compared with putting in the current technology when it is up and running with take-up increasing in the future.  It could then do the typical refresh that any other Internet service provider would do in the mid-2020s and fund that from user revenues rather than from subsidised capital expenditure.  If there was more competitive tension in the process, the company may have been forced to go with the lower cost capital expenditure to try to win the bid.</p></speech>

This is exactly what our fear was when we first learned that the process was down to one bidder.  That is exactly how it is playing out.</p></speech>

The witnesses are clear that the competitive tension would have arisen in the latter stages of the process and usually as part of the final bid price, but that did not happen.</p></speech>

One must also take into account that while the Department appears to have a good handle on the costs, the other side of the equation is the revenues.  It was in the mix between the cost and the revenues that the competitive tension would play out.  That is where one would expect to get the advantages that underpin the gap funding model.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.</p></speech>

When one speaks to Department officials and others, they say we do not understand that the developer in this case is taking on significant revenue risk.  I do not know whether our guests have assessed that.  It is difficult because we are all working with blacked-out sections of documents.  Have they examined it in any way to assess where the risk resides?</p></speech>

It is fair to say we have been told, and provided with a specimen contract to the effect that if the revenues are higher than projected, there will be a clawback.  In that sense, the developer takes on risk but it also takes on the downside risk.  If the revenues do not accrue, the developer will be penalised within the contract on that basis, which is important.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, we need to take into account a few general aspects of risk, of which there is a great deal.  At the initial stages, I assume that the developer ran risk workshops to identify at least ten or 20 risks, worked out the probabilities of them occurring and placed values on them.  We mentioned construction operating revenue but there are other risks.  An important factor in risk transfer is that it is central to the value-for-money argument in favour of PPP.  What is in the contract is not necessarily what materialises when the contract is up and running and managed.  An interesting lesson emerged from the schools PPPs, where it was identified that in the first three years of the schools' running, the management of the contracts were such that they were not really up to scratch and risk transfer was not imposed in reality, that is, with penalties imposed for poor performance and so on.</p> <p>  That brings us to the question of how the contracts will be governed.  In the case of schools' PPPs, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, took over the management of the contracts.  I am curious about where the NDFA has been in respect of broadband.  It is a specialist PPP procurement agency.  The PPPs that have caused the most problems in the country are those that were not procured by the NDFA but rather by individual Departments, such as that of Department of Education and Skills in the case of the schools projects.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment procured the incinerator project and, now, the national broadband plan.  The question is where the NDFA is.  I acknowledge that it played an advisory role but in the overall governance plans for what happened in respect of appraisal and so on, it is a question that needs to be asked and should certainly be addressed.  </p></speech>

I cannot remember whether representatives from the Department, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council or others made the point that one of the downsides of PPPs is that much higher costs for money must be paid when compared with when the State funds a project.  That is on the basis that there would be efforts in capital markets to issue a bond or raise lending, which, as Professor Reeves noted, would be a more standard PPP model.  In this instance, it is probably even yet more expensive because a return on equity will be the payment rather than a return on capital.  It means we will cover the capital costs.  We do not know the figure for the return on investment but it is likely to be even higher than what it would be if it was a more standard PPP project.</p></speech>

Given that such a small amount of equity - &euro;220 million, or less than 1% of the overall project costs - will be provided, the rest of it will be financed by the Exchequer.  In that regard, it will not suffer from the cost disadvantage that would previously have applied in the case of PPPs, where they were entirely privately financed, usually at a equity-to-debt ratio of 1:9.  Those PPPs probably had a higher cost.</p> <p>  As I outlined, the concern is that the degree of equity is so low that it will pull the rug from under the mechanisms that should drive the advantages of a PPP model, such as a gap funding model.  Developers just do not have enough skin in the game.</p></speech>

In a sense, the ultimate risk for the State is that if the problem goes wrong, it will carry the large capital-cost risk.  If there was at least a private financing element, the banks or their bondholders would carry some of the risk cost, in the event of it terminating.</p></speech>

When Carillion went bust in January 2018, the banks and the private sector took the risk.  At the time there was much panic because the schools were not opening, which showed that the ultimate risk taker is always the service user.  When Carillion went into bankruptcy, the Government and the NDFA were managing the project and were in a position to stand back and let it be resolved within the special purpose vehicle.  Eventually, a cost was paid by the service user but that will not apply in this case.</p></speech>

In many ways, that is similar to what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform advocates.  Does Professor Reeves have any suggestions as to how more affordable alternatives might work?

I have read what the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has proposed as a "plan Z".  To a large degree, I can understand where it is coming from.  Two words in the proposal that struck me are "budget led".  In other words, it will be affordable.  The Department has suggested that the large escalation in the costs of the project mean there will be an opportunity cost.  Other projects within the national development plan will have to be forgone.  That should not happen under the more modest concerns with the plan the Department has put forward.</p> <p>  On whether my colleague or I have specific plans or proposals, I cannot come up with something better than the Department.  Dr. Palcic might like to contribute.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's proposal seems to be the more realistic and would allow for the time to retender a more State-led approach.</p> <p>  On the revenue risk, as I mentioned, in the report by Analysys Mason, it appears that Granahan McCourt is being very conservative in what it expects the demand to be, especially in the early years.  It will, of course, have to bear some of the risk in respect of how many people it connects as it rolls out broadband, meets its various deployment targets and receives its subsidy payments.  As well as a higher internal rate of return, it is building into its cost model many different margins in respect of labour, the capital expenditure and the various aspects that subcontractors will carry out on its behalf.  The Analysys Mason and KPMG reports, however, state such margins will impose significant additional costs.  Granahan McCourt is covering itself as much as possible by taking on the risk.</p></speech>

My concerns relate to the cost to the taxpayer; the risk to the public finances; the total absence of competition, given that there is now only one bidder; the fact that the owner will ultimately be the investor; the subsidy and the 340,000 households and premises to be connected by Eir; and the governance.</p><p>What is set out in the plan for National Broadband Ireland is a structure whereby one person will be representing the investor who puts in 95% of the cash upfront, which is the taxpayer, and there will be eight representing the outfit that puts in 5%.</p><p> In light of his comments that he has extensive experience of PPPs - this project is a PPP of sorts - has Dr. Palcic ever seen a PPP such as this and was it a success?  Dr. Palcic also referred to the NDFA and stated that it would normally be involved in major projects.  Ministers have indicated time and again in the D&aacute;il and in these rooms that this is the biggest tendering process ever undertaken by the State.  It is an absolutely massive project and the scale has increased in the context of costs.  Is there any reason the Government would not hand this over to the NDFA?  According to replies I received to parliamentary questions, up to 80 people have been working on this in the Department for a number of years.  I suspect that there are bale loads of information, such as tender, legal and procurement documents, and that the entire process is bogged down in a quagmire.  Can Dr. Palcic think of any reason the project would not go to the NDFA?</p></speech>

KPMG's ownership report looked at other countries and the only other gap-funding model that was used as a case study was the Broadband Delivery UK programme.  One of the central criticisms in the KPMG report relates to the lack of competitive tension in that programme in the early stages.  It was just down to one bidder every time in terms of lots, and BT won it.  The report effectively states that one has to ensure competition in order for the gap-funding model to work.  Just last night, Indecon's review of the national broadband scheme, which was carried out in November 2017, was published on the Department's website.  The national broadband scheme involved 3, which won the contract to roll out mobile broadband 3G technology to rural areas that otherwise could not get broadband.  That scheme used the gap-funding model but on a much smaller scale.  The amount involved was approximately &euro;200 million, of which the State provided &euro;80 million through capital expenditure and it received &euro;36 million back from the European Regional Development Fund.</p> <p>  Indecon's recommendations on the gap-funding model are instructive in this regard.  Indecon indicates that the calculation of strategic value is central to all of this in terms of the subsidy that is required.  One would hope to have the revenues and costs estimated somewhat accurately, and then there is the strategic value that the bidders will attach to the fact that, because of the gap-funding model, the network remains in private ownership at the end of the process.  Indecon has stated that it is extremely difficult for Government to come up with a figure when estimating this strategic value and that the only way to ensure that the figure is more accurate is to have strong, competitive tension in the whole process.  This review has only been published now.  It took a bit of pushing; I submitted a freedom of information request for it last March and there was a delay in the report coming out.  Part of this is probably due to that recommendation.  Indecon zeroed in on the strategic value and pretty much stated that coming up with the figure in that regard was dubious.  The KPMG ownership report assumes the strategic value in its financial appraisal, which has not been published.  That drives the recommendation of the gap-funding model.  This is the major difference between it and all the other ownership options.  KPMG has assumed similar costs and revenues for the public ownership model but states that the difference, along with some of the start-up costs, is the strategic value and the estimate on that.  The gap funding model has already been used in the national broadband scheme.  The recommendation is that it is all about competition and especially in a telecoms sector where there is a lot of uncertainty regarding market developments, potential competition and technological developments.  When all of that complexity is in the mix, one wants a very carefully designed mechanism, which is the recommendation coming from Indecon.</p></speech>

I would have recommended that the NDFA be involved in the appraisal, especially the financial appraisal, but instead KPMG was contracted to do it.  I would also have suggested that the NDFA should have been involved to a large degree in the procurement of the project.  Again, it is too late for that now.</p> <p>  In general, it is a good idea for the governance of infrastructure projects to see separation between the agencies that take care of the different stages of procurement.  It does not always happen, even internationally.  We are witnessing the fact that the Department does not want to let go of this project.  It has invested so much time and so many resources - internally and in hiring outside consultants - and the project has run on for years.  There is a huge reluctance, institutionally and at a particular level, to change tack.  Unfortunately, this appears to be where matters stand.  If I had a blank page and I was to suggest how to improve governance going forward, a good way of doing it would be to separate the roles of the agency that sponsors the project, which is the Department, with the agency that conducts the appraisal, which is the cost-benefit analysis and the financial analyses such as value-for-money assessments.  That role would need to be separated again between the agency that procures the project and a separate agency to manage it thereafter.  This would avoid the kind of rut the project has gotten into now.  This is just a suggestion.</p> <p>  I mentioned the resources that have been expended on this project and I expect it has been a lot of resources.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, made reference to a figure at the committee's meeting last week.  A lot of resources were spent on the cost-benefit analysis but, unfortunately, we do not have the details in the public domain in order that we might interrogate that  analysis.  I find it very difficult to understand how the bottom-line figures have changed so much.  It is good that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has scrutinised this and held the consultants to account on the assumptions that underpinned some of the cost-benefit analyses.  After the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had consulted, the benefits were reduced in the region of &euro;1 billion, but suddenly the costs went down due to an error that had been recurring throughout the whole process but had not been spotted.  When I learned of this, I found it very difficult to understand.  It calls into question how, generally speaking, we govern different stages of big procurement projects like this and who we rely on to do so.  Not relying on State agencies such as the NDFA with its built up expertise is hard to fathom.</p></speech>

In his submission, Professor Reeves stated that the current procurement process should be terminated and a more affordable alternative should be explored.  Would the ESB or a model based on ESB Networks be a viable alternative?  I ask this in the spirit of trying to be helpful and to move the matter further along.  Given Dr. Palcic's experience of studying PPPs and his broader experience in procurement processes, and considering that we have been told that a lot of the heavy lifting has been done in the context of detailed analysis and so on - there have been 80 people working hard on this so there is a lot of information, experience and learning already built up - generally speaking, do our guests believe that we could complete a competitive tender and procurement process within one year or so?  I have a related query that may tie the three pieces together.</p><p>The witnesses are familiar with the negotiated procedure without prior public notice that can be used.

My understanding is that if the ESB were to be brought in, that would have to be under competitive conditions.  On the feasibility of using the ESB, I understand from the deliberations of the committee that there are issues regarding the viability of using the ESB's infrastructure.  I will not get into the details, which have previously been discussed.  Ideally, the State should lever the network infrastructure of the companies it owns, such as the ESB, Ervia and so on.  I wish it were possible to turn back the clock and that the Government had run with the original option to build a national broadband company as stated in the NewERA plan published in the run-up to the 2011 general election.  However, that ship has sailed.</p></speech>

It effectively encircled many villages, towns and areas of significant residential development in rural areas.  This was of significant concern to me at the time.  Some 340,000 homes and premises are now being serviced in those areas and that appears to have derailed the whole procurement process.  Is that the reason for the other two bidders pulling out?  Is it the reason for the cost of the subsidy to fill that gap increasing from slightly less than &euro;800 million to &euro;3 billion?  The gap is &euro;2.95 billion.</p></speech>

As they were probably the most commercially viable premises, would have been connected in any fibre roll-out and would have been the initial revenues on which one would have relied, it definitely had an impact on the cost of subsidy.  It removed a big chunk of potential revenue and that was revenue which would have been more quickly gathered in terms of the deployment.</p></speech>

The state aid rules and report for this plan indicate that if the ESB or any other commercial operator has plans to invest in the intervention area within the next two years, it will not qualify for state aid.  The Government cannot provide any other State-subsidised investment in that area.  When Eir progressed its plans, there was no choice but to sign a commitment deal.  In summer 2015, before a contract notice was issued, Eir stated that when it was finished its urban investment roll-out programme, it would move on to the 300,000 premises.  It seems to me from speaking to various people that there may have been a calculation by the Department that that may have been a bluff or some way of Eir trying to insert itself into that position.  The Department called Eir's bluff by going ahead with the full tender.  Once Eir followed through on its plans and talked to the Directorate-General for Competition or the European Commission, there was simply no choice as a commitment deal must be signed if it is to invest as a private operator in the intervention area.</p></speech>

In the document and their presentations, they put considerable focus on ownership of the network, which is reasonable.  In their extensive submission they refer to schools and road projects and use them as a kind of benchmark.  In their analysis, did they apply the same assumptions to the fibre broadband network as they might to a school or hospital?  Breaking this down, what lifespan does fibre wire have?  How does that compare to the lifespan of a school or hospital?  In that regard, is it a valid comparison?  Where is the value of the comparison?  What is the value of fibre when it sits on rented Eir poles?  These are very pertinent, real and practical questions to which the taxpayers would like answers.  What value will the fibre have after 25 years, including 25 Irish winters?  What would the depreciated value of this fibre and communications infrastructure be after 25 years?  In other words, what end product will we have after 25 years?  I am not referring to the KPMG analysis of its other values, but, rather, to the physical value of the infrastructure.  To what extent will reinvestment in the network be necessary after 25 years, keeping in mind the lifespan of the infrastructure?  What level of reinvestment will be necessary for the following ten years?  That is a key question.  To continue the analogy, although some maintenance work might be required in a small school or hospital after 25 years, much more significant replacement of fibre and telecommunications infrastructure could be required.  The comparison does not fully stand up in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that he estimates the turnover of National Broadband Ireland will reach a peak of &euro;150 million.  That is one tenth of the current turnover of Eir.  KPMG suggested that its peak turnover may be less than &euro;150 million.  Is this a valuable asset for the State to own after 25 years?  It is a great popular and populist concept to get out there and people identify with this kind of thing and believe we may miss out on something of great benefit to the State in 25 years.  I would like a little quantification of that in the context of the figures put forward by the Minister.</p></speech>

Have they looked at how that model worked there?  That would be a valid comparative study.  In fact, it would be the most valid comparison.  A previous witness told the committee that in the UK, BT initially assessed a 20% take-up in the early years of the service, but the actual take-up was 40%.</p><p>This resulted in the Government being able to claw back a total of &euro;700 million.  Is a series of clawbacks not a good protection for the State?  Does it not outweigh anything we might talk about in the context of a reversion of the asset at that point?  Would it not be far more significant for us to be getting that clawback?  My belief is intuitive and instinctive, and is based on my own professional background, anecdotal evidence and observation.  The demand for the service will increase exponentially.  I did a bit of history in the past.  Initially there was almost a fear of the electric light and there was a limited take-up.  Subsequently, the level of take-up skyrocketed and only total flat-earthers and people living on the margins of society as a result of various social vulnerabilities were left without electricity at the end of the process.  I expect a similar process here, although, when saying that, I am gazing into a crystal ball.  Based on the UK experience, could we not have optimism in that regard and in respect of the clawback?  If our guests want me to repeat any of those questions, I will do so but I think they have them.  For each of my questions there is a taxpayer who wants to know the answer.</p></speech>

When they went through the different ownership options, there were initially five options on the table but the detailed analysis was of just two.  One was the DBFOM model and the other was the gap-funding model.  The DBFOM model is that which is used for schools and roads and the key difference between the two models is ownership of the asset at the end.  The reason-----</p></speech>

That was the reason the model was chosen.  That is why we brought it in, just for the purposes of comparison.</p> <p>  On the question of ownership of network infrastructure, I take on board a number of the points the Senator made.  However, I am always mindful of the experience with the Eircom privatisation and the decision made back then to divest full State ownership of vital telecoms infrastructure.  We would not be here today if the decision in that regard had not been made.  Governments should be extremely careful about giving up vital network infrastructure, be it roads, telecoms or electricity infrastructure.  For that reason alone, I would be loath to recommend to Government that it opt for something like the gap-funding model, not only because the justification for it is not very strong, particularly in view of the points that have been made, but also because giving up vital network infrastructure is not necessarily in the strategic interests of any country.  That is how I would respond to those two points.</p></speech>

If the residual value of the network is higher in the future, then there will be a clawback to the State.  We do not know what is that estimated residual value.</p> <p>  The Senator and Deputy Eamon Ryan asked a series of questions on the lifespan of fibre.  I do not think people yet know what will be the full lifespan of fibre.  ComReg applied a 20-year lifespan in the context of the depreciation rates.

Rather than just the cost of the piece of cable or whatever, the value is actually the monopoly access which is being supported to build that pool of customers, which will really drive the future valuation.</p><p>The Department's expectation is that in approximately ten years 80% of the 542,000 premises will have signed up to the network.

Assuming the high level of take-up outlined by Deputy Dooley, do the witnesses accept that the clawback will achieve the taxpayers' requirements, as happened in the UK?  When Deputy Dooley was out of the room I made that the point that in the UK whereas BT anticipated 20% take-up of the service, it was 40%.  In his absence, I was drawing the analogy of rural electrification.  I think we are only at the margins in terms of this service in that there will be huge take-up of it.</p></speech>

The clawbacks are meant to ensure that the contractor continues to invest in the network that it will ultimately own.  While this clawback sounds good, in essence, it was never included to benefit the State.  Rather, it is a methodology of ensuring that the contractor does not cream off the profits while the contract is ongoing.</p></speech>

In this case, the difficulty is the risk in terms of take-up because almost three quarters of the population have been already serviced.  I was in a townland recently where there are 56 houses, 40 of which have been serviced in the past month or two by a private operator via a radio signal.  </p> <p>  I am fascinated with the discussion about the value after 25 years.  The Government, the Department and those defending this process have advised us that there are built-in obligations for the technology and the fibre to be kept up to scratch.  In terms of comparisons, the motorways are to return to State ownership after 25 years but this asset will not come back to the State.  If the motorway is not resurfaced every two years and maintained in terms of drainage there will not be much of a motorway to get back.  The difference is that the taxpayer's buy-in was less.  I am not happy with some of the motorway contracts, particularly the contract for the N7, which I think is a bit dodgy, not in the sense that anybody set out to do anything wrong but in that its terms were not good for the taxpayer.  I will give another example.  Various private companies have flipped Eir in the 20 years since it was first privatised.  It was sold recently to a French investor, who paid billions of euro for it despite the fact that half of the poles are falling over in the ditches.  To say that a telecommunications network or a broadband network would not be valuable at the end of 25 years is ridiculous.  Taking what the Government has told us regarding the compulsory mechanisms built into the contract to ensure that the investor and operator will maintain, upgrade and renew cables and so on over the 25 years, this network will be very valuable.  When one adds to that the point made by Deputy Dooley that it has the customer base cornered in the 542,000 intervention area this will be a very valuable asset after 25 years.  That is my contention.</p></speech>

Nobody is going to want to do that with an asset of this value.  If the operator does want to walk away, it cannot flip the asset under the contract.  Assuming that after a set number of years it could flip it, the company buying it would have a commercial imperative and an imperative to its bank to keep it going.  One could make the argument that the people who own the Shelbourne Hotel could walk away some day and run it down in the interim.  Surely, they would want the hotel to be in a state which allows them to move it on.  The people who buy it will have bankers who make sure they maintain it.  I would have thought the same would apply here.</p></speech>

The main reason for using the gap model was for a different set of considerations, which was it would drive down the subsidy because it was expected the winning bidder would exploit the advantages of owning the infrastructure in the long term.</p></speech>

I do not believe the point was made that there is any guarantee the investor will sweat the asset and run.  We did not make that statement.  That was not in our opening statement or in our detailed brief.  The truth is that we do not know.  Nobody knows what will happen in terms of changing technology and the value of the asset at the end of the day.  No one ever said that we did know.   It is up to the people who are involved in the contract to do their best to try to factor this into the agreement.  The problem is that what is in the agreement will be set in stone to a degree.  One of the downsides of using a PPP type model is that one loses a bit of flexibility when there is a lock-in to a 25-year contract.  That is another aspect we did not mention.</p></speech>

They are looking at a 20 to 25-year period.  On the question of whether it will be worth anything in 25 years, Deputy O'Connell does not know, I do not know and the Department does not know.  We simply cannot answer that question.  We have not suggested and nobody else that I am aware of has suggested there is an incentive for the operator to sweat the asset or to run it down.  They might have an incentive at some point to exploit the value of the asset and sell it.  That happens in PPP contracts.</p></speech>

What it becomes then is a question about who is extracting value and where does the value go?  The problem with the Eircom privatisation - and I have referred to it already and exactly what we are talking about here was relevant is that case - was that the true value of the network infrastructure we privatised in 1999 was only realised when it was flipped not once, not twice but three or maybe four times.

The question is who extracted the value.  In that case the value was extracted by private equity groups abroad.

Professor Reeves compared it to Eircom and explained it very well to us.  In the case of Eircom, and Professor Reeves has done a lot of work on it, there were poles and cables attached to them and the ground around them, as such, but that is gone now and we cannot reverse that.  I know it is regrettable as we could do with them to attach these cables but we are where we are today.  This is a vital infrastructure just like electricity but it is not really comparable to Eircom because what we are dealing with here is the infrastructure as a cable but with Eircom it was the pole and the cable.  With Eircom, it was an entire pathway through the country where in this instance this is not comparable.</p></speech>

NBP Core, NBI will be overlaying its fibre in that 300,000 premises area.  I think Deputy Dooley asked earlier whether we would have any state aid concerns around that in that it is meant to be passing through the exclusion zone to get to the intervention area and whether there would there be any concerns that it could then try to connect premises within the exclusion zone.  Obviously that is technically not allowed in the exclusion zone but the fact the Department had assumed that it would rent Eir's fibre - it signed a commitment deal with Eir to roll out fibre in the 300,000 homes-premises area.  I think the Department's budget model then assumed that the winning bidder would effectively rent the fibre used, Eir's wholesale active product, but now it is not.  There is a much higher cost to what it is doing.</p></speech>

It could have been just a small part of its overall business.  Do the witnesses understand the point I am making?  The witnesses are assuming that this theoretical company would have had the same model, but if the new company did not have that vision, that potentially would have taken 300,000 homes out of the priority for broadband.</p></speech>

What if Eir, which is a private company with control over those 300,0000 homes, had been sold and the new company decided to specialise in electric cars?  I am raising questions about the idea that we could have used a chunk of a private company's network.  Would that not be high risk for the State?</p></speech>

We have been told it is a significant additional cost to the winning bidder rolling out its own fibre, overlaying Eir's existing fibre in the 300,000 premises area.  That is just a point of comparison that we are looking for and to see what justifies it.  Why would Eir's product not be dependable?  I cannot remember which company was here at the time - perhaps it was Analysys Mason - but it said something about a view that Eir's product would not be dependable.  That company did not go into significant detail, but what are the precise reasons that Eir's fibre would not be good enough and that Granahan McCourt need to overlay that fibre with its own fibre in the 300,000 premises exclusion area?</p></speech>

The big issue for all of us is to try to understand why the subsidy goes from &euro;787 million to that figure, plus another &euro;1 billion.  It appears, and Analysys Mason mentioned this last week when it appeared before of the committee and the penny dropped with a lot of us, that this is what is going on.  One of the reasons that the cost is going up is that Granahan McCourt has decided to overlay its own cable on the Eir network within the 300,000 premises exclusion area.  This goes back to the Deputy's original question.  That is what Granahan McCourt is actually doing.</p></speech>

When Analysys Mason was before the committee last week, it could have been probed more deeply to try to understand why it does not have confidence in Eir's products.  Again, we do not know the answer, but what we do know is that it seems to have been a major driver of the huge increase in the subsidy that the taxpayer will pay.</p></speech>

If one did not overlay fibre on the Eir poles, one was at risk of leaving 300,000 families that were in the intervention area.</p></speech>

For me this is a suspicion, because we do not have full facts.  When one is down to one bidder, then the bidder is in a very strong position and can say that it will not go with the original plan, which is to use the poles and ducts, and that it will overlay its own cable.  There is an advantage to doing that, because the subsidy is based on the capital expenditure.  The company gets a bigger subsidy and builds a much higher quality network for itself.  We do not know what will happen down the line, but Granahan McCourt will be able to exploit that value for a longer period.  This is the problem with having a procurement with no competition.</p></speech>

Eir was sold for a significant sum, and the figure was &euro;4 billion was mentioned at one stage.  Perhaps the witnesses will be able clarify that.  The Eir network had very little investment in it over the 20 year period, or in the nearly two decades since privatisation.  Very little cable was replaced.  The cable has been exposed to the severe weather in the winters since then.  Eir has what the witnesses would call distribution and what I would call connectivity and a connection and an infrastructure value despite the fact that it needs a lot of upgrading and repair.  Will the witnesses remind us of the price achieved when Eircom was sold?</p> <p>  When Eir exited the competition, I believe it had what it needed at that stage.  It got 300,000 households and premises that were easy to reach and it then said, thank you very much.</p><p>The real issue is the overlay.  The whole thing is bananas, that one was going overlaying fibre already there, which was going to happen.  I said it would act like Dick Turpin on the highway and say, "You won't pass us unless you pay".  To combat that, one must go around it or overlay another system on its one.</p><p> The real issue Deputy O'Connell missed is that the taxpayer must pay a subsidy for each pole, each year and for each metre of cable that the fibre runs through.  That is the real issue because we are going with the model of using one private company to use the network of another private company and Joe and Mary Soap will subsidise the whole thing, which completely ties into the cost escalation of &euro;0.8 billion up to what it is now.  The other factor in driving up the cost is the fact that we are now in a situation where &euro;1 billion of &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money is going to be handed over and it has to be handed to a separate private company by the investor to allow it to use its infrastructure.  Is that not the real issue plus the overlay in the Eir intervention and controlled area?  Is that not the reason for driving up the cost from an estimated &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1 billion to a bill of &euro;3 billion for the taxpayer?  We must pay for each pole and each metre of ducting must be subsidised.  It is not as if Eir is saying to us that we can use it and it is all right to overlay it.  The taxpayer must pay for this each year with the crazy scheme that has been designed.</p></speech>

Eir is involved in a lot of other things beyond just a wholesale broadband operator.  Eir has invested in recent years in fibre roll-out mainly in urban areas and now in the 300,000 premises.  Of course there are parts of rural Ireland where poles are falling down, as the Deputy mentioned, and things like that so there has not been massive investment.  Eir is involved in so many other things that the value is a very different situation.  Eir took 300,000 premises out of the area, which obviously had an impact in terms of competitive tension, the cost of subsidy, etc.  A lot of that subsidy is going to renting the actual poles and ducts.</p></speech>

In terms of the best protection from the perspective of the State, do the witnesses accept that full State ownership is the best way to ensure that the State is protected into the future considering that there is a relatively low level of private capital being invested versus the very significant amounts of money that the State has invested?  We are all of the view that burden and risk sharing would ultimately be carried by a third party - the private sector.  The State lost the long-term potential.  On the basis of the medium term, the risk was elsewhere and, therefore, lower subsidy which made sense.  In a nutshell, that has been turned on its head.  We have capital worth &euro;175 million coming in and then there is some working capital that will be paid back together with dividends, interest and all of that good stuff.  Before we really know the success or otherwise of this venture, based on Mr. Watt's communication, the cost will already have been recouped by the bidder.  The risk remains with the State throughout and in return there is no potential upside.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

Ideally, the answer should have been given as accurately as possible in the ownership report that was published at the end of 2015.  I read the report then and I read it again in preparation for today and I cannot get away from my conclusion that the State-owned model was dismissed too easily.  The arguments were not very convincing.  As a corollary, a huge degree of faith was put in the PPP approach which, as it turns out, is always more complicated than often anticipated at the beginning.  There is a constituency that believes in a more private sector led approach but basic economic theory will tell one that in such complex projects, where there are huge degrees of uncertainty around issues like technology, it is almost a common sense thing.  Economics is a common sense subject sometimes but it would suggest that the solution will be closer to the State-owned model and away from the market-based model because, in circumstances like that, markets do not work well when there is huge uncertainty, great complexity and so on.  This is exactly what we see being played out.  I think the State would be better protected with a State-owned model and that choice should have been made at the beginning.</p></speech>

If any consideration was given to that as a reason for the additional cost it would breach the state aid rules because there is already an incumbent.  Therefore, any further provision of taxpayers' money to future-proof the 300,000 premises would be a breach of State aid rules.</p></speech>

The fact that it would have a cable and have an arrangement to go through the area opens up opportunities once one is out of contract in 25 or 30 years' time and, therefore, creates a potential competitive environment against Eir or whoever else is there.</p></speech>

Once it is out of contract that could be the case.  It is very hard to see.  It is the complexity that is key, as Professor Reeves mentioned earlier.  In a more State controlled or State-led approach, one is better able to deal with that complexity, having to negotiate contracts for all of these things and arrange PPPs.  Even for roads, which is easier infrastructure in that it will be a motorway and there will be a certain value at the end of it, that is still a complex contract and there are a lot of complexities around it in calculating value for money, the PSB, etc.  In this type of contract, in a fast moving sector, with technology and competition changing, there is so much extra complexity on top of what we would normally see with a PPP.  Earlier people asked what would the economic or residual value.  Maybe I would be too glib if I said it would down, and I am not saying it would be.  A lot of the value would come down to the competitive process.</p><p>The NBS review suggested that the subsidy to be paid would be a mixture of the costs, revenues, strategic value and final economic value.  Bidders will have to come up with figures for what they believe that final value will be, what the strategic value of their ownership of the asset will be, what the revenues will be and what the costs will be.  The subsidy to the Government will need to be worked out with the complex interplay of these factors in mind.  When there is just one bidder, though, and it is not under competitive pressure to be more realistic about future demands and, therefore, revenues, attaching a higher strategic value or placing a higher economic value on the asset so that the subsidy will be reduced, all of that tension is gone.  When dealing with this type of gap funding or PPP model, complexity and uncertainty make it extremely difficult.</p></speech>

Given the number of unknowns and variables, including the vagueness, which is reasonable in some respects, around the asset's value after 25 years, the likely uptake, and whether the asset will be stress tested or worn out by the company, is it not too emphatic for Professor Reeves to say that "the procurement approach adopted has not satisfied the criteria necessary to ensure that the key objective of value for money"?  How did he reach that conclusion, given the level of unknowns?  It is theoretically possible that Professor Reeves could be correct, but there is no evidence to suggest he is.  Given that he does not know the detail of many elements, were the comments he put into the public domain not too emphatic?</p></speech>

A great deal of the information has come out.  Let us say that the witnesses' hypothesis or proposition is that the State-led model would be better.

Consider KPMG's ownership report.  When it examined the public ownership option, it assumed that that option would have more or less the same costs and revenues as all the other options.  The key differences were some higher start-up costs, given that this would be a new State enterprise, and the strategic value that KPMG assumed would arise under the gap funding model.  That is what KPMG said was the difference.  It has access to all of the costs and figures whereas we do not because everything has been redacted.</p></speech>

In terms of elements that distinguish the DBFOM, or PPP, model from the gap funding model, though, the only thing that KPMG referred to was step-in rights, which are included in the gap funding contract that we have.  Without seeing what KPMG's financial appraisal included and the figures used in that, we cannot say for certain what the situation is.  Based on what KPMG has written in its document, though, one must question many of the assumptions that it made.</p></speech>

As it turned out, however, there is no competition in the gap funding model anyway, so how can one argue at this point that the State-owned model would not have the same advantages as proposed for the PPP model?</p></speech>

In turn, we do not have access to any of the data because that is the way much of this happens.  This is one of the big problems with infrastructural policy.  By and large, it is problematic because these details tend to be hidden.  Why are they hidden?  It is a good question.  My suspicion is because people do not want to be accountable for decisions that they make.  I am glad I made that point.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's point, how does one put numbers on that?  This is the art of cost-benefit analysis.  It is most inexact because there is much educated guess work.  My knowledge of the analysis that was undertaken by PwC was that it was heavily invested in by PwC.  PwC would have relied on many previous studies, for instance, in order to come up with a number for something like the value that one could attach to remote working.  There is an established body of work around how to put numbers on time and cost savings and I would have a degree of faith in the rigour of the analysis up to that point.</p> <p>  The important point is, because it is imprecise, the key then would be to have it scrutinised by an independent agency of some sort.  That is why I mention the fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, scrutinised the cost benefit analysis, CBA.  As a result of that, many adjustments were made.  They identified, for instance, how sensitive the ultimate result of the CBA was to certain assumptions.  For me, it highlighted the fact that one can never get this right.  One can never get it nailed-on perfectly.</p></speech>

One will always be able to shoot holes through the analysis but at the end of the day, I would argue - I teach this stuff - it is better than no analysis at all.  When one is talking about investing approximately &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money, it has to be legitimately supported by a cost-benefit analysis.  That happened in this case, but the value of the CBA depends largely on the scrutiny.</p></speech>

If one is coming at it as an economist looking only at figures one would have one view but if one is coming at it, I would argue, as a Minister trying to deliver high-speed cable across Ireland, one's lens is totally different, wishing no disrespect to the academic lens.  Legislators and Ministers have a different job to do.  They must balance the sum that the man has done in the office on the cost-benefit analysis with the fact that we want the woman outside Skibbereen to be able to sell her pottery.  We are back to the academics of it.  All of these variables, first of all, are bespoke to Ireland and one cannot really compare it to get an international perspective.  I have looked at it.  One cannot compare it to any other jurisdiction and it is bespoke.  The variables are arbitrary by which I mean they are not set in stone.  It is merely what lens one is looking at it through.  Looking at the plan, the lens it is being looked at through is the delivery of broadband to the people of Ireland, not whether it is worth our while to have the woman outside Skibbereen selling the pottery.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

The CBA that was used in this case was complete and looked at all those costs and benefits.  The tricky part is the benefits.  KPMG, as I understood it, looked after the costs - we talked about that - but PwC was commissioned to look specifically at the benefits.  We are talking about social benefits here.  Identifying them is one big challenge, and one has to make choices.  The tricky part is monetising or putting the value to them.</p></speech>

I found that because I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts and I have been through this previously on a number of occasions.  My understanding was Eir was a larger company, Open Eir, and it had all sorts of parts selling other bits and bobs.  Would there not have been an issue there if that company, with business to its name other than the roll-out of broadband, was selling phones or whatever?  Would the State subsidy, potentially, in a private company situation, be pulled off to pay a pension, etc.?</p></speech>

What we were basically saying there was, in terms of Eir's incentive to want to win this contract, the complexity that type structure would create for Eir would probably diminish its desire to win that contract whereas they are assuming there will be strong competition from the likes of Eir or SIRO with existing infrastructure that they can leverage, etc.  Our point was not that this should not have happened.  The clear line of separation is perfectly understandable but it definitely would have affected Eir's incentive, particularly because the Department is setting up a separate governance and regulatory structure for that area.  They are setting a different price.  ComReg is already regulating Eir outside of that area across the country.

That is a big structure that they will have to put in place.  They have budgeted &euro;10 million per annum.  It is a very big structure that they will have to put in place.  If one reads the KPMG document, practically every second line reads "if the contract is implemented appropriately ... if there is appropriate governance on monitoring ... if there is this or if there is that...".  It is constantly saying it.  It states a number of times that the success of this plan or otherwise will all come down to the monitoring of this contract.  That will require a big, well-resourced multi-disciplinary and thorough team within the Department.</p> <p>  They have talked about a longer-term vision of a State agency to do all of this.  That is a big duplication of regulatory functions in the telecommunications sector that a highly experienced ComReg is already doing.  I would wonder what the cost of all of that will be purely in order to deliver this type of plan and the conflict that there might be, and maybe the overlap, with some of ComReg's existing functions.</p></speech>

The main issue is around the refresh rate - for example, if one puts in, say, the current optical equipment and it has to be replaced in seven years.  It is much further in the future when there are revenues.  Much of that could be funded by commercial revenues.  However, there is a much higher cost of putting in the more advanced technology right now.  Analysys Mason said that is a much higher cost and a big margin in terms of what it was assuming.  If take-up rates are low in the next several years and it will have to be refreshed in ten years time, it is big upfront capital expenditure cost subsided by the State versus the future refresh costs which could be coming out of revenues.</p></speech>

I welcome everyone here today and thank them for appearing before the committee.  The witnesses have been invited here to discuss Petition No. P00011/18 from Ms Josephine Boles.  The petition concerns mandatory training for Irish mainstream schoolteachers on the needs of children with spectrum disorders.</p><p>Before inviting the witnesses to address the meeting, I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I also advise the witnesses that their opening statement and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on its website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The witnesses' presentation has already been circulated to members.  I remind them that their presentation should not exceed ten minutes in duration.  I invite Mr. Jim Mulkerrins, principal officer at the Department of Education and Skills, to make his opening statement.  We are also joined by Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer with the special education section of the Department of Education and Skills, and Mr. Adam Harris from AsIAm.  I will call on members to ask questions when the presentations have concluded.  I invite Mr. Mulkerrins to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer with responsibility for special education section in the Department.  Ms Madeline Hickey of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is in the Gallery.</p> <p>  We welcome this opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the issues raised in Petition No. P00011/18 regarding mandatory training on spectrum disorders for teachers.  To assist the committee we have provided a briefing note for circulation to members for today&rsquo;s meeting.  That note provides an overview of policy developments and provision in the area of inclusive education and forms the basis of our presentation.  I note that the focus of the petition is primarily on the need to educate the educators.  This aim is fully shared by the Department and I hope to demonstrate today that there have been substantial developments in recent years.  This has occurred in both initial teacher education, ITE, and in continual professional development for serving teachers with the aim of supporting teachers&rsquo; knowledge and understanding of the specific needs of children with special educational needs, including those with spectrum disorders including dyspraxia, sensory processing disorders and dyslexia as well as autism and other spectrum disorders.</p> <p>  I note also that the petition suggests that the desired objective could be achieved by making training mandatory.  In his response to this committee on this issue in May, the Secretary General of the Department advised that inclusive education, including the education of children with special educational needs, is already a mandatory part of the standards for initial teacher education.  The Teaching Council&rsquo;s accreditation process for initial teacher education programmes is the mechanism through which the council can satisfy itself that its standards are being met through a given ITE programme.</p> <p>  The Secretary General also noted that, at present, no mandatory professional learning is required of teachers after they have completed initial teacher education and induction.</p><p>In this context, section 33 of the Teaching Council Act provides that the Teaching Council may make renewal of registration subject to having completed an accredited programme of continuing professional development, CPD.  To inform and support the development of Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teachers&rsquo; learning, the Teaching Council implemented a comprehensive, multilayered consultation process in 2014 and 2015.  Some 5,000 teachers contributed to the process, and the feedback was rich and helpful in informing the drafting of the framework, the purpose of which is to ensure there is a mechanism through which there could be further consideration of mandatory CPD.  Findings from the process identified that teachers are very interested in opportunities to engage in high-quality professional learning activities that are relevant to their needs and those of their pupils and that enhance teaching and learning in their classrooms.  Allied with this deep interest in professional learning is a strong interest in personal development and in the types of collaborative learning and professional conversations that take place in schools on formal and informal bases.  The findings are confirmed by the strong demand for professional learning opportunities provided by the Department through its funded professional development services including the professional development service for teachers, the junior cycle team, the national induction programme and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, along with other professional learning opportunities, about which I will speak further. </p><p> In considering the question of mandatory CPD, it is important to consider any evidence to indicate that a mandatory approach to CPD would enhance teachers&rsquo; practice and ensure that teachers are taking account of the diversity and complexity of learners&rsquo; needs, especially in a special education context.  The evidence gathered thus far by the Teaching Council has led it to the conclusion that ongoing learning by teachers should be encouraged and incentivised to ensure authentic engagement in a way that is sustainable and impactful.  Through the Cos&aacute;n development process, the council is exploring with the profession how this can be done.  The Department will be guided by advice supported by appropriate evidence when considering the broader question of linking teacher registration to the completion of accredited courses.  At this time, the Department is of the view there is much more work to be done before such a move should be considered.  In the material provided for the committee, we have included details of provision for professional development and, therefore, I do not propose to list the entire provision in my remarks.  Nevertheless, I point members to the supports available to teachers through the NSCE.  The council's remit is to develop schools' capacity to support students with special educational needs, including those with spectrum disorders, and to promote a continuum of educational provision that is inclusive and responsive.  The NCSE is responsible for the allocation of additional teaching and care supports to schools to support children with special educational needs.  In addition, the NCSE support services provide additional professional development supports for teachers of children with special educational needs.  In this way, the NCSE fulfils a vital role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the area of special needs provision.  CPD and other in-school supports provided by the NCSE are designed to enable teachers to adopt evidence based approaches to teaching students in special and mainstream classes and special schools.  The focus of professional development is on enhancing teachers&rsquo; understanding of the nature of the special educational need, including autism and other spectrum disorders, and the learning and teaching implications for each individual student and teacher; enhancing teachers&rsquo; use of a variety of interventions and teaching approaches for students based on the assessed needs of the students and taking account of empirical research; and enabling teachers to assess, plan and implement effective and differentiated teaching strategies with a view to meeting the needs of students through individualised planning, which I will address further.  </p><p> To support children with autism, the NCSE support service and the Middletown Centre for Autism operate co-operatively on the provision of CPD for teachers in the area of autism spectrum disorders. The Middletown centre, based in County Armagh, is a joint North-South initiative established in 2007 with funding provided by the then Department of Education and Science, along with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  Its purpose is to support the promotion of excellence in the development and co-ordination of education services to children and young people with autism.  There is also a range of other Department-funded CPD supports provided through other support services and delivered throughout the national network of 21 whole-time and nine part-time education centres, as well as in primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  When designing CPD for delivery to teachers, all support services must take account of the needs of all learners, including students with spectrum disorders and all students with special educational needs.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to answer any questions they may have.  We look forward to engagement with Mr. Harris.  It will not be the first time and I am sure we will have a positive discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the issue of mandatory autism training for teachers, which has featured in every submission that AsIAm has made to the Department of Education and Skills in the past five years.  Whether we are discussing the need for additional autism classes, the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme, reduced timetables, better outcomes for autistic students or children out of school, the issue of teacher training cannot but be central.  It is no surprise to us that it has been brought to the attention of this committee by concerned parents and we congratulate Ms Boles and others who took the initiative to get the matter on the committee's agenda.</p> <p>  By way of context, I am the founder and CEO of AsIAm, Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity.  We will be five years old this year.  We endeavour to bring about an autism-friendly Ireland, that is, a society where every autistic person is respected and accepted as they are and has the opportunity to participate in every aspect of Irish life.  Central to this aim is an inclusive education system that universally respects and values autistic students and their unique way of communicating, understanding and interacting with the world.  It is important that we treat it as an accessibility issue.  In the context of the discussion about mandatory training for mainstream teachers, we must recognise that the right to access mainstream education is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p> <p>  We are at something of a crossroads in respect of autism access to education in Ireland.  A total of 86% of autistic students enrolled in school now attend a mainstream school, which is a sea change compared with the norm perhaps 20 years ago.  As a young child, I spent the first three years of my education in a special school due to a complete lack of support or knowledge of autism in the mainstream school system at the time.  It is clear to us, however, that while the quantity of children attending mainstream school has vastly increased, the quality of their experiences is greatly varied and significant change is required to ensure that every autistic student has a positive, empowering school experience.  Sadly, that is not currently the case.  Every week, my team deals with cases of autistic children being disciplined because of their autism and how they may interact with others or due to high levels of anxiety.  We also deal with children who do not have a school place or are on reduced timetables, often because of a lack of suitable teacher training, and a sense of rejection when a child is not understood, respected and celebrated within a school environment.   </p> <p>  To include autistic students meaningfully, there are numerous essential ingredients.  Schools must be adequately resourced, that is, they must have access to the staff numbers, capitation and clinical expertise they require to include students universally, a point which is repeatedly raised.  The environment of schools must be autism friendly.  When we consider accessibility, we often think of wheelchair ramps and lifts but we often overlook the sensory needs of autistic students in busy, loud and often congested mainstream school environments.  Even buildings currently being constructed lack autism proofing in their design.  School policies must be autism proofed.  Policies that, for example, deal with discipline, assessment and enrolment cannot remain the same as before the introduction of autism inclusion in school.  They must reflect the specific support needs of a cohort of students who may need to do things in a substantially different way to get through stressful school days, which affects the culture of schools, including the language we use to describe autistic students.  Everyone in a school community must be informed and respectful of autism.  This includes peers, parents, non-teaching staff and members of the boards of management.  Perhaps most critically, all teachers within a school must understand and accept their role in teaching students on the autism spectrum and must be able to access whatever training they need to provide a differentiated, accessible education for such students. </p> <p>  I have outlined these different issues because it is right that we understand meeting the needs of autistic students as something of an ecosystem as opposed to any one action.  Although we are in attendance to speak specifically about teacher training, it is important we also acknowledge the need for the State to do more to support schools.  For those who may not be very familiar with autism, it is perhaps useful to provide a short explanation of the condition and why, as a result, students may need teachers to be further equipped to support them.  Autism is a lifelong developmental condition that relates to how a person communicates and interacts with others and how they experience the world around them.  In practical terms, this means that autistic students may communicate in a different way from others.</p><p>This might include using alternative communication systems as opposed to speech, understanding language very literally or not using facial expression or body language in the same way as other people.  A student might see detail as opposed to the bigger picture.  A student might not be able to fill in the blanks in social situations as other people can.  If a student perceives his or her environment very differently from others, this may lead to sensory overload and significant discomfort.  When these issues are misunderstood, it is easy for breakdowns in communication to occur, frustration to develop and a lack of understanding to become evident.  Unfortunately, we often take a deficit approach to autism.  If we accept that autistic people sometimes need to do things differently, we can unlock the potential of students whose insight is different from others and who often excel in areas in which they are most interested.<br/><br/>Given that one in 65 students in our education system has a diagnosis of autism and that autism is a vast spectrum, with every autistic person having different levels of need and different challenges and strengths, it is easy to see that every teacher will encounter many autistic students in his or her career and will need to have the capacity to adjust his or her pedagogy and classroom environment accordingly.  We can think about this from an accessibility point of view.  If a teacher does not have these skills, the school is not accessible for students.  Many teachers are already taking action in this regard.  AsIAm has been inundated with requests from schools to access training and talks during Croke Park agreement hours.  The Middletown Centre for Autism is playing a vital role in providing a range of high-quality free training to teachers across the island of Ireland.  We are lucky to meet incredible teachers every week who have learnt about autism through their own initiative, and are now playing a vital role in ensuring their students can fully participate and succeed.  However, <i>ad hoc</i>efforts like this are simply not enough.  This cannot be optional because inclusion is not optional.<br/><br/>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is 15 years old.  If we consider this in the context of a student&rsquo;s journey through school, we will understand that a generation of students is now ageing out of the school system.  It is regrettable that not enough has been done in that time to ensure every teacher knows and understands autism.  Autism education does not constitute a compulsory element of initial teacher education.  There is no mandatory training for existing teachers.  Many teachers who are assigned to autism classes have little or no training on the condition prior to taking up their posts.  This is a recipe for disaster because it places students and teachers in an entirely unacceptable position.  Unfortunately, many students are being failed today as a result.  I am sad to report that we hear each week from students who have fallen out of school or are attending school irregularly.  A key factor in these cases is teachers who are not equipped to meet the needs of autistic students.  This must stop.<br/><br/>I would like to make some practical recommendations to the joint committee.  Autism training must form a compulsory requirement of initial teacher education, in line with recommendations already made to the Department and the Teaching Council by the National Council for Special Education.  As I have explained, autism is counter-intuitive in many respects.  As a result, it requires teachers to have a discrete knowledge of the condition.  Autism training can improve their overall teaching skills.  Mary Immaculate College in Thurles has taken the first steps in this direction.  I encourage the committee to learn more about its rationale for making this decision and to encourage all other initial teacher education institutes to follow suit.<br/><br/>There is also a need for a national programme of training and continuous professional development for all teachers in autism and other disabilities.  We need to get beyond the concept of autism being the purview of any one teacher.  It must be the responsibility of every teacher in every school.  We welcome the similar calls that have been made by teacher unions.  We urge the Department to commence consultation with stakeholders on what such a training programme should include and how it should be conducted.  While I recognise that an evidence base is needed in this regard, it stands to reason that if a teacher does not have the knowledge to meet the needs of an autistic student, that student would be better served if the teacher were to acquire that knowledge.  That is pretty intuitive.<br/><br/>Our next recommendation relates to the range of offering.  It continues to be the case that a significant cohort of students who need autism classes or special school places cannot access them.  Greater consideration must be given to the voices of parents when decisions are being made about school placements.  Teachers in special classes must have advanced training and significant expertise.  When we talk about training, we must remember that the people best placed to provide insight into their access needs and strengths are autistic students.  In our work with young people, we have found that when students are not consulted on how they are supported, this reduces their self-esteem and their openness to accepting help.  The voice of students must be built into the individualised planning process for autism because it is true that someone who has met one autistic student has met one autistic student.<br/><br/>I would like to highlight a positive example of partnership between educational stakeholders and our organisation.  AsIAm, in partnership with the joint managerial body and the Irish Primary Principals Network, has developed a reflective online tool for teachers and schools to explore their own practice regarding autism.  This will include three hours of free online training for every teacher in the country, aimed at a whole-school level of understanding.  We will pilot this programme with 200 schools in September.  Schools and teachers are often asked to be autism-friendly without a clear or fair picture of what this looks like.  We hope this tool and training will help to make that relationship attainable.  Teachers can massively improve the lives of autistic students.  The teachers I had in school made such a difference in my life.  The profession is already doing a lot, but we must put in place supports and standards to ensure inclusive practice is a universal reality in our education system.</p></speech>

I am delighted to participate in this discussion with the stakeholders.  Parents approach Deputies and Senators on a weekly basis to look for supports for their children.  It is commonplace and is becoming more commonplace.  I welcome this discussion.  I have two questions.  What is Mr. Mulkerrins's assessment of what we have heard from Mr. Harris?  Where can common ground be found?  I ask Mr. Mulkerrins to share some of the Department's experiences of hearing from parents and boards of management about the supports that are needed.  There is a conversational style of open and frank debate at this committee.  I would appreciate it if Mr. Mulkerrins could address some of the points that have been made by Mr. Harris.</p> <p>  When Mr. Harris, who is very welcome, was speaking about autistic students at the beginning of his presentation, he mentioned that the quality of their experiences is very different across the board.  Has his organisation assessed the demographics of that?  Are these differences geographically based?  Has an effort been made to drill down into the reasons for this different quality of experience?  Mr. Harris mentioned teacher training as well.  He also stated that teachers must understand and respect their roles.  He mentioned that one in 65 students in our education system has a diagnosis of autism, which certainly stacks up from our perspective in light of the experiences we have on a weekly basis.  He further stated that each student who presents with a diagnosis has different levels of need and different challenges and strengths.  Therein lies the problem in terms of the requirements for teachers and the challenges they face.  Mr. Harris spoke about the training required by teachers to acquire the different set of skills that is needed.  Can common ground be reached with the Department as it seeks to face the challenges that have been outlined by Mr. Harris and with which his organisation is dealing?  We can see from our work that this is a very complex area.  We are not trained to deal with it.  Mr. Harris's organisation, the Department and society in general want to see a far more welcoming attitude.</p> <p>  I disagree with the suggestion in the petition that our educational system has not changed much since it was introduced during the Industrial Revolution.  I can see the education system that my children are enjoying in primary school.  It is far more welcoming, inclusive and open than the system I was brought up in.  It welcomes all children's strengths and weaknesses in the classroom setting.  The petition is unfair in that respect.  I would appreciate a response to the questions I have asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Mulkerrins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#E00300"><p>The Deputy raised a number of issues and asked me to respond in general to the points made by Mr. Harris.  I would be happy to do so.  I will begin by making a couple of technical points.  The petition relates to the experiences of children with spectrum disorders.  It does not refer specifically to autism.  I do not want to get into the personal details of the petitioner's child.  Our comments have a broader focus than autism.  I acknowledge that autism is the avenue we are likely to follow because it accounts for the overwhelming majority of children with spectrum disorders within schools.  I am of the view that we can agree on this.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Mr. Harris's point about AsIAm being inundated with requests for training.  I welcome that level of demand, to be frank, because it speaks to the willingness of the teaching profession to seek out and access opportunities for learning.  The experience I would like to outline speaks enormously about the value of what has been traditionally been referred to as CPD.</p><p>Mr. Harris pointed to the NCSE's recommendation on mandatory training for teachers teaching children with autism.  In 2013 and 2015, the NCSE recommended that there should be mandatory CPD.  In that context, work is under way at the moment both within the Teaching Council, the NCSE, and collaboratively between the two, to develop the framework for CPD.  We would all agree that it would not be very effective for the Department to simply issue a circular from next Monday or 1 September saying it would be mandatory for teachers to undertake training on autism.  One has to develop the training and ensure the training is appropriate, recognises the needs and contexts of children and also that it is capable of being translated into better practice within the school.  One then needs a framework for the evaluation of that.  Otherwise, it would be meaningless as well.  We fully acknowledge that there is work to be done in that regard.  The Department's concern is that before we get into the space of deciding that there should be a mandatory component on CPD that we would have the evidence base to underpin the decision and that is just not there yet, but work is under way.</p><p> I also acknowledge the point made by Mr. Harris that Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, head of education in Mary Immaculate College on the St. Patrick's Campus in Thurles has introduced autism in the initial teacher education training courses.  That is one good example of practice.  Dr. &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has a background in working with the special education section of the Department and continues to inform it of best practice in this area.  He also had a significant engagement with the Middletown Centre for Autism.  There is a wealth of inter-agency activity, engagement and consultation happening in this space.</p><p> I wish to make a broader point, namely, that we have probably come from a difficult enough period perhaps 15 or 20 years ago when there was little in the way of additional provision and inclusion was not the language of the education system.  In a very short period, the level of resources provided to support the inclusion of children in education has increased exponentially .  During my time in the area of special education, the entire budget has increased from approximately &euro;880 million to &euro;1.8 billion.  Such was the commitment of the Government and the Department to support children's education, and specifically the education of children with special educational needs, that it was done over the ten years of the worst economic depression that the country has ever experienced.  That has seen a significant increase in the number of additional teachers to support special education.  We are now at in excess of 15,000 teachers and we just reached 16,000 SNAs from a very low base in the mid-1990s of approximately 300.  Approximately one third of the adult population within schools is specifically related now to special education, particularly when one adds in the number of teachers teaching special classes and the number of teachers who teach in special schools.  The investment is significant.  That has encouraged a significant increase in the number of children who are being included.  We are working at breakneck pace to try to ensure that those teachers are supported in order to ensure that there is best practice within schools.</p><p> We acknowledge that at a time of substantial change there will always be examples where one will find that the best things are not necessarily happening or where decisions within schools are not necessarily the best decisions in the context of, for example, the assignment of teachers to special classes or the assignment of teachers with special needs responsibilities.  It is around those concerns that the NCSE has made most of its recommendations on training and qualification structures.  The recommendations are now being actively interrogated in the context of the consultation and development work that the NCSE and the Teaching Council are doing.  The Teaching Council's exercise, which I referred to in my opening remarks, on engagement with the teaching profession has satisfied it and we in the Department are convinced that there is a ready openness on the part of the teachers to engage.  There is openness and willingness to engage in professional learning, including the formal and informal conversations in the schools and within the training opportunities that are provided, both by the NCSE and the Teaching Council through the education centres and all of the other training opportunities that are available, including Mr. Harris's organisation, AsIAm.  The willingness to engage in training and the positivity towards it is what we are trying to identify better and to base the future on rather than simply engaging in a box-ticking exercise.  I use the words somewhat advisedly because in preparing for the meeting we looked at where there is evidence of a mandatory CPD programme.  Since the introduction of its mandatory programme in 2011, the Medical Council has published a report indicating that in many respects the mandatory CPD programme for doctors is regarded as a point of contention, a box-ticking exercise and does not speak to a quality of provision.</p><p> In terms of ensuring that it translates properly into schools, the Department is currently examining the Looking at our School document, which we use to ensure that schools are self-reflective in terms of their practice , that they are understanding of all of the different contexts within their schools - for example, that assignments are conducted appropriately - and that leadership and school management are conducted appropriately.  That document speaks significantly about the inclusion of children with special educational needs and other diversity issues, including for example, disadvantage.  We are currently reviewing that and we are conscious that there is an opportunity to bring all of our service providers, the PDST and the NIPT, which are responsible for induction training of teachers, and the JCT and the NCSE, together to ensure that there is coherence between development work and how that translates into best practice within schools.  As members are aware, the inspectorate is a mechanism through which we look to see how schools are being effective in terms of practice.  In the context of whole-school evaluations, inspectors will typically look at what the schools are doing in respect of the implementation of all that good stuff in the Looking at Our School document.  There is a lot happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#F00200"><p>I will respond to some of the questions from Deputy Cassells.  He asked where we have seen examples of a differentiation in quality.  In the first instance, we have probably seen it at a very anecdotal level in that we do meet many young people and families who are having positive experiences in schools and who attribute that to the teacher in the class or the teachers in the school.  Inversely, the organisation receives approximately 70 queries a month from families.  Consistently, the top five issues are school issues concerning the support they receive within schools, the appropriate management of the resources Departments are giving them, engagement with parents by teachers and disciplinary processes.  To give an example of the latter, if a student who is autistic experiences a meltdown during his or her school day, very often the policy that is being used to address that does not relate to support; it is a disciplinary policy and it deals with the person involved in the same way as it that deals with students who smoke behind the shed.  That is a big issue.  What we have been concerned about in particular is that while there is no doubt that a lot of students have very positive experiences, we are seeing an increasing number of students not attending school, not having access to a school place or illegally being placed on reduced timetables.  That is consistently coming about fundamentally due to a lack of teacher knowledge.  Schools are afraid to open autism classes because teachers do not feel that they have the training.  Schools that have such classes or have students enrolled in mainstream classes perhaps are not in a position to support students as well as they could.  That is central to it.  We published a report in April that documented the cases of 313 children, whom we call "invisible children" who are currently out of school.  That represents a very small example of the people in that position.</p> <p>  Another indicator that is important is when one looks at schools that have autism classes, there was a vision when such classes were established that students who enrolled in the classes in junior infants would increasingly spend more and more time in mainstream school as time went on.  However, the evidence suggests that children who are enrolled in junior infants very often spend their whole education in such a class, which suggests that not enough is being done in reverse integration and slowly supporting students on the autism spectrum who enter schools.  When we look at what happens to students when they finish school, while some progress to university, many find themselves in a position where they are very socially isolated because they have had negative experiences.</p> <p>  In terms of how teachers can manage the varied needs, fundamentally, what this comes down to is resources and then planning and differentiation.  The courts have been clear through the years that people with disabilities have a right to an appropriate education and that an indicator for that, if one likes, is differentiation.  I do not think that is particularly new in terms of what we are talking about because the established policy of the State is that in the vast majority of instances students with disabilities should attend mainstream school.  The difficulty is that often while that is the established policy, schools then are not being sufficiently supported but also are not sufficiently regulated in terms of delivering the service.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities clearly states that it is never the case that a child needs to change or adapt in order to go to school, rather it is incumbent on member states and their agencies, in this case schools, to ensure that the service they offer is accessible.</p><p> This brings me back to mandatory CPD and the training relating to it.  While I recognise that there might be a need for an evidence body for an overall mandatory CPD programme, if we do not have mandatory CPD, this is literally the equivalent of asking somebody who does not speak French to go in and teach a French class.  Fundamentally, autism is a completely different way of doing and seeing things and placing a person without that knowledge and insight in a classroom is setting everybody up for failure.  There is an evidence base for that.  To return to language, there are current examples in the education system of non-verbal autistic children whose SNAs and teachers do not have the training to use the alternative communication styles they might use, which highlights the importance of this issue.</p></speech>

It is very clear from the Department's point of view that every child is entitled to receive a full education.  If there are examples or situations where children, because of a medical or some other pressing need that is supported by expert evidence, require to have that curtailed for any reason, it should be part of a plan about which parents are consulted.  There should be timely engagement and there should be defined objectives as to what the outcome of the plan is.  That should be reviewed and it should not happen as a surprise to the parent, with he or she just being called in to bring the child home on a recurring basis.  This should, very clearly, be a response.  There are support services available to help schools around individual children, such as the National Educational Psychological Service, for example, and there may be others.</p> <p>  On the legal side, it is clear that, under the Education (Welfare) Act, there is an obligation on schools to record attendance and to report on non-attendance.  Where a child is sent home and there is no consultation and it is not part of an educational intervention, it is technically a suspension.  It should be recorded and should be reported to Tusla, which has guidelines and a range of interventions in place through its education welfare service for that to be followed up.</p> <p>  On the broader issue, Mr. Harris made very valid points about school culture and teacher competence.  The OECD  carried out research a number of years ago which stated that the quality of teaching in a school cannot exceed the quality of the teachers.  That has been central to Department policy-making and thinking in recent times, as well as to the emphasis on how we address that from a strategic and policy point of view.  The establishment of the Teaching Council was a very strategic move in order to guarantee in terms of quality what we now call the continuum of teacher education, which governs the initial teacher education piece, then bridging the initial teacher education piece into teaching, and through to career-long professional development.  The whole thrust of policy should be evidence-based throughout and, obviously, it is very much about bringing the profession with us.</p> <p>  While there is clearly a bit to go on that, much work has been done.  All of the initial teacher education programmes, of which there are quite a few, have been reviewed and reconfigured since 2012.  In the context of the NCSE review to which Mr. Mulkerrins referred, there was clear evidence in terms of these programmes having inclusive modules within them.  There may be some work to be done on that and, clearly, the work of Mary Immaculate College will be useful in that regard.  However, it is safe to say the council in its work is very much driven by what is the State's policy, what is international best practice and where are our needs currently.  In other words, if we want to meet the needs of children who are in school today, we need to respond to that and pick up on the work of our inspectors and the work of Mr. Harris and his organisation.</p> <p>  The other strategic move the Department made was to establish the NCSE.  This was an intervention designed to address a lacuna in the Department's ability to respond to the needs of children in special education and to make sure the Department, in responding, was doing so on a very reliable evidence base.  Mr. Mulkerrins outlined some of the statistics on the work that has been done.  The commitment to supporting children with special educational needs and spectrum disorders cannot be second-guessed because the position regarding what has happened since 2011 is very clear, particularly in the context of the number of special needs teachers and SNAs, as well as the variety of supports going into schools, in place.</p> <p>  The emphasis on training cannot be understated and this is very clear in terms of the advice we have been getting from the NCSE, and we will see more on that.  We know that, last year, something of the order of 15,000 teachers were trained on special education in general terms.  There are further statistics, if the committee wishes to break that down, but that is a very clear statement in its own right of the commitment of the State to support the upskilling of teachers.</p> <p>  We have made a number of other innovative moves on the advice of the NCSE.  There is currently a school inclusion model in development which will see a range of new therapies being brought into schools.  It is happening in 75 schools currently and will be piloted for a further year.  It is about bringing occupational therapy, speech and language and behavioural practitioners into schools so we support teachers in a way they have not been supported before.  While special needs assistants are doing a magnificent job, it is clear they do not have the skills and competencies in some of the areas where children exhibiting needs in schools need to be supported.  The outcome of this pilot will further inform policy as to how we might extend that model into the future.</p> <p>  The point I am making is that we recognise there is an increased need, our understanding and knowledge is building the whole time and we are trying busily to catch up, given that resources are not unlimited.  Currently, almost 20% of the total education Vote is being spent on supporting special needs and that investment will grow.  We need to be sure we are doing it based on good, sound evidence, which is our intention.  Teacher education and general training have to be central to that.</p></speech>

It is fair to state that there are instances where parents are comfortable with reduced timetables, feel that it actually helps their children, and are of the view that it is better for them to go school for part of the day rather than not at all.  The aspect that really concerns us is where these reduced timetables are imposed unilaterally by a school.  There has been a real culture of secrecy around that and, certainly in the surveys we have done, it appears reduced timetables have been put in place in a very coercive manner, with the approach to the effect that "If you do not accept this, we will be looking at suspension or expulsion."</p> <p>  What came out of last week's Oireachtas committee is very important, which is that Tusla has clarified that a reduced timetable is a suspension.  The question has to be asked why schools are not being written to and informed of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.679" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#G00600"><p>I thank our guests for their honesty.  I will address my questions first to Mr. Ward.  I have encountered many cases of children with special needs who are having problems,.  Mr. Ward referred to schools having programmes and so on.  Is he referring to a national programme for schools or is it based on the fact that, as we all know, some schools will perform better than others, and it depends on the co-operation between teachers and principals with regard to better supports for children in schools?</p> <p>  The Middletown Centre for Autism came up a number of times.  I was lucky enough to visit the facility last year with a number of Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.</p><p>We had a frank discussion on this issue and the fact that it supports the industry, as we will call it.  The reaction I received, however, suggested that the people in Middletown actually want to do more.  They are chomping at the bit.  The centre is co-funded by the British Department of Education and the Department of Education and Skills.  The people there referred to how to "encourage" schools.  That was a very cute word to use, but they were referring to encouraging schools through an accreditation system.  It would be a case of inviting schools to state how many pupils they had and how many more were expected and then asking if there was a way to obtain assistance for those schools to upskill their teachers, without putting extra pressure on them.</p><p> As has been stated by previous speakers, this is an issue of resources and forward planning.  What I understood from our visit to the Middletown centre, however, is that it has the system required to move this issue forward.  We need the Government to buy into that system and to co-fund it.  We will call it that.  The positive aspect is that people want to do the right thing.  It is a normal human reaction to want to help people in difficulty regardless of what is the problem.  If a school is encouraged to help its teachers upskill`, the obvious knock-on effect is that the quality of school life improves for everybody.</p><p> In addition, with accreditation comes acknowledgement.  That is something that is missing from many systems in this country.  We do not acknowledge the good work that people do.  Would the Department be interested in this?  Reference was made to cohesion and to tying everything up.  Is there a way that everyone can tie in to this?   I am referring to linking in with the Middletown centre.  There is a coincidence in the name because I am from Middleton.  It is strange because Middleton was also called Middletown long ago.  The Middletown centre is totally non-judgmental.  It has looked at the sphere of education in a 32-county context in a very honest fashion.  Would this be a way of achieving joined-up thinking?  I ask that because we have seen that many organisations want to do the right thing but they are all doing things differently.  My question concerns whether our guests would regard this as a way to tie things together.  If this is the only 32-county autism specialist centre, could we not link up and link in the work of the education Departments on both sides of the water?  I understand that there may be an impact as a result of Brexit.  The Departments are already working together, however.  Surely they can come up with a plan and I think the accreditation model would benefit everybody.  What is the opinion of our guests?</p></speech>

We view Middletown as a centre for excellence on autism.  We want to work with it and we have a programme of work with it at the moment.  The centre works with the NCSE and delivers programmes for us.  The centre will also be very closely involved as we move forward.  For example, we are looking at a training programme for schools which are establishing special classes for the first time in September.  The Middletown centre will be involved with our own National Education Psychological Service and the NCSE in developing that programme.  I do not want to pre-empt how the delivery might work but clearly we are involving the centre more and more in our thinking, policy-making and planning.  It is already involved in the delivery of programmes.  The centre has expertise that we do not have in ready supply and we will be drawing on that.</p> <p>  The Department spends approximately &euro;50 million each year on teacher education.  That covers everything from employing teachers, developing and delivering programmes, paying for substitute teachers in the base schools and all of the other expenditure involved in teacher education.  The expenditure is significant and it is going to increase.  Much of that increase is connected to new curriculum innovation and all of the things that will happen in a school such as the introduction of mandatory child protection guidelines, etc.  There is much going on.  The issue of special needs and spectrum disorders, however, is a priority.  We are very aware of the increased needs, as we see it, and the issue of how we will respond to those needs.  Deputy Buckley referred to resources and as a good official I should refer to resources as well every now and again.  It is a question of balancing priorities.  However, we take the point on board.  Middletown has expertise and we will certainly be utilising that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#H00300"><p>I will pick up on a few of the points made.  Not reinventing the wheel is particularly important because schools are getting so many new initiatives at the moment.  In the resources we have developed, which I referenced, we have used the Middletown framework, the Autism Education Trust framework and all of the relevant departmental policies so there is not something new.  It is just making everything a bit more cohesive.  The point regarding accreditation is interesting.  AsIAm accredits many organisations such as universities, shops and other businesses in respect of being autism friendly.  We have been reluctant to do that for schools.  There is a reason for our reluctance.  We would very much like to do it.  We must look, however, at a pattern that is occurring and which is worrying.  Sometimes in a geographical area one school will step forward, state that it wants to be inclusive and that it will do the right thing by opening a special class.  What tends to happen then is that every time one school steps forward all of the other schools take two steps backwards.  We are hopeful that the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will address this issue with the ability to designate areas for autism classes.</p> <p>  We are concerned that some ghettoisation is happening.  In other words, one school ends up taking all of the children with special needs.  That school is then mandated as the school that is good at that instead of there being a recognition that every school has a role to play.  It is worth stating in this context that league tables and media reporting of league tables have a negative impact on outcomes for autistic students.  Those league tables define that the only good school is one which does well in the league tables as opposed to one that works for everybody.  I would love to do accreditation but the worry is that it would designate a school as the only school that does this.</p></speech>

We are anxious, therefore, to avoid anything pointing to schools that are doing well and, conversely, to schools that are regarded as not doing very well.  The Deputy mentioned issues regarding school programmes.  It is important to point out that there are many programmes in place to support teachers working with children with autism spectrum disorders and a range of other special educational needs.  They are typically supported by means of provision from the NCSE.  Work to develop those programmes is informed by the Middletown centre.  It is a significant part of a much bigger joined-up process.  Everything the centre does informs development work in this area.  I refer to the development work that the NCSE is doing as well as the development work that Mary Immaculate College is doing with its particular programme.  Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, while he was in the inspectorate, was involved in a major inspection of the Middletown model and he is very familiar with it.  There is again much joined-up thinking in this regard.  Turning to encouraging schools, from my own experience the difficult bit is to encourage schools to get to the starting point, to open the class and to enrol the child.  There is a real willingness to continue once schools have opened classes.   Engagement from that point on is wholehearted because it is possible to see the benefits-----</p></speech>

It is not always perfect but it can be seen that it is working.  The impact that has on the life of the child can also be seen, as can the improvement for all of the other children in the school who begin to understand that they do not live in an homogenous world.  An inclusive school is much better for all of the children in that school and not just those children with special educational needs.</p></speech>

I will make some comments before we wrap up.  I have spoken about this matter a few times, especially at the education committee.  Having listened to the presentations, I have comments rather than questions.  Our guests should feel free to comment as well.  We are continuing to see what should be a normal way of teaching within a diverse system as something additional.  We are taking it for granted that every child in a room must learn in the same way except for one child who might, possibly, be on the spectrum or is diagnosed as being on the spectrum.</p> <p>  That is instead of acknowledging that there should be a mandatory or general training scheme for teachers.  That should be the case even if a teacher is not aware that a child in a room has a diagnosis or if there is child in a room that should have diagnosis.  Teachers should be informed and trained in such a way that they teach on the assumption that they should teach in a particular way regardless of whether there is specific notification of a child or children needing special attention or special education.  I am the mother of someone on the spectrum.  Navigating the school system was really difficult for her.  If some simple things had been done within the mainstream system, it could have made that experience much easier for her.</p><p>Looking at some children who end up on reduced timetables particularly due to tiredness and the emotional toll it takes to navigate a school day - when one has that narrator in one's head about what one is supposed to do next and has to consider how to find one's way to a classroom when everybody moves into the corridors at the same time, or even where the teacher sitting at the top of room constantly clicks a pen and is not aware of the impact of that on someone in the room - there are very simple things that could be done to stop reduced timetables.  It is the environment that creates the anxiety rather than the person's diagnosis.  This involves the environment, the response to the person and the learning style that person is not receiving - the idea around verbal instruction and how we provide people with information on how to carry out their homework.  The problem is that we keep seeing special education as additional.  Every single piece of teacher training, regardless of what module it is or what teacher training year it is, should have a thread through it.  It should naturally include the idea that different people learn in different ways.  Perhaps what I will say next is not true but I will make the assumption that it is.  If a teacher taught a class as if every member of it had autism and the assumption that everybody in the classroom is different, it would be a much nicer learning environment for most people because the teacher would take into account the fact that some people will have sensory issues or a different way of receiving information.  That is where we are failing in terms of special education because we keep seeing it as an add-on.  Unfortunately, accreditation would do that as well.  Do the witnesses see a space where we need to transform teacher training in general to be more reflective of Irish society rather than having to keep finding these add-ons?  What impact would that have?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#J00200"><p>I certainly agree with that.  While visiting a few teacher training colleges to give talks over the past while, I have had the pleasure of meeting student teachers who are on the autism spectrum.  I think that will be so important in, ultimately, shifting the profession and moving it away from one type of person teaching other types of people and making the profession more inclusive overall.  The point made by the Acting Chairman is really important because we talk about universal design and universal design for learning.  The problem is when many of these frameworks were developed, autism was still addressed as a medical issue and was not seen as part of that.  As I briefed the committee earlier, I even see that with regard to how school buildings are being built.  They are incredibly accessible with wide corridors but are less accessible than they ever were for autistic students for a range of reasons.  There is a need to embed autistic people into the universal design process recognising that it is not about charity or special education but about diversity and embedding that culture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Mulkerrins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019061900002#J00300"><p>Certainly it was true in the past that the classroom was such that teaching was teaching and teaching the child with autism was different but everything else was uniform within that almost as if the child with autism was inconvenient.  A lot of work was done in this space around the introduction of the new resource teacher model in 2017 and it took many years to get us to a place where we could introduce that.  The distribution of teachers was one small part of introducing the new model.  The major part of it was changing the approach to teaching within schools, which now informs teacher training.  Much of that was around the identification of pupils with additional needs and moving away from a model that relied entirely on a diagnosis because, frankly, a diagnosis of autism does not tell the teacher anything about the needs of the child.  Every child with autism is different, as indeed is every child who is deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired or who has ADHD, dyslexia or dyspraxia.  There are lots of different needs in there so it was very important that we would have a model that would encourage the school to have a better understanding of the learning needs of children and then develop planning.</p> <p>  We issued very substantial guidance to all schools and teachers around the introduction of that new model and also issued circulars around the distribution of teaching resources and what they would be used for.  I will read one small part of it.  Under the heading of additional teaching support in the 2017 circular for primary schools, it states that the classroom teacher in consultation with the special education teacher, as required, will consider ways in which the curriculum can be differentiated or adapted to suit the needs of individual pupils.  It states that this may also involve identifying the most appropriate teaching strategies and programmes to meet the child's needs and deciding which additional teaching supports are required.  It states that parents should normally be consulted as part of this process.  That was a radical move from where we were where, essentially, the needs of the children were being negotiated between the parents and the NCSE and the response was "we'll provide a couple of hours teaching and some SNA support."  This was now a discussion around the learning needs of the child in a way that did not really happen until then but is happening now and is informing the differentiated teaching practices of teachers.  A teacher should now understand the learning needs of all of the children in the classroom regardless of whether they have autism, Down's syndrome or moderate learning difficulties.  Teachers should understand the needs of children.  They have the supports to work with them and should plan to teach the child in respect of those needs and plan in consultation with the parents.  That is what our teacher training and continuous professional development efforts try to support.  </p></speech>

The point has been made - perhaps more than once - around what the school culture is like.  Very often, it can take time to move school culture.  It is a constant process and it is through training, information and leadership development that we get agents of change across the system at every level.  I do not exclude the Department from that.  It is a challenge.  During my time in the Department, we have certainly moved in terms of the provision of special education, about which we have spoken.  We have also moved in terms of curriculum development.  There are strands of curriculum development that are focused around differentiated learning and teaching in the classroom.  I know that in respect of the new primary language curriculum introduced in the past number of years, there would have been dedicated aspects of training to help teachers in the different environments they might be in.</p> <p>  The other issue concerns the quality of relationships within the school.  Some of the points made by Mr. Harris refer to that.  Clearly, we must value the voice of the student and child more and more because there is great learning from that.  We have ways and means of beginning to capture that evidence with our inspectorate model and increasingly consulting with parents and families around their experience.  We are beginning to focus on that more and more through the work of agencies such as the Teaching Council and the NCSE.  </p> <p>  By its nature, change takes time.  If we achieve one goal, obviously, there are four or five more on the horizon at any given time.  There is a progression here.  As human beings, this will be a lifelong challenge.  A a lot of work has been done but there is more to do.</p></speech>

The committee will now make formal decisions on six petitions.  Petition P00015/19 from Ms Mmoley Taylor would like to see Irish citizenship offered to all British spouses of Irish nationals who are currently resident in Ireland and have been married for over five years.  This petition cites the uncertainty of Brexit and potential hardships for British citizens as reasons for doing this.  Does any member wish to contribute to this matter?  I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>Petition P00016/19 from Ms Molly O'Brien would like to see visa exemptions for non-EU spouses of Irish citizens in the case of short-stay visits only.  The petition cites the excessive documentation required for the application and lead-in in time required in the application process.  </p><p><font color="#FFFFFF">End of Take</font></p><p>This is the first of two petitions by the same petitioner on a similar theme.  Unless any member wishes to contribute on this matter, I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P00024/19 is from Ms Laura Moore.  This petitioner would like to see the immediate end to all badger culling and the implementation of a tuberculosis, TB, vaccination programme for badgers.  The petition states that a vaccination programme was proposed by the Government in 2018 but has not been actioned.  Does any member wish to contribute to this matter?  No.  I propose that we keep this petition open.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will correspond further with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ask for further details on the roll-out of the vaccination programme, including a timeline.  We will correspond with the petitioner and inform her that the petition remains open.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P00015/19 is from Mr. Joseph Guerin.  The petitioner objects to an official visit to the State by dignitaries and cites security fears.  Does any member wish to contribute to this matter?  No.  I propose that we deem this petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(a).  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P00030/19 is from Ms Molly O'Brien.  This petition concerns the documentation required in the Irish visa application process.  The petitioner specifically references the requirement for six months of bank statements from applicants.  The petitioner considers this a breach of privacy.  As an alternative, this petition suggests that a certificate of balance be used.  That would show the balance of an applicant's account on a certain date.  Does any member wish to contribute to this matter?  No.  I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close this petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P00011/18 is from Ms Josephine Boles.  This petition concerns mandatory training for Irish mainstream schoolteachers on spectrum disorders.  This petitioner would like to see mandatory training given to all primary and post-primary mainstream teachers in the various elements of spectrum disorders.  This would include autism, Asperger's syndrome, dyspraxia, developmental co-ordination disorder, DCD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and sensory processing disorder.  Does any member wish to contribute to this matter?  No.  I propose that we forward a copy of the Official Report of the meeting and the documents supplied by the Department of Education and Skills and AsIAm to the petitioner and also inform her that the petition remains open.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I thank everybody for their attendance at this meeting.  I propose that the committee adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 July 2019.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to meet the Ombudsman for Children and representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance to discuss the impact of homelessness on children.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children; Dr. Karen McAuley, head of policy in the Ombudsman for Children's Office; Dr. Carmel Corrigan, head of participation and rights education, Ombudsman for Children's Office; Ms Tanya Ward, chief executive officer of the Children's Rights Alliance; Mr. Louis Mooney, BL, Bar Council of Ireland; and Catherine McGuinness, Fellow.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw the attention of attendees to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and guests in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they may interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for persons watching the proceedings on television to hear and for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.</p><p>I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements made to the joint committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After their presentations there will be questions from members of the committee.  I thank all the witnesses sincerely for coming in today.  Apologies for the slight delay in having them come in but we had some business to attend to before our public session.  I call on Dr. Muldoon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the impact of homelessness on children.</p> <p>  As members of the committee know, the Ombudsman for Children's Office is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  We have two statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals.</p> <p>  The rights and welfare of children experiencing homelessness has been a strategic priority for my office since 2016 and will remain so as part of our new strategic plan up to 2021.  As members of the committee know, there has been a steady increase in the number of families experiencing homelessness in Ireland in recent years.  According to the most recent monthly homelessness report from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, in April there were 1,729 families with 3,794 children accessing local authority managed emergency accommodation.  A total of 75% of those families were in Dublin while 25% were spread across the rest of the country.  Lone parents represented more than half of the families, 58%, accessing emergency accommodation in April 2019, reminding us of their risk of homelessness.  Other types of families at higher risk include young parents aged 18 to 24 and families with four or more children.</p> <p>  A majority of families with children who present as homeless are still being provided with emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Similarly, the practice of self-accommodation continues to operate in certain circumstances.  I am very concerned about the impact of that and that there do not appear to be clear timelines in place for bringing an end to these practices.</p> <p>  As members of the committee know, the development of family hubs emerged in 2017 as an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation to provide for the emergency, temporary accommodation needs of homeless families.  While hubs may be preferable to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, they have developed in the absence of an evidence base, without an initial pilot phase or any clear public policy objectives for their use.  There are currently 27 family hubs in operation nationally providing 650 units of accommodation and my understanding is that further hubs are being developed.</p> <p>  In light of how family hubs emerged and are being developed further, we wanted to learn more about what it is like for children to live within those family hubs.  Between October 2018 and January 2019, we undertook a consultation with 37 children between the ages of five and 17 years of age and 33 parents of 43 children under five years of age who were living in eight different family hubs.  I would like to use the remaining time available to me to briefly highlight a number of the issues and recommendations contained in our report No Place Like Home, which we produced in April 2019 to highlight the views and experiences of those children living in family hubs.</p> <p>  Through our consultation, children and parents told us about what they liked about living in the family hubs, what they found challenging about it and the changes they would like to see made.  As regards the positives, younger children spoke about making friends.  Those who had access to outdoor play space and child support workers spoke very positively about those aspects.  However, several younger children could not identify anything positive about living in a family hub, with some children simply saying there was nothing positive about it.  Thirteen to 17 year olds were positive about the support provided by staff in the hubs.  Where provided, facilities such as computers, a TV room and a study room were regarded as positives.  Some older children regarded living in a family hub as comparatively better to where they had been previously, which may have been overcrowded family accommodation or hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Parents of children under five years of age welcomed the relative security and stability provided by hubs.  They also spoke about the support of the staff in those hubs.  Where provided, the good facilities and activities for their children and access to a child support worker were also highlighted as positives.</p> <p>  No Place Like Home also highlights the accounts of children and parents of the negative impact that living in this type of environment is having on family life; parenting; individual and family privacy; children&rsquo;s ability to get adequate rest and sleep; children&rsquo;s health, well-being and development; children&rsquo;s ability to learn and study; children&rsquo;s opportunities for play; children&rsquo;s exposure to aggression and fighting; children&rsquo;s freedom of movement; and children&rsquo;s ability to maintain relationships with extended family and friends.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the children we met frequently expressed feelings of sadness, confusion and anger.</p> <p>  One of the most concerning features of the perspectives shared by children is the consistency with which they referenced feeling ashamed about being homeless and living in family hubs.  Similarly, parents consistently spoke about feeling that they had failed in their role as parents.  Such feelings of shame and failure underscore the corrosive impact that homelessness can have on people&rsquo;s sense of their own dignity and worth.</p> <p>  As such, the accounts of these children and parents recall the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, who has characterised homelessness as a violation of human rights because the lived experience of homelessness "challenges the very core of what it means to be human, assaulting dignity and threatening life itself".</p> <p>  We have identified a number of priorities for action which were outlined in No Place Like Home.  Among those priorities are the following - timelines need to be put in place for ending the practices of self-accommodation and providing emergency accommodation to families via hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation; an independent, formal evaluation of the suitability of family hubs as an approach to providing emergency, temporary accommodation needs to be undertaken; and additional measures are needed to combat the stigma associated with family homelessness and to support the dignity, self-worth and resilience of children and parents experiencing homelessness.  Practical measures that need to be considered include increasing the number of child support workers, therapeutic supports and family support services available to children and parents living in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  We welcome the indications that the National Quality Standards Framework for Homeless Services in Ireland, NQSF, will be introduced nationally over a 12-month period from 1 July 2019.  However, we are concerned that there do not appear to be any plans to put in place independent statutory inspection of those homelessness services.</p> <p>  Existing primary legislation needs to be amended and strengthened to make children visible and to require housing authorities to provide appropriate accommodation and supports to homeless families with children.</p> <p>  The issue of enumerating the right to housing in the Constitution needs to be progressed as a priority.  We would like the Oireachtas to proceed with a detailed examination of the recommendations contained in the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution without further delay.</p> <p>  Following the publication of No Place Like Home, I had a constructive meeting with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I have also written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ask her to give serious consideration to increasing the practical supports, including child support workers and family support services, available to children and parents living in emergency accommodation, including family hubs.</p> <p>  I am deeply concerned about the immediate and longer-term impact that the trauma of homelessness has on children and their families, therefore, I welcome this committee&rsquo;s decision to examine the impact of homelessness on children.  I am happy to take questions if I can be of further assistance.</p></speech>

The Children's Rights Alliance is an umbrella organisation.  We represent more than 100 members.  Our goal is to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  Our work is around promoting children's rights in Irish policy, law and services.  We also provide an information helpline and legal advice services for children, young people and families so that they can contact us directly.</p> <p>  The issues I want to raise today relate to our helpline but also those coming from our members.  We started working on this issue a number of years ago.  Our members contacted us because they we so concerned about what they were seeing regarding the homelessness crisis.</p><p>Teachers were telling us they had seen children arrive in dirty clothes for the first time in their lives and that they had never seen it before.  They are seeing children arriving hungry and exhausted.  They wanted to know what we could do about it.  The ombudsman has talked about the high numbers we have at the moment.  There is no doubt that there has been a lot of Government action in this area to try to alleviate the impact of homelessness.  A good example of that would be the early years scheme that was put in place to give children in homeless accommodation the chance to be in an early years setting, to get a free meal and to get someone to look after them.  There was research commissioned into food poverty.</p><p> The other area is that of education issues.  The Children's Rights Alliance decided to take that up directly because we felt there was a particular gap and wanted to bring some attention to it.  With the support of the Community Foundation of Ireland we commissioned Dr. Geraldine Scanlon, who is in the Gallery today, and Ms Grainne McKenna to carry out a study.  They found that school was a really important source of solace for these children and that the parents would do anything they could to keep the children in school because it was their only sense of normality.  The schools were found to be doing a great job.  That was the overwhelming feeling coming through all the case studies with the families.  The flip side of that was the individual experience of children.  Parents were spending long periods travelling across the city to keep their child in school.  For example, there is no homeless facility in Bray at the moment so people from Bray will end up being accommodated in Dublin, maybe in Clontarf.  Parents could be travelling across the city nearly two hours to get the child to school.  The child will be hungry and will probably miss the breakfast club and arrive at school late.  He or she will not have homework done having spent another two hours trying to get home in the evening, will try to keep up in school but start to find it very difficult.  It is very hard to motivate oneself when one is hungry and tired.  When a child starts falling behind in school it is very hard for that child to motivate himself or herself.  That was ultimately what the researchers were finding with these children.  The longer they were spending in homeless accommodation, the greater the impact on their well-being and their mental health.  We are very concerned about the impact on their long-term prospects in school and their ability to complete school and do well there.  These are the kinds of things we are grappling with.</p><p> When we look at the homeless crisis itself, there are lots of solutions and tangible ways we can address this crisis.  These include public housing to address the housing shortage, preventative measures to keep people in their homes, and also measures to alleviate the impact of homelessness on children.  Particularly in non-DEIS schools, teachers and principals told the researchers of our report that they needed support, they needed an extra teacher or a home-school liaison officer for a temporary period to get them through this crisis.  That made all the difference for them.  They also talked about the need for a small budget to buy a meal for a child or to buy a bean bag if a child needed to sleep - these are some of the things they were thinking about - or a school uniform if the child arrived in dirty clothes.  These are very basic things but they could make all the difference for these children.  I urge the committee to look at prevention, housing solutions and measures to alleviate the impacts of homelessness.  I am sharing time with my colleague, Mr. Mooney, who will talk about the legal solutions to this homelessness crisis.</p></speech>

However, as outlined in the statement that has been furnished to the committee, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child affords the right to an adequate standard of living for children within the jurisdiction.  The courts in recent times have demonstrated a willingness to interpret domestic and constitutional obligations in light of public international law obligations on the State.  That has been seen in cases such as N.H.V. <i>v.</i>the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the right to work.  There is also a debate going on about the impact of Article 42A in respect of the right to housing and children.  The result of this remains to be seen through litigation.  It is also outlined in our statement that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its examination of Ireland in 2016 found that there were reports of major delays in respect of families living in emergency accommodation and inappropriate, temporary accommodation on a long-term basis.  We must recognise in the political discourse that those families are also categorised, quite correctly, as homeless.<br/><br/>The Children's Rights Alliance is running a campaign called No Child 2020.  The overarching principle behind it is for every child to be provided with secure and affordable housing.  That is not the case now.  Instead, we face an emergency in the homelessness crisis.  That has been outlined in the Children's Rights Alliance report card.  The Children's Rights Alliance is advocating for a best interests analysis to be inserted into the heart of legislation on the assessment of families who find themselves in homelessness.  The evidence shows that the largest cohort of people in homelessness are lone parent families.  As Ms Ward has outlined, children are being placed in accommodation far away from their schools and communities.  This has long-term ramifications for their mental health, welfare and well-being and their interactions with their own communities.  There is also a lack of suitable facilities within the emergency accommodation in which children are placed, and a lack of space, which is causing major problems for families.  We are calling for a statutory obligation to be placed on the Government and local authorities to carry out a best interest analysis when placing children and families in accommodation and to ensure that the voice of the child is heard throughout that process and that children are consulted on placements.  The other thing the Children's Rights Alliance is calling for through the No Child 2020 campaign is for a limit to be placed on the amount of time for which families can be placed in emergency accommodation.  The politics of this is difficult but the evidence through the Home Works report has demonstrated that families in emergency accommodation are finding themselves becoming increasingly institutionalised and that is causing major difficulties as well.  Those are the two immediate asks of the Children's Rights Alliance in order to be able to realise the much longer term solution of providing secure and stable accommodation for families across Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.712" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019061900002#D00300"><p>I thank Mr. Mooney and Ms Ward, who have both emphasised the need to enshrine housing rights in the Constitution.  From a personal perspective, I believe the Constitution is a document of principle but the fine detail of what that means for any matter should not be in the Constitution.  The fine details should be in legislation.  That is my view and, given what we have done in recent years, I think the public believes that as well.  On the basis that enshrining housing rights in the Constitution does not build a house, change a policy or direct a budget, are we sure it is the answer to the housing and homelessness crisis and to the 3,700 children who are in unsuitable accommodation?</p> <p>  I completely agree that local authorities should consider the best interests analysis which Mr. Mooney mentioned but there is an automatic knock-on effect that persons who are legitimately on housing lists are displaced because a family has applied and there are children involved.  Clearly the remit of the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children and this committee is to prioritise rights and protections for children and the supports they receive.  That is our role.  However, is the best interests analysis something that would by default displace individuals who are on housing lists legitimately and may be ahead of those families?  Is that the priority?  Is this similar to medical grounds becoming a priority?  If that is the case, that is fine, I just wanted to seek that clarification from the witnesses.</p><p> I completely agree on the time limits.  The evidence presented to the committee and the reading I am sure all of us have undertaken indicate the profound and long-lasting detrimental impact on children in unsuitable accommodation, such as hotels and hubs.  It has the potential to seriously damage the development of children, teenagers and young adults.  The effect may be felt for many years afterwards, as the witnesses have both outlined that these young people are unable to do their schoolwork or study at secondary or third level.  There is no dispute that these would be profound and long-lasting effects.</p><p> None of us wants 10,000 persons in unsuitable accommodation or 60,000 or 70,000 people on housing lists around the country.  There must be some way in which we can alter the manner in which we procure or deliver housing in the first place, including the planning process.  It has been altered but I have not seen major evidence of run of the mill, three-bedroom, semi-detached houses being delivered on the basis of fast-tracking.  It has all been apartments etc., which is fine.  Since everybody outside Ireland is doing that, why should we not do it too?  At the same time, I appreciate that a three-bedroom, semi-detached house with a front and back garden is something that families need; children need those desperately as there is no better space for a child to grow and be nurtured and loved than in a home with a garden.</p><p> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Ireland is a signatory, has a reference to adequate shelter.  I struggle with this as I have heard it so many times but does this change policy?  If not, which policy needs to be altered to ensure 3,700 children will no longer be in unsuitable accommodation?</p></speech>

We have seen the benefit of constitutional change over the past number of years.  Society changes and it gives our people on the ground around the country the benefit of these changes.  A survey of Irish primary school principals at the start of the year indicated that 40% of principals had engaged with children in homelessness.  The problem is spread all over the country and everybody knows someone in that situation.  There is a groundswell of opinion that we must now protect our children and families at the highest level.  We all know legislation changes behaviour.  We have seen that with the other constitutional changes over the past five, six or seven years, all of which have created a conversation, brought issues to the fore and allowed a discussion to take place.  We are asking for a discussion to take place in the Oireachtas and across the nation to ask if this is the way we want to go and if this is the sort of standard that will be set for our children so we will not allow anybody to fall into this position ever again.  Of course, this must be followed with legislation and that is where work must come from parliamentarians.</p> <p>  We must send a signal that our children and families are so important we will not allow anybody else to be in this position ever again.  It must a constitutional right that can be stood over.  This must undoubtedly be followed with practical actions but that is the best answer.  With the recent referendums on children and marriage, there was a very clear statement to the cohorts affected by the issues that we are standing by them.  We need to get to that point.  There was a constitutional referendum in 2012 around children and we have not followed through on that sufficiently.  This is one way of ensuring that does not happen again.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned best interest analysis and displacement of people from one list to another.  I am afraid that could be the sort of conversation that allows people to use the argument that homelessness is a choice and I do not want that to happen.  Again, that is a Government decision-----</p></speech>

If there is a constitutional right to a house and a safe, dignified and secure place to live that is affordable for everybody, the Government would be making a statement to those 70,000 people and the people who may be in homelessness now.  We would ensure that in future, those people would not fall into that situation.  The best interest analysis becomes less and less important as we create infrastructure.</p></speech>

I know members of the committee are aware that the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention looked at economic, social and cultural rights, and it made a recommendation on the right to housing.  Due to the complexity of the matter and the time available to the convention, it asked that the matter be considered by the Oireachtas.  That was in 2014 and we are now in 2019 but the matter has not been the subject of detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas in the way other recommendations flowing from the Constitutional Convention have been.</p> <p>  In the first instance, we would like to see that recommendation from the Constitutional Convention being subject to detailed scrutiny so the issues could be teased out.  We are very clear that the constitutional right to housing is not a silver bullet and it will not effect change overnight.  However, it has potential and it remains a stone left unturned.  In light of the crisis we have all seen unfolding in recent years, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure no stone is left unturned and the potential of the Constitution is properly explored.  The key element for us is that the conversation, as and when it happens, should not be about whether it should be done but how it can be done in a way that brings the potential to have a meaningful and constructive impact.</p> <p>  As the ombudsman was saying on the best interests issue, under the Housing Act 1988, children are invisible.  It is one of our key concerns.  As members are aware, a Private Members' Bill, the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017, has reached Committee Stage after consideration by the D&aacute;il.  It has not progressed since 2017.  It is not a panacea but as primary legislation it has the potential to achieve some very important objectives.  It would make children visible in the 1988 Act.  When local authorities are making a decision on a request by a family for assistance, the Bill would recognise the family as a family unit and treat the best interests of the child as paramount.</p> <p>  Whatever about constitutional change, there is an opportunity to effect positive change for children and families in the context of primary legislation.  Our understanding is there is, broadly speaking, cross-party support for this Bill and we would like to see it progressed.  It may be adapted or changed but we would like to see that conversation happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019061900002#E01100"><p>I will share my response with my colleague.  We support a constitutional right to housing and the time is right to seek a constitutional referendum.  It does not guarantee a house for every person, as has been noted, but it would set a clear direction to the Government about what it must do with respect to housing.  Looking at the standard and unpacking it, there would be an onus on the State to provide homeless accommodation or a homeless services response and to provide social housing to vulnerable groups.  It would also have to look at the quality of accommodation, as conditions have a major impact on the welfare of children and families.</p> <p>  There is the question of how a constitutional right to housing has been interpreted in other countries when people have taken cases under such a provision.  It has not necessarily led to a slap on the wrist for a government or that a particular person had to be given a house.  These are progressive rights so governments have had to realise them over time in line with available resources.</p><p>It puts a spotlight on the Government's approach.  Has the Government done everything that it can with its available resources to address this issue or have its decisions or actions been irrational in some way?  It would shift the direction of how homeless and housing policy are developed.  We have heard a few times about the issue with using prevention measures to keep people in their homes which would be challenged because we have private property rights in the Constitution.  The Chief Justice and members of the court in general seem to be quite open about this issue which needs to be tested.  If we had a right to housing in the Constitution, it would help to balance that issue.  Private property rights would not trump the right to housing, nor would the right to housing trump private property rights.  The courts would have to interpret both together.  As the Ombudsman for Children said, it would be a strong statement that we are about providing everyone with an adequate standard of living, including the right to a house.  It does not mean in reality that everyone gets a house but is more about the approach of the State to housing and accommodation.  That is what it means legally.</p><p> A good case in South Africa explains this.  It relates to a local equivalent of a county council which knocked down a shanty town for social housing.  It was a good goal but the court said that the authority could not knock down a shanty town and not provide an alternative for the families living there.  It found against the state.  Those are the ways that a right to housing could improve or help the decisions that the Government and county councils might be making in this area.  My colleague, Mr. Mooney, will address best interest assessments, and I will come back about developmental issues and long-term impacts.</p></speech>

The simple answer is "No".  The statutory mechanism would remain in place for assessment of people on the housing list and it would not be legally possible to displace individuals already on the housing lists.  The best interest assessment would look at where children should be placed.  As outlined already, hotels and emergency accommodation hubs are having a profound impact on children's education.  It has been seen through childcare cases in courts that parents are finding it increasingly difficult to parent young children in emergency accommodation, which is leading to major problems.  The best interest analysis would seek to assess what is in the best interest of that child's well-being, such as the facilities that the child requires in the accommodation to be able to develop and being as close as possible to the community the child is leaving and the educational establishment or school that he or she is in.</p> <p>  Through the Children's Rights Alliance "Access to Justice" helpline, numerous children as young as nine and ten have contacted the Children's Rights Alliance to try to find information on their rights.  They have outlined profound issues about having to travel to school and the conditions that they are living in.  That is why we think it is crucial that children are heard through the process and that their views are taken into account in this best interest analysis.  There is an argument to be made that Article 42A already mandates this.  That remains to be seen through testing Article 42A, which is obviously in its infancy as a constitutional provision.  It is arguably legally mandated apart from what we in the Children's Rights Alliance are advocating for.</p></speech>

My response is that if it is a guiding principle in housing policy and it does not displace people, then all it can do is state the obvious.  This is not the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government but the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  While many of us have a great deal of knowledge on housing, planning and such, our role is a little more narrow.  That sort of policy would suggest to a local authority that certain types of property that it has available are unsuitable to accommodate a family or small children.  Is Mr. Mooney suggesting that certain types of property are not suitable because a child or schooling is involved?</p></speech>

Local authorities are not under any statutory obligation to explicitly carry out this best interest analysis.  That leads to major ramifications for policy, as has been outlined.</p></speech>

For children under four who have developmental delays, we could look at intensive early years provision to catch up because they can catch up.  Educationalists working with these children and families could help them with the transition to primary school.  They will be behind everyone else by the time they start primary school and there is a general impact on their well-being, including anxiety and stress.  Children experience stress due to their parents being stressed about trying to get through the day, travel and missing out on things.  We could look at that.  There are solutions to this in education.  Some schools are doing very well already, especially the DEIS schools because they have some of the resources.  They are looking for direction and support.  One of the solutions that Grainne McKenna and Geraldine Scanlon came up with was having a number of DEIS schools working together with someone supervising who has the expertise to support the schools with their solutions.  We know that this crisis will last until at least 2023 based on the statistics as they are at present.  We need a time-limited solution to address it and to think about the school completion programme perhaps playing a bigger role in the longer term in tracking these children's development, keeping them in school and helping them to do well throughout the process.</p> <p>  The last matter is mental health and well-being.  I was recently at a meeting with the housing charities and that was raised often.  They think that psychologists are the answer.  I said that it is a much broader issue and we need a spectrum of support for these children.  It is possible to address all this through the right actions by the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Health.</p></speech>

That is becoming a norm for those 650 and, as Ms Ward said, an institutionalising effect is created because there is no clear pathway.  I will be a little bit political for 30 seconds.  Earlier this week, I saw a report which stated that 25,000 new units were being built by Government.  If we want to cut to the chase and not insert anything in the Constitution and if we wanted to alleviate all child homelessness in the country, of those 25,000 units, we should allocate 1,750 for all the families who are experiencing child homelessness and just deal with it.  That sounds very simple but it ends the problem.  Despite all the long conversations we have had about children experiencing the fact that they cannot access education, do not have a front door, cannot be in their community and cannot play outside, among other effects and everything else we are doing to alleviate it, we can actually solve it because we only need 1,750 houses.  That might sound very simplistic but it is much simpler than changing the Constitution, doing pre-legislative scrutiny and so on because at least we have a good base to start with.  We would have removed the crisis and emergency.  That is what I think we should focus on, lobby the Government for and ring-fence.</p><p>How will we use the allocation being built this year and next year?  Houses are being built.  They might not be built in the locations where everybody is but, then again, this is where there will be an onus on people to work with local authorities to ensure that if they are offered a property where there is adequate support through schools and communities, they avail of it and do not state it is not close enough to their families or X, Y or Z.  This is what we should be looking at.</p><p> The Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children and the committee should seek the ring fencing of 1,750 houses.  Then we could use the hubs for the next tier of people who need to avail of them.  We would have a strategy and a system in place.  This might be simplified but we need solutions as opposed to getting bogged down with what is in or outside the Constitution.  We should work on that on the side.  The Children's Rights Alliance displayed a card with an F but we need to display this card along with the solution.  The solution is to ring-fence and we need to look for this.  The committee would be supportive of this.  We have to have solutions.  We have to take children out of the crisis.  Last week I was critical of the local authorities and I will continue to be so until we get the systems put in place for them.  It does not need to be legislative; it is called best practice.  We need to simplify this so there is a direction from somebody in a Department on best practices.</p><p> One of the reasons we have a housing crisis is the collapse of the economy and nobody can shy away from this.  We have had five and ten-year fixed terms, which have all been maturing and now builders or whoever owns the properties are selling with a relative balance of equity.  Some of the families who bought properties and fell on hard times also are within this.  The HPL form that must be stamped is preventing families accessing social housing scheme faster.  It is a Revenue document.  If people received tax credits over the previous years, it cannot be stamped.  If the form cannot be stamped people do not qualify for social housing.  This is a huge barrier for many families trying to access the process.  It is something that needs to be looked at.  There has to be some way to support these families when they come forward.  They are the people self-referring to bed and breakfast accommodation.  They have had their own properties and feel the shame that has been spoken about.  They do not want to tell anybody.  The first time they look for support they are slapped straight back down because they do not qualify.  These are middle income earners.  They are middle Ireland.  They get up and go to work and they are trying to balance everything.  They could not hold on to their properties and they are struggling to pay the rent.  They are being held back because of this form, which is something we need to look at.</p><p> What would the witnesses like from us?  They have told us what they want in legislation but what are their quick fixes that we can push on the floor of the D&aacute;il or Seanad to intervene?  When the Minister, Deputy Zappone, intervened in the early years programme to help with buses it was a simple solution.  How can we help with the meals?  How can we ensure spare uniforms or an allowance?  What is needed within the schools' capitation budgets if spare uniforms are required because they have not been washed?  Is there is an allowance for lunches to be provided?  Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien explained it very well when speaking about a particular school where every class brought in an extra lunch.  There was responsibility within the class.  People have lot of pride.  Perhaps we should give some control back to the primary and secondary school principals so they have a budget to provide uniforms, books or lunches.  Will the witnesses tell us exactly where they are at with regard to recommendations to the Government for support on this?</p></speech>

This is what it is about.  The homeless crisis is symptomatic of a deeper problem and it is a crisis of the rental market.  The rental housing market is carrying everyone.  It is why rental costs are spiralling out of control.  If I were here speaking about child poverty I would say people on good incomes experience poverty because their incomes are being eaten because of the cost of rent.  I agree the solution is building.  On Saturday, I heard the Taoiseach speaking about building more houses this year than ever before, with 22,000.  This is great to hear, and more investment is being made, but the challenge is with regard to what is needed.  IBEC states 36,000 completions a year are needed to keep up with the growth of the population, workers coming from outside Dublin and regional centres where the crisis is hitting, and workers coming from other countries.</p> <p>  Private builders have a solution and they have an important role to play.  Some of what they are building is not having the impact we thought it would.  The reason high-density student accommodation is being built is because of the price of land.  It is the only way some of them can make a profit but actually we need far more homes.  The only solution is for the State to get building directly itself and increase the number of homes being made available to people.</p> <p>  Finland does not have a homeless crisis but had one in the past.  It addressed it through the Government having its own construction company, which built sustainable housing.  Denmark is another example.  Here, in the past, when social housing was provided local authorities provided 30% of housing.  I grew up in Cabra.  My father's family were working people.  They were not on the social housing list. They both had jobs when they got the house.  Local authorities were providing housing for working people.  Something we will have to do to address the crisis is have social housing not only for vulnerable families but also for working people on low incomes.  This is the solution.  If we really want to end the crisis this is what we need to do.  We need to get building.</p> <p>  Professor Tony Fahey in UCD has done a lot of work in this area.  The research now states big housing developments are a good thing.  We used to think they were a bad thing because of places such as Tallaght and Ballymun.  Why those places had the problems they did but do not have them now was because at that time, there was poor family support and not enough garda&iacute; doing their job investigating crime.  They are now rich and vibrant communities.  Ballymun still has its problems but this is what the finding is.  Where we have developments with just a small number for social housing and the rest for private housing we find that people in social housing get very isolated in bigger-scale developments.  We need to rethink the housing solutions.  They are all there and I hope we can do it.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte is right that there are quick fixes to some of the problems families face.  Families want the Leap card for the summer.  Is there some way to do this?  With regard to education, non-DEIS schools state they need home school liaison officers or teachers.  A family will arrive and the principal will contact Focus Ireland because there is no one else to do it.  The principal spends time doing this work to try to get a family into a home or stays late with the family in school trying to find a solution.  This would be a quick fix for those schools, as would giving them the small budgets they need.  They are not looking for big money.  The principals have said if they had a small amount of money to make sure every child was fed or he or she could subsidise something that was needed it would give the child and the family some level of dignity.</p> <p>  Some schools have come up with some very good solutions to help families.  Some of them got beanbags for children to sleep on because they noticed they were exhausted.  They were being quite flexible.  They created a room for children to have a little nap to catch up.  We could give all schools the capacity to do this or support them in what the solutions might be.</p><p>That could make a major difference to families.  We are hearing feedback from some of our members, especially in the family support and early years areas.  They want to provide more services but find it difficult to know where the children are.  A mapping exercise needs to be done to ensure we know all the hubs where children are located and all the housing developments.  For example, in a place like Clontarf all the local services have to be contacted and told the people are there so that they can start to provide the services or get the families into their services.</p></speech>

From our point of view, obviously, if there is a quick way of getting children and families into new homes, then that is a fantastic achievement.  From what I can see, unfortunately, the mix does not seem to be as good as we would like it to be.  I hear of new units, but many of them are for student or buy-to-rent accommodation.  These are smaller units with fewer facilities and less car parking.  Those living there have no need for the same level of facilities as families.  These units have different square footage.  Families are not necessarily settling into these new units.  They are not designed or being built in the way we would like.  I doubt whether we would get the numbers we want in the right places.</p> <p>  That is one crucial part of future planning.  It is okay to say we are getting 22,000 new units but are they units that will eradicate this in future?  Will they ensure we are stocked up for the future?  Much of this accommodation seems to be for students or well-paid young single professionals.  The units going up at the moment seem to be for them.</p> <p>  We have to work towards removing the crisis.  That is definitely a key point.  We also need to remove the possibility of the crisis recurring.  That is a longer-term argument.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte.  The sooner we can get children and families into homes, the better.  We have to see housing as a social good.  That is the way it has to be.  Housing is a social good and not a commodity.  That is what we need to change for the future.</p> <p>  The only tool the Dublin Region Housing Executive has is the housing assistance payment scheme.  That is what it uses to get people out of family hubs and into rental accommodation using their allowance.  Straight away, we can see the landlord has all the power.  They are the people who make the decisions.</p> <p>  We can see the problem outside of Dublin.  Galway and Limerick have no rental accommodation any more.  Cork is running out of rental accommodation.  The HAP scheme is useless or not as good as it can be in those situations and we are relying on the private landlord, as Ms Ward has said.</p> <p>  We have to get the State building again.  We have to get control of those houses and get them built for the future so that we are working towards reducing the figure of 70,000 on the waiting list for general housing.  That is a crucial part of the social good that we have to try to establish as a nation.</p> <p>  Ms Ward has referred to many of the short-term fixes.  We recommend these fixes for child support workers in the hubs to help children and provide them with better facilities or opportunities to talk.  We suggest therapeutic support should be available.  It need not necessarily be in every hub but it should be available to children and families in this situation.  We know that people are traumatised by becoming homeless.  We have heard the eloquent words about people from different backgrounds becoming homeless.  This is not what they expect or plan for.  It is not what they want for themselves or their children.  There is automatic trauma there and the longer people are subject to that trauma, the more difficult it is for them to come out of it.  Therapeutic support would be fantastic as well.</p> <p>  The Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection are now moving to bring 7,500 school dinners into a pilot scheme in September.  That is an automatic thing.  I do not know why we need the pilot.  We are the last country in western Europe to bring hot meals into schools for free.  The only good thing about it is that we now have a situation where everything is recyclable and the quality of food is high.  It would be great to speed that up.  That is a real joined-up approach and it will help every child without anyone being stigmatised for being the recipient.  That is fantastic work.  Ms Ward referred to the Leap card scheme for the summer.  That is working well.  However, we know there are major problems outside the Dublin area where people do not get a Leap card.  It is far more complicated for a homeless family to get access to free transport there.  We know about the community welfare scenario as well.  Dr. McAuley may wish to comment if there is anything I have left out.</p></speech>

It is not only about quick fixes but measures to alleviate the trauma and stress on families.  We need to consider the odds of it changing around and Ms Ward has spoken about that.</p> <p>  There is a broader point.  Mike Allen from Focus Ireland was talking about this last week.  He said the solution to homelessness is not emergency accommodation but rather housing and homes.  One of the key things in broad terms is what may not necessarily be a solution but a response now.  For example, we need to consider our reliance on the private rental sector in terms of facilitating families as far as possible to exit homelessness as quickly as possible.  We do not see that as a solution in the longer term.  It comes back to this idea of investing in housing as a social good and recognising it for what it is.  Housing provides a fundamental human need for security and stability.  We need investment in a scheme of public housing.  I know that is not a response but in the longer term, it is a question of how we think about this.  Emergency short-term measures are reactive and limited to what is possible right now, to a certain extent.  We need to ensure we do not start speaking about them as long-term solutions, because they are not.</p></speech>

It was totally unavoidable.  Forgive me if I make some comments that people have already made.</p> <p>  As some of the witnesses may know, I come from the real world in many ways.  We need to be real.  We do not know whether the people who are here today will be back again when there is another election.  That is the reality.  We do not know when there will be an election.  It could be the end of this year or next year.  Most people will be back although I probably will not be.</p> <p>  What Deputy Rabbitte said was spot-on when she talked about a solution-focused approach.  That is really and truly the only thing that works.  Ms Ward came up with a really good comprehensive list of needs.  That is something each of the committee members could take on board and fight for.  What happens if we do not do that?  We will leave this meeting today and probably file our reports but that will be the end of it.  If we want to see solutions we have to go to the people who we believe will fight for us.</p> <p>  One area I am obviously interested in is mental health.  I was busy last year with a particular campaign.  One thing stopped me in my tracks.  I was listening to a young girl being interviewed on the radio.  She said that she dreads lifting the blanket from her body when she wakes up in the morning because she knows it is the start of another day.  This was from a child in a hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  That stopped me in my tracks.  Reference was made to looking at mental health.  Looking at it is one thing but what the hell is happening?  What can we do?  What can I do to help the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children with that aspect of it?  I might not be able to do anything but I believe we should be thinking about what this Government can do for the next six to eight months, because really that is all we have.  Let us be real about it.</p> <p>  We can talk about legislation and introducing things into the Constitution but that is all long term.  I have learned one thing from being here for three years.  It has taken me three years to get a tiny tranche of legislation through the Seanad, and it is still not through the D&aacute;il.  Again, we need to be real about this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.747" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Let us look at the issues that are concerning us now.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the 25,000 homes.  Dr. Muldoon said there was a mixture, including student accommodation.  Let us find out what homes are available.  If we cannot provide 1,700 with one, let us give 700 families a home.  The witnesses should focus on certain members and get them to fight their fight.  That is what we should do for the next six to eight months.  I do not know if I even asked a question in all that waffling.  While it is wonderful to listen to the witnesses, whose reports are comprehensive, we must be practical now.  Does anyone want to respond to that?</p></speech>

It is not to undermine the short-term solutions to some of the problems that have been outlined by Tanya Ward and the Ombudsman, but there is a requirement for long-term thinking in this context.  Senator Freeman referred to a general election.  It is important that there is legal change and that rights are afforded to children which they can realise through the courts if necessary but so that they can also have those recognised by local authorities.  While they are very important, short-term solutions are not going to fix the problem.  The number of homeless families is increasing day by day.  It requires a whole-of-Government approach and that Government really grasps the problem.</p></speech>

We need to have solutions now for the 1,700 families who do not want to wait another two or three years to see what the Government will do.  Let us focus on that while continuing to work in the background on legislation.  I am not dismissing legislation.  I am saying that at the same time those families should not hold their breath because we are waiting for the Government to take this a step further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.750" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019061900002#J00400"><p>A lot has been covered and I will not repeat it.  There were a few things that jumped out of the presentations, however.  One was the interviewing of children in the Ombudsman's report.  Some children said "nothing" was their answer.  That is really sad.  It is important to read here the response of the ten year old girl who said: "Some days I didn't even want to wake up because I didn't want to face this day.  I am tired in school.  Some days I would just sit there and not even smile."  That is heartbreaking and would be for any parent whose child felt like that.  What do we do for that ten year old child?  We know we have to build social and affordable housing.  We cannot sit back and say "Let us do A, B, C and D" because there is another tranche coming in behind.  There are people out there who cannot afford the rents.  Unless we get into a proper programme, we need to build housing.  The numbers are increasing every month.  The Ombudsman's report refers also to the stigma and shame of being homeless.  What can we do in the here and now for those 600 children in the hubs to ensure they do not feel shame and are not stigmatised.  Is there anything we can do for those children who are going to school and do not even want to smile?</p> <p>  I note to Ms Ward that we went to the Minister again last week to ask for Leap cards.  He said he has no plans to introduce a Leap card over the summer period.  I find that horrific.  It is something we can do here and now as a committee with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  In that report, our teenagers say they feel isolated and excluded.  As a committee, we need to contact the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and tell him we want these teenagers to be given this Leap card over the summer period.  It will not make their lives fantastic.  It will not get rid of their stigma.  They will not be jumping around in happiness.  However, it will help them in some way over the summer period so that they are not excluded and can take part in activities and meet their friends.  It is something we can and should be doing when we leave the meeting.</p> <p>  There has been a great deal of talk about national standards for hubs.  Can the witnesses expand on that and give the committee some examples of what they would like to see done?  Does Ms Ward know whether any of the recommendations of the Home Works report have been implemented?  If so, what has been implemented and what is outstanding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019061900002#J00500"><p>We have an engagement with the Minister for Education and Skills on the Home Works report.  There was a Fianna F&aacute;il-sponsored motion on it and we had discussions on the report with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  We have had some good engagement with Tusla and the school completion programme under Noel Kelly.  However, the key recommendations, in particular those to be led by the Department of Education and Skills, have not been implemented to date.  Deputy Mitchell asked about solutions.  The Leap card for the summer is a good solution which would help to reduce isolation.  Geraldine Scanlon has discussed the need to use the provision of &quot;July hours&quot; to give schools the option of running programmes over the summer.  That is because for the 1,000 families in emergency accommodation in particular the other issue is hunger.  We do not have cooking facilities.  While that is not something about which children think <i>per se</i>, one needs to think in terms of basics about the holiday hunger issues that will face children in the holiday period.  Summer holidays are a drain for these families to try to get through and that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>On mental health and well-being, this is being driven by the structural issues.  Getting families into homes as soon as possible and reducing the amount of time in hubs and transitory accommodation is key.  The reason for the time limit is to force the Government to build.  That is one of the things we want to see.  If there is a time limit, the Government must end the use of bed and breakfast homeless accommodation and get building.  That is what we hope the time limit will do as it has had that effect in other countries.  Looking at the best solutions around mental health and well-being for children in these types of situations, in-school support is one of the better approaches.  Some children like to have psychological support outside, but most want it in the school.  It is about making sure those schools dealing with higher numbers of children who are homeless have the right number of psychologists to work with them.  It is about supporting schools with the toolkit and techniques on emotional wellbeing.  Things children could be doing include stillness, mindfulness and practices like that to help them get through what they are dealing with.  Those kinds of techniques would make a major difference.  Another solution is to have services working with children in the family hubs to provide those kinds of support.  It is about ensuring children have play and recreation facilities where they can be normal children and young people.  These things could make a major difference to their mental health and wellbeing.</p></speech>

I made the same request to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Hopefully, the two Ministers are linking up on the matter to respond as efficiently as possible.  The Deputy asked about standards as well.  A lot of these hubs have fantastic play areas nearby and within their neighbourhoods, but many do not.  We have said the standard should be that we will not allow anyone to go to a hub that does not have a childcare support worker, good play facilities, a therapeutic connection and easy access to schools.  Those are the sorts of things to start creating now.  Ireland has a history of creating an immediate solution that lasts for ten or 15 years.  We do not want to mention examples of that again, but we need to get to a stage where we provide high-quality, short-term solutions.  The target was to get people in and out of family hubs within three months.</p><p>Emergency accommodation is a bigger issue.  We need to start creating opportunities.  As Ms Ward said and as the figures have shown, it is probably going to be 2022 or 2023 before the numbers level off.  We could create a five-year contract for somebody.  It does not have to be a full-time Civil Service job for life but we can put this system in place and provide supports.  It is similar for the education system.  Many of the extra supports do not have to be provided by a high-level psychologist and it could be therapists or child support workers.  There are various ways to make sure that we make this happen in the immediate term and provide consistency around the country.  People could be doing well in a particular hub in Dublin but other hubs are not as high quality and they are less consistent, less supportive and provide less access to what one needs even in terms of cooking facilities and stuff like that.  A lot of them are glorified hotels that have installed extra washing and cooking facilities.  It is those sort of things that we can start to do very quickly and move forward at the same time trying to create opportunities for people to get out of the hubs.  I will pass the question on mental health scenarios on to my colleague.</p></speech>

Other aspects of the report are equally heartbreaking.  One of the cases that comes to mind is the five-year old who tried to commit suicide and is being minded by his seven-year old sibling.  There are children who find solace in school.  The only thing they look forward to is going to school because it means leaving the facility.  All of these issues have an impact on their mental health, which is compounded by a number of factors concerning accommodation such as a lack of space, a lack of facilities and exposure to other family stressors.  The situation is compounded by their parents' sense of not being able to parent and cope.  Children are ashamed and embarrassed and parents feel like failures, which is not a healthy scenario for a child to spend any time in as part of a family.  As Dr. Muldoon mentioned, we have argued for family support to be increased in the report.  First, family support should be part of a solution because families, as a whole, in these situations need support.  Child support workers are specifically needed to help children not necessarily deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis rather than a psychological level and to have meaningful activities and a little independence and normality.  There should then be outreach therapeutic services for children who need more psychological or mental health intervention.  I agree with Ms Ward and the Ombudsman for Children that having resources school is a good place to locate these resource  but while I do not mean to be flippant, we are back to the Leap card situation.  What does someone do for the three months of the summer if he or she has a child who is suffering with this?</p> <p>  We found that many children do not want to identify as homeless and their schools are unaware of their situation.  As Ms Ward said, they may show up in dirty clothes or hungry but that may not be enough for the school to identify them as children living in these circumstances.  We need to be cautious about where we locate services other than, and as well as, the school system. </p></speech>

We are delaying the notion of free travel anyway.  A friend of mine pointed out that people pay for the bus to get to work to pay tax to pay for the bus so we are just delaying free travel.  People using Leap card, particularly during the summer, would use the spare capacity of Dublin Bus and a card would help people who could not afford such travel.  If the Minister does not make a move on this, it would be worth talking to Dublin Bus or the Luas provider directly.  An Post, amidst its rebrand, has provided for homeless people in terms of postal services.</p> <p>  Many of the broader issues have been covered but I want to discuss LGBT homelessness.  Focus Ireland was here last week but I did not get an opportunity to commend its work alongside BeLonG To in preparing research and data on LGBT homelessness in this State.  It is a global issue.  A recent study in the UK found that a quarter of young homeless people are LGBT.  The Albert Kennedy Trust report found that 69% of young LGBT people reported that parental rejection was a reason for their homelessness.  In 2013, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that LGBT people were highly represented among Ireland's homeless and "a targeted response is required".  Are the witnesses conscious of the issue?  A hostile family environment and stigma are more prevalent than we realise, particularly for young transgender people. </p></speech>

Our direct consultations were with people who were much younger and in families.  I cannot disagree with the figures.  I can imagine the extra trauma that goes with that.  If one has been forced out of one's home as a young person and trying to come to terms with one's sexuality and identity, it must add enormously to the trauma.</p></speech>

I appreciate that for all young people coming to terms with their sexuality, whatever that may be, is a transition period in their lives and it can be a difficult and challenging situation.  For somebody trying to come to terms with that while living in a room with the rest of his or her family for a protracted period may pose particular and difficult challenges, particularly for the LGBTI community.  It may be a particularly difficult scenario for young people who are dealing with that and expressing that to be in.</p></speech>

They have told us that young people are not being represented in the general statistics because they do not out themselves.  When they are asked to identify their reason for being homeless, family breakdown comes up as one but they do not say their families have kicked them out of home because they have just come out or their families have discovered something about them.  The issue is, therefore, under reported and under counted, yet it is still prevalent.  BeLonG To and the other organisations have said that these young people need specific supports to find a housing solution.  Some of them could end up in the care system depending on their age.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Mooney wants to talk about the issue from that perspective and whether these young people should be in aftercare as well.  Tusla should provide these young people with supports such as residential lodgings, etc.  Some of the solutions might look like that for some of these young people. </p></speech>

The Senator talked about quick solutions.  The 30,000 Travellers are completely over-represented in the homeless statistics, particularly outside Dublin.  There are many solutions that are not being exercised by the local authorities, with money not being spent.  There may be something the committee could do.  Accommodating Travellers would immediately result in a significant drop in the homeless statistics.  We know from Focus Ireland that at one point they represented approximately 10% of new entrants in homeless accommodation.  If the solutions were exercised and the State took control of the issue, it would have an immediate effect on the numbers.</p></speech>

I come from a rural constituency and see homelessness presenting in slightly different ways where we have families living with grandparents or many people in one house.  We do not have hubs and for the most part do not see people on the streets.  There are some families who use vouchers for bed and breakfast accommodation.  The local authorities are quite reluctant to go beyond five days at a push.  In my office I frequently meet people who have been told to apply for the housing assistance payment and are asking for help in finding a property to rent.  However, they are not available.  The last time I searched <i>daft.ie</i>in the entire county of Mayo there were about 90 properties, even though it is a very large county.  In some areas there were no properties available for rent, but there were a number of properties available on Airbnb.  That is an issue not just in the cities but also beyond them.  Are there specific solutions for rural communities in counties such as Mayo?</p><p>It is great when families come out of homelessness and are finally housed.  On the follow-up with children who have spent a period in homelessness, there is stigma attached to it and the damage is done which they take with them.  Is there any follow-up?  Does it vary from county to county?  I presume Tusla is responsible for that engagement.</p><p>My final suggestion came from a discussion about Leap cards.  What to do with children during the summer is a problem for all parents, especially when it is raining and they do not have the routine of going to school every day.  The parents who can afford to do so send their children to summer camps such as C&uacute;l camps or Let's Go camps.  This gives them routine as they are gone in the morning and back in the afternoons, a little like school.  People who are homeless obviously do not have the resources to do so.  Perhaps as a short-term measure for families living in hubs, bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels a grant or money could be made available to allow the children to participate in the summer camps we all attended when we were children.</p></speech>

We are aware that some of the hubs have connections with voluntary organisations that allow that to happen in the local area.  Most of them are outside Dublin, in which there are one or two.  It is happening locally, but it could easily be moved forward on a national level.</p> <p>  The committee has discussed making more use of school facilities outside school terms.  That might provide opportunities for all children, not just those who are homeless.  If the playground was available or some supervised activity was allowed in the gymnasium - there are facilities that are unused for two or three months - we could possibly use them in different ways.  They are great ideas.</p> <p>  On the issue of quick fixes in hubs, one of the children suggested to us that for teenagers who could not move from their bedroom to the television room or the study without their parents and other children coming with them, we could provide perhaps a university student to oversee a teenage room in order that the parents would not have to supervise every child all the time.  That is the lack of privacy they experience in hubs.  It is something we could do quickly.</p> <p>  I am fully aware of the rural homelessness.  Each local authority does it differently.  Donegal County Council only allows a maximum of three days' bed and breakfast accommodation.</p></speech>

People are moving to where other facilities can be made available to them.  Again, that changes the nature of the demographics and the supports available to the children also.  That needs to be taken into consideration.  I do not have a set answer to that question.<br/><br/>The follow-up is crucial.  Last week I spoke to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government about the psychological impact of the first 1,000 days of homelessness for all children.  For a child who spends even 12 months in homelessness as a baby, the follow-up needs to be almost as long to ensure they will get back on track as quickly as possible.  Dr. Nowicki wrote in the <i>Geographical Journal</i>about children and families who had come out of homelessness and found a new place in which to live.  They were still feeling the impact of trauma, the shame and guilt.  They will not go away for a long time and the parents will carry them even longer than the children.  They still need to be acknowledged, recognised and worked with in order to come out of it.  It is important to find a way.  I do not know if one agency has taken this on board.  There has been so much work done in getting them out that nobody has thought about the aftercare element.  It will be an important part for the future.</p></speech>

Each co-ordinator has significant autonomy in how he or she runs the committee for the county or district.  Perhaps we might write to Tusla and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about the matter for children coming out of homelessness.</p></speech>

If housing is not available in rural communities, whether it is provided by the local authority or otherwise, how can we prevent families from having to present as homeless in the first place?  Can further measures be taken to minimise the necessity for any family having to do so, whether it be a change to the legislation or otherwise, short term or otherwise?  I appreciate the point about taking immediate measures to alleviate the position for families who are experiencing homelessness now.</p> <p>  Going back to the legislation, as I know members of the committee appreciate, the provision of emergency accommodation for families and others in whatever form it takes is at the discretion of the local authority.  In the longer term it is about legislating to create an obligation to require the local authorities to provide accommodation and supports for people, including families, who present as homeless.  I know, as we all do, that that is not the solution right now, but it is really important that those legislative changes happen alongside the taking of immediate measures.</p></speech>

The number of people in rural communities calling to gain information is much larger than it is Dublin.  The support and information services are not as developed in these communities, which compounds the problem.</p></speech>

It is perceived as an urban or city issue, but it is now being seen in rural communities also.  My colleagues in other rural constituencies are saying the numbers presenting in their offices with this problem are increasing.</p></speech>

This makes it more difficult for families to compete for private rented accommodation if rents are increasing.  On the western seaboard, I hope the Airbnb measures will make a difference.  Part of the problem, particularly in Galway, is that many properties are being used to provide accommodation for tourists when they could be made available in the long-term rental sector.</p> <p>  The countries that have been most successful in addressing housing crises are the ones in which the state has built more public housing for working people and vulnerable groups.  On the issue of urban Ireland versus rural Ireland, local councils need to build their expertise and funds, as well as the accommodation stock.</p> <p>  There is a range of aftercare supports provided by homeless services.  Focus Ireland does a lot of work with families when they come out of homelessness, for example.  One of the challenges for such a family is the having the ability to hold down a home as they could have become institutionalised when in the homeless services.  Simon Communities does this with single people who have gone through addiction, emotional or mental health issues.  However, some families do not need that support and are resilient.  They might spend a shorter time homeless and get out of it quickly.  However, there are others, particularly those who are homeless for longer, who tend to be more vulnerable.  There is probably a need for a mapping of services versus need.  The Deputy is correct that the children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSCs, are the ideal location for it.</p></speech>

There is a range of issues.  It means that the well funded services which could make a significant difference are not necessarily getting to the families in need.</p> <p>  On the issue of school completion, we know from research carried out by Geraldine Scanlon and Grainne McKenna for Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, with the support of the Community Foundation for Ireland, that their long-term educational prospects could be affected by homelessness.  There is a need to bring in the educational welfare services to work with these families early on.  A child might only need support for several months and then in mainstream education.  Someone somewhere needs to make an assessment and follow through to ensure there are no issues that a child will not be left vulnerable.</p></speech>

This led us to establish an evidence base which included drawing on previous reports, of which there have been many, and to meet stakeholders on over 40 occasions.  We undertook a public consultation, to which we received over 100 replies and many written submissions, and we felt it was important to compare the situation in Ireland with other countries, particularly other EU countries. </p> <p>  Our main finding is that the State and the voluntary sector need each other.  The voluntary sector provides 28% of inpatient hospital beds and two thirds of disability services, while the State pays &euro;3.3 billion a year to the voluntary sector to provide these services.  </p> <p>  We recommend recognising this reality and making a new start through building a new relationship of mutual trust and respect between the parties.  In our report we explain how and why we believe the relationship between the voluntary sector and the HSE has broken down and why it is necessary to find better ways of working together.  In our view this should be done through State recognition of the role and value of the voluntary sector and by recognising its separate legal status.  Equally, the voluntary sector must recognise that it is an integral part of the overall health and personal social care system with all the duties and responsibilities that arise.</p> <p>  We propose giving this recognition through a charter and a forum where the voluntary sector and the State can interact on a permanent basis.</p><p>We recommend a two-way process of consultation, early involvement, listening and learning to deliver a genuine partnership such as exists in several other EU countries.  Drawing on wider EU experience, we recommend moving to a system whereby the State decides, in early and real consultation with the voluntary sector, on a list of essential services to be delivered to the public.  The list should be based on full-cost pricing for the delivery of these services, with prices fixed nationally but with room for regional variation.</p><p> A first step on the road to this way of delivering services would be to improve data and to map service needs across the country.  We recommend including a map of difficult-to-replace services to help ensure continuity of services in the case of withdrawal of key service providers.  We recommend that the State should apply or fix national standards for commissioned services.  Obviously, the list would require regular updating.  Such a process would be more patient centred, providing greater certainty about availability and affordability of services and would have the benefit of moving the dialogue between the HSE and the voluntary sector away from the current overwhelming focus on funding to instead focus on the type of services to be delivered and their quality and outcomes.</p><p> In addition to hoping to put relations between the HSE and the voluntary sector on a new footing, we recommend separating the commissioning and service provider roles of the HSE and making the executive more accountable to the Minister and the Department of Health.  We also recommend a stronger and more visible role for the Department, including ensuring more joined-up services for users and fostering greater co-operation between Departments and agencies to reduce unnecessary duplication.  We also point out that the voluntary sector needs to modernise and improve its governance, to strive to avoid duplication and to accept it is part of delivering a national health service that requires it to take wider considerations into account.</p><p> With specific reference to the faith-based organisations that formed part of our terms of reference, we carried out a detailed analysis to establish how many there are and who owns them.  That detail can be found in the annexes to our report in particular.  In summary, we concluded that 14 of the 48 public and acute hospitals in the State are voluntary and that as many as 12 of them still have some degree of faith-based ownership or governance involvement.  This situation is changing and new decisions are being taken.  We foresee that the number of faith-based hospitals will reduce to four in the coming years.  We looked at the mission statements of faith-based organisations, examined how they provide access to services and considered issues around ethos and decor and the range of services they provide.  We made recommendations to the organisations and the State in the light of previous experience.  For example, on the issue of co-ownership, we recommend that in future, the State should own the land and buildings of publicly funded hospitals.  Where this is not possible, financing and governance arrangements should be agreed before funding decisions are taken.</p><p> To conclude, we met a wide range of very dedicated public-service-minded people in the course of our work.  We thank them for their input.  We also met with high levels of frustration in both the voluntary sector and the HSE.  We believe that a new beginning is needed if we are all to benefit from the positive contribution of the voluntary sector as described in more detail in our report.  Other countries have found ways of working with the voluntary sector in mutually beneficial partnerships and we believe this is possible here, provided a new relationship is developed based on mutual trust and respect.</p></speech>

Although there is no direct relationship or connection between our report and that of the independent review group, coincidentally, each report was researched at approximately the same time.  Although our report was published first, its recommendations are very similar to those of the independent review group.</p> <p>  I will first address why we commissioned the report.  Many members are familiar with it having attended the briefing facilitated by Senator Dolan last November when the report was published.  Early in 2017, we asked Dr. Chris McInerney of the University of Limerick to conduct the research because we and our colleagues in the section 39 or disability sector had a sense that in addition to facing many challenges, basically, something was wrong and we wanted to establish what that was.  He looked at the larger section 39 organisations which, coincidentally, are providers of disability services.  That is interesting because, as members know, section 39 organisations are supposed to provide services ancillary to those provided by the State.  However, RehabCare, a division of the Rehab Group with which the committee is familiar, is funded to the tune of &euro;65 million annually to provide disability services, which is hardly ancillary.  We are the largest section 39 organisation and would argue that our services and those of other large section 39 organisations are anything but ancillary.  They are vital.  The day services, residential and respite services we provide are essential for those who use them every day.  The first thing to realise is that section 39 organisations are not ancillary.  Rather, they are core and central to the delivery of a vital part of health services in this country.</p> <p>  Our report found that our future is very uncertain.  The extent of the challenges we face means that our future as a sector is anything but secure and, as such, the services we provide do not have a secure future.  The sector stands at a crossroads and the core, immediate and urgent issue is funding.  My colleagues will substantially address that issue.  The adequacy of funding and our wider relationship with the State as represented by the HSE and more broadly are key.  A hangover from the recession years is that many section 39 organisations are carrying a deficit as a result of underfunding and that is making them financially unsustainable.  Members will all be aware of the recent efforts of Rehab, particularly during May, to secure more funding.  I thank all members for their support of our efforts because, thanks to those efforts, the Minister and the Government agreed to provide us with the essential funding we needed, which means that the services we provide are secure.  Rehab is not the only organisation which has been facing financial sustainability issues, as we pointed out to the committee at the time.  The issue of deficits was called out by the members of the independent review group.  In particular, we strongly support the recommendation that the issue be resolved and ask the committee to call on the Minister for Health to establish an urgent time-bound process to have that happen as soon as possible.</p> <p>  We want this meeting to be the start of something.  We are very pleased to be here to outline the issues to the committee.  We are very supportive of the clear and powerful recommendations of the independent review group.  The key issue is that they must be implemented.  We want and need a process to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

The messages and conclusions in both reports are clear and consistent.  Independent voluntary disability service providers operate in the absence of a Government strategy for our role and future or adequate funding for services.  Our warning is that this will soon be unsustainable.  The people impacted on by this uncertain future are those who rely on our residential, respite and day services and who deserve to live full lives as citizens of this State with the support they need.  The "Who Cares?" report and the  independent review group report concluded that the relationship between the State and the independent voluntary sector has deteriorated and that there is an urgent need to place it on a new footing.  The conclusions of the "Who Cares?" report can help us to design a roadmap which would see the independent voluntary sector working in partnership with Government bodies to provide services for people with disabilities which promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights while promoting respect for their inherent dignity.</p><p>Those objectives are reflected in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the ratification of which the voluntary sector campaigned for and which the Government effected last year.  We should all be on the same page in supporting the implementation of the convention.</p><p> Members will hear more details from our colleagues in the sector about the deficits organisations are facing.  Our research findings highlighted that the HSE is not paying the full economic costs for services delivered.  Organisations have exhausted their economic reserves, board members are no longer willing to operate the law as it stands and, without change, more organisations will be forced to closed down.</p><p> The first step on the road to a solution would involve the Government bodies paying the full cost of the delivery of services and dealing with the immediate and urgent problem of the deficits in voluntary organisations.  As we experienced recently in RehabCare, many independent voluntary sector service providers are just a few short steps from closing down essential services for vulnerable people.  It is only a matter of time before some hand their keys over to the HSE.  I ask the committee and the Government officials here today to consider what the HSE will do when the deficits are too large for these voluntary organisations to bear.  What will happen when board members refuse to tread recklessly under company law and organisations are forced to close down?  What is the Government's plan B when - it is a case of when, not if - this occurs?  When doors are shut, what will happen to the thousands of vulnerable people who use these services throughout the country?  As a matter of urgency, the current financial deficits facing these organisations must be addressed by an independent reviewer.  Ultimately, the State must pay the full cost of delivering the services.</p><p> The second step is that the independent voluntary sector must build a new relationship of partnership with the State organisations.  We should be working towards one goal, namely, providing services for people with disabilities which protect and promote their human rights.  Why is that not at the core of the relationship?</p><p> The third step is to develop a compact to govern this relationship which sets out a clear vision and principles for interaction.  We also propose that the Government create a junior ministerial portfolio within the Department of the Taoiseach to manage the strategic relationship with the community and independent voluntary sector, including the compact.  We have a responsibility to get this right for the people who rely on our training and education and our residential, respite and day services, all of whom deserve access to the supports they need to live full lives as citizens of this State.</p></speech>

The federation is the umbrella organisation for the voluntary agencies that provide approximately 85% of the direct support services to more than 25,000 children and adults with an intellectual disability in Ireland.  All providers are governed by boards of directors, are made up of some 395 volunteers and are subject to a wide range of oversight, from Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, regulations to company law and housing regulations, where the provider concerned is also an approved housing body.</p> <p>  The disability sector is facing a critical challenge in 2019 owing to financial constraints which, if not addressed in a comprehensive way, will have serious repercussions for service provision and for people with disabilities and their families.  In 2017, financial losses occurred in 23 member organisations for which full accounts are publicly available.  The combined deficits of those companies were &euro;25.2 million in 2017.  Some boards that are carrying operational deficits are unable to sign service agreements as that would effectively mean signing off on a "reckless trading" situation which is contrary to their legal obligation as directors of companies limited by guarantee.  Some have signed the agreements as a good-faith gesture in anticipation of addressing the underlying funding deficit as part of an engagement process with the HSE.  However, if the deficit is not addressed, those agencies will be left with no option but to cut services, transfer services to the HSE, or enter into a voluntary liquidation process.</p> <p>  Several key drivers have given rise to this situation.  We have supplied the committee with supporting documentation that provides more information, so I will focus on two key factors.  First, providers have frequently felt forced to implement cost-increasing measures following HIQA inspections to avoid being in breach of the law and facing closure orders.  Boards of directors are faced with the unenviable task of meeting the terms of HIQA regulations or face legal proceedings, which has often resulted in financial deficits.  Second, the changing needs of persons availing of services, together with the higher standards required resulting from regulation, are another significant cost driver in voluntary agencies at present.</p> <p>  Due to the lack of appropriate supports, thousands of citizens with intellectual disabilities are not being supported to live lives of their choosing or to maximise their potential to live as independently as possible as contributing, active citizens.  In addition to the personal cost, this is not compliant with the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland has ratified.  Older family members are trapped in unsustainable caring roles in the community due to the lack of investment in planned supports.  Families are forced to watch key milestones in their child's development pass without appropriate intervention due to waiting lists and, in the most distressing cases, children and young people are moving into full-time care on an unplanned basis.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Shakespeare.</p></speech>

However, many of them face financial deficits which relate, in the main, to compliance with HIQA regulatory standards and the need to respond to the urgent support needs of children and adults.  The required expenditure reduction over the period 2009 to 2016 and the continued maintenance of agreed service levels over that period are central to understanding the current financial sustainability predicament.  We cannot close wards as the acute care sector can do.  The care our members provide is in people's homes as part of their regular day-to-day lives.  As providers, our members have exhausted all possible savings across management, administration, maintenance, and non-pay, in addition to savings achieved through efficiencies such as roster reviews, service innovations and attendance management initiatives.  There is a significant risk for the State arising from the lack of financial viability of the voluntary disability provider sector, where verified deficits total some &euro;25 million in the annual financial statements of those companies for 2017.</p> <p>  It is important to note the vulnerable position of volunteer company directors who are faced with intensive demands to deliver services while also meeting extremely demanding regulatory compliance requirements which have created a significant burden in both professional and reputational terms for those concerned.  The degree to which these significant stakeholders can maintain their position should be of particular concern in terms of their organisational resilience and capacity to continue indefinitely to maintain organisational service delivery.  To be clear, the disability social care sector is in a seriously weakened state in respect of both its financial stability and its organisational resilience.  This represents a serious risk for service users who rely on our services.  The provision of support from the HSE, including cash liquidity to ensure day-to-day operations are maintained, has provided some remedy for the organisations concerned.  However, it cannot and will not provide the necessary ultimate solutions to ensure an ongoing and resilient voluntary provider sector into the future.</p> <p>  I will now outline our main recommendations to establish an immediate and longer-term resolution of the challenges facing the sector.  There is an urgent need for the State and voluntary sectors to work together to implement in full the recommendations of the independent review group.  Its recommendations challenge all stakeholders, both voluntary and statutory, and provide a framework for addressing the urgent challenges facing us in supporting the future of our citizens with disabilities.  There is also a need for urgent financial investment by the State to resolve the unsustainable deficit situation.</p><p>Companies will fold.  There is an urgent need for a multi-annual investment programme to address the unmet need outlined in the supporting document we have tabled and the working group's report developed by the HSE as part of the Transforming Lives programme.  There is a requirement for consideration of a change in the approach to the application of the HIQA regulations that will move from a position of compliance to a model of service user outcomes.  It should include a legal obligation to have regard to the financial resources available prior to compliance plans being developed and accepted.  The State and service providers must work together to innovate and develop new models of integrated service delivery in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare, harnessing the capacity of the community and voluntary sector in the provision of effective social care for persons with disabilities as citizens of Ireland.</p></speech>

As outlined by my colleagues, the current crisis in the sector calls into question the value the State places on the sector and, more importantly, how it prioritises the rights of the people who depend on the services the sector provides.  The sector has grown to provide two thirds of all services for people with disabilities on behalf of the State and the continued delivery of those services is now dependent on the financial sustainability of voluntary organisations.</p> <p>  The Not for Profit Association represents the largest independent, national, not for profit organisations engaged in the provision of essential social care services on behalf of the State.  Collectively, the seven member organisations manage an annual service delivery budget of more than &euro;200 million on behalf of the State.  We employ 7,000 people in delivering services to more than 30,000 adults and children in every part of the country.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the distinctions between section 38 and section 39 funded organisations as set out in the Health Act 2004, we provide direct services on behalf of the HSE under the mandate of the service arrangement process.  The services we provide are essential, not ancillary, and annually include 1.8 million personal assistant hours, 150,000 days of service in our centres throughout the country, 40,000 respite care nights, 125,000 clinical interventions, as well as a wide range of other person-centred services, including training, education, employment and independent living.  What will happen to these services if the organisations can no longer provide them?  Their continued delivery is under immediate threat.  Our member organisations are struggling to remain financially viable, some to the point of existential crisis, following years of cumulative deficits that have eroded financial reserves.  The deficits have arisen owing to austerity cuts that have never been restored, additional costs of compliance and regulation, ageing infrastructure and general inflationary cost increases as the economy continues to grow, but there has been no equivalent increase in State funding for the services provided.</p> <p>  In 2018 Not for Profit Association member organisations reported a combined deficit of &euro;8.3 million which was directly attributable to the shortfall between the cost of delivering services on behalf of the HSE and the funding allocated by the HSE for these services.  For ten years our member organisations have subsidised the cost of providing services on behalf of the HSE from their own independently generated income and related reserves.  Those reserves are depleted and continued delivery of services is under immediate threat.  Should the organisations have to cease providing services, the HSE will be required to resource and reinstate the services at full cost to and with no scope for savings for the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The issue of deficits for our member organisations is compounded by the HSE's ongoing insistence that deficits not be recorded in the annual service arrangements process.  They are, therefore, not provided for in funding allocations and, presumably, not included by the Department of Health for consideration in future year budgets and strategic service planning.  It is further compounded where service providers do record the deficits in service arrangements, thereby reflecting the true cost of delivering services.  The HSE then threatens the withholding of 20% of the already inadequate funding, further compromising service delivery.  This practice completely disregards and undermines the organisations' obligations in statutory corporate governance requirements, as companies limited by guarantee, to ensure the accuracy of information contained in legally binding contracts.</p> <p>  The State's regard for the sector is evident in its recent handling of the pay restoration process for section 39 employees.  Having had funding cut to ensure our employees took the same austerity cuts as public sector staff under financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, they were left out of the original public sector pay restoration process that began in 2016.  Late last year the HSE agreed to a process of partial pay restoration for employees in just 38 out of more than 2,000 section 39 organisations, which will see these staff only return to 2008 rates of pay by October 2021.  Recent communications from the HSE state there will be no funding for the pension element of pay restoration when historically service funding from the HSE always covered the pension element of service related pay.  Our member organisations which are already operating with significant deficits arising from underfunding by the HSE cannot fund the pension costs arising from pay restoration.  This is likely to lead to further industrial action which, in turn, will have a detrimental impact on service delivery and the lives of those depending on it.</p> <p>  The recent communication also states there is no expectation or requirement for section 39 employees to be aligned with health service salary scales.  This seems to be a contradiction in the service arrangement process in which there is a requirement to have regard to public sector pay scales and the decades long practice of funding section 39 employees' pay at public sector pay rates.  There is now a two-tier system of pay for social care workers, with those in the voluntary sector lagging behind their public sector peers in doing exactly the same work.  In an economy with full employment this has created huge challenges in staff recruitment and retention, with a knock-on impact on service delivery already evident in our member organisations.</p> <p>  The publication of the independent review group's report should serve as a defining moment in preserving the positive impacts of the voluntary sector and its recommendations should be the anchor that will underpin a new relationship between the State and the sector.  Failure to urgently implement the recommendations made in the report will result in many voluntary organisations being forced to terminate services.  The biggest losers in this scenario will be the tens of thousands of people throughout the country who rely on the organisations for these essential services.  The Government was able to find &euro;3 billion to connect people virtually through the national broadband plan.  What is it prepared to do, before it is too late, to connect tens of thousands of vulnerable people who are dependent on the services provided by voluntary organisations for their communities and society?</p></speech>

Before I open the floor to members, I have one or two questions of my own.  I will try to keep them brief because I know others have questions.</p> <p>  On the operation of deficits and the manner in which they arise, the phrase "trading recklessly" was used by more than one person.  Will the delegates describe for us the impact on the organisations because it would be dramatic and the potential impact on service users?  For the organisations and their staff, having to read in the newspapers that there is a deficit is very worrying, but, in turn, it has an impact on service users.  I note the use of the phrase "more than a little coercive".  Will the delegates describe exactly for us what that behaviour is and how it manifests?  It is a serious charge.  There is the notion that people are somehow being coerced into signing service level agreements when they know that they will not be in a position to deliver on them and when they also know that if they do not sign them, they will find themselves in a position where their funding may be cut off.  I believe I am quoting the phrase directly from at least one of the reports.  It jumped out at me and I found it concerning.</p></speech>

When we speak about coercive behaviour - the Acting Chairman summed it up well - in the service level agreement process the HSE requires all organisations to sign service level agreements by 28 February each year.</p><p>There was a change in that practice, I think it was introduced around 2015 or 2016, where organisations were told that if they had not signed by 28 February or if they had signed the service arrangements but had declared deficits, they would be faced with a withholding of 20% of funding for those services until such time as they signed the service arrangements with no deficits.  I am CEO of the Irish Wheelchair Association and as recently as yesterday, we received a letter from the HSE advising us that because we had shown deficits in our service arrangements for this year that accurately reflect the cost of delivering those services, we will now be faced with a withholding of 20% of funding.  If that does not demonstrate coercion, then I do not know what does. </p></speech>

In 2017, we decided to include all of our deficits in our nine service arrangements around the country and the HSE moved to withhold 20% of funding.  At that stage, we exercised our right under the service arrangement to enter into the dispute resolution process and were able to demonstrate clearly that the HSE had no legal right to withhold funding under that service arrangement.  Once we had demonstrated this, the HSE rescinded its action.  However, we are a large organisation and were able to enter into the process.  In addition, we had the capacity to manage the situation during that period.  For many smaller organisations, the withholding of 20% of funding on a monthly cashflow basis is incredibly difficult and poses considerable challenges in terms of meeting pay costs, service delivery costs etc.  The measure pushes many organisations to the extent where they must sign in the way in which the HSE has indicated and that is primarily by not demonstrating that there are deficits.</p> <p>  Again, I echo what was said by my colleague whereby if we continue to produce service arrangements, which are public documents, indicating there are no deficits, then we feed into the myth that there are no deficits in the sector.  We have all been doing this for a good number of years.  As a result, there is no public recognition or recognition within the health budgets that deficits are accumulating.  This is something that is very much under the radar.  It is only through our efforts and what emerged from the report compiled by the independent review group report that the deficits and the process that has been initiated have become public knowledge.  </p></speech>

The service users and people who work in the area do so.  Unfortunately, the Department is unable or unwilling to recognise the deficits.  Presumably, that has an impact on an organisation's capacity to plan on a year-by-year basis.</p></speech>

I support everything that was said about the experience with service agreements.  Our own members have experienced that as well.  Boards of directors have been placed in a very difficult situation.  They are asked to govern organisations that provide services to people with disabilities, which is their core purpose and the only reason that they exist.  They are very driven by a commitment to people with disabilities to provide the best services that they can and respond to their needs.  They do so in an environment that has changed dramatically over the past five to ten years in terms of the level of compliance in respect of lots of different regulations.  That is very different from how things used to be.  The environment has improved for the better but there are consequences, much of which were not properly planned for, anticipated or costed in terms of potential implications.  Directors govern organisations and ensure all of those requirements are met.  At the same time directors are conscious of the unmet needs and try to respond to them.  Directors are being placed in situations where there is not proper and adequate funding for the actual cost of the services they are being asked to provide and yet must provide the services at the level that is expected.  For them to continue to do both of these things without adequate funding places them in an unenviable situation.  They do not have the finances to do this work, yet are driven by both regulation and needs at the same time.  The effect of that on the people we support is either they do not get the services they need or their confidence in the services they receive and their sustainability into the future is always in doubt.  Families who have battled for services and got them feel that they have to continuously battle to maintain them rather than being able to say, "We have won this war and we can now move on with other parts of our lives".</p></speech>

I do not think there is an overview of the size of the deficits.  Therefore, we recommended that a survey should be carried out to establish how much we are talking about.  We also felt, from what we heard, that the way in which the HSE negotiates the service agreements was to start by saying one got X last year so it will start at X minus so much this year.  The whole process is designed to squeeze down the costs.  In itself that is obvious, because one must manage public money.  There was no discussion, however, about what services would not be provided if there is less money.</p> <p>  The introduction of the 20% cut in funding has been described.  We tried to explore the measure with the HSE and the organisations.  What we also heard was that because the 20% cut jeopardises the delivery of the services, then late in the year the HSE would produce emergency financing to keep things going.  We recommended a few things.  First, in terms of the overall management of this issue, there must be a survey to discover the extent of the deficit and then a plan must be drawn up to eliminate the deficit by using more money or by deciding to not make services available.  There are not many options.</p> <p>  Second, we must move to a system of full cost pricing, where organisations must be paid for the service that they provide.  Third, we must move to multi-annual budgets in order that the organisations can make a reasonable plan and give reasonable certainty to the service users.</p></speech>

As the HSE is so big, a lot of responsibility has been delegated to it and until fairly recently it did not even have a board to hold them accountable in some way.  We felt there was a little too much distance between the Department and the actual conduct and way the policy is being implemented by the HSE.  While there is lots of international practice about delegating work like the HSE does to agencies, experience also shows that in the end, the political responsibility comes back to the Minister and the Department.  Given that, we felt that should be a stronger line of communication, including a way to signal problems between the HSE and the Department.</p></speech>

Our relationship is with the HSE.  We do not have any inroad to the Department of Health.  There are a number of national forums that we might sit on where there may be a representative of the Department of Health present but, typically, he or she is not somebody in a decision-making capacity.  There is a huge remove in our relationship with the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Clearly what existed in the past and was recognised in the 1980s and 1990s on the key role of the voluntary sector led to enhancing the partnership agreement.  The agreement may have had its pros and cons but it underpinned the relationship between the State and the Department of Health and the voluntary and disability sectors for many years, and did so very effectively for many years.  That was basically lost from 2009 onwards.</p><p>What we see today is a reflection of the absence of a strategy or policy that would determine what that relationship should be.  The result has been a rather <i>ad hoc</i>relationship in which many of the issues relating to the sector are not brought forward or addressed. </p></speech>

Many members of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies have experienced emphasis of matter being noted in their annual financial statements and conversations being held at board meetings about going concern and trading recklessly.  My organisation has a &euro;101 million turnover, a &euro;7.2 million accumulated deficit and an in-year operating deficit of &euro;3.2 million.  Our board had a serious discussion on the issue of going concern and trading recklessly and whether that would become a reality in 2019.  To manage that deficit cash is forwarded during the year on a drip-feed, monthly basis.  To add to Ms Keogh's remarks on the withholding of 20% of funding when a board member does not sign a service arrangement it clearly indicates that the organisation cannot operate with the allocation that has been received.  That is the lived reality of our members, of which there are 59 accounting for expenditure of &euro;1.3 billion across Ireland.  We do not believe it is possible to sustain this any further.</p></speech>

We could get into the rights and wrongs of the involvement of faith-based organisations in healthcare delivery but we would be here all day.  Faith-based organisations are currently involved in 14 hospitals.  Some would say that is 14 too many but the expectation is that the figure will eventually fall to four.  Does Dr. Day have a timeline for achieving that reduction?  Can she indicate where and how it will happen?  Is there a specific plan in place with a timeline or is her view based on a sense of how this will be done?</p></speech>

For example, the National Maternity Hospital has a board of 100 people, which is, according to its charter, chaired by the Archbishop of Dublin, though he has never chaired a meeting.  For us, that technically still constitutes faith-based involvement while in reality the hospital has already moved away from that.  These are all individual decisions of the faith-based organisations.</p></speech>

There are nuances and differences among those 12 hospitals.  Most of the faith-based organisations, though not all, are withdrawing from the boards of hospitals or withdrawing their right to nominate directors to boards and some are even withdrawing from ownership of hospitals.  We cannot say exactly how many years the process will take but we estimate, based on decisions we know are being taken in some of the faith-based organisations, that it will be relatively quick.  Our best estimate is that the number of hospitals with faith-based involvement will have declined to four in three to five years' time.</p></speech>

I also thank the independent review group for its report.  It makes for sobering reading and the opening statements make for sobering listening for a wide variety of reasons, from service provision and financial stresses and strains to future stresses and strains and what is described as a broken relationship between the voluntary sector and the State.  It is all very sobering stuff.</p> <p>  I will start with the voluntary organisations.  The independent review group's report was published in February.  It is 100 pages long and makes 24 very sensible recommendations, some of which are technical and relate to good governance, while others would profoundly change the relationship between the sector and the State.  Have the witnesses seen any progress from the State on any of those 24 recommendations?  Have their organisations been engaged with in a meaningful way on any of them?  A massive reorganisation and reconfiguration of the health service, of which they are an integral part, is taking place.  How closely have the voluntary organisations been consulted on and involved in the plans, which will soon be brought before the Cabinet?</p></speech>

When the Sl&aacute;intecare report was issued, it initially identified that the voluntary sector was not a key part of future plans and the relative importance it gave to disability was no more than a couple of lines.  That, to us, reflected our status in future thinking, yet we are intrinsic to a policy that aims to have our health and social care services delivered from a community perspective.  Without the home supports, residential and day services and other supports we provide, many of the opportunities to deliver alternatives to acute delivery will not be available.  We have an ageing population within our demographic and we do not see their needs being reflected.  Many of the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals on funding were geared towards opportunities for older people but not older people with disabilities.  We are not part of the consideration.</p></speech>

There has been no forecasting to 2031 for disability services, as there has been for the acute care sector.  The workforce planning report from the Department of Health, which was also published in 2017, similarly failed to comprehend disability social care from a workforce planning perspective.  That is quite significant.</p></speech>

Ms Flynn stated there is no policy or strategy, described the relationship with the State as broken and noted that even though an excellent report was published about five months ago, there has been zero engagement with either that report or the forthcoming changes to the healthcare system.  That is the most damning testimony we have of the reality of this broken relationship.  It is quite extraordinary.</p> <p>  Dr. Day also referred to a broken relationship, a phrase that clearly goes to the heart of the problem.  Why is the relationship so broken?  What we are hearing about is not a mildly dysfunctional relationship.  We are hearing that a multibillion euro essential service is being kept at arm's length by the State, despite &euro;3.3 billion of public money going into it.  Does Dr. Day have a sense of why the relationship is so profoundly broken or what we can do, not in the coming years but in the coming months, to start bringing these groups together?  That is one question.  How much strategic alignment did Dr. Day see in her work between the stated health goals of the State and the expenditure of &euro;3.3 billion?</p><p>I cannot remember who said one of the things.  It was in the report.  It was recommended that a mapping of services be provided for.  Is it the case that the HSE could not tell us today what it is getting, or what it thinks it is getting, for our &euro;3.3 billion?</p></speech>

While it is dangerous to simplify, I will do so nonetheless.  There is not a good understanding of the value of the positive contribution made by the voluntary sector.  It was present in Ireland for a long time, but it has evaporated.  The need to impose cutbacks during the financial crisis was interpreted not in a partnership way but in a command and control way, to adopt the wording the HSE often used with us.  Unfortunately, we found that the emphasis had almost shifted to the financial side.  That meant that the quality and range of services being made available to service users tended to be squeezed out.  For that reason, we have recommended that there be a new start.  In some parts of the HSE there was a tendency to amalgamate the voluntary sector with the public sector.  That is why we are recommending that the separate legal status of voluntary organisations be respected.  Their permission is needed to involve them, rather than presuming that certain services will be made available through them.</p> <p>  We have looked at how this has happened in other EU member states, most of which have a similar background in having voluntary health and social care services provided partly through faith based organisations and partly by means of philanthropy.  Unless there is a new respect for the role, nature and difference of the voluntary sector, it will be hard to fix this problem.  Now that there is a new CEO in the HSE and a new HSE board - there was no board for most of this period - perhaps there might be an opportunity to fix it.  We hope our report will make a contribution to it.  We would like the forum we have recommended to be convened quickly in order that our ideas can be discussed.  It may transpire that they are not the best ones.  There are many people in voluntary organisations and the HSE who have good ideas about how things could be improved, but those voices do not seem to be getting through.  The idea is that the forum would enable them to meet and hammer out ways to improve things.</p> <p>  Everybody understands public money is limited and has to be spent wisely.  It seems to us that people in the voluntary organisations are fully cognisant of the fact that they have to be accountable for public money, but they also believe many things could be done better.  There is a need for a change in attitude and culture.  We hope the changes at the top of the HSE provide an opportunity and a moment to bring that about.  Having been at the head of the European Commission, much of what we have heard during this discussion reminds me of when the Commission had to change its attitude from one of arrogance to one of consultation and involvement.  It was a difficult process.  The people at the top level understood it was not possible to continue with the old way.  As a result, the message came strongly that a change in attitude was needed.  That is part of our message.  We think it is important for the future that there be such engagement and involvement.</p></speech>

Therefore, the involvement of the voluntary sector in the development of policies and strategies is absolutely critical.  They are not out there but an integral part of the system.  We are very taken by the fact that this can work very well.  We saw the strengths of the voluntary sector in other countries.  It is not the case that we have to say the State should take over everything.  A great deal would be lost in going down that route.  It works elsewhere and I think we can make it work here.</p></speech>

The State, via the HSE, is paying out &euro;3.3 billion, which is a substantial amount of money.  It sounds like this figure needs to be increased for a wide variety of reasons.  How well is it aligned with the State's clear and strategic position as set out in the HSE's service delivery plan and overall objectives, etc?  How well is the money lined up with what the HSE needs?  In the light of the recommendation that the HSE needs to create a list of all the services for which it is currently paying, am I right in thinking it does not have such a list?  I may have misunderstood the point that was being made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Day" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019061900002#J00500"><p>I would like to explain what we meant.  The HSE knows what it gets for the money it pays.  Our point was that no advance consideration was given to the services needed by the population.  It is forecast that the population will grow by 1 million in the next 20 or 30 years.  Rather than start with how much money we have, how much we can spend and what we spent previously, we need to look at the population, including the increase in it, and try to come up with an idea of what those people need and what services the State should be obliged to provide for them.  Without oversimplifying matters, some continental countries involve the voluntary sector with the equivalent of the HSE.  Together they work out which services are needed in order to take care of vulnerable parts of society.  They debate how many services will be funded from the public purse and how many will be provided through voluntary fundraising.  In times of budgetary cutbacks perhaps the list of publicly funded services might have to shrink, but at least there is clarity on what services are needed, what services are to be funded and how they are to be funded.  If we were to adopt such an approach here, it would give much more certainty to families, parents and service users.  Mapping needs to take place regionally and across populations to link with-----</p></speech>

I have done work with non-governmental organisations in Ireland, America and the United Kingdom.  One of the differences I see here is that many voluntary organisations are very small.  Ten or 15 years ago a big effort was made in London to consolidate and reach scale.  It was a painful process, but it led to better outcomes for service users because it created an ability to have economies of scale, bring in more expertise and do a bunch of things that really small organisations find it difficult to do.  Is that something the voluntary sector would consider to be okay?  Does it think there is a good opportunity to consolidate to try to create a smaller number of bigger organisations?  I would also like to ask about the pension funding issue in that context.  Deputy O'Reilly has spoken about the deficit.  The funding of pensions can destroy the wealthiest of organisations.  Am I right in thinking the State is now saying it may fund some of the voluntary organisations' capital, wage and associated costs but that they will have to find the money to fund the future pension contributions of their staff?  I understand the voluntary organisations will have to raise the money to fund the 5%, 10% or 15% that will have to be put into staff pension funds each year.</p></speech>

Historically, our organisations have always been aligned to HSE pay scales.  If public sector pay went up, our funding went up accordingly.  If it came down, our funding came down accordingly.  In the current round of pay restoration we have been told that there will be no funding for pensions.  However, we already have funding that covers the pension element of existing pay rates.</p></speech>

I will give a concrete example.  One of our member organisations within the Not For Profit Association has a high take-up of its pension scheme.  That will be exacerbated next year when there will be mandatory enrolment to pensions.  This particular organisation has calculated that the impact of having to pay that pension contribution in respect of the &euro;1,000 per year increase for each of its employees will effectively double its deficit for this year.  While that organisation has been given the first tranche of funding to undertake pay restoration, it cannot do that because it cannot pay the associated pension element.  That organisation is now in negotiations with the trade unions to resolve the issue.</p></speech>

That has been partly driven by decisions between those organisations themselves regarding what was in the best interests of the future of services or for financial or governance reasons, etc.  Those are some examples of what is happening.  I know from our membership that there is certainly an openness to exploring those options but there are also questions.  Some of those questions concern the underlying assumptions regarding what mergers and acquisitions achieve.</p> <p>  There is also concern about the importance of the relationship these organisations have with the communities of which they are a part and trying to maintain the right balance of scale.  There are questions on how to maintain that connection to communities and how to do that well, while, at the same time, making changes on a scale that could bring about the type of efficiencies mentioned.  Becoming involved in these exercises, however, comes with costs as well.  They may be time bound, but there are transition costs and a need for resources.  If these kinds of mergers and acquisitions are to happen in a serious way, the role of the State in facilitating them will be important.  Rather than two organisations inventing the wheel and two other organisations then reinventing it, the sharing of learning on process, etc., could be usefully facilitated by the State.</p></speech>

I have been raising many questions in this area for some time, including some weeks ago in the D&aacute;il with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who accused me of frightening people.  What we have heard today justifies my raising of the issue.  I have also tabled a number of specific parliamentary questions.  I will not embarrass the Minister of State by the referring to the fact that no information was received in response.  We had an example of the real problems that exist in the first five minutes of today's meeting.</p> <p>  The issues in this sector are coming to a head due to the report that has been carried out.  I believe this is a crisis, which is one of the greatest crises facing healthcare in this country.  It has been suggested that these organisations provide ancillary services but that is not the case; they provide essential services.  I have been fighting for two years on behalf of a young man from Waterford to get him full-time residential care.  That has not happened because there are no services to be found for him.  That is a crisis for him and his family.  No funding is available to provide the required services for him because the package needed would probably cost &euro;250,000.  That is just one example.  When we break this issue down to individuals and how they are affected, I have an image in my head of that young man. </p> <p>  I will ask some specific questions because what happens at this committee is monitored closely by the Department of Health and the HSE.  They need to start paying attention to what is happening here.  Some of the staff in the HSE, in particular, are excellent people.  Off the record, those people will admit that they know that this cannot go on.  How I do I know that?  They tell me the same thing.  This situation has to come to head and, hopefully, this meeting will facilitate that happening.  We cannot go on the way we are.  I have some specific questions on the deficits.  How much is the total deficit?  I know this will be a matter of guesstimates to some extent, but how much do the witnesses reckon is the total deficit in the sector?  I refer to the deficit in funding for current services right now in June 2019.  I have heard the figure of &euro;30 million mentioned.  Is that accurate?</p></speech>

There are other organisations, however, outside of our groups and we cannot speak for them.  The overall deficit is, therefore, more than &euro;30 million.</p></speech>

It is difficult to know and that is part of the problem.  Some work needs to be done on getting an accurate figure.  Concerning our own members, based on the 2017 accounts we know the figure was &euro;25 million.  We do not yet know what it will be for 2018 because those accounts are still being filed.  We also need, however, to examine what has been accumulated in previous years because that also needs to be added to this total.  The amounts concerned are probably lower the current deficits because this situation has been worsening.  That is certainly the case with our members.</p></speech>

Other organisations are not members of the umbrella groups present and, therefore, we can increase that overall total for deficits.  It would not be an exaggeration, therefore, to state that in 2019 the historical and current funding deficit overall is somewhere in the region of &euro;40 million.</p></speech>

Another issue concerns the hands-off approach of the Department of Health.  That is obvious.  It outsources responsibility to the HSE.  The HSE then works with the umbrella groups to outsource service provision to the member organisations.  The witnesses have outlined in detail how they have to balance corporate governance, company law and trading recklessly versus moral issues.  The dependency of the users on the service providers must also be taken into account.  That is a difficult position to be in.</p> <p>  This situation has been constructed and facilitated by the HSE.  The Department of Health is aware of what is happening.  It is a process whereby the HSE is effectively facilitating the potential for reckless trading, in some cases.  The dichotomy is that on one side there is a necessity to behave in a certain manner while, on the other, there is no way in which we want services to be taken away.  That is an impossible situation for all of these organisations to be left in.  It is not the fault of the organisations.  I know, however, where the finger of blame would be pointed if there were to be any issues.  It would not be at the Department of Health or HSE.  The finger of blame would be pointed at the witnesses' organisations.  That is not right. </p> <p>  I want to focus now on the process that happens each year.  I ask that the committee be sent a copy of the letter sent to the Irish Wheelchair Association stating there would be a cut of 20%.  I also wonder whether it would be possible to canvass all the organisations that the witnesses represent and find as many of those types of letters as possible that have been issued in the past three years.  I ask the witnesses to forward all of those letters to the committee.  I make that request because it would be good to get a sense of the scale of what is going on.  I am sure that the Department of Health will be delighted that I have asked for those letters.  Let us tease this out a little.  If I am wrong here, just stop me.  Each year negotiations start in respect of the provision of the contract-----</p></speech>

There is no negotiation.  As Dr. Day rightly pointed out when she described the process, an email comes out with a service arrangement template which effectively states: "Here is the number that was in it last year so here is the number that is in it this year", or it may be a smaller number.  That is the negotiation.</p></speech>

We have done that for the past three years.  Like the Rehab Group, we also evoked the dispute resolution process successfully, and we will be doing it again in the coming days if this is not resolved.  We would have some back-and-forth exchanges but it never changes anything.</p></speech>

For example, if we were being advanced cash this month, it may be coming off our December payment.  To a point it is within year but by the time one reaches the end of the year, nothing has changed because one's underlying financial position is still challenged.  Effectively, one has a loan from the HSE, which has to be repaid to it.  One is beginning the following year with, say, &euro;500,000 - the number does not matter-----</p></speech>

However, if one looks at the published accounts of a number of large voluntary organisations, one can see clearly that there are both going concern conditions put in by their auditors and the clear indication of how much money the HSE has had to advance those organisations in terms of functioning.  That would be some of the larger voluntary organisations.  That information is very clear within their published accounts.</p></speech>

There is a significant deficit.  The contract is sent.  There may be some form of minimal negotiation.  The contract has to be signed.  If not, a 20% cut is imposed.  As a result, organisations have to fund their operations in a different way, which means they have a larger deficit.  As a consequence of that, some organisations are now coming under increasing pressure and, even in January, require to get advances from the HSE.  The HSE is providing millions of euro in loans to fund the gap created by the funding deficit as regards the equation versus actual service provision.  As a consequence of that, there are examples of the HSE putting in other funds to keep service provision in operation where organisations are in very serious situations.  Following on from that, the deficits keep growing year on year as a consequence of what I just said, and there is no end in sight.</p></speech>

It is a crisis and the public now knows about it because we have elevated it here and highlighted the detail.  It cannot continue.  The Minister accused me of scaring people.  This is not scaring people.  These are the facts.  We must continue and elaborate on the service provision so that the young man in Waterford I spoke about can get a service.  We cannot continue the way we are now.</p> <p>  I want to bring it up to the next level.  The report done by Dr. Day is excellent and needs full implementation.  We know that.  When I asked the Minister of State about this he said that he and the Minister, Deputy Harris, intended to establish a new dialogue forum between the relevant Department organisations and so on and to "strengthen the relationship".  We heard from Dr. Day when responding to questions from some of my colleagues that since the report was produced, there has been zero dialogue.  Is that accurate?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be familiar with the recent situation in RehabCare, where the board of the Rehab Group found itself in a situation where it could not countenance the effective conflict between the reckless trading and our commitment to delivering services.  We were then forced to say publicly that the board had no option but to say that the service agreement would have to be terminated, and to give notice that the service agreement would have to be terminated to stay within the law.  We were talking about &euro;2 million, which in the context of the size of RehabCare is small, but without that &euro;2 million we would be in a situation where we were ready for liquidation.  That is what happens.</p></speech>

I think there are organisations which are very close to that, not because they want to be but because they have to be.  It is a case of asking whether that needs to happen before it is taken as seriously as it needs to be taken.</p></speech>

It very nearly happened.</p> <p>  The picture I painted in dialogue with the witnesses is where we currently are.  Obviously, to everybody present, the most important thing is service provision.  I outlined the requirement for future service provision as well, which is high demand.  When I talk about full-time residential care, I believe that specific area alone and where we are leaving people is embarrassing. </p> <p>  How do we fix this?  We know that it requires the 100% implementation of the report.  That will take a period of time, if there is a commitment from Government.  Today is a shocking day and it is an embarrassment for the Government and for the Minister.  It is obvious that the commitments they have made are not being honoured.  It is obvious that what they have said is not being honoured.  What are the first steps to take to force the Government into a direction?</p></speech>

First, a costing methodology for disability services has never been bottomed out in Ireland.  Several stop start attempts have been made at it, so until we understand how to cost disability services, we will never reach that platform that is referenced in the independent review group, IRG.  Implementation of all aspects of the IRG recommendations is taken as read but a costing methodology is very clearly intrinsically linked to the financial viability and the service provision aspect.</p> <p>  There is a false assumption that the service provision in disability social care is static.  We are seeing an explosion in young people with very complex needs-----</p></speech>

Equally, at the far end of the spectrum, we are seeing men and women with disabilities who are older and are surviving much longer than they would ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  We are also seeing an increase in population, and for the first time since the Famine the population the risen beyond 5.5 million.  There is a requirement for a health service capacity review for disability and social care to map out and scope out the scale and extent of disability social care provision and to plan for it in the context of multi-annual budgets that are sensible.</p></speech>

A review of the service agreement part 1 was due to take place last year, and ironically because of the IRG report that review was deferred until the outcome of the report was known.  It is being deferred continuously and as recently as last week, we were told the meeting that should have kicked off that process was not happening because the Department of Health and the HSE have not met to discuss the recommendations of the report.  I think that would be a very useful step.</p></speech>

It needs to be recognised, as Deputy Kelly stated, by the Department and, in particular, by the Minister.  Actions need to be taken.  As we speak, the house is falling down right around us.  It will not be built again unless action is taken.  We have a great deal of analysis, recommendations and we have put our figures in front of members.  It is urgent that action be taken.  What we need is a commitment from the Minister and from the Government, because the Department that has not been mentioned today is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There was a reference to the change in the relationship from partnership to command and control.  We have identified in our report that the change in culture has been driven very much by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but obviously it is Government policy and a cultural issue.  That needs to change.</p> <p>  In the short term, there is a crisis.  First, it must be recognised that there is crisis.  We must admit there is a funding problem, because without the funding the house will fall down, as we know.  Let us get some scaffolding in place to hold it up.</p></speech>

That is a very useful starting point.  I am a little concerned about the direction in which we tend to go at some of these meetings because it would appear that the Government seems to be in some way blocking or impeding progress in terms of delivering much-needed services to a very vulnerable group in society.  I want to state emphatically that is not the case.  The Minister is fully conversant with the issues, but the issue that is arising now is different.  I have a number of questions on it.</p> <p>  If we attempt to fund all the organisations and the country itself by way of public acclamation, we will soon be back in the place we were in 2008 but only worse.  That is an issue we need to take on board and learn carefully from it.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether we want to be back where we were in 2008, nationally bankrupt.  We do not, because we will not get salvation from any quarter the next time, it will be our own fault fundamentally and we will be left with it.  We need to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  I used to be a member of a health board for a very long time.  How do the service providers see themselves?  Do they see themselves as being contracted to provide a service?  Who is contracting the contacting body?  Is it the Department of Health, the HSE, both or something in between?  I would like an answer to that question.</p></speech>

The services are being provided on a contractual basis.  I agree, as that is my understanding as well.</p> <p>  To what degree does that entail the Department of Health or the HSE providing support for pensions or for other services?  In my view if one has a contract to provide a service, it entails everything.  One brings one's baggage to the contract and one provides everything oneself.  I provide everything myself if I am a contractor, in the same way as a builder or somebody else.  To what degree have the witnesses found that it was necessary to call on the RehabCare voluntary fundraising activities, the HSE or the Department of Health to assist in such issues as pension provisions for the future?</p><p>That is another question. </p><p> To what extent has consideration been given to the multiplicity of organisations that appear to be engaged in the delivery of vital and sensitive services in the same marketplace, in competition in some circumstances, particularly with regard to voluntary fundraising?  How do voluntary bodies fit in there?  Would some degree of amalgamation might be beneficial?  For example, the HSE - and the health boards in the past - has certainly attempted to provide services under respective headings from within its own resources.  The other issue is the voluntary sector, which consists of many and various compartments these days.  I respect the voluntary sector for what it does.  It does a great deal of work.  The religious parts of that have been referred to on numerous occasions.  The country was quite happy to accept the services provided by the voluntary sector in years gone by.  We cannot state that we do not want an organisation because it represents some religious group but that we want the services it provides.  We are being hypocritical in how we look at some of those issues.</p><p> How do voluntary and non-profit bodies see themselves fitting into the fabric of services provided by the HSE or the Department of Health?  Our guests had a meeting with Laura Magahy.  How long did the meeting last and was it satisfactory?  Did Ms Magahy provide any indication of future prospects around interaction?  Will there be a further meeting?  The cost of providing health-related services are growing all the time and will continue to do so.  Even in the context of the very extensive budget of the Department of Health, &euro;3 billion is a great deal of money.  The extension of the cost of the services is likely to continue based on information to date.  What is the likely outcome in terms of the necessary increase in taxation to fund it?  That is the only way it can be funded.  The Minister does not stick his hand into a back pocket to find money.  He does not refuse to find money either.  He wants to help out and the Department of Health wants to help for obvious reasons, including political ones.  There are all kinds of reasons.  The creation of the belief that in some way the Minister is opposed to providing the necessary services is completely wrong.  Everybody has to look at how they present the picture in that context.  If we do not, we are heading back to 2008.  If we want to go back to 2008 in respect of the national finances, it might be a learning process.  It might be a hard way to learn, but also necessary.  Maybe the country has to go broke again in order to illustrate fully the seriousness of the situation in which we find ourselves.</p><p> I have restricted my submissions so far and I intend to come back in.  I have a final question for now.  Has any evaluation been made of the extent of the increase in income tax paid by the public on a weekly or monthly basis?  It would be helpful if we were given some indication of where we might have to go in future.  If we do not pay for the services, we lose them.  If we do not provide the funding through taxation - and it does not come from anywhere else - the services will go too.  We are caught in a cleft stick.  I have had dealings with all of the voluntary organisations represented here and many of their subsidiaries as well.</p></speech>

As an organisation that contracts with many other bodies in this jurisdiction and outside it, the essential difference in the relationship is that in other contractual relationships we are in a position where we can build in the costs relating to running the service, employment, pensions and so on for our employees as well as being able to build in sufficient margin to develop our services.  As not-for-profit organisations, we are not putting out money back for shareholders but rather back into services.  Our relationship with the HSE is as described earlier where we are informed "This is the money you got last year and this is the money we are giving you this year".  The room to increase funding to drive a surplus to sustain an organisation into the future for all of those areas is not there.</p></speech>

In a contracting situation, the reference to the terms on which the response comes from the person or the organisation to whom we provide the contract is not really relevant.  The relevant issue is the extent of what we propose to provide under the contract and the cost to the person to whom we are making the contract.</p></speech>

The detail of that particular service is what the contract is going to entail, not in respect of some ancillary issues that might add costs afterwards.  In respect of Government contracts, it is illegal to qualify a contract or to extend it beyond its original terms.  My question still remains.  This is a fundamental issue.  If the contract is not properly set out by Government or the person advertising it or if it is not responded to properly by the organisations proposing to provide the contractual service, we have a problem and do not know where we are going.</p></speech>

We were asked first to perform a factual assessment of the situation.  The reason we recommended mapping the services was that we felt there was not a good overall understanding of the services that were needed and what it really cost to provide them.  That is why we raised in our report the question of the ballooning deficit.  It was simply being put to one side as though it did not exist.  We recommended the mapping of the services because we need to know what the extent of those services is and the State needs to indicate how many of the services that are needed it is willing to provide for.</p><p>The State must then decide whether it should provide for them through the public system or whether it should contract out to the voluntary sector because it feels there is a positive value in working with that sector.</p><p> The question about the large number of organisations came up and we looked at that as well.  We did not make a recommendation to consolidate because we feel that, in many cases, proximity to service users is part of the extra that the voluntary service adds.  The reason we recommended that the State should have a rolling list of services that it commits to fully funding is because then it would be possible to be clear with people about what services would be provided.  We made the point that, for example, one could not prevent a group of concerned parents from setting up a voluntary organisation if they felt they could help in some way but, equally, they could not have an expectation that the State would fund whatever they decided was needed.  This why we need clarity in terms of what services are required by the population and how much of those services the State is prepared to provide.</p><p> In the context of the negotiations with the HSE, we are not starting afresh; we are coming from an historical position.  We are coming from a situation whereby the HSE wants to provide the services but has a limited amount of public money.  Instead of looking at the services that are needed, it and, to a certain extent, the organisations are looking at it as being a case of "Well, we are here because we are here and we need to be funded to continue."  We felt that this was not a sustainable situation and that what we needed was to be clear about which services are to be provided and by whom.  The full cost must then be paid, particularly if one considers what might happen if, to use the expression used earlier, the voluntary sector "throws back the keys".  If the latter happened, the would have to step in and provide those services.  One needs to look at the cost of that and decide whether it is better value for the public purse to do it through the voluntary sector - taken in the round, not only financially but also in terms of the quality of the services that are offered - or whether it is not sustainable because the voluntary sector does not have the capacity to do it.  If the latter is the case, then provision must be made, from a budgetary perspective, for the public sector to provide it.  What we were trying to recommend in our report was that the factual basis needs to be established.  As a result, we suggested that the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform look at the deficit situation, put a figure on it and then work out how it will be absorbed or what services will be cut if it cannot be absorbed.  There is a need for greater clarity on the factual situation and then a strategic discussion about what services are to be provided and by whom.  This needs to happen before one can put a cost on it.</p></speech>

It produced a report which projected that an additional investment of &euro;200 million per annum for a five-year period was needed, based on cost at that time, in order to meet known and future need.  My understanding is that this is being updated by the Department of Health, which is looking at a ten-year project to build on that.  That is the kind of cost at which one would be looking in terms of meeting current and future need.  That does not include the type of issues we are raising around deficits or dealing with the things that are there.  They would be on top of that.  That is the kind of scale of investment we think is needed.  That was work done by the HSE.</p> <p>  Part of the challenge in respect of the work in which we are involved relates to the challenges around contracting for services.  We are in support of people who travel along the whole-of-life journey.  We can engage with the HSE today to agree a budget for the provision of a service to a person but that person's needs can change quite significantly tomorrow.  What we do not have is a system that permits renegotiation when those things happen.  They are real-life situations.  We cannot and will not abandon people in those circumstances but we need an arrangement with the State because, on the one hand, the State has a finite resource and has to manage within that resource and, on the other, we need something flexible and adaptable enough for us to be able to engage properly around when those changing needs occur and to be able to respond to them in a reasonable way.</p></speech>

I am mindful of the fact that we cannot negotiate pay agreements in this or any similar forum.  It we were to do so, we would need to abdicate our various responsibilities, walk away and stated that this thing is out of control and cannot be resolved.  Incidentally, that was one of the matters on which previous Minister's opined over the years but-----</p></speech>

We do not necessarily know where it will arise but we could anticipate that there would be a certain level of changing need over the course of the year.  The other thing I would say about some of the deficit situation for organisations like ourselves is that, in the past - and I do appreciate that it was in the past - when the HSE ran into financial difficulty, it was able to go back to the Oireachtas and get a supplementary allocation.  We were never included in any of those supplementary submissions so our need, particularly for voluntary providers, was not necessarily included in the ask.</p></speech>

Some of our historical deficits might have been addressed at different times and in different ways but the system did not allow for this.  That has been a contributing factor part of the frustration regarding how we are arriving at a position like today.</p></speech>

She had 104 actions on the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, none of which related to disability.  She was very cognisant of that and recognised the fact that throughout 2019, she needed to capture data so that it would be built into the 2020 Estimates.  That was her commitment to us when we met with her.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's earlier points around costing, we have a national database that profiles, for the most part, individuals with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>However, it has less capacity to profile individuals with autism and physical and sensory disabilities.  Certainly, on a preliminary review, in the period from 2010 to 2018, inclusive, the country saw a 35% increase in the number of men and women with intellectual disabilities and a 240% increase in the number of people over the age of 65 years.  For the ordinary population that requires increases in health, dementia and social care supports.  We have not done anything similar for disability social care services.  I understand this is something at which the HSE is looking and to which the voluntary providers are committed to contributing.  There is no equivalent for what the acute care sector calls the exotic or unscheduled care budget for disability social care services.  When these changed needs present in a person's daily functioning, we have no budgetary capacity to meet them other than by overspending for the sake of safety.  These are really important things the committee ought to be aware of.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that, to coin a phrase, the independent review group has done the State some service, as will become manifest and for which the three representatives need to be thanked, as do those who are providing the support they receive in doing that work.  My colleagues have made several useful and interesting points.  To put it mildly, we have excavated a range of concerns and issues.</p> <p>  My first question is a speculative one for Dr. Day.  Are public bodies and the political system threatened by the voluntary sector as an equal partner, a conscience and critical friend?  How might the broken-down relationship be put back together?  What are the first three steps or the key pieces of that process?</p> <p>  There is an idea of health being a resource for living and well-being, something that supports people in being out and about, rather than simply being cared for in a health setting.  This point was touched on.  Is this being considered as something valuable in what I would call the investment, rather than the cost, made from the public purse?  I will put it in industrial relations terms.  Could this be the productivity element that will bring us from deficits and under-funding?</p> <p>  Reference was made to other EU countries that had got it right.  To get us to use Google in the right place, about what states are we talking?  Mr. and Mrs. Google are our saviours.</p> <p>  In effect, the faith-based organisation sector was one of the spurs for the independent review group in starting its work.  It is interesting how it has moved from it.  I have in mind the idea of charity status and the Charities Act.  For charitable purposes is a concept that dates back hundreds of years, long before the Republic, the Free State or anything else.  It comes from an altogether different world view when kings were appointed divinely.  Now we have the notion of public benefit which the Constitution sets out in secular language.  It underwrites the connection between the old-fashioned terms of charity and charitable with public benefit.  The Constitution also includes fundamental freedom provisions.  Reference was made to a point about a group of parents.  The Constitution refers to the right of people to form associations and unions.  It does not give them the right to send in invoices to be returned as paid within 30 days.  That is understood.  Can the review group representatives offer some thoughts on whether that could be a way to bridge the traditional concept of faith-based or charitable purposes with public benefit or the public good?</p> <p>  I will come down to more testing or immediate issues.  The new head of the HSE was before the committee smartly after he was appointed.  He brought with him a letter he had written on 14 June.  Two things in it interested me.  The first was the statement that the director general held the line absolutely on the budget he had been given.  We know that the footnote is that every year we have seen the budget broken such that the State has to come in with a Supplementary Estimate.  We now have the idea that this cannot or will not happen or that it could happen but will not happen.  My second point is allied to the first.  The director general stated the HSE had to earn the trust and confidence of its funders.  I put this point to him on the day.  He is suggesting people who are not receiving services, whether they are disability or elderly care services, will have to wait until a public body earns the trust and confidence of another public body.  I simply do not know what words to put on that statement, but it is a serious place for public bodies in which to find themselves.  From our point of view and that of the people we want to serve, that leaves them well and truly out in the cold and there are many of them.  There are deficits and unmet needs.  We also have the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council giving us a financial weather forecast.  Let us also bring it in.  There is considerable competition in public spending.  The issue arises as to whether the base of &euro;60 billion has to be looked at or whether we keep looking at the portion on the edge that is considered to be extra funding.</p> <p>  I turn to the disability organisation representatives.  I am someone who lives on both sides of these tracks.  That is my position in the here and now, not only in the past.  I will attend a board meeting tomorrow of the Disability Federation of Ireland, of which I am chief executive.  I will attend our annual general meeting.  We are dealing with a 20% deficit in funding this year, as are others, because of reductions made earlier this year by the HSE, about which I am not moaning, as we all know it.  I have it also in being involved in the Seanad which is a great privilege and honour.  It is a valuable position to be in.</p> <p>  Section 38 and section 39 organisations provide ancillary and essential services.  Perhaps some of those present know this off by heart.  I have in mind two organisations, Ability West and the Brothers of Charity, both of which are based in Galway.  One is a section 38 organisation, while the other is a section 39 organisation.  I defy anyone to put the thickness of the paper I have in my hand between either of them.  That is one of the great lies in all of this.  Do the disability organisation representatives wish to comment on that matter?</p> <p>  The current narrative emerged during the past couple of decades.  It was different in previous decades, for example, when I started work in the Irish Wheelchair Association.  At the time, we might have met the Minister if he or she came to open something and do whatever else.  I am paraphrasing, but the Minister would say to us that when the Government got some money, we would be looked after.  It got money and we know exactly where we are today.  Something has shifted in the past 20 years.  That is one of the conundrums.  The narrative now is that there are too many organisations with inefficiencies and that there is duplication.  The view is disability services are getting almost &euro;2 billion annually.</p> <p>  My next comment is for the committee.  We need to have some analysis or receive some response smartly from the three connected entities in the public arena, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>We know the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is always busy elsewhere.  I cannot see, however, how it, with any honour, could refuse to be part of this conversation with this committee and others.  I am sorry that my colleague, Deputy Bernard Durkan, is not here.  I found some of the things he said confusing.  I am coming to a conclusion after these points.  Deputy Durkan stated that he respected the voluntary sector for what it does.  He continued by saying that as a country we were happy to accept the services provided in the past and now.  I will put this point to the voluntary organisations.  As somebody who has grown up with and has a great gr&aacute; for voluntary participation in this republic, I find it hard to hear what Bernard said. </p></speech>

I know he made a different statement later.  I was deeply involved in this sector at the time.  I was on the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, then and we did reports on this whole business and the cause of the crisis.  I do not know how what happened then could happen again because voluntary organisations are standing up for the people they see day in, day out.  They do not see people in the context of reports.  Let us be clear about this.  These organisations are dealing with people who are in front of them every day.  I know the Chair wishes me to conclude.</p></speech>

I was in New York last week as one of Ireland's representatives at the conference of states parties at the United Nations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was also present with his officials.  I stated in the general debate that Ireland is serious about implementation and wants to make progress.  My instinct is not that our State does not want to do the right thing.  However, we have to go about this in the right way.</p></speech>

Regarding the first point on whether the Department and the HSE regard the critical friend of the voluntary sector as a threat in some way, I cannot speak for them.  Let me take the question in a different way.  In our report we state that one of the strengths and one of the positive contributions of the voluntary sector is its ability to advocate, champion and say uncomfortable things.  We felt that was important in a democracy.  Those who work in the public sector are not free to criticise public policy.  I cannot remember the exact wording we used, but we stated that the role of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the voluntary sector in this particular case is necessary to keep challenging the system to deliver the best that it can deliver.</p> <p>  Turning to the second point, the other European Union countries we looked at included France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium, among others.  A European Observatory on Health Systems and Polices exists and gathers much comparative data which is very useful in looking at how other European countries are doing this.  We all know that there is no country on earth that does not have problems in its health sector.  We are not stating that everybody else has got it right and we do not.  We are stating that there are interesting things to learn from what others are doing in this area.  I hope that what comes through from our report is that there are problems but that they are fixable.  That should be our goal.  We should be trying to find a way to bring the parties together to fix these problems.</p></speech>

Regarding the point made on the lack of difference between section 38 and section 39 organisations, I think that is correct.  It would not be possible to slip a sheet of paper in between the services provided, the language used in the legislation and in the contracts and to distinguish one as ancillary and the other as essential.  That makes no sense when they are exactly the same services.  This raises a core issue as to how we as a State and a country look at all our citizens and how we judge them.  If we look at the services being provided by one organisation and we describe them as ancillary but exactly the same services as essential services for somebody else, we are saying something as a State to those people with disabilities regarding how the State views them.  I do not believe that is how we think about it.  We want to treat everybody equally.  Our legislation and language, however, undermines some of that desire.  We end up with differences regarding how staff are being paid for doing the same job depending on which organisation they happen to be employed by.  That states something as well about the people in receipt of those supports and services.  We have to be cognisant of that too.</p> <p>  Turning to the point made about avoiding going back to 2008, we as service providers are really conscious of how the economic downturn affected people with disabilities in Ireland.  It affected all citizens but we have to be mindful that it had additional consequence for those people with disabilities.  There is no way that we want to cause or participate in a process that brings the State backwards.  That is not what we are about.  It is important for us today to name the issue.  We know we have a stake in the resolution of this problem.  We made the point in our opening statement that the IRG recommendations are challenging for everybody.  It is not just the State that has to do things.  There are things in there that we will find challenging as well and that will require us to consider how we are doing things, how we are using our assets and many other aspects.  If we are looking for the recommendations to be implemented, it behoves us to state that we are committing to something as well.  That has to be to work jointly with the State so that we do not go back to 2008 and we do not get into this belief that what is involved is always about just throwing money at the problem.  It cannot just be about that.  Equally, we cannot state that it is not about some money.  Any money invested, however, needs to be part of a strategy.</p></speech>

One of the issues we highlighted in our report was that the vast majority of these voluntary organisations have to report to the Companies Office, the Charities Regulatory Authority, HIQA, the HSE and probably many other bodies besides.  In many cases those organisations are reporting the same information multiple times over, probably on a slightly different form.  There needs to be much more co-operation.  It is good to see that the Charities Regulatory Authority is looking at the Australian charities passport idea.  That would be very good.  This is a cost issue because there is an expense involved in the State and State bodies requesting the information and processing it when it is received.  It is, however, also a cost on the voluntary sector.</p></speech>

Both reports are very welcome.  I will start with the increase in the health budget over the last four years.  There has been a substantial increase.  Have comparable amounts of money been allocated to the HSE and the voluntary sector?  We are talking about &euro;3.3 billion.  I think that is nearly the same amount as four years ago.  Has the comparable increase been looked at?  My second point concerns staffing levels in the HSE.  There has been an increase of 13,000 in four years and 2,700 of those are in administration and management.  I have serious issues with that.  Staffing in public health nursing has only increased by 3.7% whereas there has been an increase of 17% in administration and management staff in the HSE.</p><p>I do not believe there has been a comparable increase in staffing levels in the voluntary sector.  If anything, there has probably been a greater demand on the voluntary sector to do the same amount of work with fewer staff or do more work with fewer staff.  Has a comparison been done between the increases that have occurred in the public and voluntary sectors?</p><p> There is a lack of understanding in Ireland about the contribution of the voluntary sector and the organisations working in it.  I remember approximately five years ago going through the HSE's annual report and seeing more than 2,500 organisations getting funding and trying to explain it to the general public.  Does the voluntary sector need to get more information out there about the services it delivers and how cost-effective it actually is?  I know the nursing home sector is not comparable because it is very much the private sector and not the voluntary sector but I have seen that a relatively new nursing home run by the HSE costs &euro;1,600 per bed per week whereas a comparable facility three miles away receives &euro;900 per bed per week to look after the same demand for patients.  It is the same with regard to costings for the voluntary sector.  It appears to deliver very effective care to a large number of people at a very efficient cost but does not receive recognition for it.</p><p> Will the witnesses comment on increasing demands?  In private session this morning, I raised one aspect of the HSE whereby the staff of an entire section resigned because they cannot cope with increasing pressure from the general public requiring the service to be delivered.  To put my cards on the table, this is because of a lot of adverse commentary in the media.  For instance, if a voluntary organisation runs into any difficulty, the media immediately seem to focus on that particular aspect of the organisation without looking at the overall picture of what the organisation does.  Voluntary organisations are, unfairly, very prone to adverse media coverage.</p><p> The report shows the need for us all to work together, including the general public, voluntary organisations, the HSE and the Department.  There is a disconnect and the question now is how do we go forward.  It is not only about the HSE and the voluntary sector working together but also the general public.  There is only so much a voluntary organisation or healthcare system can do.  Perfection cannot be provided in every area but we have reached a stage where people are looking for perfection that we cannot deliver.  How do we get out the message that everyone has a part to play, not only those providing the service and working there but also the general public?  I might come back to make a few more comments later.</p></speech>

People do not realise the depth and breadth of the essential services our organisations provide.  Interestingly, until 2016 the social care division of the HSE produced an annual report that set out in detail the funding that went to each organisation and the types of services provided.  People did not use it for bedtime reading but it was available in the public domain.  That report has not been published for the past two years so there really is no visibility of the quantum of services provided.  We need to find a way to get that message out there publicly.  We do it individually as organisations but the HSE in its own annual report should recognise the contribution of the voluntary sector and the types of services and quantity of services we provide for people.</p> <p>  With regard to whether headcount increases in the voluntary sector are comparable to those in the HSE, the short answer is that they are absolutely not.  This is compounded because we have a pay disparity between the public and voluntary sectors.  All of our organisations are struggling in a full economy to recruit and retain staff.  My organisation is the largest provider of personal assistance hours in the country and we find it very difficult to recruit and retain staff because people doing exactly the same job in the HSE are getting full pay restoration.  In the past month, they have been getting the benefit of pay for travel time, which our organisation cannot provide.  We cannot compete.  This impacts our services.  Already this year we have been unable to deliver personal assistance hours and this will only be compounded.  At the end of the day, it goes back to the people sitting in their homes relying on those personal assistance services.  They are in complete isolation and cannot get out of bed or their houses.  They cannot participate in and contribute to society and it is very important that we hammer this home.</p></speech>

This year, the HSE budget uplift was 6%.  Our members did not experience a similar uplift.  It is a little more complicated for section 38 agencies that use the pension related deduction, or the additional superannuation charge to which it has become this year, as part of their operational income.  This goes back a little to Deputy Durkan's query on how we are funded.  We are funded by using some of the pension levy income in addition to the allocation from the HSE.  The effect of this for some of our members is they have had a negative increase in budget, that is, a decrease in budget, or a 1.16% or 1.6% increase in budget.  This does not match the pay awards we are expected to pay to remain compliant with health sector pay policy.</p></speech>

The only increases we see are specific to service areas.  An individual's care needs may have increased and we may have negotiated an increase in funding for that person.  It is, therefore, very much related to particular services rather than the organisation as a whole.  Perhaps during the year HIQA inspections identify increased service requirements.  It is those we hope to get funded in the following year.  In the years they occur we are expected to meet those costs ourselves.  To give an example, as a result of a meeting with HIQA yesterday, we will probably have an additional cost of between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000 for just one service for three people.  That is just one of 61 residential services I have and that additional cost arose in one day.  These are continuous costs that increase but are not being met and have to be negotiated on a case by case basis each year.  Provisions are made in the HSE budget for increased numbers of places or increased numbers of multidisciplinary services such as occupational therapy but while they may be seen as increasing within HSE delivered services, those rarely translate to those of us in section 39 agencies.  We cannot avail of psychology services.  We spend more than &euro;250,000 each year buying in private psychology services to deliver to our service users because the HSE is unable to provide them through the public service for the individuals in question.</p></speech>

It would be interesting one to look at from our point of view.  I imagine that the increase in the budget allocation to health has been absorbed principally by the HSE and not by many of the 2,500 organisations.</p> <p>  Insurance is another issue that was raised in the report in terms of the State Claims Agency.  Could Ms Flynn outline the current position regarding insurance costs for voluntary organisations?  When people look at moneys going to organisations, they do not look at the straightforward costs of heating, light, rent and insurance.  We do not have any overall information.  I presume each voluntary organisation is insured independently.  Is a policy needed whereby the 2,500 organisations providing a public service are brought in under one umbrella for insurance and ensure that the cost can be absorbed in a better way?  Could Ms Flynn outline her position on that?</p></speech>

To be fair, the HSE has facilitated a piece of work in the past year involving a number of our organisations with the State Claims Agency.  A detailed analysis was undertaken of the costs incurred, in particular in employer's liability and public liability.  We have just had that information given to us and it clearly shows those costs have increased exponentially in recent years.  We do not come under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  The section 38 disability agencies were brought in under the remit of the agency some years ago.  The ongoing effect that has had is that the insurance pool has decreased, which means that private insurance companies are now insuring section 39 agencies on the basis of a reduced pool and, therefore, our costs have gone up because we are not under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  That has had a significant effect on us.  Some of us self-insure, which is a perverse place to find oneself in, but there is no doubt that while the solutions are being considered, nothing has been forthcoming to offer us the same protections through the State Claims Agency as our section 38 colleagues.  As Senator Dolan said, the difference between us is barely a slip of paper.  This comes back to the issue of costs and contracts.  It is the same price for the same services but that does not take account of the considerable increase that has come upon us in recent years as a result of the decision to bring in the section 38 agencies under the remit of the agency.</p></speech>

Our staff are paid differently and the insurance is treated differently.  Based on the work that has been done so far, I am not sure that we could assume that we are going to come under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  If anything, that is not going to happen and the best that may happen is that we work together to pool our insurance needs and go to the market as a collaborative rather than coming under the remit of the agency.  That may have some financial benefit but it might not be as beneficial as coming under the remit of the agency.</p></speech>

It is a considerable challenge.  As I come from a legal background, I am very much aware of it and I give legal advice to people who sit on boards.  What can we do to give support to those who give of their time and leave themselves exposed due to the decisions they make?  Given the current structure, what can be done for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1005" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Day" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019061900002#S02100"><p>Perhaps I will pick up on that.  The underlying problems have to be solved.  The risk of being accused of reckless trading will exist as long as there are deficits.  We suggested that it would probably be financially worthwhile and useful for the State to fund some kind of small support office for the smaller voluntary organisations to provide training for board members and, perhaps, to support shared services.  Insurance is another example of that.  Rather than having to deal with multiple individual problems, we could provide a centrally funded service that would help to take some of the burden of administration and personal burden away from the organisations and help to get a more streamlined delivery coming through.  That would be one inexpensive but useful way of supporting the boards.</p> <p>  Many people made the point to us that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get people to go on boards because of that problem, which shows that they take their duties responsibly and seriously.  To solve that problem, we will have to take away the underlying problem, which is that there is a risk of reckless trading because the deficits are mushrooming.  They are not being taken into account or even being talked about.  Then it will come out some day that there is a funding gap and people will ask how that happened but the warning signs have been there for a long time.  It is not a new or sudden problem.</p></speech>

I remind people to switch off their mobile phones as they interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>We are joined by officials from the Department of Justice and Equality: Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy secretary general, Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, and Mr. Michael Kirrane, director general of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  Mr. Paul Gunning, principal officer at the anti-human trafficking unit is<i>en route</i>.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Buckley to proceed to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1015" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019061900002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting the Department to participate in these important hearings on the direct provision system and the international protection process.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, under EU and international law, Ireland, like other countries, is obliged to examine the claim of any person who comes here and claims international protection under defined grounds.  Persons will be granted refugee status if it is shown that they have a well-founded fear of suffering persecution in their home country.  Where a person does not meet the criteria under the Geneva Convention to qualify as a refugee, they will be granted subsidiary protection status if they would face a risk of suffering serious harm if returned to their home country.  A person who qualifies for neither refugee nor subsidiary protection status will have other humanitarian reasons to be allowed to stay considered by the Minister and may be granted a discretionary permission to remain in the State.  The process of examining such applications is set out in the International Protection Act 2015 with first instance decisions considered by the International Protection Office, IPO, and appeals determined by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal - both independent in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the Act.  The processes in both offices have been designed with input from the UNHCR. </p> <p>  While an international protection claim is being examined, we offer accommodation and related services to anyone without means.  This includes all meals, medical care and utilities.  A weekly personal allowance is paid to each person and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection cover exceptional needs.  The Department of Education and Skills provides school places for children resident in the centres and children also have access to the free preschool scheme, the early childhood care and education programme.  The HSE provides mainstreamed health services to residents.  It is a whole-of-Government approach to supports and services for applicants. </p> <p>  There is no obligation on anyone to accept the offer of accommodation and there is no restriction on the freedom of movement of applicants throughout the State.  Any notion of incarceration of applicants is wholly misleading and risks stigmatising the residents. </p> <p>  The pressure our accommodation system currently faces is clear.  The Reception and Integration Agency of the Department is accommodating 6,108 people - the figure last week - in its 39 accommodation centres and a further 760 people are in emergency accommodation in hotels and guest houses.  The use of emergency accommodation is sub-optimal.  It does not allow us to provide the full range of services to applicants that the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; centres provide.  However, we must ensure that each person arriving today to claim protection, with no advance warning, tonight has shelter, food and any urgent medical care required. </p> <p>  Coupled with an increase in the number of people applying for protection in recent years is the large number of people with an international protection status or a permission to remain who continue to live in RIA accommodation.  We have approximately the same number of people in this scenario as we have applicants housed in emergency accommodation.  People with status or permission to remain have the same access to mainstream housing supports and services as nationals.  We are working intensively with organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust, Depaul and the Jesuit Refugee Service to assist these people to transition to mainstream housing services but, as members will realise, that is challenging in the current housing environment.</p><p> The committee heard from Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon of the improvements that have been made to the system in recent years.  Significant improvements have been made to the system to deliver real improvements in living conditions and standards for residents.  Chief among these is the introduction of independent living.  I understand that most of the members of the committee visited the Mosney accommodation centre last Friday where they will have seen how independent living works first hand, including the foodhall where residents can obtain food and toiletries through a cashless and points-based system.  More than half of all residents now have access to cooking facilities and our aim is to have all residents in commercial centres benefitting from independent living by the middle of next year.  This will be achieved through our ongoing regional tendering process for the provision of accommodation.  Successful bidders will also have to provide dedicated living spaces for families and teenagers, and greater facilities for recreation.  Standards developed by an advisory group have recently been finalised and approved by the Minister, and will be applied in all centres.  Access to the labour market has also provided an important integration opportunity for eligible applicants.  To date, the Minister has granted 2,633 labour market access permissions, including 1,900 to direct provision residents.  Residents also have access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  Importantly, each centre also now has a friends of the centre group, which brings together residents, community and voluntary groups to increase integration opportunities and provide support for residents by local communities.</p><p> The Department is now engaged in its own review of the direct provision system.  I chair a high-level interdepartmental group to examine the current system and report to the Minister.  As part of this work, we are identifying gaps in service provision, areas where we can strengthen existing service provision and supports, and may propose alternative options for the provision of services to applicants in the short and medium terms.  The work of the committee will be an important consideration for the interdepartmental group.  As Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said previously, we would welcome proposals and tender responses from individual non-governmental organisations or groups of NGOs that want to work with us to improve the system.  Indeed, we are already working with some NGOs to see how they can play a more active role in supporting residents.</p><p> The system has provided a safety net for more than 60,000 individuals and families since its inception 20 years ago but there is room for improvement.  These committee hearings are timely and coincide with the work that is already under way in the Department.  We have followed the hearings to date with great interest and carefully listened to the testimony of witnesses.  We share many of the views that were expressed to the committee.  The system of deciding on applications must continue to get faster and the improvements to living standards must continue to be implemented.  Where we may differ is on how we get there and how quickly the protection determination process can be made taking into account that this is a legal process, which requires full consideration of all aspects of each individual case.  We are open to engagement with all stakeholders to provide a system that is responsive to the needs of applicants, treats applicants with dignity and respect and continues to meet our international and humanitarian obligations to people seeking international protection from the State.</p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that the Chairman or members may have.</p></speech>

I take on board all of the information Ms Buckley has given us.  This review has been extremely difficult.  For us, it has been devastating to hear some of the direct testimonies from people living in the system.  Ms Buckley said that changes have been made but there was room for improvement.  I understand the Department is taking steps but I feel that is a huge understatement.  This committee's role is to highlight as clearly and as fairly as possible places where we see the system is falling short of what is expected in terms of human rights and basic dignity, and to propose changes.  Some of the changes relate to the system as a whole and, therefore, political decisions must be made at Government level.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on questions relating to the operation our asylum system and the Department's responsibilities.  The first one is waiting times and delays.  After the passage of the International Protection Act a commitment was given to have a nine-month limit on a first instance decision.  Currently, the median waiting time is 15 months and the average is likely to be much longer.  Why has the target been missed?  Are more resources and staff needed to meet the target?  Does the Department have a timeline for when it expects to reach the nine-month target?  Similarly, there is often a long delay between the time people receive a positive decision and the final letter from the Minister.  What is the reason for such a delay?  What happens in the interim?</p> <p>  The second issue is about standards, which is critically important and repeatedly arose during the hearings.  The difference in the standard and quality of facilities is astonishing and urgently needs to be addressed in the short term.  I understand that the standards have been agreed and will be published soon.  Can Ms Buckley give us an overview of some of the areas that will be covered?  How do they differ from current practice?  What kind of oversight mechanism will be put in place?  Any standards will not be worth having unless they are closely monitored by an independent body that has real teeth and that conducts random inspection, which is vital.  During the hearings it was suggested that the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, could be extended cover this.  How will the oversight of the standards work?  Will there be reporting on whether standards have been met?</p> <p>  The EU Reception Conditions Directive includes the need for an ongoing vulnerability assessment.  I have read the replies to parliamentary questions that were tabled on this issue.  It seems that what is being described is the basic medical screening that is carried out in Balseskin.  That is different from a proper vulnerability assessment because it would not pick up mental health issues, an in which I am specifically interested, trauma and sexual abuse.  Can Ms Buckley elaborate on the screening process and how the legal requirement for an ongoing vulnerability is met?</p> <p>  I have just started to explore the issue of profit.  The decision to operate our asylum system on a for-profit basis is a political one.  Yesterday, I looked through some of the materials on the contracts and I was quite shocked.  I would like to get the Department's perspective on it.  For example, Bridgestock is a company that runs two direct provision centres - Globe House in Sligo town and The Old Convent in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  The State pays Bridgestock about &euro;6 million per year to run the centres.  Since 2000, Bridgestock has made almost &euro;100 million.  In 2011, the company became unlimited and the majority of its shares were transferred to the British Virgin Islands.  That means the company's accounts are not published and it is shielded from public scrutiny.  Does Ms Buckley think that a private company with the majority control exercised from the British Virgin Islands with no public transparency as to its costs and profits is conducive to a safe and respectful asylum system?  It has been said also that the average amount paid to each company is &euro;35 per asylum seeker per night.  In Bridgestock's case, that provision amounted to &euro;6 million last year.  Does the Department know the profit margin enjoyed by the companies that run these centres?  How much of that &euro;35 of public money is spent assisting asylum seekers?  How much of it goes to the shareholders?</p></speech>

Indeed, I might ask one of my colleagues to give a more detailed answer as I might know the generalities but not the detail.</p> <p>  In terms of the waiting times, the goal of the Department is to meet a medium time for first decision, from the International Protection Office, IPO, in nine months, by the end of this year.  We are, however, a way off that at the moment and we may miss our goal.  Part of the challenge has been as follows.  We have increased staffing in the IPO of civil servants by 20% and doubled the number of legal advisers who conduct initial interviews and so forth in the last two years, it is challenging for the Civil Service to recruit people into what, as members will know, is an extremely tight labour market.</p><p>We struggle to recruit the necessary staff in a timely fashion.  This problem is not unique to the immigration service or the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is an issue in Dublin with regard to recruiting civil servants.  However, we have increased staffing there by 20% in two years.  We have doubled the number of legal advisers who do the initial interviews.  We have reduced the overall hearing times.</p><p> Another issue that has arisen is that when the 2015 Act came into force thousands of existing applications were in the system.  They were reset to zero and started again through the process.  There was a challenge in dealing with the bulge of overhanging applications that existed at the time.  They had to be dealt with in a timely fashion and in order because of legal restrictions and requirements, and the requirements of the UNHCR.  Unlike other organisations that I managed in the past, where we were able to work on new applications and existing applications in two streams, this had to be done in consecutive order, which led to a large delay that was, in effect, built in from the get-go.  The team in the IPO is getting on top of this and we are moving towards a situation where applications coming in under the new Act in the first instance are being dealt with in a more timely fashion.</p><p> Senator Black also mentioned delays between the decision being given by the IPO or the international protection appeals tribunal, IPAT, and the letter issuing from the Minister.  Certainly there has been issue with an extended delay due to checks being conducted.  These final checks involved a final run through to establish, for example, whether there was any issue of a criminal record.  As my colleague, Mr. Kirrane, will be able to tell the committee, we have introduced a new policy of issuing these letters in a much more timely fashion and we should start to see it come through very shortly.</p></speech>

We have assigned additional resources to clear them in the next four weeks and at the end of this process we expect the new decisions coming through to issue within approximately ten working days.  We have changed the process by running some of this in parallel so there is no delay at the end of the recommendation coming from the IPO or the IPAT for the decision letter to issue.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the standards have been drawn up and were recently approved by the Minister.  We are working with his office on establishing an oversight committee.  As the committee knows, an oversight and inspection mechanism is part of the structures established for this.  We have not yet determined what that inspection mechanism would be.  What I can say right now is there are independent inspections of our direct provision centres to the standards that currently apply and they are unannounced.  RIA itself makes two unannounced inspections every year and a body contracted by RIA makes a further unannounced inspection every year to make sure the standards that apply are being met.  We certainly will look at the introduction of an independent inspection mechanism that will be subject to the oversight of a committee that will be there to ensure the Department manages and maintains the system to these new standards.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Baxter, to discuss the detail of the standards.</p></speech>

The Children's Rights Alliance was integrally involved in the standards development process and the standards themselves were developed and facilitated by an independent facilitator.  It is a very good example of collaboration that covers accommodation, food and living conditions.  An example of where there will be a step change is in the area of training.  It will require ongoing training of centre staff and management with regard to person-centred approaches to the delivery of services.  There will be training on interculturalism, awareness of trauma and mental health issues and whether a person has experienced sexual or domestic violence.  We feel this represents a step change in the capacity of centre managers and staff to engage with centre residents.</p></speech>

It is a legal requirement of the directive that a vulnerability assessment be carried out.  I mentioned that putting people into emergency accommodation is not the optimal solution and it is not something we are keen on.  Part of the reason for this is it becomes harder for us to offer the same assessment of vulnerabilities as is available in the standard direct provision centres.  We also had a difficulty in Balseskin in we had a couple of cases of chickenpox, which is a very human situation.  The protocol from the HSE is that we must not put children or women of childbearing age into that centre while a period elapses after the detection of chickenpox for obvious medical reasons.  This has been challenging for us as the numbers of people arriving into the country are increasing year on year, and they have increased by approximately 30% every year for the past while.  The chickenpox protocol has elapsed and we are now able to put people through Balseskin again.  We are giving the necessary vulnerability assessments and health screening through Balseskin for arriving visitors.  The HSE also has an arrangement in place with Safetynet Primary Care, which attends to places such as emergency accommodation centres to ensure medical and other screening can be done there.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that vulnerability assessments extend beyond medical screening.  They need to detect mental health conditions that may not be apparent in the first instance.  It is a necessity that these issues get picked up as time goes by, and every instance where a person interfaces with the RIA, IPO or whatever provides another opportunity for the screenings and assessments to occur.  Our advice to the GPs with whom we interface is that at any point where they detect them they need to feed them back, of course within the confidentiality limits that arise for anybody's medical conditions.  Where they are known to the RIA, we can certainly address them.  We continue to have to work towards making sure we meet the legal requirements.  We believe we are meeting basic legal requirements at present but certainly it is something we need to work towards.  It is not ideal, particularly in a situation when we have so many people in emergency centres.  It is much better for people to be in the direct provision centres, despite the ongoing public discourse about them.</p> <p>  As the Senator pointed out, the use of commercial companies in the running of centres on State-owned property and contracting with private companies is a policy decision and this situation will continue.  It is worth saying that we will require everybody we interact with to comply with the law of the land.  For instance, they must have a tax clearance certificate.  The obligation on us is to ensure value for money in the delivery of this demand-led service where there is a significant challenge with regard to the budget for the service, particularly this year.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, the use of commercial companies is a policy decision and not one on which I can comment.</p></speech>

This committee and the previous justice committee have done significant work in this area.</p><p>I have taken a great interest in this area but what concerns me that there has not been a huge amount of improvement.  The talk, the interagency links and engagement all sound good, but time and again, the examples on the ground do not stand up to the presentation from RIA.  In some centres, children are accepted into the local national school, but the support and services made available are very limited.  In other situations, children from direct provision centres are not accepted into the local primary schools.  The protocol should be that local primary schools are obliged to take children from direct provision centres and should not be in a position to refuse.</p><p> Today, I want to focus on emergency accommodation.  I have a few questions, and will start with a very simple one.  Has RIA ever been in a situation where it was unable to find an emergency bed for somebody who presented seeking assistance in this country?  Are there any recent examples of someone ending up homeless because accommodation has not been found?</p></speech>

That is why we moved to the emergency accommodation model.  We now have people in hotel beds in 25 locations.  We are using emergency accommodation because we had to turn people away at one stage.</p></speech>

The minute that we got further accommodation, we went back to people in the subsequent weeks to indicate that we had accommodation for them.

It is worth pointing out that it is not possible to estimate how many people will present in any one day applying for international protection.  For example, on one day at the beginning of the year, 132 people presented looking for international protection.</p> <p>  The other changing aspect is the countries from which the flow of people is coming.  That is affected by developments outside Ireland.  A very large proportion of people now applying for international protection come from Albania and Georgia, which are regarded by Ireland as safe countries.  We believe that is due to a change in visa arrangements in the Schengen area, which is outside the control of Ireland.</p></speech>

We have added substantial numbers of beds in the past two years, and continue to seek to do so this year, to try to keep ahead of demand.

What are the financial arrangements between RIA and the providers of these emergency accommodation beds?  I do not mean the direct provision beds but the emergency accommodation beds.  What protocols are in place to ensure basis standards in the emergency accommodation?  I am trying to understand how the arrangements with the emergency accommodation providers are different from those with the more established direct provision centres.</p></speech>

As I have made clear from the start of our presentation, emergency accommodation is not of the same standard as the direct provision centres.  We cannot impose the standards we require of direct provision providers on hotels and guest houses, which is where emergency accommodation is provided.  We are trying to make sure, therefore, that people move out of emergency accommodation as quickly as possible, in particular families, so that children are not left in a hotel before being moved into a direct provision centre to be registered for schooling.</p></speech>

I spoke directly to the Minister about this, so the Department is not unaware of it.  Last January, people in emergency accommodation were bused for six or seven hours to another part of the country in order to facilitate a wedding in a venue being used for emergency accommodation.  When the wedding was done and dusted, they were shipped back.  They were treated appallingly.  No Department, and no provider of emergency accommodation, could stand over how those people were treated.  It was not an isolated incident; it has happened more than once.  After I spoke to the Minister and informed him what had happened, I got an assurance that it would never happen again.  Are the witnesses aware of those incidents?  Can the committee be assured that such incidents have not happened in the past two or three months?</p></speech>

After it happened, we spoke to the accommodation provider involved and received assurances that it would not occur again.  To the best of our knowledge, there has been no similar incident in the past few months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1046" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019061900002#G01700"><p>That is good news, but it should never have happened.</p> <p>  I understand that the engagement to get beds for emergency accommodation is done through third parties.  Effectively, the services are dealing and negotiating with entrepreneurs, who block book bedrooms.  There is job of work to do to streamline the protocols for emergency accommodation and ensure that they are transparent, appropriate and respectful.  Ultimately, we want to ensure that the quality of accommodation for people who come to this country seeking our assistance is up to standard and taxpayers' money is used in the most efficient way.</p> <p>  It is often asked where somebody would get full board and bed for &euro;35 a night.  That is good value.  However, when a facility is 100% occupied, seven days a week, every week of the year, it is easy to achieve those efficiencies and provide it for &euro;35.  We have a duty to significantly and fundamentally upgrade all the direct provision centres.</p><p>People such as members of this committee should not be hearing stories from residents.  Until such time as that does not happen, unfortunately, the delegates will be before this and other committees to explain the reason it does happen.</p></speech>

In order to do that, we need to open more direct provision centres.  In order to achieve this, we are working our way through a procurement process.  We would welcome the support of members of the committee for the opening of new centres in which we can offer facilities to the standards we aim to achieve.</p></speech>

We try to move people through the system as quickly as possible and into a direct provision centre.  There are individuals who have been in emergency accommodation for upwards of nine months, which is very unfortunate.  Part of our issue is we have approximately 730 people who have the right to remain in direct provision centres.  We are working intensively with a number of NGOs and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to try to move those residents into mainstream housing.  In effect, if we could solve the over-stairs problem, we would not need emergency accommodation.  An important part of our structures is moving people out of direct provision centres into mainstream accommodation in order that we can, as best we can, cease our use of emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

Clearly, as Ms Buckley mentioned, people who have come here have been left at the behest of others who have shown total disregard and disrespect for their basic physiological needs and human rights.  For anyone to be thrown around like that is a disgrace.  As Senator Conway mentioned, there was not only one incident.  There are others, about which people have expressed concern.  What I want to know is what are we doing to formalise standards, governance arrangements and protocols for emergency accommodation providers.</p></speech>

In the meantime, as we have moved into a situation where more people are in emergency accommodation, we are working to try to formalise some of the important standards people require to be achieved.  The key standards are in the areas of child protection, meeting educational needs and health screening, in addition to putting a roof over their heads and treating them with dignity and respect.  I ask my colleague to go into the matter in more detail.</p></speech>

The Deputy will recall that when we moved to use emergency accommodation, we contracted a series of centres including those in Moville and Rooskey which we subsequently were not able to use because of the arson attacks.  As I said, when we started to use emergency accommodation, we understood it would be a short-term measure.  Now we realise it will be a somewhat longer term measure, although it is still our objective to move out of providing emergency accommodation, if we can, by the end of the year.  We have worked on an interdepartmental basis to address the issue.  We are working with the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure standards will be met within the hotel being used to provide emergency accommodation.  In addition, we want to have a more active presence in the centres.  We are contracting NGOs to provide an opportunity for residents to highlight issues that are arising for them.  The intention is that they will have a presence on the ground, in addition to our own staff in the emergency centres.</p></speech>

In the initial phases when we had to put families in emergency accommodation, some <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements were made.  We are now working with the Department of Education and Skills to formalise the arrangements to meet the educational needs of children in the centres, but it is not ideal.  We would much prefer to move as many families as possible into direct provision centres in order that more established arrangements for schooling can be made.</p></speech>

I suppose it is a broader question of whether there are sufficient healthcare services generally, especially around mental health.  We work closely with them.  We work especially closely with the Department of Education and Skills.  A co-located official tries to ensure that the goal is to meet our legal obligations in the context of the education of children.  In some instances there have been positive outcomes from having children come into the direct provision centres in the sense that it can be the trigger for the allocation of additional resources in local schools, including additional teachers or additional support services because of the children present as part of the international protection process.</p></speech>

It is worse than direct provision.  For all naysaying about direct provision, it allows us to provide public services in a more co-ordinated way to a group of people in a group setting.  These are people who tend to have high levels of needs because of some of the circumstances from which they have come.  The use of emergency accommodation is not where we want to be and we need to move away from that.  As the use of emergency accommodation has become a more regular feature of the system, we have moved to improve our governance arrangements around it.  I want to highlight that in the circumstances where we are under an obligation to provide a bed or a roof over the head of every person who presents, and we have no control over the demand, we struggle a great deal to keep ahead or abreast of the demand for bed places.  That is something at which we have to work hard every day to keep on top of.  We are happy that we are moving towards a better arrangement and better standards for direct provision more generally.  However, for that to happen we need to increase the numbers of beds available to us in the system.  We need to move people with status out of our direct provision centres and into mainstream accommodation.</p></speech>

Several colleagues have asked questions that I was going ask.  I will not engage in repetition.  I am keen to hone in on one issue identified by Deputy Jack Chambers and Senator Conway regarding the movement of people in emergency accommodation.  Can Ms Buckley outline the Department's position?  She stated that the issue was addressed with the provider but then she also indicated that the Department cannot impose standards on emergency accommodation.  That is both a screaming admission and a contradiction and it prompts my fundamental question.  It is all well and good and as far as we know it has not happened since, but can it happen again?</p></speech>

We cannot impose direct provision standards on private hotel owners.  What we can say, in circumstances where there is a clear breach of what we anticipate as being the requirements of someone providing emergency accommodation, is that we will withdraw from using that hotel or facility.  We believe that it is certainly possible for these facilities to meet our contractual requirements, but we cannot say to them that they have to meet all the standards that come with being a direct provision centre.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

However, I do not think it is good enough to simply rely on information emerging.  We are talking about people who are facing extreme marginalisation and extraordinary issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder and all kinds of things.  Yet we are merely hoping that at some point they will tell us, via a third party, that they have been shipped on a bus several hundred miles down the road to God knows where, despite the precarious situation they are already facing.  I acknowledge that the Department can see the emergency accommodation situation as unacceptable and not fit for purpose, but we are hearing that this is the scenario and that it is imminent.  It seems there are no measures in place to proactively prevent this type of situation recurring.  I am highly concerned by the fact that this has been identified already with an existing provider and the person responsible and the facility are still operating.  There are people still existing - I would not use the term "living" - in that accommodation.  I want to make that point.</p> <p>  Earlier, Ms Buckley rightly identified the issue of value for money.  Is there a definition of what constitutes value for money?  Is it written down anywhere?  Are there terms of reference for that statement and for ensuring value for money?  What constitutes value for money for the Department for a person living either in emergency accommodation or direct provision?</p></speech>

As civil servants, we are required to achieve value for money in the use of taxpayers' money.  As one of the other members of the committee pointed out, that means we have been paying approximately &euro;35 per head to the providers.  That cost is going to increase because, as we go through the existing procurement process - I must speak without revealing any commercial secrets - to meet the higher standards, there will be a higher level of cost per person per night for people in the new model of direct provision centre.  That is the right thing to do because those are the standards we must meet.</p></speech>

I will accept an approximate figure.  Does Ms Buckley know how many centres the Department will have to close based on the new standards?  How many people can expect to be relocated into the new centres?  How long will they have to wait until they can relocate into what are deemed to be higher standard direct provision facilities?</p></speech>

These are the arrangements such as those the members saw in Mosney.  A further 1,400 people have access to independent cooking facilities and can provide their own food.  They do not have the on-site shop.  By the middle of next year, we aim to have completed the procurement process and achieved the new standards across the entire complex of direct provision centres, that is, existing centres and new ones that may come on stream through the procurement process.  We obviously need additional direct provision centres to come on stream to provide us with additional beds.  I do not have a figure in my head for the number of current centres that may not meet the standards.  It is not necessarily the case that centres will open or close because they do not meet the standards.  Hatch Hall in Dublin city centre, for example, is due to close.  There is no suggestion that this centre is closing because it would not have met the standards.  It is closing because of a commercial decision to redevelop it into a hotel.</p></speech>

This is a very important part of the committee's valuable engagement on this matter in recent weeks.  I am sure the officials have been following our hearings.  I reiterate my view that direct provision has lost the confidence of the residents and the Irish people.  The committee's responsibility now is to formulate a proposal in our report that provides a comprehensive and detailed alternative.  While I acknowledge that there have been improvements, there are still significant shortcomings in direct provision.</p> <p>  On the issue of emergency accommodation, I am conscious that the committee's hearings are on the direct provision and international protection system as a whole.  Based on this hearing and our previous meeting, I am only beginning to get my head around the scale of this issue.  Is it the case that, before last September, no one in the direct provision and international protection system was in emergency accommodation?  Since the problem arose, it has escalated, with 687 people in emergency accommodation in mid-May and, according to the Department, that figure has since increased by 73 to 760.  Does Ms Buckley believe it will continue to escalate and could we be back here in a few months talking about 900 or 1,000 people in emergency accommodation?  Is that possible given the rate of increase since September?</p></speech>

We cannot say what the numbers would be because it is dependent on demand and how many people come into the State seeking asylum or international protection and how many people we are able to move into mainstream housing from the existing direct provision facilities.  My staff work hard every day to try to achieve that.  It is an entirely demand-led scheme.  If we are to meet the basic human requirement of putting a roof over people's heads, we will continue to have to put people into direct provision.  Our goal is to add a net 1,200 beds to the direct provision system by the end of the year.  We are still hopeful that we will achieve that but, as my colleague mentioned, two centres we sought to open were the subject of attacks, which did not help.  It is extremely challenging to manage the process in the current accommodation environment.</p></speech>

It is terrifying.  If that rate of increase continues, it is possible that we will have 800 or 900 people in emergency accommodation.

Ms Buckley indicated that some people are prioritised, for example, children of school-going age, for accommodation in direct provision centres but that some applicants are in emergency accommodation for perhaps six to nine months.  On that basis, is it possible that we are in breach of the reception regulations?</p></speech>

In general the requirements are met through the medical screening that takes place in Balseskin.  We are able to put people through medical screening in Balseskin.  We are about to open a better medical centre there, which will be a great improvement.  There are other aspects to the vulnerability screening.  It looks at a series of vulnerabilities.  Those are generally detected in the initial contact with RIA and the system.  We are able to manage that when placing people.  Sometimes vulnerabilities can come through-----</p></speech>

This is always balanced against the constant pressure to find people a bed for the night.</p> <p>  Vulnerabilities can also become apparent some time into the process.  This is particularly true of things such as mental health issues.  These are often detected by the management of a direct provision centre and, if appropriate and if it does not involve invading people's privacy, these vulnerabilities are brought to the attention of RIA and we then try to manage the issue and to put support services in place.</p></speech>

The non-reactive part of the screening is the medical screening.  We offer that to everybody who presents seeking international protection.  A substantial proportion of applicants take it up.  It is very proactive and it is offered proactively.  People have to bring other vulnerabilities to our attention.  We cannot evaluate whether someone has a particular vulnerability by looking at him or her.  These have to be brought to the attention of the staff before we can appropriately assess them.</p></speech>

An issue recently arose in respect of gender identity, that of the sad case of Sylva Tukula.  I have put my criticisms of the handling of that case on record.  The coroner's office should have been notified of her wishes and of the fact that there were people who wished to remember her with dignity.  I understand there was also an issue in that she was accommodated in an all-male direct provision centre.  I am not sure how long ago that decision was taken but it is one which should not have been taken.  It seems contrary to the recast directive.</p></speech>

Her burial was not carried out at the behest of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Clearly we have to change the way in which we communicate with coroner's offices to ensure that similar issues do not arise again in circumstances such as these, which thankfully are exceptionally rare.</p> <p>  With regard to Ms Tukula's placement in a centre, she was initially placed in one centre and then moved to another which, it was felt, would be more in keeping with her gender identity and would provide a better environment for her.  RIA did react to her initial placement, which may have been inappropriate, and moved her.  The circumstances are incredibly sad and we very much regret what happened.</p></speech>

I hope that things will be handled differently in future.  Communication with the coroner's office will be key in that regard.  I will raise two final issues, which relate more directly to direct provision <i>per se</i>.  I have previously raised the matter of location.  It is not my view that all centres should be located in Dublin or anything like that.  While I have the opportunity I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks on proposed direct provision centres in Moville and Roosky.  They were appalling acts which show a disgraceful mindset.  While I do not believe all who present for protection should be accommodated in Dublin, there are issues for the residents arising from the location of some centres.  People accommodated in Moville would have had to travel through the Six Counties, which is not legal, or to take an extremely circuitous route to attend appointments in Dublin.  That would probably not be possible in a single day.  The income given to such people would make the use of public transport very challenging.  Accommodation would also have presented a challenge.  Mount Trenchard is not served by public transport generally.  Travelling from Kenmare would probably involve an overnight stay if one had to spend any serious length of time in Dublin.</p><p>I have raised this with the Minister previously.  When people are required to attend appointments in Dublin, insofar as possible, centres should not be located in places that have poor public transport connections.  They should be located in places with transport links that are as good as possible, where there are opportunities to work and good educational opportunities, and where capacity exists in the community to support the centre.  In addition, as much as possible needs to be done to bring the mountain to the centre.  People should be able to attend as many of their appointments as possible and fulfil as many of their obligations as possible within the centre.  The Minister seemed open-minded to that point.  Is it being progressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019061900002#L00900"><p>It is.  There have been some very positive developments on that front.  Up to the end of last year, people had to be brought to Dublin, in many cases for an overnight stay, for their International Protection Office, IPO, interviews.  At the instigation of the Minister, we have instituted a pilot with the IPO which allows interviews to be held closer to the residents of the direct provision system.  An initial outing was held in our office in Tipperary town.  It worked extremely successively, save that it was in Tipperary town, when it needed to be closer to our population.  We now propose to run those interviews in a more co-ordinated way, in Cork in the initial phase.  As Cork is within an hour of approximately one third of the population of our direct provision centres, it presents a highly achievable way of delivering the IPO interview process.  We are also looking at delivering similar interviews in Sligo, which would be extremely helpful for people in the north west, particularly those living in Donegal.  There is a prospect of delivering services closer to the people.  That is standard for services to Irish citizens but it is not how we have traditionally managed the interview process in the IPO system.  We are working very hard to deliver that over the course of this year.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy about location.  It has been policy for a long time to disperse people across the country so that all asylum applicants are not gathered in, for example, Dublin.  That would be extremely difficult in the context of the current accommodation situation.  It is much better for people to be dispersed across the country.  As a consequence, Ireland has had a great dispersal of people with permission to remain or refugee status.  They are dispersed across all communities.  Every part of the country has been able to accommodate people and to bring them into the system.  The procurement model which has been adopted for direct provision centre means that we accept any centre that is offered to us if it meets our standards.  It is not the case that we choose a particular location but is a case of accepting what is offered to us.  We are very interested in hearing the views of the committee as to whether there should be more direction as to where we locate centres and as to how that might be done.  We will be considering the future of the way in which we procure and select sites for direct provision centres at the interdepartmental group I am chairing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019061900002#L01000"><p>I will finish on these two points.  I asked a question at the last committee hearing.</p><p>I told the witnesses I had a concern about the Department's culture and attitude in respect of INIS and RIA.  When I suggested the system might be too adversarial, Dr. Liam Thornton said he felt I was being generous in so describing the attitude and referred to the existence of a culture of disbelief.  He told the committee that when the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection started to plan for the increases in the direct provision allowance, an official in the Department of Justice and Equality who was asked to offer a comment or express views began by stating they are all working anyway.  A few other examples were given and a few other comments were made during the meeting.  Another witness made the valid point that the Department's responsibility to uphold the security of the State might inform some its attitudes.  I did not detect much disagreement with the view that there is an adversarial attitude to applicants.  It is fair to give the officials from the Department an opportunity to respond to what was said at last week's meeting and give their views on the issues raised.</p><p> I have a final question.  There has been a great deal of discussion in recent weeks about the potential to get out of private tendering, which clearly cannot be done overnight.  This is very much in line with my own thinking.  I believe the State should seek to provide accommodation directly or through not-for-profit bodies, approved housing bodies or community and voluntary organisations.  At the same time, an effort should be made to integrate people into the mainstream housing system as quickly as possible.  Is the Department open to that, given how expensive direct provision has been?  I have seen statistics that suggest &euro;1.25 billion has been spent on the system since 2001.  Why has the Department not pursued such an approach since 2001?  We are talking now about trying to get out of emergency accommodation as an immediate response.  In 2001, direct provision was an emergency response as well but 18 years on, we are still with it.</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, I arrived in the Department of Justice and Equality relatively recently.  He will know that we are undertaking a substantial reform of the Department.  I believe the Secretary General may brief the committee on that at a future date.  I find the Department an interesting place to work.  I have been a civil servant for a very long time and it certainly has a different culture from any place I have worked before.  When I have spoken to the team who work on the direct provision system - the RIA team - I have been significantly impressed to see that people are treated as individual human beings.  That is what the staff try to achieve.  It is extremely difficult because of the pressure of numbers we are under.  There is very much an attitude of seeing people as human beings.</p> <p>  I also was asked about the international protection system and the asylum process.  There is a very legalistic process to go through.  As with any legal process, people can find that very confrontational.  When people come in and set out a series of facts, those facts are challenged and tested as part of a well laid-out process.  The system is carefully monitored by the UNHCR and is extremely fair.  I think the substantial reforms of the international protection system that were done in 2015 have led to a big change in timeframes and the approach to bringing all the decisions together.  I will give an example of that.  One of the McMahon recommendations was that people who had been in the process for more than five years would have their applications reviewed.  Over 1,000 people received permission to remain on foot of that review.  That was delivered quietly and effectively on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that people can have a certain perception of big Departments like the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department has a security of the State function.  Its work involves ensuring the immigration policy the State has decided on is deployed and enforced.  There is, however, very much a regard for the human being in the middle of that.  We need to keep focusing on that.  Part of the goal of the reforms of the Department is to ensure that system prevails throughout.  Freedom of information requests sometimes reveal that there are robust debates in the Department, as there are in every Department.  Notwithstanding the personal view that may have been expressed by an individual in an email, the reform went ahead and is strongly supported by the Department.  There has been an increase in the allowance for direct provision.  We strongly support the implementation of the McMahon recommendations.</p></speech>

All of this is a substantial cost pressure within the budget of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

The staff have been under pressure in managing that.  Our goal is to meet residents every three months to make sure their views are heard.  If something arises - there have been a couple of protests and things like that - we tend to send down a staff member that day or the following day to see what the story is and make sure we are on top of whatever has occasioned the issue.  We proactively seek the views of residents.  We work quite closely with the Office of the Ombudsman.  Staff from that office visit every centre every year and listen to the complaints of residents.  As the committee will have seen in the Ombudsman's report, many of the complaints tend to be about issues of local communication and can be resolved on the spot.</p></speech>

I will give a specific example, one on which I think the lady in question came and gave evidence to the committee.  Contrary to our standards and rules for direct provision centres, she had a sick child but was refused food at a late hour.  That was brought to our attention very quickly through social media and we then spoke to the accommodation provider.  It related to an internal communication with a staff member and was dealt with quickly.  Accommodation providers tend to react very swiftly when they get a phone call from RIA.  They know that if a store of complaints is built up, it will be a problem for them when it comes to contractual arrangements with the Department.</p></speech>

The concept of providing State services directly to residents is not a bad one, although perhaps the process we are now going through to bring in somebody independent, such as Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, needed to be done at an earlier stage.

We have responded to it by setting up relationships with a number of NGOs and charities.  We have reached out and established a memorandum of understanding with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to provide its services, for example, the housing assistance payment or HAP, to people with permission to remain who need to move into mainstream housing.  We have started to write to the residents of various centres, including Mosney, in the past two weeks to tell them about those services and invite them to engage with those services so that we can start to help people move out more actively.</p> <p>  This is a problem that has only arisen in the past year and a half to two years.  Prior to that, people who got their right to remain tended to move on quite quickly.  The requirement to help people move on has only been an issue for the past 18 months or so.</p></speech>

For example, some programme refugees housed in one of our emergency reception and orientation centres have been offered other types of accommodation but have refused them because they want to remain in the centre.  We must start to make greater efforts to insist that people accept the alternative accommodation they are offered.  They cannot remain in our centres because we are under too much pressure.</p></speech>

There was a direct provision centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, for many years and I knew many of its residents.  I often say that none of those residents so much as broke a window in the town in their time at the centre.  They were very well integrated into the community.  There were issues with the facility and it eventually closed a number of years ago.</p> <p>  This weekend a number of residents, the majority from Dublin, came to emergency accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Some people in the community were somewhat aggrieved that there was no prior notice and they did not know in advance that these people were coming.  I have learned quite a bit from listening to the interactions so far and it has been explained that, in most cases, the Department tries not to move families into emergency accommodation because it is short term.  For that reason, it was all men who arrived into this particular centre and that will also apply in the future.</p> <p>  I would like clarity on some issues.  I met some of the people in the centre in Carrick-on-Shannon the other day.  I understand some of them are doing courses and are involved in education.  Colleges and educational facilities will be closed over the summer but those who are in education will want to return to their courses later.  How will that be achieved given that they are now in emergency accommodation 100 miles or more from where they had been receiving their education?  The situation is similar for those who were in work, as some of them who have been here more than nine months are entitled to be.  That can be difficult.  Having said that, Carrick-on-Shannon is a tourist town and a welcoming place in general.  If they were looking for suitable employment, it is possible they could find it the town.  That issue about the distance from education and employment still exists.</p> <p>  I would like Ms Buckley to explain why there is a level of secrecy and communities are not told when people are moving into them because it creates unnecessary suspicions.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, we have had many complaints about direction provision centres being opened with people not being informed and centres being landed into communities.  We know we need to improve our communication on that.  We are working very hard whenever a direction provision centre opens once we have completed the contractual negotiations.  Even in the short time I have been in the Department there have been a number of instances where we have opened negotiations but an actual direct provision centre has not resulted from it.  In those cases, there would be absolutely no point in talking to people.  We know we need to communicate with the local authorities which might have issues with fire safety etc.  Then, of course, we need to engage with the local community about concerns over the nature of people coming, which can be allayed fairly swiftly.  They also have concerns about issues like GP services, schools etc.  We know we need to get better at those kinds of things.</p> <p>  Emergency accommodation is different because we are scrambling around trying to find places to put people.  The particular people the Deputy mentioned had to be moved out of Dublin because one of our centres in Dublin is closing.</p></speech>

Carrick-on-Shannon is a great option for them because it is a tourist town and therefore the opportunity to work should be reasonably readily available.</p> <p>  We have an ongoing difficulty with people who are in education, particularly people who are offered third level education.  A number of universities are working very hard to offer free educational facilities.  However, because those facilities do not come with accommodation, it rebounds on the Department of Justice and Equality.  If somebody is accepted for a university degree in Trinity College, DCU or wherever, we are asked to accommodate them in Dublin but we no longer have much accommodation in Dublin.  That is an ongoing challenge for us.  I do not have any specific answer but Ms Baxter may have something to add.</p></speech>

That is particularly difficult with the emergency accommodation because that is something we are just setting up and establishing as we go along.  If the Deputy wishes to raise any specific issues relating to Carrick-on-Shannon, we can work with our colleagues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure we address those.  However, we are very challenged in trying to deliver that.</p></speech>

Thankfully, what happened in Moville and Rooskey is extremely rare.  Generally speaking, as the Deputy is probably aware, there can be an initial push-back but once the direct provision centre opens, it all dies away.  As the Deputy rightly points out, there is not a day's trouble from the vast majority of people.  When I visited Mosney, I asked if there was much trouble.  The people running the Mosney centre told me they had more trouble in a single bank holiday weekend when it was being run as a holiday centre than they had in the entire time it has been a direct provision centre.</p> <p>  We also need to manage the privacy of the people involved.  Rumours go around relating to opening a direct provision centre and placing people there.  We struggle to respond to that because we are obliged to maintain the privacy of the people involved.  We often have to respond to queries from the media and interested individuals by saying that we cannot give them the information they are looking for.  That is done in order to preserve the privacy of people in the international protection process.</p></speech>

Is it a short-term or a long-term contract?  Earlier it was mentioned that one individual had spent nine months in the same emergency accommodation.  We understand these contracts are short-term contracts for three or four months.  Are they simply automatically renewed and the same people end up staying on?  Will there be some protocol on that?</p> <p>  If it is emergency accommodation - this is another fear people have - can additional accommodation be added on?  For instance if there is a big yard behind a building, there is concern that several portakabins might be put in there, or is that out of the question?</p></speech>

We review them on a month-by-month basis but they are for a set number of rooms and people.

On at least three occasions, Ms Buckley referred to one direct provision centre by name.  We understand why.  While it has its issues, Mosney is by far the best representation of the current direct provision system.  It is not representative of what is out there, which is part of the problem we see.  We would have an even greater problem, if not even a crisis, were it not for some of the decisions that have been taken which have significantly relived the stress within the system.  I refer to the increase in the weekly stipend which has helped.  However, the much more important decision was the right to access work, to afford people the dignity and self-worth of work.</p><p>I say that because I know from my own community and knowledge of the situation that it has made an enormous difference, underscoring the fact that these are human beings just like ourselves who have the right to face a day's work and to come home in the evening, be he or she a single individual or, arguably more importantly, someone who has a family, as many of them do.  These are important decisions.  I would think that the current arrangement post nine months could be looked at.  It would be important to bring that back considerably.  It does not in any way impede the processing.<br/><br/>The processing issue is a big issue.  Little of Ms Buckley's opening statement and the focus of the questions related to what can be done.  I understand and appreciate the complexities and the legal elements within the appeals system <i>et al</i>.  All of that builds up, but how do we compare in terms of international comparators?  &quot;I do not know,&quot; is my honest answer.  We certainly need to explore the processing of applications with a mind to reaching real and fair decisions at the earliest possible time.  That is essential.<br/><br/>I will make a couple of points and invite Ms Buckley to respond in a general way at the end.  It strikes me that it is the Department of Justice and Equality and yet there is this ever present reality presenting here today that it is now, whether one likes it or not, almost a housing authority.  The Department has a cohort of people to provide housing for.  In the health services, people holding up beds have been wrongly described.  Here we are looking at people holding up beds within the direct provision system that might equate with the number in emergency accommodation if one were able to secure them housing accommodation within the wider society.  Are there steps being taken to explore what some of my colleague members have raised, namely, in terms of engagement with the housing associations?  I would echo some of the views of my colleague members in relation to looking seriously at the construction of temporary housing.  What stands out about Mosney as against some of these older buildings, be they whatever in past use, is that many of the latter are not suitable for what they are currently undertaking.  Mosney is quite unique because of its construct and the thought behind it.  Is there the prospect of replicating clusters of such standard?  If it is to be temporary direct provision, the greater number of us in any conversation would think that six months is more than adequate for the processing procedure and accommodation if there were housing provision of that standard that allowed people to cater to their own needs, to cook the food that they are used to, to have access to purchase through local stores, and to be able to perform and operate as a family in many of the instances that they are families.<br/><br/>On the concentration of effort on searching out and identifying former hotel properties, etc., the number of such properties is finite.  There is not an endless supply of these anymore than there is an endless supply of former agricultural colleges in my own backyard.  We need to be looking much more seriously because the numbers that present will not end tomorrow or next year.  The situations that have given rise to the growth in numbers are conflict situations that are continuing.  People are genuinely, in the greater number of cases, fleeing very fearful situations.  We need to step up to the plate in a real and serious way.  A serious exploration of that housing provision is the only way that we will move away from emergency accommodation.  I welcome the statement by Ms Buckley here today that we want to get out of emergency accommodation but we need to look seriously.  We cannot be hoping and praying that the numbers will drop and we will cope better then.  It will not happen that way.  We need to be looking at new and imaginative ways of dealing with it.  I underscore once more the need to examine speedier processing.  I would welcome any comment that Ms Buckley might have to make on that before we conclude.  Independent catering and the purchasing of food for meal preparation is such an important need for people and it is not universally the case.<br/><br/>It is sad to meet young school-going boys and girls and, as I have in the very recent past, to say to them knowing their school uniform, &quot;Are you looking forward to the holidays?&quot;  I can honestly say to Ms Buckley that not one in the little group that I spoke with was looking forward to the holidays.  For them, the great joy was getting to school every day rather than being in what they viewed as an isolated and limited scope location.  School enthused.  It gave them all sorts of opportunities, and mixing with the school population.  From the very first day of the school summer break, they are looking forward to getting back to school in September.  That is unique.  I guarantee Ms Buckley that was not my children's story or any of their neighbours'.  We need to be cognisant of that.<br/><br/>Ms Buckley spoke about health screening in advance of placement.  While RIA has not direct responsibility for health and education provision, nevertheless it states in its outline of responsibilities working with the other services to ensure this.  What of health issues presenting subsequently?  I am aware of situations, not in my own immediate backyard but elsewhere, where accessing a GP is now almost an impossible project.  Ms Buckley spoke of chickenpox.  Perhaps Mr. Sinclair would take a note of the following.  I wrote to RIA on Monday of this week, addressing it without a named official, instancing what I believe to be the case of an unaccompanied child within the direct provision system who is not accessing education and who in the course of the year so far has had chickenpox and could only access calamine.  The child had no access to a GP.  Because the young person is relatively tall for someone of that age, sometimes that child can be viewed as a young adult, which is not the case.  I have seen the birth certificate and I can confirm that the child is not.  The child is unaccompanied and in great distress.</p><p>I documented all of that this week and would appreciate it if the particular case was addressed.  It is absolutely imperative that the child and their needs be catered for.</p><p> I support the views expressed by Deputies Jack Chambers, O'Callaghan and others on the importance of having an independent audit of the accommodation centres and the needs of residents.  It is not only a case of presenting.  People may say those who are inclined to crib and cry would be the first ones to be heard; that in itself is not a non-Irish thing.  There is an element of fear and distrust among the population in the centres.  They are mindful that they are applicants for asylum and loath to give voice to matters, some of which could be quite simple and easily resolved, but they are fearful and the fear factor must be taken on board.  The people who engage and who would be trusted to carry out an independent audit, as opposed to the visit by the Reception and Integration Agency, vwhether announced or unannounced, need to have the people skills and necessary understanding of those whom they meet and deal with.  That is very important if the truth is to be got to.  It is very important to know the truth.</p><p> I have covered several matters in that outline.  People in my home county of Monaghan, a host community not only of direct provision but also emergency accommodation, are horrified by the approach to emergency accommodation.  We are cognisant of the references to moving people with very little notice to accommodate other events.  It offers no understanding whatever of people's dignity and their needs and there is great offence among the overwhelming number of the population of my home county at this.  There is a very strong view that we need to do much better than we are in direct provision centres.  I have indicated some of the issues for the delegates and invite them to make whatever closing comments they wish to make.</p></speech>

I agree that the centre in Mosney is the jewel in the crown and offers the model in terms of where we need to get in providing for independent living and so forth.  It is something we are working very hard to try to achieve.</p> <p>  It is very hard to compare internationally Ireland's processing system as we have a different legal system and structure for taking decisions.  We treat international protection applicants entirely differently from other European countries.  For example, other European countries detain applicants for asylum, but we do not detain anybody.  We are working very hard to achieve the nine-month median goal.  I would not be thanked by my colleague if I tried to set a more challenging goal for him and his team.  I was head of the Workplace Relations Commission and know that there is a limit to how by much a process can be shortened because people must be given an opportunity to return questionnaires, etc.  There is an absolute minimum that can be achieved.  Mr. Kirrane and his team have been working very hard to introduce a shortened timeframe for applications from applicants from some of the safe countries of origin we have referenced, including Albania and Georgia, in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  That will tighten the timeframes in a way that will remain fair to the applicants, but we must still give consideration to their individual application.</p> <p>  There was mention of health screening and access to healthcare after screening.  It is unusual that health screening is offered to everybody.  After people join the process, they have the same right to access health services as ordinary members of the Irish population.  The Chairman identified an issue.  We try to work closely with colleagues in the HSE, particularly where a direct provision centre is opening, to allay the concerns of the local population that there will be yet another demand placed on local GP services, etc.  It is a challenge.  There is no doubt that offering health services in any part of the country can present a challenge.</p> <p>  A child should not be in a direct provision centre.  If a child is brought to our attention, we refer the matter to Tusla services.  Children are referred to Tusla.</p></speech>

We will take the matter on board and examine it.</p> <p>  On the need to carry out an independent audit, we know that when standards are introduced, one of the important elements will be how we measure against them.  On the fear factor mentioned by the Chairman, nothing that happens in a direct provision centre such as the making of a complaint can have an impact on the decision-making process of the international protection office or the international protection appeals tribunal.  They are independent in the operation of their functions.  There is a Chinese wall between the systems in place.  I appreciate that there may be fear, but it may be just as well to say bluntly right now that somebody who complains in a centre about some circumstance within it will see absolutely no impact on the legal consideration given to the application for asylum or protected status.  As well as being able to complain to the RIA about any circumstance, it is good that people have a right of access to the Ombudsman and the children's ombudsman.  We have a system under which people can complain to somebody who is completely independent of the system to have his or her complaints addressed, just as an Irish person can.</p> <p>  That covers most of the issues raised.  We would be very interested in hearing any recommendation the committee might wish to present.  We cannot promise that we could change course as rapidly as others might like, but we know we that are moving towards a better system.  We will take on board and consider any recommendation the committee might have to make.  I reiterate that we are really open to considering other models of provision at the centres.  We are not fixed on one form.  However, we would probably have to have a row with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform if we wanted to change our budgetary position, but so be it.</p></speech>

This meeting is being convened for consideration of Committee Stage of two Bills, the first of which is the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) (Amendment) Bill 2019.  Before we proceed further I wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  We are joined by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials.

I am joined by my officials, Mr. Richard Fallon and Mr. Patrick McHale.</p> <p>  The Bill, as committee members will be aware from Second Stage, deals with the amendment of section 1A of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961.  The provisions deal with judicial resources.  The purpose of the amendment is to amend section 1A(2) of the 1961 Act and provides for the increase by six, from the current number of nine to 15, of the maximum number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal.  The amendment will achieve the primary purpose of the Bill, as initiated.</p></speech>

With co-operation it may well be possible to complete Report Stage tomorrow, whereupon I will be keen to contact the Business Committee with a view to commencing Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I do not have proposed dates with me but I would be happy to have the Opposition spokespersons, Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and O'Callaghan, contacted immediately after this meeting to ascertain their views on the matter.  We have the remainder of this week and then three more weeks.  My desire is that we could schedule Committee Stage of that Bill during the course of those three weeks.  Again, I would be in the hands of the committee in that regard.  There is a public sense of urgency with that legislation.  It is one of several tranches of priority legislation.  However, I understand the committee has a schedule of business and certainly it would not be my intention either to interrupt or disrupt that.  I am keen to contact the Deputies in advance of Report Stage in the Seanad tomorrow.</p></speech>

The purpose of this legislation, which is being promoted by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, is to provide greater protections for people who find themselves in the very unfortunate position of a financial institution trying to gain possession of their property.  Everyone here commends the Minister of State on seeking to improve the situation for people who find themselves in that unfortunate position and are before the courts.  As I mentioned during the Second Stage debate, my party is supportive of this legislation.  I do not know whether it will have a significant impact on the position of the aforementioned people when they are before the courts but hopefully it will.  I had tabled a number of amendments which would have improved the legislation in a number of ways.  First, it is very important that people who find themselves before the courts have the benefit of having the legal protections available to them advocated before the courts on their behalf.  That is why in one of the amendments I tabled, which is similar to an amendment tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I sought to expand the parameters of the Civil Legal Aid Act so that it would apply to the applications that can be brought under this new legislation.  I also wanted to put forward an amendment that dealt with the situation in respect of a person who is applying for the appointment of a receiver.  The appointment of a receiver is a very complex aspect of our legal system.  Generally, receivers are appointed pursuant to a deed of instrument or a contract.  The provision tabled by myself and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire aimed to facilitate a change in the law so that a receiver could not be appointed over a certain type of property unless there was an order from the court.  The final amendment I tabled is in respect of what may be a bit of an ambiguity in the Bill.  We all hope that when this legislation is enacted, it will apply to all existing mortgages and will not simply apply to mortgages that are created in the future.  We have a problem in Ireland at present with people who are in mortgage arrears and it is these people this Bill is seeking to protect and that the Oireachtas should be seeking to protect.  In that context, I am concerned that in the future, financial institutions will be able to claim that this legislation does not apply to mortgages that existed prior to its enactment.  </p><p>I had an opportunity last night to speak to the Minister of State about these amendments and I am conscious that if I push them, at best the legislation may be delayed and at worst, it my not be enacted.  That is not what I want to do.  My objective and that of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is to improve the legislation.  However, if there is a potential threat of the legislation not being enacted at all, I will withdraw my amendments.  It is preferable to get this legislation enacted and if it is enacted, I hope it will be of benefit to the house owners who find themselves in the terrible position to which I referred earlier.  I have some concerns, as I said, about the civil legal aid system and its application, the appointment of a receiver and the extent to which the legislation applies to existing mortgages.  If the courts interpret this legislation in a negative way once it is enacted, we will have to come back and amend it.  Indeed, we may need to amend it in any event in due course.  I want to see the legislation enacted without delay which is why I am not going to pursue or proceed with any of my amendments.</p></speech>

While a lot more needs to be done in this area, this is useful legislation.  We are discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 3 but I wish to refer to section 2 first.  There is an enormous issue, generally speaking, with the civil legal aid-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019061900002#B00900"><p>Okay.  In a general sense, there is a significant issue in relation to legal aid across a wide range of actions, including serious delays and excessive minimum contributions being requested due to under-funding of the Legal Aid Board.  The cases addressed by this legislation will inevitably involve significant legal argument at the Circuit Court, whereby people will have to have a debate with the financial institutions and their legal teams.  It is only right and proper that people who do not have the means, which will often be the case with people in mortgage arrears, should have access to civil legal aid, where appropriate, in order to make strong arguments on their own behalf in court in order to advance their case.  That is only right and proper.  The amendment providing for same has been ruled out of order because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer but it is a matter for which the Minister can provide on Report Stage.  The Department can try to address it because it is vitally important.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the other amendments, specifically amendment No. 3.  We had a meeting with Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, recently and Deputy O'Callaghan has also had communications with that organisation about an issue it has correctly highlighted.  There are instances, increasingly, of people who due to mortgage arrears have moved out of a mortgaged property, moved back into the family home and rented out the mortgaged property.  They did so in order to meet their mortgage payments and to keep up with their financial obligations in the hope that in the longer term, they would be able to move back into the property.  However, because they are renting out the property, it is possible to appoint receivers without the same court procedures that might apply for a repossession.  The financial institution does not have to go through the repossession process and the additional protections that have been created in that regard do not apply.  Neither would the protections in this legislation apply.  In such cases, we are proposing that applications for receivership should come to the Circuit Court.  Very often these are people who are trying to do the best they can to stay on top of their mortgages in order to get their home back.  That is what they want to do but there is a backdoor there that has been created.  Often it is not the traditional banks but some of the other financial institutions that are using that backdoor and in those circumstances, the people involved need protection which is what the amendment seeks to provide.  </p> <p>  The final amendment, to which Deputy O'Callaghan also referred, deals with the issue of retrospectivity and I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position in that regard.  It is not immediately clear that this Bill will apply retrospectively.  It must be the case that the tens of thousands of mortgages that are in arrears and the people who are very worried about repossession are afforded the maximum protection.  The amendments that Deputy O'Callaghan and I have tabled seek to ensure that retrospectivity is crystal clear and to provide a sound legal basis for those people in this legislation.  </p> <p>  Generally I do not share Deputy O'Callaghan's view on the amendments, which I communicated to him.</p><p>I accept the point, and do not feel any desire to delay this legislation unduly, but this is how the legislative process works.  We have a discussion and we table amendments to try to strengthen the Bill.  I believe that these amendments do strengthen the Bill.  If it is delayed subsequent to that, and people decide to try to slow it down, that is a matter for the Government and the Minister's colleagues.  These are good amendments and it is worth including them in the legislation.  Consequently, I will press them.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate the amendments before us, but tens of thousands of people have campaigned for this, and some of them have been on the Deputy's doorstep and mine.  We are a minority Government and do not know what will happen next.  This legislation could be enacted as quickly as before the summer, but to delay it and go back to get a legal opinion could mean that it might never see the light of day.  The people out there are asking us, as legislators, to do this, and this Bill will help those people.  I respect what the Deputy says, but we should look at it.</p></speech>

The basic objective of the Bill is to propose added protection for people in mortgage arrears in respect of their principal private residence.  This amendment will not help such people in any way for the simple reason that the receivers are not appointed to a principal private residence.  Receivers are generally appointed to buy-to-let properties with the purpose of ensuring that any rental income on the property is used to service the mortgage.  In the case of the principal private residence, there is no rental income and so the appointment of a receiver would be of no benefit to the lender.  However, receivers may be appointed to buy-to-let premises on which there is a house loan mortgage where the borrower continues to collect the rental income but is not using it to service the mortgage.  The appointment of a receiver in such a case is fully justified, for the same reason that a receiver may be appointed to receive rent in the case of other commercial properties.  It is not clear why, in such circumstances, the borrower should benefit from the additional protection set out in the amendment.</p> <p>  The rationale behind the proposed amendment is to assist certain borrowers who, for whatever reason, rent out their principal private residence with a view to serving the mortgage.  Such an action is itself a breach of the mortgage contract.  It is not clear how often this happens.  However, the proposed amendment would cover all instances where the lender decided to appoint a receiver, which would include all buy-to-let mortgages.  This would invariably cause difficulty for the Courts Service, given the demands on its time and the cost of processing applications for court orders.  Recent figures from the Central Bank indicate that receivers have been appointed to more than 5,600 buy-to-let mortgage accounts, and approximately 300 receivers are appointed to such accounts every quarter.  This requires lenders to apply for a court order prior to the appointment of a receiver and leads to increased demands on the Courts Service's time and cost. </p> <p>  I should add that, apart from any statutory power to appoint a receiver, mortgage deeds normally reserve the contractual right for the mortgage to appoint a receiver when conditions such as those in section 108(1) are satisfied.  The amendment seeks to set aside terms that may be contained in the mortgage agreement contract and could lead to a legislative challenge.  If the amendment is passed, the Minister has indicated that it will be necessary to obtain legal advice prior to Report Stage, which would delay the passing of the Bill.  That is why we will be opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

I spoke to the purpose of this briefly in my initial remarks.  It is very simple: we want to ensure that all existing cases of people in mortgage arrears are covered by this.  It is my view and that of FLAC, and to some extent Deputy O'Callaghan, that they are not necessarily covered.  That is not immediately clear to me that they are.  That is why the amendment was tabled.  I am likely to press the amendment, but is the Minister of State absolutely certain that existing cases are covered by this legislation?</p></speech>

The intention behind the amendments is unclear, but may arise from the desire that the Bill should have retrospective effect.  To that end, the amendment seeks to insert a new section with the words "any proceedings brought by a mortgagee, irrespective of when the mortgage was created".  I consider the amendment unnecessary, as it is clear from the current wording that the section applies to any and all proceedings brought by the mortgagee for the possession of land to which section 2 applies.  The amendment adds nothing; on the contrary, by departing from the existing wording in section 2 it seems to suggest that the range of mortgages to which section 2A would apply is wider than the range under section 2.  There is a danger that the amendment will create uncertainty on the scope of the Bill.  The current wording is consistent with section 2(2) of the 2013 Act, and amending it in the manner suggested could create confusion as to its scope.</p></speech>

It seems to me the wording is open to challenge by financial institutions saying that it does not apply and is only for cases arising in the future, especially given that legislation generally applies to future cases.  There is a tendency against retrospective application, but it is desirable here.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could clarify that as best he can, because I am not confident in the wording.</p></speech>

We are about to discuss transport proposals but one glaring omission from the Government's recent publication is the concept of free public transport.  Many cities worldwide are moving to free public transport and Luxembourg is the first country to do so in its entirety.  This is vital if we are to tackle climate change and meet the demand for less carbon emissions.  It would also free up the roads from congestion, which is a major issue in many cities, particularly in the Dublin suburbs where I come from.  Yesterday, it took me about an hour and 15 minutes to get home to Blanchardstown and other people have a longer daily commute.  The Government's proposal largely contains punitive measures such as higher car parking charges for vehicles with higher emissions, but not everyone has the money or the wherewithal to switch to lower vehicular use and we do not have the public transport to allow people to get out of their cars.  That is the reality.  As I have noted previously, there are 110,000 people in Blanchardstown but there is no Luas or metro connection to the area, which is bus dependent.  A rail line serves some of the area but it is inaccessible for most people and the industrial areas.</p> <p>  We probably need more than one session on this matter if the committee is serious about contributing to tackling the global emergency that has now been recognised by young people and in the recent election.  We should consider this and there are cities we can look at and expert witnesses we could invite.  Tallinn in Estonia, Dunkirk in France, Luxembourg and many cities in Poland all have free public transport.  I ask members to support that idea and to put together proposals.</p></speech>

Its members are appointed by the Taoiseach and represent business, employers, trade unions, agricultural, community and voluntary organisations, and environmental organisations.  We also have heads of Departments and independent experts on our council.  The composition of the NESC means that it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with Government.  Dr. Jeanne Moore and I are here as members of the secretariat.</p> <p>  There is a strong and growing consensus across society, the Oireachtas and Government that ambitious and meaningful policy action is urgently required to address climate change.  In the council's latest report, Climate-Change Policy: Getting the Process Right, we argue that what is required is a mission-oriented approach to climate that will help us to drive the development of actions and solutions that will decarbonise our economy.  That would allow us to capture the full range of positive benefits from what we have seen must be a just transition to a low-carbon future in terms of our economy, health, well-being, air quality and enhanced biodiversity.  However, the council points out that ambitious goals such as these without a rigorous and reflective policy will not be sufficient to deliver a transition to a low-carbon future.</p> <p>  What the council has focused on in its report is to ensure that growing ambition is matched by action.  What is required is a process of policy development and continuous improvement, which over time can force emissions downwards at the scale and pace we require.  The system we talk about uses target setting at a specific level, action and review that will ensure ambitious actions on climate, which would often encounter difficulties, costs and contested ideas, need to be grappled with and not glossed over.  We accept that in many areas of climate change policy the precise details about how we will act are not yet fully worked out but progress has still to be achieved in the face of that uncertainty.</p> <p>  The council talks about continuous improvement in policy and I will focus on what that means for climate and specifically for transport.  For climate policy, the council strongly supports the Government&rsquo;s proposal to adopt a policy and implementation process modelled on the Action Plan for Jobs.  The process it outlines in its report also bears close similarity to the proposal of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action to establish a climate action implementation board.  Such a process and structure can provide the key mechanism that will allow for intensive reporting and monitoring of action.  However, the existing range of known actions on climate policy, even if fully implemented, will not be sufficient.  The council, therefore, recommends that along with the monitoring process in the Action Plan for Jobs, which rightly focuses on the need to check implementation and deliverables, it should in the case of climate change be enhanced to make sure that Government agencies actively explore, find, trial and cost new solutions for specific contexts.  In doing so, the Government agencies will have to engage and collaborate with each other and with the non-Government actors in their respective networks.  This Action Plan for Jobs plus process at the centre of Government will have a key role in trying to pool the learning from action on the front line in various sectors to prompt co-operation between Departments and sectors to find and exploit the co-benefits for health, well-being and the environment.</p> <p>  On transport, the council identifies three key additional activities and processes that would support future climate action.  First, the council strongly supports the role of task forces in searching for appropriate solutions.  The report by Dr. Torney and Dr. Devaney focuses on a low emissions vehicle task force in transport as something that seems to have the capacity to do the key element of grappling with the complexity and uncertainty that characterises some of the actions that are required in the transport sector.  Running such task forces and learning from their work should form a core part of the climate policy and not only be tangential to it.</p> <p>  Second, the council highlights the role of departmental and agency-led processes that would support breakthroughs and innovation, and scale-up promising solutions.  They would achieve this by using the full range of tools available, including regulation, acting as facilitator and convenor, and using the traditional instruments that shape behaviour such as taxes, charges and subsidies.</p> <p>  Third, the council recommends that an enhanced research and knowledge-generating capacity and capability are required in transport because they are lacking in transport compared to other sectors such as agriculture and energy where Teagasc and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, are key resources.  What the council envisages is a research approach and capacity that are very close to practice and that help in finding new solutions and identifying obstacles and challenges to progress.  Examples we cite are research trials on practical issues such as parking policy, cycling and safety, how we might prioritise pedestrians in urban areas and congestion charges.  The second area is how we engage people and communities in trying to find and see the co-benefits of having a more sustainable mobility system.  The third area is using our research to develop best-practice guidelines and standards, and advisory support where it is needed, for example, in creating safe walking routes in rural areas.</p> <p>  These three innovations-task forces, which would move specific issues forward, using more of the co-ordinating force and instruments of the State to increase the pace of change; and an enhanced practice orientated research programme would in the council&rsquo;s view create the means of continuously improving the sustainability and quality of our mobility system and wider climate policy process.</p><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our work.  My colleague, Dr. Jeanne Moore, and I are happy to answer any questions committee members have.</p></speech>

My colleague, Dr. Laura Devaney, of the School of Law and Government in Dublin City University and I completed this research which was commissioned by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  However, the analysis and conclusions are ours and do not necessarily represent the views of the council or its secretariat.</p> <p>  The climate crisis has gained unprecedented prominence in Irish politics, media and society in recent months.  This is not before time but better late than never.  Stark warnings last October from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, highlighted the risks involved if we fail to limit global heating to 1.5&deg;C.  These risks include more extreme droughts and floods, as well as severe impacts on ecosystems and human communities.  The IPCC report was equally unequivocal in highlighting that we are on a dangerous pathway.  The world has already warmed by approximately 1&deg;C and we are currently headed for 3&deg;C of heating.  To have a chance of limiting heating to 1.5&deg;C, we need a radical change of direction that will bring us to zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century.</p> <p>  Young people took to the streets across the country in their thousands in March and again last month to put pressure on politicians to tackle the climate crisis which poses a grave threat to their future.  The results of the recent European and local elections illustrated that climate change has indeed moved to the centre of politics.  Momentum for necessary climate action is growing.  However, emissions projections from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, show that Ireland will, in a best-case scenario, achieve a 0.4% reduction in emissions in the sectors of the economy outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme by 2020.  This compares to a 20% decarbonisation target.  Nobody claims that Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate safe future will be cheap or easy.  If it were, we would have done it long ago.  What is beyond doubt, however, is that it is necessary and achievable.</p> <p>  Ireland has struggled to decarbonise transport.  Emissions from this sector fell during the recession but have grown significantly since and remain responsible for approximately 20% of our national emissions.  The NESC commissioned Dr. Devaney and I to undertake a study of how governance structures enable or constrain low-carbon transition in Irish transport.  It is important to note that, in focusing on governance structures, our report does not go into detail on what the appropriate balance is between different specific modes of transport or what policy instruments are best placed to spur low-carbon transition.</p> <p>  Governance institutions are key enabling factors for decarbonisation across economy and society.  The international literature on governance of low-carbon transition points to the importance of bottom-up innovation and experimentation, as well as top-down direction from central government.  Drawing on desk-based research and interviews with key stakeholders, we show how a low-carbon transition in Irish transport could be better facilitated by modifications to governance institutions and the broader policy system.</p> <p>  There are three dimensions to our diagnosis of the challenges facing the transport sector in transitioning to a low-carbon future.  First, the Irish transport sector is inherently complex.  There are tensions between public and private actors in charge of different transport options, rural and urban divides, as well as special interests playing a strong role.  Delivering transport also interacts in complex ways with broader policy systems, including where we locate our housing, schools, hospitals and other facilities.  Second, low-carbon transition is not yet a priority in transport.  Contestation between different players has shaped the development of a carbon-intensive transport system to date.  There is also disagreement over what low-carbon transition might entail across different elements of the transport sector such as between passenger and freight transport.  Third, our system of transport decision-making is deeply fragmented.  Authority is spread among multiple institutions whose mandates often have not kept pace with the urgency of the climate crisis.</p></speech>

These recommendations were developed in advance of the Government&rsquo;s publication of its climate action plan on Monday.</p> <p>  Building on the diagnosis of the transport sector, as outlined by Dr. Torney, our research identifies recommendations and poses questions for stakeholders who wish to strengthen low-carbon transition in Irish transport.  These align with our three key research themes.</p> <p>  First, acknowledging complexities in the transport sector, transport governance should be built on the following principles.  We need to adopt a collaborative, adaptive and reflexive approach to policy making.  This requires input from a diverse range of public, private and civil society actors whose voices are not sufficiently heard.  Stakeholder engagement is essential to enhance transparency, legitimacy and trust in decision-making, along with generating better outcomes.  We should support bottom-up approaches to low-carbon transport.  This approach takes into account geographical and technical variations, as well as the rural-urban divide which results in different transport solutions and investment required in different areas.</p> <p>  We need to understand transport as a social practice to promote positive behaviour change.  This means that we must consider the socio-cultural, technical and governance forces that shape our mobility choices.  Designing and implementing appropriate combinations of these interventions will ensure we have the right incentives, options and new social norms to make low-carbon transport easy to choose.</p> <p>  Second, challenging institutional priorities that to date have not included a strong focus on low-carbon transition, we propose several recommendations.  Transport policy-making should be aligned with international sustainable mobility thinking that promotes an avoid, shift, improve, ASI, framework for both passenger and freight transport.  For the systemic change required, this would more clearly emphasise a hierarchy which focuses on reducing journeys in the first place through better land-use planning, for example.  It also aims to achieve modal shift, for instance, to public transport, walking and cycling in passenger transport, as well as rail and alternative last-mile delivery options in freight.  Finally, the ASI framework focuses on improving vehicle efficiencies, for example, through using alternative fuels, electrification or enhancing engine efficiencies.</p> <p>  The Government needs to provide low-carbon direction.  This will signal a new pathway to investors, consumers and citizens.  This includes leadership from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but should also be underpinned by a whole-of-government approach to climate action.  The mandates of transport governance actors should be revised to include a statutory commitment to prioritise low-carbon development.  More detailed carbon accounting, along with a heavier weight assigned to this, could feature in project appraisals to inform decisions about transport investments.</p> <p>  The public sector should lead by example.  This could include not just central government but also, for example, local authorities switching fleets to electrified alternatives.  The Civil Service should give greater priority to low-carbon transition in its hiring, promotion and travel schemes.</p> <p>  Changing who shapes transport outcomes, our research identifies a variety of institutional remedies which can help to advance the low carbon transition.</p><p>Focused taskforces could combine insights from public, private, academic and civil society actors around specific transport challenges.  This could build upon the success of the low emissions vehicle taskforce that provided a structured forum and brought together key actors to unblock policy action for electric vehicle incentivisation.  Multimodal transport hubs that connect transport options hold promise for decarbonising Irish passenger transport, along with enhanced redistribution hubs to decarbonise freight.  Public private partnerships may help to progress such low carbon hubs, combining funding and expertise for change.  Forums for peer learning can help villages, towns and cities across Ireland to learn from each other and to scale up innovative low carbon transport solutions.  A variety of settlement sizes could learn from one another&rsquo;s experimental approaches, while recognising important differences across the transport landscape.  Deliberative forums for stakeholder and citizen participation could enhance transparency and moderate the impact of lobbying by special interests.  Public information offices could be established, along with structured citizen assemblies for deliberation and engagement.  Research infrastructure for transport policymaking that supports more diverse and inclusive transport research is needed, as well as channels of communication and absorptive capacity for more evidence-based policymaking.  This includes the potential for intermediary institutions and for enhanced knowledge exchange between academia and Government, as well as participatory backcasting approaches to create implementable transition frameworks.</p><p> None of these solutions by themselves are a silver bullet but, together, they can provide a governance framework that adequately addresses the climate crisis.  We need to tackle Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions head on.  The recent declaration of a climate emergency by the D&aacute;il made international headlines but it will be meaningless if not backed up by concrete action.  Transport would be a good place to start.</p></speech>

I like very much the principles that have been enunciated today.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019061900002#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for giving their time today.  As was rightly said, in the past six months there has been a huge uptick in interest among the public and policymakers in terms of how we tackle climate change.  It is welcome and timely that the witnesses are here, given the Government published its climate action plan earlier this week.  As transport is the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it obviously has a key role to play in terms of how we tackle this.</p> <p>  There is huge emphasis in the Government plan on transferring people from fossil fuel cars to electric vehicles, and it seems to be one of its key points.  In 2010, there was a plan to have 200,000 electric vehicles by 2020 but that was revised downwards in 2014 to 50,000 vehicles and further revised downwards in 2018 to 20,000.  Therefore, despite setting our plans, we have failed abysmally in terms of achievement.</p> <p>  As somebody who piloted an electric vehicle for six weeks in the run-up to the local elections, I can see why people would not make the transition.  Our infrastructure is extremely poor, in particular the number of charge points.  I live in a village nine miles outside Mullingar and it has no charge point.  When I come to Mullingar, the provincial town of County Westmeath with a population of 15,000 people, there are six public charge points but no high-speed charge point.  If we are talking about enabling people to make the transition, we have a long way to go.  It is not so much a question of encouraging people because there is a willingness, but there is the practical question of whether people can actually do this.  After six weeks, I found myself asking whether I could survive with an electric vehicle and the answer at the moment, until the range improves, is "No".</p> <p>  One of the witnesses made the point that while it is welcome there are goals or targets, there are no timelines for implementation of these targets or any precise details.  Page 90 of the Government's climate action plan contains a measure that will "Require new non-residential buildings with more than 10 parking spaces to have at least one recharging point installed by 1 January 2025".  Therefore, there might be a car park with 200 spaces that has one charging point by 2025, which is just not ambitious enough.  From what the witnesses have said today, electric vehicles should nearly be the last piece of the jigsaw whereas the Government policy seems to make it the first piece of the jigsaw.</p> <p>  To follow on from what one of my colleagues said earlier, it would be great to make public transport free but, even if that was introduced in the morning, we have no extra capacity on very many routes.  Our ticketing system is not even integrated, never mind the system being integrated for users.  That is another issue.</p> <p>  Dr. Devaney raised a point on forums for peer learning.  Despite the obvious uptick - the results of the last local and European elections demonstrated there is further acknowledgement and awareness that this is a real issue - there is still huge scepticism on climate change and a huge reluctance as to how we are to make the transition so that it will not cost us.  The Government said this can be done in a nudge, nudge way but I do not think it can be.  Significant sacrifices will need to be made, which will cost money.</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on the Government's climate action plan.  Perhaps I am being unduly hard on it, and coming from the Opposition benches, that may be natural.  I would be interested to hear their views.  I would also be interested to know if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has had any engagement with the National Economic and Social Council in regard to its research, in particular how it can extract the NESC's key findings and implement them in Government policies.  Given we have failed to achieve all the targets we have set ourselves to date, how would the witnesses prioritise the changes that need to be made?  As an example, if any of them were Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow morning, and had an opportunity to make three or four changes with immediate effect that, in their opinion, would give the greatest return in terms of reduction in carbon emissions, what would they be? </p></speech>

On whether the Department has been involved in any way with the research, Ms Laura Behan from the Department was on the steering group for the research.  She was supportive and had good input into the work as it was done.  The work has just been published and we have not met Ms Behan since.  I acknowledge that because it was an important part of us commissioning the work.  It was a short piece of research and, therefore, I commend my colleagues on getting under the skin of the transport sector in the way they did.  We wanted to examine a process aspect in respect of institutional governance, which NESC is interested in, along with the specific technical issues that my colleagues will be able to address.</p> <p>  On the necessary shift in the system, the individual must be put at the centre of the policy and transport system.  If we are trying to create a system of sustainable mobility, not only do we need to think more about the technical changes to electric vehicles, EVs, as the Deputy mentioned, but also social aspects need to be at the heart of policy-making and planning.  That involves the digital transition as well as the wider issues of the opportunities that stem from a low-carbon transition.  That framing, namely, starting to put the individual at the centre, means that different questions must be asked.  Given that we have thought about how to persuade people not to use their cars, we must ask how we can make the infrastructure supportive of them cycling and walking.  The latter are risky activities in the city centre at present.  We need to think about putting the individual at the heart of the issue, and building out questions and supporting networks to understand how it might be developed.  My colleagues might wish to comment further on some aspects.</p> <p>  I welcome the climate action plan and the significant steps towards thinking about the governance arrangements therein, which we acknowledge in our report.  We noted that a climate action delivery board is important for delivering concrete actions.  As Dr. O'Connell stated, our report favours an Action-Plan-for-Jobs-plus type of approach.  As well as the kind of delivery mechanism outlined in the climate action plan, we must ask what kind of process is it necessary to generate, tailor and generalise solutions.  We must also ask what else can be done to try to get under some of the innovative, bottom-up practices that my colleagues have outlined, and how could they be fed into the process.  I welcome the signal that governance is being taken seriously.  My colleagues might comment on how to embed some of those solutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Devaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019061900002#J00200"><p>I almost wrote another full opening statement on my reaction to the climate action plan, although I will not bore the committee with it.  Echoing what Dr. Moore stated, I welcome the plan.  It is timely and necessary for the climate to receive such political attention.  Getting the top-down governance right has been an important part of the plan and is welcome in respect of the direction, the carbon budgets, the emphasis on just transition and citizen engagement, all of which are elements the authors got right.</p> <p>  On transport, I reiterate that mine is a personal reflection based on my experience from research of various forms of environmental governance and our research did not focus on the climate action plan.  I worry about the overemphasis on the "I" part of the avoid, shift, improve framework that we mention in our research.  The "I" is about improving efficiencies and, as the Deputy correctly noted, the overemphasis on EVs as being capable of solving everything.  There is a nod to other aspects, such as avoiding journeys by work-from-home models and more compact growth, and there is a bit on the shift to public transport and the establishment of a cycling office.  Unfortunately, however, the predominant focus is on EVs.  I do not agree with that from a progress or transformative perspective.  EVs are part of the solution, however, and they will be important in rural areas that do not public transport or where people cannot cycle to certain places.  In such sprawled settlements, they will have a low-carbon benefit, albeit only if the energy source is decarbonised.  If we move from a low-carbon framing to one for sustainable mobility, EVs have contradictions, such as not addressing issues of congestion or the costs, stress or health implications associated with that, not reducing accidents and not promoting active transport.  There are also social sustainability concerns, even in respect of the sourcing of materials for EVs, as we mention in our report.  There have been cases of increases in child labour, such as in Democratic Republic of the Congo, where cobalt is sourced for EV batteries due to increasing demand.  We must be careful, therefore, to understand the life-cycle analysis aspect of EVs.  That is my reflection on the wider focus of the transport chapter.</p> <p>  I have similar questions about the focus on compressed natural gas, CNG, given that it is a fossil fuel, even if it is the only option, such as for freight.  I would be worried about being locked into another fossil fuel in that regard.  Research done in Europe has shown that while there may be carbon savings from CNG, there is a potential for methane leakage, which is a much more potent greenhouse gas emission.  The emissions benefit, therefore, might not be what we expect.</p> <p>  Similar sourcing conflicts in the case of biofuels affect food and feed.  The sustainable production of the virgin material is essential.  If using used cooking oil or waste, we should ask whether it is being imported from abroad, what the emissions profile is and whether we are achieving the desired objectives of the plan.</p> <p>  I was struck by the neglect of aviation.  Obviously, it is part of a different regulatory scheme.  It can be part of the emissions trading scheme and there are other international regulations relating to it.  However, it is remiss to ignore aviation, particularly as there has been discussion about establishing and investing in Waterford Airport or, potentially, a third terminal for Dublin Airport.  There is no mention of the environmental impact of such decisions relating to infrastructure.  For more cohesive, transformative policy-making, we need to consider aviation with the climate action plan.  In a nutshell, there has been too much focus on technology, EVs or CNG solving everything, whereas there are not many tangible ideas for public transport, such as Deputy Coppinger's suggestion of free public transport.  There was a note on the sharing economy but there has been no progress in respect of, for example, developing sharing schemes for bicycles, electric scooters or cars, which would have a much more positive, sustainable impact on emissions and the necessary social aspect.</p> <p>  There is an over-reliance on tax to change behaviour.  From my experience of working in sustainable consumption fields, I know that we need to use tax as the motivation for behaviour change.  I refer to a social practice approach, as Dr. Moore referred to and our report outlines.  As the Deputy Coppinger noted, we should consider the charging network and incentives to buy EVs - both timely issues - but we must also examine the position regarding education and information awareness promotion.  There could be positive incentives if we moved away from punitive measures.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that it is just a plan and that the next step is to implement it and create policy.  Nevertheless, it is important to get the plan right in the first place.  There should be a greater focus on avoiding journeys in the first instance, while shifting to public transport options and alternatives to CNG for freight are essential.</p></speech>

If our guests became Minister with responsibility for transport, what three changes would they make with immediate effect?</p></speech>

My response to the Deputy's final question builds on what Dr. Devaney said about the overemphasis in the transport chapter on technological improvement.  As our report shows, we need to recognise that transport systems vary and there are different challenges in different parts of the country.  There is a place for EV roll-out but one of the main constraints in that regard is the charging infrastructure.  The costs are decreasing significantly.</p><p>The action plan makes reference to the fact that Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which has crunched the numbers on this, projects that by 2022 electric vehicles for private transport will be cheaper on a total cost of ownership basis than internal combustion engines.  That means that just three years from now, the combined purchase cost and running cost of electric vehicles over their lifetimes will be cheaper.  They will become the obvious choice but not if the charging infrastructure is not in place.  That is one thing we really need to focus on and prioritise.</p><p> To pick up on Dr. Devaney's emphasis on the avoid, shift, improve approach, we need to prioritise public transport to an extent that is not reflected strongly enough in the climate action plan.  I refer to more funding for public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure.  When we were waiting to come in this morning we remarked on the importance of things as simple as traffic light sequences.  Cyclists and pedestrians seem to be an afterthought in the way that we design our public spaces and allocate space to different modes of transport.  I would place a priority on that.  As Dr. Devaney said, this does not come through strongly in the climate action plan published on Monday. </p></speech>

I was struck by the example of Vienna, where the city was designed on the basis of whether a child could navigate it.  An approach like that puts pedestrians at the heart of public transport planning.  I cycle and I nearly collided with a bus this morning.  Thought must be put into urban design.</p> <p>  With regard to the forum for peer learning, there is considerable motivation to change.  People recognise how serious the situation is with regard to climate action.  Peer-to-peer learning is important.  I am very struck by the example of the sustainable energy communities.  Communities themselves come up with energy solutions and renewable energy planning.  They then talk to other communities about how they did it and the lessons learned.  Something similar could apply to local transport based solutions that would engage public participatory networks at a local level.  The national dialogue on climate action has a lot of infrastructure at community level which could help people to arrive at bottom-up solutions.  The policy system could learn from these and then roll out the approaches that work.  One change I would make would be to resource bottom-up solutions and put in place a mechanism to learn from them and pick up initiatives that work.  </p></speech>

We have been quite lazy.  Certainly local authorities have been quite lazy.  Many years ago, we got funding for cycle paths and the local authorities built footpaths.  There are much stricter conditions in place now.  We are talking about cities and it is great to see so many cyclists in Dublin.  I live in a rural area.  Carrick-on-Shannon is a central town for north County Roscommon and south County Leitrim.  It would only take 45 or 50 minutes to cycle from Boyle to Carrick-on-Shannon or <i>vice versa</i>.  Much more can be done, as is shown by the model of Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands.  People could be able to cycle between little villages.  Many things are happening but the infrastructure is still not in place.</p><p>Dr. Moore's suggestion of allowing towns and villages to come up with ideas for helping the environment would be a great incentive.  Perhaps those villages and towns could save money or learn from one another.  We are on the cusp of something great.  As I have said, I have seen the approach taken by most local authorities.  They use the funding for cycle routes to build their own infrastructure, which is wrong.  There is a much better way.  </p><p>We all want to use public transport.  There is a squeezed middle out there.  I do not have free transport.  Living in Dublin I can get a Leap card and take the bus, which is great and good value.  However, we do not use the trains or buses as often as we might.  Let us suppose there was an incentive.  Let us say &euro;5 was charged for every train journey.  What would that cost the taxpayer?  Would it cost billions or millions?  Is that incentive provided in any other country?  The train service is not as bad in Ireland as in the UK.  Is there any incentive that could motivate people in the middle ground who do not have annual tickets to get off the roads?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Larry O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019061900002#K00400"><p>I will come back on that question and also refer to Deputy Coppinger's proposal for free public transport.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, conference was attended by the mayor of Vienna.  Vienna did not quite introduce free transport.  Rather, the authorities introduced a pass, costing about &euro;300 for a year, covering all of a holder's public transport needs.  Senator Feighan asked about costs.  It would have to be analysed but the Viennese approach almost paid for itself.  A big subvention was provided by the authorities but the uptake was huge.  It was quite interesting to see what happened when an entry point was provided.</p> <p>  The essential issue and the view of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is that many issues around decarbonising transport will be complex.  We need to get into the detail of how projects work.  I am very interested in public transport.  As was discussed earlier, part of the question is whether there are international examples.  That will get us so far but the specific details will then become complex.  The minute free public transport is offered, we will need much more of it.  We will need more bus lanes.  Then we will encounter the complexities of communities and how they will react.  All sorts of risks will arise.  Ticketing was mentioned.  All of that has to be resolved.  Safety issues arise when many more people are taking public transport or walking in cities.  This is not an argument not to do it.  This question goes beyond transport in a sense.  As has been said, it will create costs for the Exchequer and raise issues around planning and community engagement.  The NESC view is that if we are serious about climate, those are exactly the types of projects the Government must take on and analyse seriously.  This project would be of interest to NESC.  We need to get involved in initiatives with that degree of complexity and ambition.</p> <p>  As Dr. Moore noted, that project also depends on community engagement and a process of collaboration.  We recently came across a project in Inchicore where the residents are proposing a contraflow system.  That might allow public transport to operate by having lanes move in different directions at different times.  That is what we want; somebody in the community coming forward with the solution.  We must ask what type of process we need to create in local communities to get solutions on the table early.  When NESC talks about the projects being complex we are not discouraging them.  The question is how to delve into them.  I am very interested in the suggestion of a session of one or two days discussing public transport.  That is something in which NESC would be interested. </p></speech>

I realise that there is a limit to what academics and NGOs can argue for.  What the witnesses are arguing for is relatively conservative compared with what other cities have done around free public transport.  I am glad the witnesses are open to the idea.  The crisis we have is not an ordinary one.</p><p>I am sure everyone knows the now Greta Thunberg's legendary quote that we ought to act like our house is on fire.  What the Government has put out has pushed them a little further than they would have gone a year or two ago.  We can thank the young people who took to the streets and the fright many people received during the elections.  However, we need not just radical changes but also revolutionary ones globally to tackle climate change if we are talking about a window of ten to 12 years.  Governments are still standing with their arms folded.  My ideological view is that as long as the economy and the transport sector are in private hands, it will be extremely difficult to make the changes that are necessary.  <br/><br/>It is good that we will have a session on transport.  There was a special conference early last year on free public transport when the figure was about 100 cities.  It has increased and now includes Luxembourg.  Initially, it was treated as if the idea was absurd and it was said there would have to be huge investment.  The Taoiseach said we did not have the capacity.  He was asked about it yesterday by <i>The Journal</i>, as was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who pooh-poohed the idea even more because he was so committed to private transport.  The Taoiseach and I represent the same constituency.  He has noted that he comes from the commuter belt and that he would be very worried about the impact if we had it straightaway, but nobody is saying we should do it straightaway.  Most countries do it one year after it is announced.  The bus fleet could be increased straightaway, or quickly.  It would also be necessary to examine light rail systems.  I will carry out some research in that regard.  In this country they are not built quickly, but I have seen reports that they have been built in two years elsewhere.  If it is really considered to be an emergency, that is what must happen.<br/><br/>Some of the benefits of investing in public transport include reduced numbers of road traffic accidents in all of the cities in question, cleaner air, less noise, faster emergency response times which also save money and the abolition of ticket infrastructure.  People may recall the time when there were toll booths on the M50.  I went through them daily and it added about 30 minutes to journey times.  There is a saving to be made on infrastructure.  There is the use of the free travel pass at limited times, but in these cases more people started to use public transport, which enhanced commerce in cities and businesses started to make more money.  People in parts of Clonee or Mulhudart are marooned and isolated because they cannot get into the city.  When I was teaching in west Tallaght I recall bringing some of the pupils into the city centre which was like a different universe for some of them because they did not spend much time there.  For so long there has been neoliberal concept that everything must be paid for, but in the past many countries had free public transport, which is probably why countries such as Poland have so many cities where it is provided.  It has been introduced in many cities in China.  In Tallinn in Estonia passenger numbers increased eightfold very quickly when free public transport was introduced.  There was also a tourism boom as more people visited the city.  Yes, there would be an initial investment which would require progressive taxation of wealth to pay for free public transport.  It cannot come only from ordinary workers and the working class all the time, which is the Government's default position.  It must come from huge increases in taxation.  As Dublin is now the slowest moving city in Europe, we must examine this issue.</p></speech>

I am interested in the project.  I am only pointing out that part of the NESC's approach on the issue would be trying to probe some of the complexities.  There are some when one tries to figure out some of these things.</p> <p>  There is a clear recommendation in the climate action plan that the NESC have a role in monitoring the just transition as the climate plan is implemented.  We are very interested in that work.  One of the big challenges is how does one identify who is the most vulnerable and impacted on by the transition.  Transport is one area that arises for consideration in that context.  When one models it, the high-level transport sector emerges in the ESRI's analysis.  For information, one piece of work we propose to do is qualitative research in the transport sector to identify some of the workers who would be most vulnerable in the low carbon transition.</p></speech>

They will be impacted on greatly.  Part of the issue is selling the message and the policy and ensuring the economic impact of the changes on people in the workplace will be reduced as much as possible or that they will be assisted and supported in the changes they will have to make in order that the economy will not suffer and that the work will still be done.  Is that not the reality?  That is where we must get to.  I have no issue with these policies, but the problem is that when one tries to put renewable energy infrastructure in place in a rural community, there is absolute war.  Thousands of people object and there is hassle over it.  Therefore, a huge message must be sold.  It must be seen that there is a real economic benefit to the communities in which the infrastructure is placed.  They pay the price for the energy that is supplied from A to B as it does affect their quality of life.  These are the issues we must address in the bigger picture.</p></speech>

We did such work in 2014.  We found that if communities were involved and given a share of either the economics of a renewable energy project or the social benefits, they were much more open to the idea.  It is also a justice issue.  It is about not only procedural justice - it must be a fair and transparent system - but also distributive justice in the sense that people need to get something back.  It is a broader issue in the decarbonisation of the economy that it is not merely about taking out emissions but also about creating a new social vision of the kind of society in which we want to live.  There is a social aspect to it.  That is why when we consider renewable energy projects, we cannot forget that people must be brought along and that there must be community engagement.  I do not think we would make that mistake now, knowing as much as we do.  It would be nice to think that in assessing every technical challenge we can think of in terms of decarbonisation we would also think about the social aspects and how we could involve and engage communities.</p></speech>

It goes beyond getting people to accept change to having them involved from the get-go in co-designing solutions.  We have had these discussions at the NESC and DCU.  There is often the accusation of NIMBYism when people reject the idea as a case of "not in my back yard".  However, as we have discussed, it is often not NIMBYism but because they were not engaged with from the outset when they were merely presented with the final plan and asked to accept it.</p></speech>

We support the BusConnects project because nothing makes more sense than getting people to their place of work and home at twice the speed.  They are being consulted, but we need to strike a balance in terms of whether we remove trees or cars.  That is the question for some communities, or does one find alternative routes, travelling one way in the morning and a different way in the afternoon?  It is about finding imaginative solutions to the problem.</p></speech>

First, picking up on this discussion, this is one of the weaknesses or lost opportunities in the climate action plan.  The strength, picking up on what Dr. Moore stated earlier, is the Government's structure.  It is good at putting in place a robust reporting and accountability framework.  The plan is to be updated annually, and reported on quarterly.  There is an implementation board in the Department of the Taoiseach, and a beefed-up climate action council.  All of those are good in terms of the top-down piece but there is a missed opportunity in the report is in respect of the bottom-up infrastructure, and in other ways as well.  The Oireachtas committee report has a chapter on communications and education but that is almost a footnote in the climate action plan.  In various ways, the climate action plan replicates our traditional approaches to policymaking in Ireland, which is a shame.  However, it is a good start, and something to build on.</p> <p>   Second, I refer back to Deputy Coppinger's question, where we began, on free public transport.  It is a promising idea, either completely free or not completely free but certainly much cheaper than public transport is here in Ireland.  As Dr. O'Connell said, I was at the EPA conference as well where the mayor of Vienna talked about a cost of &euro;1 a day.   That is worth considering.  I am glad that the committee will discuss that in the future.</p> <p>  I would raise one note of caution, which picks up the point about justice and the urban-rural dimension to this.  Often, in climate policy debates, we hear complaints from rural communities saying it is all very well for us up in Dublin to raise the carbon tax because we have the choice of cycling, walking or taking public transport.  My fear with the proposal for free public transport is that it benefits certain parts of the country much more clearly than it benefits others.  That is not an argument for not doing it but it is an argument for taking seriously these questions around justice and how we manage those.</p></speech>

On the idea that it would only apply to certain cities, as I have heard that people react like that, one would decide that public transport would be free.  Either way, there has to be a considerable enhancement of public transport.</p> <p>  On the assertion that people have a choice of cycling, unfortunately, not everybody can cycle to work, for example, if someone lives 14 miles away and does not have the physical capacity or whatever.  It is not a question of choice.</p> <p>  The carbon tax that I am hearing about would be on someone's ESB bill  or on a bag of coal or logs.  It will apply.  It applies to everyone at present, both rural and urban.  The choices one makes do not necessarily free a person from it.</p></speech>

Some of us have seen good plans in the past.  We went into that in an enthusiastic way, for example, in a deliberative forum.  When the Dublin Transportation Initiative was rolled out in the early 1990s, both Deputy Eamon Ryan and I were on a consultative panel-----</p></speech>

There was consideration of where people lived and scenario testing, and we examined the worst-case scenario where we were to have higher densities in the city centre and linkages with public transport, and the investment was to be aligned with best case scenario.  Of course, that is not what happened and we are not trying to retrofit some of the mistakes of not designing things in the way that it was hoped.</p> <p>  Obviously, I am only looking at one location.  The witnesses are considering places such are Galway, that is choked with traffic, and what is being suggested as the solution.  They are considering Cork and Limerick because there is a dispersed population pattern in the more rural areas.  That is more difficult to deal with from a public transport perspective.</p> <p>  I am looking at the plans that have been provided and I want them to work.  We not only want them to work but need them to work.  I know the next generation.  I know their names.  I can see them.  Some of them are my grandchildren.  I am aware of the kind of fallout that they will have to pick up if we do not do our job today.</p> <p>  However, I have a significant sinking feeling about the Government's climate plan because I am looking at exactly what is being proposed from a transport perspective.  There is no proposal to review the national development plan.  A climate emergency was declared.  We do not dispute the science but there has not been a shift towards funding public transport over and above the roads projects, which are more heavily funded in the plan than public transport.</p> <p>  I have been going on about DART underground or the interconnector for 20 years.  I do not see how one can solve Dublin's transport problems without delivering on major projects such as DART underground, which was part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  European funding was delivered in different ways but there was a shift in the early 1990s towards having to make an argument as to why funding should be given.  It is interesting that the argument made to seek European funding was that Dublin, including the outer counties because there is a focus towards the city, had become uncompetitive because of traffic congestion.  We are now, as Deputy Coppinger pointed out, one of the slowest cities in Europe.</p> <p>  I am struggling to see the coherence in the Government's plan from a transport perspective.  If it is predominantly about building roads and shifting people from diesel and petrol cars into electric cars or hybrid cars, the State must produce the electricity to start with.  A programme was broadcast in recent weeks on Moneypoint where capacity and making that shift are major issues.  However, there is also a vision.  We will still have traffic jams unless public transport is put in place, but they will be cleaner traffic jams.  That is my feeling on how this will play out.  Unless there is investment in large public transport projects, we will not make the sizeable shift needed.  Until we address the issue of where people will live and where they work, we will be constantly trying to retrofit.</p> <p>  I would like this Government plan interrogated.  It is almost like hearing that the Opposition will always be critical.</p><p>There is good reason to be critical of this plan.  I want to see that criticism coming from non-political sources, and as heavily critical as it needs to be, because we have to make it work.  I do not see in this plan how we are going to achieve that shift, unless we take the dramatic step of putting our money where our mouth is.  Putting our money where our mouth is means putting money into public transport.  I do not see any other way of doing it.  There is a limit in terms of what can be achieved with electric vehicles, but there is no escaping the big step that is needed to get the attention necessary, which for me is the shift in how we fund public transport.</p></speech>

That is a choice we can make.  Page 2 of the recommendations states that the public sector should lead by example.  In that regard, the committee could write to all the State and semi-State bodies that report directly or indirectly to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport asking that they provide to it, by whatever date decided, their plans for change in regard to their transport activities.  On the point regarding local authorities, I believe that not only the local authorities but all bodies that receive taxpayers' money, including An Post, should be accountable in terms of their plans.  I think it would be constructive if the committee were to communicate in that regard with all the bodies concerned.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding some of the views expressed, DART expansion, MetroLink and BusConnects are important.  The strategic park and ride facilities are also important.  It is not correct to say that there is not already huge investment in public transport, which is very welcome.  I am happy to take everybody's point of view but as a committee we need to hold the Minister and the transport bodies accountable to us in order to get those policy shifts and changes.  Today's contributions are very helpful in that regard.</p> <p>  Returning to the farmers and the freight operators, this is where the push-back is going to come from because their costs will increase and it will not be as easy for these them to sell their product abroad because it will be more expensive.  We need to provide for a benefit to them, economically, from this change, either through supporting the physical transport infrastructure or through taxation measures.  Tax policy was mentioned.  It can be constructive to bring about change.  I would welcome the witnesses views on that point because I think that is a huge part of the argument.  Of the 20% of CO2 that comes from transport how does that breakdown between farming and so on?  Is it possible to breakdown that 20% in terms of the origin of the CO2 emissions?  Do the witnesses have a pie chart which we could look at that provides that information?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the people who will be most affected as being those people who are going to be most economically affected.  Is that not the truth of it?  Also, our economy will be affected if we do not get this right.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Torney to comment later on the numbers because he has been doing some work on transport.  Deputy Catherine Murphy's comment that the interrogation of the plan would be beyond the political system is interesting.  We would not be in a position personally to comment on the plan but NESC could be invited to interrogate it.  The officials in the Department who are working on the plan could come to NESC so that its members, which as I mentioned earlier includes a diverse range of organisations, could interrogate the plan.  The NESC should contribute to the conversation around interrogation of the plan with a view to commenting on it at a future point.</p></speech>

One of the aspects of the climate action plan that I think is very welcome is the chapter on the public sector leading by example.  Within that there is provision for all public bodies to have climate change mandates and reporting around that, which is very welcome as something we highlighted in our report.  There is a risk that that would turn into a green washing exercise.  Public sector bodies - I have none in particular in mind - could see this as box ticking exercise.  The way to counter this is parliamentary scrutiny.  The climate action committee is to be set up as a standing committee under the climate action plan.  Parliamentary accountability would be strengthened if other Oireachtas committees were to do likewise.  In other words, transport bodies would not only have to account to the climate action committee on the low carbon mandate but to the transport committee also.  There is an important role for this committee.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned the increased cost for freight.  There are huge cost savings that can be associated with many of the initiatives and solutions that we have put in place.  For example, mandatory eco-driving reduces fuel costs, as well as emissions, and has other co-benefits.  I welcome the inclusion of the freight sector.  We are all in this together.  Dr. Tara Shine referred to us as collaborative humans.  Let us stop talking about detached stakeholders.  We advocate a governance approach that would include these sectors in the decision making and in the solutions.</p> <p>  On Deputy Catherine Murphy's point regarding the funding of large projects and essential public transport investment, the parliamentary process in holding public sector bodies accountable could also seek to move us beyond short-term planning so that these one-off projects such as BusConnects or MetroLink are connected in the transport landscape rather than considered in isolation.  What emerged in our research from within the sector was that planning in transport was planning on the hoof.  We developed the Luas on two separate lines.  Why was that not connected?  The Luas will be rejigged again in order to facilitate the metro.  There is need for something that takes us beyond the short-term political cycles and this longer-term vision, which is part of the transformative change that Deputy Coppinger referred to that needs to be embedded in the system for sustained climate action and that it is a long-term focus for these big projects and that it is not just in isolation.</p></speech>

We know that the planning system tends to be centred on cars, but there are cities and places in the world where, essentially, the number of homes, jobs, services and amenities close to frequent high-quality transport services are maximised, where people live and work is planned for along with transport provision.  Clearly, the State can use the uplift in land value to invest in affordable housing and other schemes.  It is about thinking longer term on how one links transport and the urban fabric together.  That is an issue being worked on by colleagues who would be happy to provide further information to the committee.</p></speech>

The suggestion by the Chair is a good one and it can be seen internationally.  That will be our next step.

When that is completed we may revert to the committee.</p></speech>

We were the poster children for the touchy-feely bottom-up civil engagement NGO contributory approach being advocated by the witnesses.  It was brilliant because it educated us and we, in turn, educated the system.  It led to better debate and analysis and it really worked.  I agree 100% with the touchy-feely bottom-up engagement approach being advocated.</p> <p>  I was slightly disheartened by an approach previously taken.  In the late 1990s, we wrote and were involved in a very good platform for change plan.  It was very well done with good modelling, people and our best engineers.  I will always remember a presentation given to us as the advisory committee in the closing stages of that process.  I do not know whether Deputy Murphy remembers it.  Those presenting told us that, whatever we did, we should build the metro and the DART interconnector first, rather than widening the M50 or investing in roads.  They stated that was what we must do.  The committee decided that it would do so.  I kept telling my wife that Dublin was about to change and it was going to be a cycling city.  We went to Utrecht for weeks and came back with the required information.  Utrecht had been pursuing that approach for 25 years and knew what to do.  What did we do in Ireland?  We widened the M50 and put off the metro.  We have done nothing on cycling or buses for the past 15 or 20 years.</p> <p>  I did not give up.  I kept going, got into government and wrote a sustainable transport plan.  I thought we should make the Dublin Transportation Office model bigger and do it all over the country and set up the National Transport Authority, NTA.  What happened?  My party went out of government and the sustainable transport plan was thrown away.  Nothing has happened in respect of the models for what we needed to do over the past eight years.  The NTA was taken over by the National Roads Authority.  We have had a roads-based transport system for the past ten years under that structure.</p> <p>  I still did not give up hope.  The recent national planning framework says the same thing we have been saying for 30 years: that we must go back into the centre and the core.  I thought there may still be hope.  I still said to my wife when I got home at night that the situation was about to change and that we were going to move to sustainable transport.  What happened?  The national development plan abandoned sustainable transport.  It is all about roads, as is ever the case.  It states that 50% of new housing will be built outside existing urban areas.  How does one square that with the national planning framework?  This is being run by IBEC.  We have a big industrial base that knows how to make money out of roads.  Even if the roads do not make transport sense, they make economic sense because people are good at making money out of making roads.  I am sorry if that is a cynical attitude, but I am releasing 30 years of frustration.</p> <p>  Politics, which trumps everything, is part of the problem.  One may have all the bottom-up touchy-feely approach but it is top-down politics that counts.  According to the NTA household travel survey, some 75% of journeys - 80% nationwide - are by car, while public transport accounts for 5% of trips.  Politicians are not stupid.  Advertising agencies spend millions promising people that if we get another little bit of road, we will finally be free.  Politicians represent the 80% who travel by car and are very sensitive to their wishes, so we steer based on that false promise.</p> <p>  Another reason that we have not moved to a sustainable transport system is that doing so is difficult.  The bottom-up touchy-feely approach is needed because this involves reallocating space and it is difficult to do so when 75% of journeys are by car and one wants to reduce that rate.  This is about parking, trucks and winning back space for children, cyclists, elderly persons, blind persons or anyone else who is not involved in the big industrial roads-based system which aims to keep making money out of cars and, as such does not count.</p> <p>  Dr. Devaney is correct in her point on framing.  I saw Deputy Michael Healy-Rae with his flat cap on television last night.  I have great time for him, but he was saying that he is not sure about the proposals for sustainability and asking what about the poor people and farmers.  It is the same old framing.  What about the 200,000 people who commute for more than two hours a day, which is injurious to their health?  Some 80,000 of them have young children.  What about the children who do not see their parents?  What about the 80% of Irish children who do not get the recommended level of daily exercise because of the system we have created?  Will that ever be taken into account on a prime time show or in the framing of this debate?  It will not.</p> <p>  My hopes were raised by the climate action plan because it seemed that there was some urgency about it.  Officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport appeared before the committee, but their performance was excruciatingly poor.  They did not know what was their ambition for 2030.  Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland appeared before the committee and were asked - I will never forget it - for their solution to gridlock in Dublin.  The solution they published is to widen the N7 between Naas and Newbridge as well as the N6, the N3, the N2 and the N11.  That was their answer to the question of how to improve transport in Dublin.</p> <p>  There is some brilliant stuff in the climate action plan around governance and the action plans approach to beginning to work on this area.  Everything it contains in that respect is right.  However, the section delaying with transport is an utter disgrace.  Deputy Murphy is right that we need other people to start saying that.  I challenge anyone to point out where I am wrong.  The reliance on a McKinsey marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, is so early 2000s in terms of climate change policy that it is embarrassing.  The promise of a cycling office is so 1990s.  We have heard that promise so often that I am tired of it.  The promise of a scrappage scheme that has not even been worked out sounds like it comes from Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  It is ill thought-out and inappropriate.  The doubling of the number of electric vehicles on the back of a McKinsey MACC curve is not good enough, given that we spent two years at this.  The Department should be ashamed if that is the best it can come up with.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Connell stated that he advises the Taoiseach.  However, he also occupies a national position and he is looked to for leadership on strategic public policy.  I want Dr. O'Connell, like Dr. Devaney earlier, to call out correctly the failings in this report, haul in those agencies and say: "You're not thinking strategically, lads, you've got to change."  It is usually lads.  If this is an iterative process, which is good in governance terms, the first iteration is that we throw out the transport section.  Can we agree on that?  We can then start with proper thinking about how we promote walking and cycling.  We should start with those two.  That is a difficult political thing to do.  It has to be top-down as well as bottom-up.  Transport requires a top-down approach.  We will not get a switch completely, which we should do, towards a car-sharing system if we do not get a direction from the centre saying, "That's what we're going to do."  It needs to be in 2022 and not in 2025 that all those car-parking spaces will be for car sharing.  We will not need 1 million new electric cars; with 200,000 or 300,000 we could do the job the 1 million were supposed to be doing.  I accept that Volkswagen would lose a few bob but so be it, the country would gain.  Can we start being strategic?  Can NESC start by showing some leadership in that by being honest about the failing in the transport section of the plan?</p></speech>

I want to pick up on, not the detail but the broad thrust of his intervention.  Our report is very strong on the need for not just bottom-up governance but also top-down direction from central government.  As a result of the fact that such bottom-up collaborative governance is lacking in many cases, we have been drawn to that in our discussion.  However, our report indicates that we see both as crucial parts of the governance jigsaw, both the bottom-up experimentation, learning and collaborative governance, and also the top-down direction from central government.  The Deputy is right to point that out.  Our report endorses that.</p></speech>

A number of committee meetings are taking place in parallel.  If people are coming and going from this meeting, our guests should not take it personally.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of this business.</p><p>I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as their use causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  We are keen to make sure the transcripts from these meetings are wholly accurate.</p><p>Our first session today will deal with the implications for the Irish economy of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I am delighted to welcome from the Central Bank of Ireland Dr. Mark Cassidy, director of economics and statistics, Ms Gina Fitgerald, head of the financial risks and governance division, and their colleagues.</p><p>The Seanad special committee engaged with the Central Bank two years ago when we drafted our initial report.  All things being equal, the committee would have disbanded some time ago.  However, that has not come to pass.  Despite the fact that Brexit has not happened yet, there is much we still have to discuss and much has occurred which has impacted on the economy, the banking system and much else.  Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, described Ireland as being uniquely vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit, so we are particularly interested in hearing the Central Bank&rsquo;s analysis.  </p><p>Before we begin, I remind everyone of the rules on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>With all that covered, I ask Mr. Cassidy to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today.  I am joined by Gina Fitzgerald, head of the financial risks and governance division in the Central Bank.  I will briefly set out the work undertaken in the Central Bank on Brexit as well as potential implications for the financial system and, in particular, the wider economy.<br/><br/>The Central Bank has been focused on Brexit risks since before the 2016 UK referendum.  Following the referendum, a Brexit task force was established on a permanent basis.  It meets and reports quarterly to the financial stability committee and the Central Bank Commission regarding Brexit-related political, economic and financial market developments, risks arising for firms supervised by the Central Bank and issues arising for the Central Bank, in particular with respect to authorisations.  In September 2018, the Central Bank established a Brexit steering committee to oversee the further stages of the Central Bank&rsquo;s preparations for the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union focusing on cliff-edge risks and the adoption of mitigating actions where possible and appropriate.<br/><br/>The Central Bank&rsquo;s work has focused, <i>inter alia, </i>on ensuring that, first, the risks to the Irish economy are understood; second, financial stability and consumer protection risks are identified and mitigated to the greatest extent possible, particularly regarding the cliff-edge risks associated with a hard or no-deal Brexit; third, regulated firms deliver on their responsibilities of appropriately preparing their businesses for these risks; and, fourth, we deliver our gatekeeper role in a robust, transparent and efficient way, consistent with our aspiration to operate to and influence European norms of supervision and, overall, ensure that Irish and European financial stability, investor protection and consumer protection risks are mitigated.</p><p>We have taken a transparent approach to this work, recognising its importance and the interest in it.  We publish all the reports of our Brexit task force and answers to frequently asked questions.  We have held several Brexit-related stakeholder round tables and published numerous reports and speeches.</p><p> I will now discuss our assessment of potential implications of Brexit for the Irish economy.  The Central Bank's central forecast is that underlying economic activity is set to continue to grow at a relatively solid pace in 2019 and 2020, though some moderation in growth is in prospect, reflecting both the impact of a less favourable and more uncertain international environment and also the limits imposed by domestic capacity constraints and tightening labour market conditions.  If a disorderly no-deal Brexit scenario can be avoided, the outlook for the economy over the next two years remains broadly favourable.  Economic growth is set to be supported by a still solid pace of expansion in domestic economic activity, underpinned by continued growth in employment and real incomes, the ongoing recovery of the construction sector and growth in domestic Government spending.</p><p> As is now well understood, any type of Brexit would be negative for Ireland, with a disorderly, no-deal Brexit especially so.  In previous analysis the bank has published work examining the potential medium-term impact on the Irish economy of an orderly World Trade Organization, WTO, no-deal scenario, a free trade area-like agreement such as the withdrawal agreement, and, most recently, a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.  Even if a deal can be agreed, there will be additional trade frictions, which will have disruptive effects for businesses and consumers, and for the agriculture and food sectors in particular.  However, the effects would be relatively contained and spread over the medium term.</p><p> A disorderly, no-deal scenario would, on the other hand, have very severe and immediate disruptive effects, with consequences for almost all areas of economic activity.  Compared with a scenario where the UK remained an EU member, our estimates suggest that a disorderly Brexit would result in a substantial and permanent loss of output.  The disruption and related decline in economic activity would be front-loaded and would give rise to a significantly more adverse outlook for the Irish economy in the first few years.  Certain sectors and regions would be disproportionately affected, especially those which are more reliant on trade with the UK or which are more vulnerable to the imposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers, particularly sectors such as agriculture, food and smaller scale manufacturing and rural regions and those near the Border.</p><p> Brexit is not the only risk to the economic outlook.  On the external side, there continue to be other downside risks facing the economy.  Given the position of Ireland as a small, highly open economy and the important role of multinational firms within the economy, the evolution of global economic and trading conditions, taxation regimes and movements in major exchange rates will have an important bearing on economic performance.  On the domestic side, while overall price inflation remains very subdued, wage growth has continued to pick up against a background where the remaining slack in the labour market is diminishing and there is a need to continue to guard against the risk that strong cyclical conditions give rise to overheating dynamics.</p><p> I will now briefly discuss the implications of Brexit for the financial system.  On the basis of the specific Brexit work that we and others have undertaken and, crucially, the work of the last decade to drive a significantly more resilient financial system, the immediate cliff-edge financial stability risks of a no-deal Brexit are considered to be broadly manageable, albeit this eventuality would be challenging for all firms operating in Ireland.  There are some remaining risks of consumer detriment.  The Irish and UK financial systems are closely connected, with UK firms and firms from Gibraltar providing financial services to Irish consumers.  The Central Bank has worked closely with the European and UK authorities to seek to ensure that those firms wishing to continue to provide services to Irish consumers are able to continue to do so in the event of a hard Brexit.  The majority of UK based firms have taken appropriate action, but not all have to date.  In this context, I am pleased to note that the Central Bank has worked with the Department of Finance to support the drafting of legislation to protect insurance customers in the event of no-deal Brexit, through the creation of a temporary run-off regime.</p><p> The nature, scale and complexity of the Irish financial system are changing as a result of Brexit.  New authorisations and expansions of existing operations are increasing the size of many sectors.  Our gatekeeping role is hugely important in mitigating financial stability risks and protecting market integrity and customers in Ireland and across Europe.  It is imperative that any new business authorised here as a result of Brexit meets the high standards that are expected of any such firm authorised in the EU.  We also continue to be active internationally to ensure that the risk of divergence between EU jurisdictions in how they handle relocations from the UK is mitigated.  In order to address the concern of regulatory divergences and the risk of regulatory arbitrage between EU member states, we have long been engaging closely with the European Central Bank, across the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and the European supervisory authorities to agree Europe-wide approaches to the key policy and supervisory issues, stances and decisions that have arisen from Brexit.</p><p> Following the UK's departure from the EU, there will be a loss of experience and expertise when UK regulators are no longer sitting at the table.  The UK's departure will require increased engagement on our part in the relevant EU and international fora.  We have consistently and successfully been making a substantial effort in this regard since the crisis.  We will continue to prioritise our work in this area.  London is a truly global financial services centre operating within the EU and serving a very material amount of its financial services needs.  Undoubtedly, the role of London and its interconnections with the EU will change post Brexit.  It is critically important for the EU economy and all its citizens that it continues to have a financial services system that delivers within the EU, but also has deep global connectivity beyond it, including with London.  We are now happy to take any of the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I am very interested in Dr. Cassidy's report.  He spoke about growth in the economy, employment and real incomes but one of my great concerns is our dependence on the big software companies here.  We have reached a point where these companies have to source accommodation for people they bring in from abroad and they have to compete with Irish salaries.  Having spoken to some of the senior people in some of these companies I feel there is a real risk now that they will look elsewhere for cheaper accommodation and labour costs.  Our labour costs compete internally rather than internationally.  Dare I say there is some suggestion we are back in the bad old 1995-2000 days as companies have to bid for professionals.  One senior executive told me that it would not take a whole lot to have the company move.  Has the Central Bank considered that threat and its likely implications for the economy?</p> <p>  The Border has been a hobbyhorse of mine since the day after the referendum.  Dr. Cassidy referred to the agrisector which I have always seen as part of our core economy.  I cannot see how we can have an open Border.</p><p>I have never been able to see it.  Nobody has ever explained to me how one can have an open border with a third country, in particular if there is a hard crash-out.  I made the point previously that all we need is one carcass of beef to finish up in Berlin or Paris that is not true Irish beef or that has angel dust or something similar in it and our entire market in Europe, which accounts for approximately 60% of our beef market, would collapse.  That is a serious concern.</p><p> Have the witnesses war-gamed the implications of the border issue?  In my view, the suggestion that we will have checks at ports and use Dublin, Cork or Rosslare ports as points for checking customs places Ireland outside the European Union.  If there are to be checks anywhere, they should be on the Border.</p><p> I am aware that some European companies that manufacture in Ireland and source component parts and raw materials through the UK are now being actively encouraged to look to suppliers in Europe.  Have we looked at the manufacturing cost implications because it will all come down to costs in a post-Brexit world?  Have we looked at the cost implications of shifting our purchasing to mainland Europe?</p><p> There has been talk of replacing the landbridge.  I am now convinced that the landbridge notion will not work.  Somebody suggested to me that the British might lay on one carriageway to Dover for Irish trucks and likewise for the return journey, but I cannot see that happening.  There will be costs attached to using the seabridge option.  For example, the journey by sea will be 36 hours rather than 18 hours.  Has the Central Bank or any other body looked at the statistics on the time it will take to clear trucks?  We are talking about tailbacks of 9 km in places.  I would like to hear the statistics on that.</p><p> In fairness, the Government has put on a number of Brexit preparedness roadshows for SMEs.  I was horrified and shocked to see at one of those meetings when companies were asked for a show of hands on who had a Brexit officer in place that only two hands went up in a packed room.  Do the witnesses have any statistics on the position now?  Have companies at last begun to realise that Brexit may very well come down the line?</p><p> In the context of inter-country partnerships within the EU, it is clear that our strongest ally is leaving so we may have to subdivide the European Union, as it were, and pick different partners for different topics.  We might go to the Germans for finance and the French for agriculture and then pick some of the smaller countries to get a critical mass.  Have the witnesses analysed which countries are most suited to which specific topics?  I hope that is not too far outside their remit.  I thank Mr. Cassidy, Ms Fitzgerald and their colleagues for their time.</p></speech>

The situation is comparable with the shock experienced in 2008 and 2009.  The witnesses might be frank about the loss of output they expect in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the number of job losses, the quantum of business closures they might expect and where those businesses are located and in what sectors.  While we know that, it is important for the witnesses to be clear on it.  In real terms, what are we facing as an economy and society in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  The reality is that whether we like it or not, given the political climate in Britain at the moment, we could very well be staring down the barrel of that no-deal exit gun.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#C00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from the Central Bank.  I have some brief questions to flesh out what was said in the opening statement.  I accept that the first issue I raise is not in our remit but it is related as it will affect us.  To what extent has the Central Bank looked at the British economy post Brexit?  Sterling is a stand-alone currency and while Britain is not in the eurozone, it is in the EU.  Presuming that Britain does leave the EU and given that we will have sterling currency on the island, has the Central Bank looked at how that situation could and would affect us further down the line?  It might not have been part of any of the stress tests carried out to date.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear about contact and research carried out by the Central Bank with consumers in the financial services sectors.  How much previously proposed development in the economy has been parked with a view to allowing the prospective investors or developers to wait and see what will happen?  We have economic growth at the moment and, leaving Brexit to one side, the Central Bank predicts continued economic growth.  Do the witnesses have a sense that substantial development and investment that may well have occurred in recent years has been postponed because prospective developers or investors are sitting on their hands and playing a wait-and-see game?  If the Brexit issue is resolved in a way that is reasonably in our favour, could a mini-Celtic tiger emerge as people who have been waiting to see what happens decide not to sit on their hands any longer?</p> <p>  It seems to be all negative in the context of Brexit, but are there any positives?  To be honest, there was not much positivity in the opening statement.  I cannot fault Dr. Cassidy on that.  He has to call it as it is and much of it is speculative.  Has he experienced any positive spin-offs to date that might not have happened if Brexit was not an issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#C00400"><p>I apologise to the Chairman and the witnesses as I was involved in a debate on a Bill in the Seanad Chamber.  I read over the opening statement and there is an understandable frankness in terms of the severity of the impact of Brexit, whether there is a deal or otherwise.  While I agree with the assertion that any type of Brexit is negative for us in Ireland, do the witnesses have a view on the importance and significance of the backstop in the context of the Central Bank&rsquo;s remit and work?  I ask the witnesses to refer to that.  I do not have any further questions <i>per se</i>at this stage, I ask others on the back of the responses.  The lack of comment on the significance of the backstop in terms of the Central Bank&rsquo;s remit and work and the businesses that will be impacted as a result of Brexit was probably an unintentional omission from the remarks that I have seen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#C00500"><p>I, too, have some questions, most of which arise on the back of points raised by Senators Nash, Craughwell and Paul Daly.  I would welcome more detail and exact figures on the prospective growth rates, both in a deal and a crash-out scenario.  We are only facing those two prospects or the possibility of a referendum, but we will not go into that.</p> <p>  On the growth rate, there have been two other forecasts that have covered the period since the referendum based on the number of new banking licences that have been issued since the referendum.  Overall, could the witnesses quantify the amount of increased activity in financial services in Ireland in that period?  Is there a projection for how much that could possibly increase in both the deal and no-deal scenarios?  Dr. Cassidy alluded to it in his opening remarks.</p> <p>  Other speakers referred to preparedness.  How best can we manage the cliff-edge scenario?  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile correctly said - I have also made this point in every possible intervention over the past three years - there is no such thing as a good Brexit, but the cliff-edge crash-out scenario is extremely worrying.  What increased measures can be taken to manage it by Government actors but also economic, business and civic society actors.  As Senator Craughwell correctly pointed out, it is very hard to appoint a Brexit officer if one is also CEO, head of sales, head of cleaning or managing director of a business that employs two and a half people and one is working flat out around the clock.</p> <p>  My final question is a bit more specific.  Dr. Cassidy addressed it directly as he was concluding.  London is not going anywhere.  Even if it is a crash-out scenario and the British economy declines significantly, London will still be one of the world&rsquo;s major financial centres and it will still be extremely important for Ireland and our financial services sector that we maintain a complementary relationship with the city.</p><p>It is, first, a question of how we can maintain that engagement and, second, what we have done so far to maintain it.  I am aware that quite a bit of work has been done.  I have met more people from the City of London and various representative groups in the past three years than I ever thought I would have to.  Senator Craughwell touched on the issue of developing alliances.  I appreciate that within the European context, in a deal or a no-deal scenario, the priorities of the Irish economy, particularly of the financial services sector, might differ from those of colleagues in the EU 27.  It is a question of how best we can position ourselves within the British economy but also within the EU 27 in order that we maintain access to the City of London and build on what has, to date, been a very strong and positive relationship for both the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p></speech>

As I was attending another meeting, I apologise if I raise something that was painstakingly dealt with.  However, it is important that people receive very clear answers, even twice to the same questions, as they are very anxious about this issue.  I come from County Cavan where it is particularly serious and already depressing the local economy, given the expectations and fears about it.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan not only is it depressing the economy, it is also halting potential expansion because people are unsure about where they will go.  There is a litany of problems and dangerous results, apart from the brief of the Central Bank of Ireland and the focus on macro issues surrounding the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.  While the fallout is within the brief of the Central Bank, strictly the actual mechanics are not.  Therefore, we will stick as near as we can to financial matters.  That is to set the context for my questions.</p> <p>  Assuming there will be a hard Brexit, is there any merit in looking at the Central Bank's overall lending guidelines as a stimulus to the economy of the Border region and the wider economy?  Is there potential for a change in lending policy and almost a Keynesian solution to inject money into the economy?  Has the Central Bank given that matter any thought?</p> <p>  Teagasc has carried out research in this area.  Has the Central Bank quantified the implications for agriculture and the agrifood industry?  This relates to my previous question about lending rules and so on.  Has the Central Bank thought about potential solutions in that regard?  While there has been an increase in property prices in the Border region in which I live, I sense it is being halted or slowed because of the level of apprehension.  Has the Central Bank thought about the implications for property prices and does it foresee a fall in them post Brexit?  Is there any cause for alarm in that regard?  Do the delegates want to venture a solution or engage in commentary on this issue which is not an easy one?</p> <p>  I am interested in the question of financial services.  Will the delegates quantify for us the degree to which financial services are migrating here because of the potential for a breakaway by the United Kingdom and a hard Brexit?  Are we gaining anything?  If so, is there joy for my region?  Without being ridiculously parochial, do the delegates see any potential for the location of new financial services in the region?  How does the Central Bank see the currency question developing as we try to navigate our way through what might be a hard Brexit, although we would like the Border to be seamless?</p> <p>  I have mentioned agriculture.  I do not want to be alarmist; I am simply reflecting points raised at all of the meetings I have attended with local sectoral groupings.  There is gloom, apprehension and fear, particularly in the Border region, although I accept that it is a national issue, as reflected in all of the contributions made.  Are there potential opportunities for the Border region?  Is there anything I could say to my neighbours when they ask me what I did today for the great taxpayers of the country?  Could I say I was at a meeting with the Central Bank and that it told me that there would be potential in a post-Brexit scenario or that, sadly, they told me that there would not be any?  I am interested in the answer to that question.  Please God, at the end of the day, none of this will apply, but we cannot afford not to be ready.</p></speech>

I welcome Senator Craughwell.  I believe the sitting of the Seanad has been suspended for a stint.  Without further ado, I invite Dr. Cassidy and his colleagues to address some of the questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#D00400"><p>Every question is extremely important and relevant.  I will group them and provide the baseline by providing what the Chairman asked for in our overall macro estimates if the no-deal scenario materialises.  I will then move on to some of the questions about particular regions, sectors and issues such as, for example, the land bridge and how it might impact in different parts of the economy.  There were questions about the property market and how the Central Bank's rules might play a role in that regard.  There was a question about what might happen if a deal was agreed, as well as the potential opportunities and risks for the multinational sector in the tightening economy in such a scenario.  I will pass on to Ms Fitzgerald some of the questions about the financial system, including some of the ones about our political influence.  We can only speak about our influence at European fora, but Ms Fitzgerald will also discuss issues related to new firms in the financial sector coming here.  If there are issues that have been overlooked, I will try to address them.</p> <p>  I will give more detail of what we think might happen in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  We distinguish between scenarios in which some deal can be agreed to.  In that case, of course, there will be a transition period until the end of 2020.  There will be no material, immediate negative effect on the economy and there will be much more time for the economy to adjust.  The effects are material but probably manageable and spread in the medium term.  If a deal can be agreed to, similar to the withdrawal agreement, we would still expect strong economic growth in the short term, as per our central forecast.  On the negative impact, compared to a situation where there had been no Brexit, in the medium term we would expect output to be around 1.75% less.  There would be just under 20,000 fewer jobs.  It is important to emphasise that this is in the context of positive growth elsewhere in the economy.  Therefore, we would still expect the economy to grow in the medium term.</p> <p>  Most importantly, we think the effects would be materially worse in the event that there was no deal.  They would be front-loaded in the sense that we would see most of the negative effects immediately.</p><p>The reason is that one would have a very sharp immediate downturn in the UK economy, as scenarios produced by the Bank of England show.  In addition, one would have tariffs on Irish exports and imports imposed from day one and those tariffs would be extremely high, in particular, for the food and agriculture sectors.  One would also have immediate disruptions, whether regulatory checks or increased documentary compliance, and all the forms of additional bureaucracy and delays in moving goods into and out of the country.  These would have material effects.</p><p> A couple of questions were asked about the economy's preparedness.  Evidence shows that the fact that the economy is not yet fully prepared, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises but also elements of the trading infrastructure, means that the most negative effects from what are known as non-tariff barriers tend to be felt immediately.  Over time, the economy and businesses become better able to adjust to these new procedures but the immediate impact can be disruptive.  The disorderly no-deal scenario could knock four percentage points of economic growth in the first year alone.  To put that in context, we expect economic growth of approximately 4.25% this year and slightly more than 3.5% next year.  We would still expect some modest positive growth in respect of a no-deal scenario but essentially it would knock off almost all growth in the first couple of years.  The effect over the medium term would be that output would be a little over 6% lower in a no-deal Brexit scenario and there would be approximately 110,000 fewer jobs compared with a scenario in which Brexit did not take place.  The effects are immediate.</p></speech>

It is on a net basis.  It is important to stress that we still see positive growth for the economy under all scenarios, but significantly weaker economic growth and significantly fewer jobs in a no-deal Brexit than if there was no Brexit, which is the ideal scenario, or if a deal was agreed.</p> <p>  An important factor relates to how those negative effects are distributed.  The agrifood and agriculture sectors, the regions that export most to the UK and the regions with a high degree of concentration in exporting agricultural products would be most affected.  From a regional perspective, the Border, midland and western region would be most affected.  The broad agrifood sector employs approximately 170,000 persons, of whom roughly 100,000 are employed in direct agriculture.  The remainder are in food processing and the like.  The sector accounts for between 7% and 8% of overall employment in the economy but up to 20% of employment in some Border regions.  There are significant numbers of people employed in agrifood sectors, from which probably half of exports go to the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  There are a number of reasons agrifood is most impacted.  First, as mentioned, 42% of exports from the sector go to the UK compared with 11% for the economy as a whole.  Second, tariffs are applied differently across sectors and far and way the highest tariff rates are imposed on agricultural products.  Tariff rates on agricultural products could be up to 50% or 60% for some elements of the dairy and beef producing sectors.  In addition, there are non-tariff barriers.  If one thinks of the nature of agricultural exports, often they are fresh foods that need to get to market quickly.  Additional delays, documentary compliance, etc., create particular burdens for these sectors.  Finally, parts of the agricultural sector are not particularly viable at present.  The degree of profitability and margins being earned are low in parts of the agricultural sector, particularly beef, which indicates that these are less resilient to the type of shock that Brexit might give rise to.</p> <p>  One question referred to the landbridge case.  We have estimates quantifying the impact that this could have.  We published a paper on these non-tariff barriers, which showed that in the case of a no-deal Brexit the average increase in the transport journey could be five hours.  We have estimates that regardless of all the other effects, these barriers alone could reduce Irish-UK trade by just under 10%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#E00500"><p>It is five hours overall.  Approximately two thirds of Irish exports to non-EU countries use the landbridge.  It is, therefore, an extremely important issue in terms of these additional costs.</p> <p>  The Border region is clearly most affected.  The issue of the backstop came up and I am happy to take any additional questions on that.  For me, the backstop is much more important from a political perspective than from an economic perspective.  The Republic of Ireland's trade with Northern Ireland is important.  Maybe 1.5% of our overall exports go to Northern Ireland and the proportion of our imports that from Northern Ireland is probably similar.  The less disruptive the Border controls, the less will be the effects on North-South  trade.  The types of arrangements that materialise will be important but the political dimension of the backstop in the context of the Good Friday Agreement dwarfs the economic effects.  As I highlighted, however, the economic effects are also important.</p> <p>  The currency issue came up in a couple of questions and it is very important.  Sterling is now approximately 16% weaker than it was just before the referendum.  This has created a much more difficult situation for exporters in terms of competitiveness of exporting into the UK market.  Irish exports to the UK have held up quite well since the referendum.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the risk of significant further weakening of sterling arises.  Added to what has already occurred, this could create a very difficult situation for Irish exporters, particularly in agrifood sectors.  We do not forecast what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit but it is quite clear that in such an event there would be further weakening of sterling, whereas if a deal could be agreed, the markets would probably be pleasantly surprised and there would probably be some strengthening of sterling against the euro.  The outcome very much depends on what Brexit scenario materialises.</p> <p>  We have already seen a slowing in the property market.  To back up what Senator Joe O'Reilly is seeing, we have seen strong increases in property prices in recent years.  The rate of increase has slowed.  That is an economy-wide phenomenon which reflects the fact that more supply is coming on stream and, probably, the Central Bank's measures and also that affordability pressures generally become more acute as prices rise.  In terms of the outlook for property prices, Brexit may have some minor effects.  If there is an economic slowdown overall, that could have a negative effect on property prices through its impact on demand.  On the other hand, the increase in demand for accommodation from workers in new financial services may put some upward pressure on housing in Dublin.  Overall, I believe the evolution or path of house prices will be most affected by more supply coming on stream in the coming years.  We expect to see this increase in supply continue.</p> <p>  The Central Bank reviews its mortgage rules every year.  Our latest review was in November last and its main finding was that these rules are critically important for financial stability reasons in order to protect borrowers and lenders from excessive lending, over-indebtedness and the types of problems that emerged during the early 2000s.  If one has a limited supply of housing and the response is to provide more and more credit, the credit starts chasing up prices.  It does not create more houses as the availability of houses does not increase.  The mortgage rules are, therefore, are an important check in the market to prevent a return to the past.  However, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have provided our recommendations on appropriate budgetary policy, fiscal policy and so on.  Certainly, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, one would see some room for discretionary spending, for example, towards most affected targeted areas.  Maybe that is the most appropriate, direct and transparent way of dealing with that type of issue.</p> <p>  I will make one final point before Ms Fitzgerald responds.  I could not agree more with Senator O'Reilly's comment that we hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided.  There is a great deal of uncertainty.  A question was asked about uncertainty and companies holding off on investment decisions.  We believe that is the case and there is considerable uncertainty, particularly among small and medium-size enterprises.</p><p>It is probably not worth their while to make long-term investment decisions until they know exactly what form of Brexit materialises.  Likewise, in terms of preparedness, it is easy to say that SMEs should be prepared for all eventualities, but it is costly for those with lower profits to prepare for an eventuality that may not materialise.  The degree of preparedness among small enterprises undoubtedly is not complete.  There has been a holding off on investment.  If a favourable deal were to go ahead before 31 October, there may be some economic bounce as a result.</p></speech>

I will also address the issue relating to multinationals in that context as the concerns in regard to that sector are related to the upside scenario.  In the event that a deal can be agreed, the outlook for the economy remains strong.  The economy is approaching full employment.  The latest quarterly unemployment figures, which I prefer to the monthly ones, point to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Some of that data point to a unemployment rate of 4.5%.  As the economy gets closer to full employment, there is a risk of overheating pressures, which manifest in wages and prices increasing at too fast a rate and cause competitiveness problems and difficulties for firms in terms of hiring additional workers.  We are seeing an increase in vacancy rates, particularly among multinational firms.  Our primary concern in that regard is the risk of overheating.  We do not see it currently in the economy.  Earlier, a comparison was made between now and 2006-07.  We have very different economic circumstances now.  The economy is much better shape now than it was then.  Economic growth is not now being fuelled by domestic credit expansion or by inflows of money from abroad.  We do not have an over-inflated construction sector, property sector or banking sector, such as we did in 2006-07.  Nevertheless, overheating remains a concern that we will constantly monitor.  The best indicator is wages.  Currently, wages are increasing at approximately 3% per annum, which we think is a welcome rate of increase.  We will keep an eye to the wage rate increase to ensure it does not begin to increase too fast because in that scenario multinational and Irish-owned firms would find it much more difficult to attract labour.</p> <p>  There are probably one or two questions in respect of which I will need to come back in later.  Ms Fitzgerald will comment now on the financial system issues.</p></speech>

There have been in excess of 100 authorisations in regard to Brexit thus far and a significant pipeline of applications is under consideration.  They range from the big banks and insurance companies whose names are in the public domain to smaller investment firms and payment firms.  There is quite an array from small one or two person shops and bigger operations.  From an authorisation perspective, the Central Bank has varying degrees of activity and engagement with those firms, depending on the level of risk they would bring into the system.  Some of those applications will be turned around in a matter of days and for others there would be much more substantive processes in respect of understanding the business models and the type of presence that we would need to be comfortable with them.</p> <p>  With regard to the changing financial landscape, it is probably well documented at this stage that on the banking side we are moving from a more traditional retail banking focus to wholesale banking activity, such as the investment banks.  There are a few new firm types coming in the investment management sphere and asset management, which is a different type of market in that it is more about infrastructure.  On insurance, there has been some increase in terms of speciality type insurance around marine and aviation, which are risks that we would not necessarily have seen previously in the sectors.  </p> <p>  On building alliances, I will speak specifically to the financial sector because that is the area on which we are focused at European level.  Building alliances is very much dependent on an issue-by-issue and sector-by-sector basis.  In some sectors, we are an exporter of financial services from Ireland into the EU and, therefore, we have natural alliances with other EU member states in that regard.  On banking, at a political level, we have signed up to various letters in terms of the Hanseatic League.  We would be of that persuasion at a political level on banking and also very much a host member state on issues in banking in how we look at prudential waivers and so on.  </p> <p>  In terms of the UK and continued engagement with it, as stated by the Chairman, we are very much determined to keep those strong relationships.  We have strong relationships at working group level in the Central Bank and in Europe and very much at senior level.  We have ongoing engagement with the UK authorities throughout this process, which has been constructive.  We intend to continue that engagement.</p></speech>

A matter of frequent debate in my home is the couple paying rent of, say, &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600 per month for a two-bedroom apartment, which they could buy with a 100% mortgage and service with &euro;1,200 per month payments, leaving them with &euro;300 per month in their pockets.  Why are 100% mortgages not considered in cases where the mortgage repayment would be lower per month that the rental payment?  I cite the example of a particular couple who have paid &euro;97,000 in rent over the past seven years and who could have financed the property they are living in quite easily with that amount.  I have been told that a return to 100% mortgages would be lunacy but I ask Dr. Cassidy to comment briefly on the matter.</p></speech>

The deposit requirement is 10% for first-time buyers.  It is important to highlight that because some people think it is 20%.  There is strong evidence regarding the risk of default and how that is dependent on the deposit requirement.  The Central Bank has published a lot of analytical evidence on this, which shows that when the loan to value is above 85%, the risk of those borrowers getting into hot water increases substantially.  It means any reduction in house prices or any economic shock to incomes can significantly impact on the ability of that borrower to repay.  We introduce risk to take account of the different situations.  The deposit requirement, therefore, is 10% for the first-time buyer in comparison with 20% more generally.  We do have strong financial stability reasons for the deposit requirements.  The 100% mortgages of a decade ago were a bad idea  in hindsight.  They certainly contributed to the crisis.</p> <p>  On the question regarding the positives and the opportunities as a result of Brexit, which I did not get to earlier, I gave some figures earlier, which incorporated one of the positives that nets off some of the disadvantages, namely, the potential for more inward foreign direct investment, either by firms that are currently based in the UK and wish to sell into the European market and will not be able to do so from the UK market or new firms wanting to sell in, which otherwise would have gone to the UK.  Ms Fitzgerald discussed financial services, which I have less in mind in this regard.  We have a thriving financial services sector, mostly located in Dublin.  I am thinking more about direct investment that could be spread more regionally across the economy.</p><p>The ESRI estimates that Brexit could result in a positive medium-term impact of approximately 3% which is already incorporated in our numbers.  As there will be that positive foreign direct investment, FDI, effect if there is a deal or not, I do not know of any economic benefit that will result from a no-deal Brexit.  I see no other opportunities.</p><p> I did not address the prospects for the UK economy; rather, I discussed the exchange rate.  The general outlook for the UK economy, in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, is very negative.  Bank of England estimates suggest output could be approximately 10% less.  We are already seeing investment, exports and output in the United Kingdom being significantly affected.</p><p> If there is anything I overlooked or missed, I will be happy to come back in.</p></speech>

IBEC is the country's largest business organisation.  In recent years we have been working intensively to support our member companies as they manage the ongoing uncertainty and plan for potential Brexit disruption.  In many respects, the headline concerns of business, unfortunately, remain unchanged since we last addressed the joint committee two years ago.  Political developments have, however, crystallised the immediate risks.  The failure of the UK Government to ratify the withdrawal agreement has left business with the complex task and enormous cost of managing the uncertainty of moving Brexit deadlines.  Millions of euro have been spent in putting in place and, in many cases, activating costly contingency plans.</p> <p>  The divisive and ongoing polarisation of the UK political debate has increased the likelihood of a no-deal outcome, further driving up the cost of contingency planning.  Irish business supports the terms of the withdrawal agreement which comprehensively addresses the key challenges that arise in the exit process and the transition period associated with the agreement.  From the perspective of business, customs and regulatory alignment across the island of Ireland is vital to avoid the return of a hard border, safeguard the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday agreement.  </p> <p>  In recent months IBEC's work to support contingency planning has intensified.  We have produced comprehensive guidance for business and hosted numerous events, providing a detailed expert insight into the complex issues that will need to be managed in such a scenario.  While our members are very aware of the risks and planning accordingly, it would be wrong to suggest business, or the wider economy for that matter, could ever be ready for the profound overnight changes a no-deal Brexit at the end of October would involve.  Despite the best efforts of business, successfully adjusting to a radically new trading environment with the United Kingdom is neither possible nor realistic, particularly for companies in the most exposed sectors in a no-deal scenario as there are too many variables and unknowns.  What we do know is that the imposition of very high World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs on certain goods, combined with additional customs and regulatory barriers, would cause major trade disruption.  There is also the risk of increased illicit trade and smuggling across a range of products in a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  Even in a worst case no-deal scenario we will need phased implementation of a new trading relationship and a compliance trajectory that will minimise disruption.</p><p>The political brinksmanship involved in setting non-credible deadlines has already cost the business community.  Additional collateral damage must be avoided.</p><p> The European Commission's claim that contingency planning is complete does not reflect the complex challenges on the ground.  In that context, further measures are urgently needed such as moratoria to facilitate data exchange and flows, the roll-over of current product labelling regimes and measures in other areas where it is simply impossible for business to change overnight.  While most larger companies have comprehensive plans in place, many SMEs are ill-prepared.  Despite major information campaigns, about 46,000 small companies of the 84,000 that trade with the United Kingdom have yet to register for the economic operator and registration identification, EORI, number that will be necessary to continue to trade post Brexit.  There is still a job to be done.</p><p> While IBEC's work to support contingency planning will continue, it must be stressed that significant Government and EU interventions will be required to protect jobs and businesses if there is a no-deal outcome.  It is important that the European Commission and the Government have fully developed and comprehensive plans that can be triggered without delay in such circumstances.  The economic hit will be immediate; so too must the response.</p><p> Certain issues have been addressed in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 such as the treatment of VAT on UK imports.  However, a much more far-reaching state aid programme would be required in these circumstances.  It would need to include a new enterprise stabilisation fund to provide short-term financing support for affected companies; direct capital, marketing and innovation supports for companies reorienting into new markets beyond the UK; and new trade support measures, including further export trade financing and export credit guarantees.  IBEC has outlined these proposals to the Government in detail and we continue to work with the relevant Departments and agencies to prepare for all scenarios.</p><p> As we move towards another Brexit deadline, the macroeconomic backdrop remains benign.  No other economy in western Europe had greater momentum entering 2019.  However, a no-deal UK exit would significantly reframe the economic outlook and involve a major sterling depreciation, cancelled investment, falling consumer confidence, rising prices and significant trade disruption.  It is crucial, therefore, that all efforts be focused on avoiding such an eventuality.</p><p> I thank committee members for their time.  We look forward to answering questions they may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#H00200"><p>I thank committee members for the invitation to appear before them.  I do not intend to provide a macroeconomic analysis of the effects on small businesses of a Brexit on WTO terms.  The economic effects have been well ventilated elsewhere.  Brexit has been impacting on business directly for the last year, stalling investment decisions, changing marketing policies, curtailing employment in at-risk areas and, most importantly, reducing confidence.</p> <p>  Among members of the Irish SME Association, ISME, the quarterly business confidence indicator we employ to analyse business sentiment has not been so low since 2011.  We thought this would lift after the postponement of Brexit in March, but it has not.  Members told us that they had invested in inventories because of hard Brexit fears.  These inventories are now being liquidated.  Businesses face the same cycle again, building inventories ahead of the October deadline without any clarity on whether such inventories will be needed and sucking up working capital and management time.  Brexit now ranks ahead of even insurance as a business concern for our members.</p> <p>  While we acknowledge the political difficulties in concluding a withdrawal agreement with the United Kingdom when that country has not come to an internal agreement on how to exit the European Union, we need creative solutions for how to assist our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner.  The backstop may or may not be the material obstacle to the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement that some suggest it is.  However, blind adherence by Ireland to the maintenance of the backstop could prove to be a costly policy if it proves to be the root cause in producing that which it seeks to avoid.  Therefore, we ask legislators to be imaginative and flexible in their approach to what may be the end-game discussions on Brexit.</p> <p>  Small businesses lack the expertise, bandwidth, foresight, finance and, most of all, the time to carry out contingency planning for every conceivable form of Brexit.  They rely on their political representatives and State and local authority agencies to assist them.  More worryingly, many have adopted a fatalistic wait and see approach.  As the committee has just heard, the low uptake of EORI numbers is indicative of this. </p> <p>  We are conscious of our duties as a trade association in helping SMEs to prepare for Brexit, despite the uncertainties.  Brexit assistance measures are included in all of our communications with members and roadshows.  We have a dedicated website area for all matters related to Brexit.  However, members will need more than information in November.  In particular, small businesses do not wish to take on more debt while addressing a problem that could reduce sales or increase their cost.  That does not make sense, but it does explain why the Brexit loan scheme has been less successful than legislators might have intended.  We wish members of the Oireachtas well in the crucial four months ahead.  ISME will assist committee members and the Government in any way it can in preparing for Brexit.</p></speech>

I am always amused when I arrive back here because I spent a good part of my life thrashing business organisations in my trade union activity.  I compliment both organisations for the tremendous work they have done in the last couple of years in providing information for their members and running roadshows.  Part of the sadness is what Mr. McDonnell alluded to, the low uptake as a result of people hoping it will be all right on the night or that maybe it will go away.  A colleague of mine here believes there will be a dedicated carriageway running both ways from Holyhead to Dover, but we both know that is not realistic.</p> <p>  One of my concerns pertaining to IBEC is the size of the soft balance sheets held in Ireland.  Mr. Danny McCoy recently stated 40% of the world's soft balance sheets were in this country.  With Brexit coming down the line, companies are moving into Ireland from the United Kingdom, putting further pressure on accommodation costs.  In speaking to the last group that appeared before us I made the point that we were seeing companies bid for employees in specialist areas.  Rather than a jobs market, we almost have an auction market for specific highly skilled jobs.  I really wonder about the damage that could be caused by something from which we are all hoping to benefit.  Is there a latent aspect of high finance companies and various other firms coming into the country?  I refer to the risk that they will end up pricing Ireland out of the market with reference to both labour costs and the cost of living.  Have the two organisations looked at that issue?</p> <p>  Dr. Ivory referred to a hard border.  This is an old hobby horse of mine.  This country has never had a hard border in its entire history.  It had a highly militarised border and I really fear the return of something similar.  The fact that it was highly militarised, with so many ways to get across it, gave rise to a black market and smuggling operations.  I wonder in particular about the danger of beef being imported from, say, Argentina into Northern Ireland which is within the United Kingdom before being loaded onto trucks, smuggled south and transported to Europe as Irish beef.</p><p>If that happens and it is caught, I cannot begin to think what it is going to do to us.  </p><p> A number of the international chambers of commerce operating in Ireland are encouraging manufacturing to look to Europe for alternative sources of components.  Have IBEC and ISME looked at the cost of changing to European-based component suppliers?  Are there issues with quality if there is a move away from the UK to source alternative suppliers?</p><p> I turn now to the issue of the seabridge versus the landbridge.  We were given an estimate earlier of the landbridge costing five hours.  Concerning the seabridge, the Germans are looking at trying to get direct routes into Duisburg or the Hook of Holland.  They think Cherbourg and Le Havre are too far away from mainland Europe.  Have the organisations examined the cost of that for their members?</p><p> Regarding what happens post Brexit, at a recent conference I was told that we could expect that it would be ten years before this issue settles down.  Have IBEC and ISME examined this and do they have an estimate of how long we are looking at?  I think Mr. McDonnell referred to the backstop and that its latent aspect might be to make things worse.  Will he elaborate on that?  Has ISME considered an alternative system?  Would it prefer a border to be in place with proper checks as against free movement over and back?  I thank the representatives from both organisations for being here.</p></speech>

I want to ask them a question that I put to my colleagues earlier.  It concerns the importance of the backstop from an organisational point of view and the companies represented by IBEC and ISME.  I would like them to build on what they said in reference to regulatory alignment.  Questions may arise from that.  Initially, I want to get a corporate view and hear about anything that witnesses may be able to expand upon regarding the significance of the backstop.</p></speech>

The first relates to the international context.  IBEC is a member of Business Europe.  We have hosted its counterparts many times when they have come here to discuss this issue.  Leaving aside the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, I ask the witnesses to comment on the degree to which solidarity has been maintained.  How is IBEC working with colleagues to develop knowledge of the unique situation in which Ireland will find itself post Brexit compared to continental colleagues?  I refer to how heavily exposed our economy will be to the British economy both directly and indirectly.  Senator Craughwell has mentioned the landbridge at length in that regard.</p> <p>  We saw the second extension to this process in April and we throttle towards 31 October not knowing what is going to happen in the UK.  That might be clearer in the next few weeks but it might also be less clear.  Mr. McDonnell made a lengthy point on inventory.  I have come across that issue in a stark way.  A friend of mine owns a second hand used car dealership and he brings in a great deal of stock from the UK.  He stocked up last year and now he has spent the first quarter of this year trying to get rid of that stock.  He has done okay.  Let us put it this way, however.  As a result of that stocking up, there will be no summer holiday for him or his kids this year.  </p> <p>  The extension period is welcome because it avoids the cliff edge.  We all know how bad an uncontrolled Brexit could be.  How damaging though is the uncertainty?  Is it the uncertainty that is dangerous or is it more that in a parallel stream people think the threat has gone away?  As a result, they have stopped preparing and assume the process will keep getting pushed on.  This process will end at some stage, however.  It will end with the agreement of a deal, a no-deal scenario or the UK revoking Article 50.  This process will, however, end at some stage.  Is this a little bit like the boy who cried wolf?  By the time it eventually ends will there have been so many extensions and possible endings that the uncertainties will have just added to the overall confusion?  How can we get around that? </p> <p>  Both organisations mentioned the work they do with their members and their engagement with Government.  We sit beside each other at Brexit stakeholder forums and we have all been to the road shows, as Senator Craughwell mentioned.  How prepared, however, can business be?  Is it the case that it will never be fully prepared and is that why only 6% of people say they are prepared?  Is that because nobody knows what they are preparing for?  The witnesses have stressed the importance of information and legislative matters.  When we talk about State aid packages, from a Government perspective, how exactly do we prepare them?  We do not know when we will need to make those changes, when this process will end or when State aid will be required.  How can that be best calculated?</p></speech>

I was in Helsinki this time last week for a meeting of the council of presidents of Business Europe.  In addition to the formal meetings of the council of presidents, we also had a number of bilateral meetings with key strategic business partners.  I am pleased that there is strong solidarity from European business.  We all continue to support the acceptance of a withdrawal agreement with a transitional period attached.  The political declaration is a part of the withdrawal agreement and there is further room for manoeuvre and negotiations on that element of the withdrawal package.  There is no sign of any business group in Europe moving away from that position.  There is very strong support for the backstop and that being part of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  As well as meeting with our business partners, in the past few weeks, we have also met the European Commission's Brexit task force and the European Council's Brexit unit.  The clear message from all of those meetings is that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened for negotiation.  On that basis, our advice to members is that they cannot rely on the impression sometimes given in the UK that a new Prime Minister will simply be able to reopen negotiations and arrive at a different deal.  Our view is that the deal on the table is a good deal.  There is no sign of the European Commission, the European Council or the Government moving away from that position.  Our advice to our members, therefore, is that the possibility of a no-deal scenario has increased and we need to continue to deepen contingency planning for that outcome. </p> <p>  One of the questions Senator Craughwell asked concerned the preparedness of businesses.  Our view regarding contingency planning is that much of it has been done by large companies.  Much money has been spent on that contingency planning.  The European Commission has also published many documents on such planning and our own ports and infrastructure have taken significant steps in this regard.</p><p>Customs and Revenue have taken significant measures in contingency planning.  Despite all the best efforts of the authorities and business, it is our view that nothing can prepare for the catastrophic economic impact of a no-deal Brexit.  In this context, we believe further measures are required and we have said this to the Commission and the Government.  At Commission level, there is a need for agreement on personal data flows and exchange.  While an adequacy agreement will be negotiated between the UK and EU, there should be a moratorium and freeze period during which data can still flow across borders.  Otherwise we do not understand how business is going to operate.  We cannot change labelling overnight and there are many other compliance issues.  There has to be a compliance trajectory and period after a no-deal Brexit when a sensible approach is taken to enable business to keep going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Arnold Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#K00200"><p>The Chairman raised a couple of points on the mood in business with regard to the rolling extensions.  There is obvious frustration and a challenge in terms of managing people and resources in trying to stay prepared.  Business appreciates the approach of the Government on this, the importance of the backstop from a political perspective and the implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  There is understanding that while the frustration and costs involved in those deadlines are painful, business is happy that extended deadlines are granted if the alternative is the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit and ramping up the tension on this element.</p> <p>  To return to one of the earlier points made on the wider economic issues that arise in the context of new investment, particularly in the context of Brexit and financial institutions, these are very big issues and IBEC and the business community are incredibly cognisant of them.  We have set out significant and comprehensive proposals on infrastructure.  We need to make sure the economy and the country in general are able to absorb inward investment and the talent implications in terms of squeezing the labour market and the talent pool.  We have set out comprehensive proposals on this and we are more than happy to circulate them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#K00300"><p>I will take the questions in the order they arose.  As to the soft balance sheet issue, as matters stand, small business sees itself in competition within a three-part economy.  There is the small enterprise economy, the multinational economy and the State and semi-State economy.  According to CSO figures, State employees are paid 35% more than private sector workers and multinational companies pay a premium above this again.  Our people complain about trickle up in the employment market as it is.  If Dublin were to become a refugee centre for even more big entities from London, the problem would be exacerbated.  We are based on Kildare Street and we can see, as can committee members, what is happening on Molesworth Street with the number of entities moving in.</p> <p>  On EU suppliers, I echo the point made by Dr. Ivory.  To give a practical example of this, I have a member in the cosmetics distribution business in Ireland which distributes a French cosmetics range that is a household name.  It is packaged and labelled in the UK for the UK and Irish markets.  Interestingly, my members have pointed out that there are commercial arrangements and licence distribution arrangements in place for the UK and Ireland that are held by UK companies.  We have raised this matter with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and informed it that, in the event of a hard Brexit, some of these contracts may become unenforceable or a UK company may try to enforce a distribution contract that is unenforceable in Ireland.  There are all sorts of issues.  The French cosmetic products has its standard markings and English translation applied in the UK.  That is not to say this cannot be replicated here or done somewhere else but it will be done at a significant cost.  Alternatively, the UK could just agree to continue doing it and abide by the standards in place.  That is a political consideration.</p> <p>  On the backstop alternatives, the difficulty with the backstop is that it has taken on a Jekyll and Hyde aspect.  The political aspect, which has become unacceptable in the UK, is not fundamentally an area that occupies small business.  The political difficulties with the backstop, as it is called, have taken on a life of their own, whereas from our perspective the backstop is an insurance policy and contingency policy against something bad happening.  We see the backstop as a practical insurance policy against a bad event.  There is total disconnect between the political imperative and the practical imperative.</p> <p>  We discussed the phytosanitary issue outside the room.  What do we do with beef crossing the Border?  It is acknowledged that there will have to be an all-island approach to this.  Where it gets interesting is, for instance, in service businesses.  I know I am dealing with some trade unionists here.  Let us take a building company in Northern Ireland that decides in the brave new world that it will not comply with the working time directive.  Will it be capable of tendering for business in the Republic?  These are practical and legal considerations that will bother some of our members if Northern Ireland companies have the freedom to opt for particular regulatory regimes that are potentially anti-competitive and if, for example, our people are held to a 48-hour average working week but this requirement disappears elsewhere.</p> <p>  A substantial amount of the equipment purchased in the health service, particularly high-end kit, has been manufactured to British standards.  These difficulties will go away if there is mutual recognition of standards but we have already complained to the Office of Government Procurement and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation about so-called Brexit-proofing of contracts.  There are tenders coming out from State and semi-State agencies stating they want to be insulated against possible consequences of Brexit, for instance, in the purchase of fixed assets that might be purchased under a British standard.  Will that standard be acknowledged in future?  These have serious implications for long-life assets.</p> <p>  The political point I made about the backstop is that when the Irish voted "No" in some European referenda in the past because of our red lines we succeeded in getting opt-outs that provided a political salve and opened up a way through for us.  I would like to think something like this is achievable for the UK.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the international impact.  ISME, like IBEC, is a member of a European business association, namely, SMEunited.  I have to be honest and say that once we go beyond talking to the Dutch and Germans, there is not a huge amount of concern.  Intellectually and in business terms, others have moved on.  One of the difficulties that will emerge in any form of renegotiation is that people see commercial advantage in the UK leaving.</p><p>The notion that there will be hands reaching across the Channel to help the UK is a bit fanciful.  This is not a significant concern outside the immediate Dover-Calais area.  It is impossible to put a euro cost on uncertainty.  If the Senator remembers the end of last year, the UK became the biggest purchaser for refrigeration facilities for medicines in the world, so one can start to put a high quantification on it.  Ireland ran out of warehousing space.  Nobody will build a warehouse for something that might not occur.  What will happen is what is classically called rationing by price.  Those that can afford to build inventories will do so and those who cannot will not, and they will accept the consequences.</p><p> With regard to state aid, most of what will be required is working capital.  Our people are extremely reluctant to take on debt.  That will be tricky to achieve within state aid rules.  I am conscious that the State cannot just hand out money.  The simple answer to how prepared businesses can be is that not all businesses can be prepared for every eventuality.  Business has a tolerance for bad news.  It just needs to be told it directly and honestly.  There are not the same political considerations that one has to deal with with the electorate.  People just want to quantify the worst case scenario and they are happy to put up with bad news.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-19a.1462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Ivory" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019061900002#L00200"><p>Could I add to the point about the beef sector and the threat of Argentinian or Brazilian beef coming across the Border?  There are two matters to address relating to the Border and the backstop is part of it.  We have responsibility, as members of the European Union, to protect the integrity of the Single Market.  That will be challenging and difficult in a no-deal situation but these are the sorts of challenges that we have to address.  It is not just a matter of customs but also regulatory alignment.  The wholefoods, dairy, beef and infant formula sector are all important parts of Irish industry, especially around the Border counties.  There has to be action by State agencies and by the veterinary authorities on sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and inspection issues.  These are all complex matters and further work has to be done on this.  Our information is that customs and the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a 24-7 employment arrangement with new customs officers, such that they will be available around the clock, seven days a week, to facilitate things coming in and out of our ports.  Are our other agencies at that level?  Will SPS measures and inspections be able to match that role?  We have to look at that.</p> <p>  On where the impact will be felt, the regional impact is extraordinarily important.  For example, in the Cavan-Monaghan region, 33% of people employed are in Brexit-exposed sectors.  Therefore we need to address those regional concerns.  As one goes further through the country, into the south and the midlands, one will find significant emphasis on food, spirits and drinks production, all of which could be impacted by this.  One of the stabilisation mechanisms we are proposing in the upcoming budget is that they should take into account the impact on workers.  We propose to prepare a short-term work subsidy scheme for two years for vulnerable workers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  We also propose the introduction of an employment subsidy scheme with subsidies up to &euro;10,000 over 24 months for employees affected in distressed firms.  We need to address a range of measures in addition to the working capital and access to finance that Mr. McDonnell mentioned.</p></speech>
