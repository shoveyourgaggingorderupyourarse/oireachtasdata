This is the first instance in which a legitimate and lawful farming practice will be prohibited in this State.  One could be concerned that this sets a dangerous precedent for other legitimate and lawful traditional farming practices purely based on the ideological views of a select cohort.  I understand that the discussions between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the three farmers concerned have not been progressing, much to the farmers' disappointment.  The three farmers have sought to meet with the Department in recent weeks and wrote to the Minister's office directly on 17 November expressing their outstanding concerns but received no response.  The Minister reiterated in the D&aacute;il on 4 November his intention to provide for a fair and reasonable scheme of compensation for the three farmers concerned.  No one of sound mind, however, would consider what is proposed to them in the closing down of their business as fair or reasonable.</p><p>These amendments were also sent to the Minister's office directly by the farmers but went unanswered.  That is neither fair nor reasonable treatment of any farmer.  As discussed by the committee during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in July of this year, the basis on which the Department's proposal to calculate the compensation entitled to the farmers, taking into account their earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, uses the worst five-year reference period.  This would give the farmers a pittance in compensation.  Farmers have asked that a longer reference period be used in order to reflect fairly and accurately the cyclical nature of their trade.  The farmers have provided the necessary financial information illustrating this to the Department.  Why is the Department opposed to considering this when it is clear that the fur trade operates in a cyclical nature and on an average of seven to ten years?  Committee members raised concerns about staff being entitled only to statutory redundancy and asked that the Minister and his officials commit to reconsidering this.  These concerns seem to have been ignored by the Department officials, who have reaffirmed that staff will be entitled only to the bare minimum statutory redundancy.  It is completely unacceptable that these workers should be punished through no fault of their own and just because they now find themselves unemployed at the hands of the Government.  Will the Minister, for once and for all, consider giving these workers a redundancy package that is fair and reflective of their services?  The farmers concerned have been left in limbo while the Department drags its heels and while there remain huge disparities in agreeing the terms of the phasing out of the practice of fur farming that would constitute fair and reasonable compensation for those involved.</p><p>The amendment takes into account that workers will be needed for the winding down process of each farm.  We feel that the amendment should be added to the Bill.</p></speech>

At their appearance before the committee, the representatives of fur farmers claimed that two of every three farms have asbestos in their buildings.  At that time, we were told the Department was considering putting a cap of &euro;50 per square metre on the compensation.  Is it sticking to that figure?  Will the additional costs involved in asbestos removal, transportation and disposal-----</p></speech>

Will the Minister give his rationale for not accepting the amendment, if that is his intention?  Will he elaborate on the wording it is proposed not to amend, namely, "during the period commencing 6 months before"?  There is a seasonal element to workers in this sector.

This is a rare occurrence.

I will support the amendment proposed by Deputy Collins.  This is so important.  The county I represent has one of these farms, which are being adversely affected by the closure of its agricultural activity.  I have seen that business grow and evolve over the years and comply with the highest of regulations and European standards.  It has given employment and been very meaningful in our community, given fish farms and so on were able to work in conjunction with it.  A void is now being left, as I have explained to the Minister on numerous occasions, which is why I was opposed in the first instance to this move to shut it.  It is a very unusual development for farming of any nature to be shut, banned and outlawed for ever.</p> <p>  I too have been dealing with the farmers involved.  While I appreciate very much, as the Minister will be aware, the work he and his officials are doing, on 17 November he received correspondence with regard to Second Stage of the Bill, when farmers' worries and concerns at that time related to the fact the package as proposed was slow in its delivery and it had not been made meaningful to them.  Furthermore, they had concerns about the redundancy package and what was involved.  We are talking away their livelihoods and talking about operations that have been built up over decades.  A practice like that cannot be made to disappear overnight.  There are purpose-built sheds that might have absolutely no other function in farming.  They would have to be dismantled, which would involve a lot of money.</p> <p>  We have also to consider the livelihoods of the people who work on those farms.  I personally know fine, hard-working, genuine people who have worked on them and made their careers on them.  It has been their life&rsquo;s work and their job.  We have to bear in mind and acknowledge the enormity of what is happening here.  People's way of life, the place where they pulled up their trousers and went to work every day, is being closed.  We have to acknowledge that.  Will the Minister please take on board what is being said here today in that regard?  It is very important and farmers deserve to be treated well.  Any time the Department and the Government pull the rug from underneath somebody, there has to be some sort of a net to catch them when they fall.  As for the people in the Government who pushed for and insisted on this, let it be on their heads that they have done this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#B01000"><p>I thank the Chairman and all the members for ensuring Committee Stage of the Bill would be dealt with today.  I thank them also for the opportunity earlier in the D&aacute;il to comment on changes the Bill will make to the forestry industry.  That was a sensible, reasonable and practical approach to furthering that measure.</p> <p>  This is a significant change.  Only three or four of these farmers remain in the country.  All of them have been operating in line with the laws, regulations and practices required of them.  When the industry started, they were given State encouragement to start their enterprises.  I am very cognisant of that, but times have changed and the social acceptability of fur-farming as a practice has changed.  Indeed, the social acceptability of the use of fur in clothing is very much a changed vista as well.  As a result of that, a decision was made by the State that it was not appropriate to farm what would be naturally wild animals for their fur and to make that illegal.  Nevertheless, it is important we treat the remaining farmers with respect and fairness in recognition of the fact their livelihood is being impacted.  That is why, with this legislation, as we have discussed at earlier stages, we are seeking to ensure a fair approach will be taken in the context of compensation for those farmers and their workers.</p> <p>  To respond specifically to Deputy Collins's amendment, the Bill defines a redundant worker as an employee "who was dismissed, during the period commencing 6 months before [the commencement of the Bill], and ending 6 months after, the date of commencement of [the Act]".  This provision applies certain parameters and limits to the group of workers who will be eligible when compensation is being calculated.</p><p> The legislation has not been enacted by the Oireachtas yet.  We are at the first stage of that, bringing it through the D&aacute;il, then it will go through the Seanad.  Once it has gone through both Houses, it will be open to me, as Minister, to commence the legislation.  There will be a period of six months before and six months after the commencement of the legislation in which workers will be eligible for a redundancy payment as part of a compensation package to employers and farmers to provide for their workers.  The fact that it will be six months before and six months after reflects that there is seasonality to mink farming.  It covers a full calendar year.  That is proportionate and appropriate, covers the seasonality and is the right approach.  If it was 12 months, there would be a two-year window, and somebody who was made redundant 12 months before the commencement of the Act would be eligible for redundancy even though the farming could be continued in that period and there was no requirement for the farmer to stop.  First and foremost, we have to be fair to the farmers concerned, but we also have to be sensible and proportionate with regard to what we put in the legislation.  We have been more than proportionate in reflecting the 12 months of a full calendar year to ensure that we capture any seasonality associated with the close-down.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Minister is going to accept any of the amendments I have tabled.  That is entirely up to him and the Department.  In winding down their businesses, the people involved will incur many expenses.  There will be professional costs that need to be accounted for.  I refer, for example, to the necessary legal costs incurred by farmers.  I do not think these have been accounted for.  The Minister stated that he wants to treat these people with respect.  As I said earlier, they feel they are being treated unfairly.  The discussions between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the farmers about their concerns have not been progressing.  Nobody can say they are treated with respect unless the discussions are progressing.  They are putting suggestions to the Minister and not getting any replies.  That is what the Minister sees as progress and treating them with respect.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position and to support this amendment.</p></speech>

At the time of the committee's discussions, we were told the Department was looking to cap that at &euro;50 per square metre.  Will the Department confirm whether it is sticking to that figure and if the additional costs involved in asbestos removal, transportation and disposal have been taken into account?  Like I said, I have experience with that kind of thing and &euro;50 per square metre does not wash with me.</p></speech>

Obviously, the objective here is to be reasonable and fair, as I said at the outset, and to ensure appropriate and fair compensation is provided for the closure of these farms.  When we discussed Deputy Michael Collins' previous amendment, I outlined that a full 12-month period is covered.  There will be six months before a farm closes and six months afterwards, which makes up a full year.  Again, that is a reasonable and fair approach.  I did not support that amendment, as I said, because the Deputy is looking to extend the period to two years.  This would give a full year before the farm was actually shut.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 2 itself, I will first outline what is contained in section 71D.  The section sets out the overarching principles that will govern the compensation payable to fur farmers.  Compensation will be payable for income losses, non-income losses and costs incurred as a direct result of the prohibition.  The amount of compensation for each affected fur farming business is to be determined by an independent assessor to be appointed by the Minister.  The Bill contains principles and policies that authorise the Minister to make regulations to specify the income and non-income losses and other costs in respect of which compensation will be payable, the basis of valuation for assessing income and non-income losses, and to provide for financial limits to apply to certain compensation payments where appropriate.  Regulations will also provide compensation for the costs involved in disposing of breeding mink, demolition and clean-up costs - accommodating the likes of what Deputy Martin Browne indicated there in respect of asbestos, for payments required to be made to redundant workers - which we dealt with in the previous amendment, for certain professional fees incurred in the preparation of applicants&rsquo; claim form and in the making of representations to my Department relating to the development of this legislation.  Regulations can also be made to provide for a number of administrative matters including advanced payments to claimants prior to any final determination of their compensation entitlements under this Bill, the appointment of an assessor, the form and content of applications for compensation, information required to be furnished by applicants and any other matters that are incidental, supplemental and consequential to that.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins' amendment seeks that farmers be compensated for: "all other reasonable, necessary and consequential costs and losses so that the totality of the compensation is reasonable and fair".  In response, I state that these overall provisions govern the compensation package that will be made available to existing fur farmers and have been developed with the benefit of expert, independent and objective financial advice.  My officials have also engaged with colleagues from other member states and have had the benefit of their experience in developing similar compensation schemes that are to apply to fur farmers in other jurisdictions.  My officials have also directly engaged with the fur farmers and their representatives on these provisions and will continue to engage with them on the specific details of the compensation scheme that will soon be provided for in the regulations.  However, for present purposes, I am very confident that the overarching loss categories provided for in this Bill are sufficient to ensure a fair and reasonable compensation package can be made available to the fur farming businesses impacted on.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>  There has been much engagement.  I have met the fur farmers on at least a couple of occasions.  There has also been ongoing engagement with officials and that will continue.  Certainly, we are open to all further correspondence and to meeting them as appropriate as well.  I will also meet them as appropriate in the time ahead to discuss any further issues they have with the Bill.  There has been really comprehensive and ongoing engagement between the farmers and my officials.</p></speech>

This amendment will ensure the correct legal test is applied by the High Court hearing any such appeal when determining whether it is appropriate for the court to vary, set aside or substitute its own decision for the determination of the independent assessor.  The High Court must first be satisfied that there is a serious and significant error or a series of such errors before it can vary, set aside or substitute its decision for that of the assessors.  In the original provision the High Court could make such orders if satisfied that there was a serious or significant error or a series of errors.  I am advised that this is not the correct legal test to apply to such appeals.</p></speech>

There are not many people who would be able to sustain the likes of the Minister or the Department hauling them to the High Court.  There should always be an opportunity to bring this about if he or she feels aggrieved but from what I understand, the Minister has the right to bring an ordinary individual, who may help us in this case, to the High Court.</p></speech>

That means there would be an assessor and independent overview of what the costs might be.  It would be really important that this is fairly done, and that is why we are being as clear as we can in the legislation.  It would also be important that regulations bring clarity to the process too.</p> <p>  We do not want it to be the case that the court process is used, partly because of the costs associated with it.  Everyone will always have the right to appeal to the High Court but it is not where we might hope these decisions would be made.  We hope that with the structure we have put in the Bill and a fair process, we would come to a good conclusion that would fairly reflect the outcome.</p> <p>  There are parallels and precedents for rights of appeal to the High Court.  Having taken legal advice through the Attorney General's office and my Department, it seems the general precedent in this regard is to use the threshold of serious and significant errors.  That is why I am making this adjustment in the legislation.  It is based on the legal advice that this is the appropriate and normal legal threshold for an appeal to the High Court.</p> <p>  In terms of the compensation package structure, there is capacity for legal and other expenses for farmers to engage with the Department in finalising the compensation package.  There is the support for the farmers around administration, including the potential for legal advice around engaging with the Department.  Any decision to appeal to the High Court is a separate matter.</p></speech>

What constitutes a serious or significant error?  Who decides this?  Will standard errors not be considered?</p></speech>

In putting the structure of the compensation process together, it is important that it should ensure a fair outcome.  It is also appropriate in setting the threshold for appeal to the High Court that we take cognisance of what happens in other situations.  I have been very much guided by the legal advice from the Attorney General around that.</p><p>To clarify the point I made earlier regarding legal advice, there will be the capacity for costs in terms of legal advice and other costs associated with making an application for compensation.  There will be support for that in terms of the compensation package.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#H00200"><p>That is too unclear in terms of the barometer that is set.  The easiest way of giving assurance on the definition of a "serious or significant" error is to give us a ballpark figure of the costs that would be involved.</p> <p>  The second part is to ask whether the Minister has received advice from the Attorney General on Deputy Michael Collins's proposed amendment regarding the word "material".  It seems to me that if an actual cost has been incurred then there will be recourse, if necessary.  It would also provide assurance for those people who are making claims in the first instance and put an emphasis on those who are dealing with claims to make sure they do not make any errors.  If people were told in their day-to-day work that the criteria that would apply to them was that they would not make any serious or significant errors than that is a fair bit of latitude.  It is important, therefore, as the Minister said, that we avoid instances reaching the level of the High Court at all.  I would be interested to hear whether there is a rationale against using the particular word "material", which to my mind makes more sense from a practical point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#H00300"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy.  The assessment would be that, for example, to use the word "material" would be too broad and, indeed, very vague as a result of that.  In putting the legislation together as lawmakers, it is important that we have due regard to putting in place a good robust structure and process that will get a fair outcome in terms of the implications for the farmers concerned and also for the State and its responsibility in that regard.</p> <p>  It is also important in setting the legislation that we give good, appropriate consideration to what the threshold is for it all ending up in the High Court.  Were we to use a vague term that is not very clear and is really broad, which the word "material" is, then obviously, the capacity for that to end up in the High Court would be much higher.  The capacity to end up in the High Court is a serious step in which there are very significant costs involved for everyone concerned.  We will all be aware of many examples and instances in the past where things went to the High Court and ended up costing a multiple of what the actual point at consideration might have been.  In terms of setting what the thresholds might be, therefore, it is important that we set an appropriate one.  We do not want to structure the legislation in such a way that it increases the likelihood of more minor matters or ones that are of a much lower threshold being considered in that forum.</p> <p>  It is important that we look at the structure of the legislation and the process involved in terms of the Bill itself.  We must look at the processes we are putting in place to make sure that by addressing and structuring those well, we come to an outcome that is suitable, proportionate and leaves everyone in a good place, both the farmers and the State.  By setting thresholds that, first of all, do not take into account the standard thresholds for appealing to the High Court, and by setting them at a level that is broad and vague, we as lawmakers would leave a much higher chance of it ending up being decided in the High Court rather than by the process we are setting up under the legislation.  That is the thinking behind it all.</p></speech>

Remember, this process deals with compensation for people's livelihoods ending as a result of legislation that is passed.  The standard should be, therefore, that no errors are made when the compensation that is due to people is being assessed.</p> <p>  I will put on record that I will be supporting Deputy Michael Collins' amendment.</p></speech>

I will make a further comment on Deputy Carthy's contribution.  On thresholds that are "serious or significant", these are words most commonly used with regard to a referral of a case to the High Court.  There is, therefore, significant case law around that.  Obviously, making that decision and consideration at the end would be a matter for the judges based on the threshold we set.  That threshold has precedence here, however, and is standardly used.</p> <p>  The point the Deputy made would be more applicable to the word "material" because there is not the same consideration as to what that means.  That is much more vague and would not have the same case law or precedence around it to test exactly what it might mean.  Obviously, it is important that anything going to the High Court would be a matter of importance.  That is why I am bringing forward this threshold, which is the one that is standardly used in such instances.</p></speech>

It is a sensible approach and the most efficient approach for all of us.  It will help to achieve a worthy objective in the most reasonable timeframe we can.  The amendment is intended to facilitate the promotion of small-scale planting of native tree species in a nuanced manner.  It will not be a requirement to get a licence for an area that is larger than 0.1 ha but not greater than 1 ha and for an area that is not less than 0.1 ha but is also not greater than 20 m in width, and where the trees concerned are native tree species only, of which not more than 25% are Scot's pine.</p> <p>The key objective behind the amendment is to facilitate the introduction of a scheme that would allow us to incentivise more plantation of native trees.  If we have a legal basis, the Department would then have the capacity to introduce a scheme and look at incentivising farmers to do small-scale plantations and riparian zones alongside waterways, which would have an environmental benefit from the point of view of biodiversity and water quality.</p> <p>The largest size that does not require a licence application at the moment is 0.1 ha.  That is small and prohibitive limit that does not allow people to do much.  After much consideration of the legislation around this topic and of what would be feasible and possible within the overall framework to facilitate planting without a licence and promote native trees, we are driving legislation to enable us to run a scheme that would encourage the growth of native trees.</p> <p>This is in addition to, and entirely separate from, the objective to reach our commercial afforestation targets.  The target in the climate action plan is to reach 8,000 ha per year of commercial forests over the this decade.  That is important.  We have had challenges over the past year that we have been working our way out of.  We have found ourselves in an unacceptable position in respect of the number of licences being issued and the backlog that is in place.  We have been making progress in that regard but more progress is necessary.  Thankfully, the dial is now moving in the right direction.  We must keep raising the output level and improving the situation during the time ahead.</p> <p>This measure is separate from those considerations.  It is a worthy objective to seek to improve the number of native trees in the countryside through small forest plantations and riparian zones.  This is an important amendment that would make the process as administratively smooth as possible, without the necessity for a full-blown licence application for an area smaller than 1 ha.</p></speech>

An increase in small acreages of trees would be of great benefit.  It would allow a farmer to plant a corner or along a riverbank, as he said, without the necessity of a licence.  It is also imperative that the programme for Government target for afforestation, which is to ensure we have a vibrant forestry sector going forward, is kept separate and divorced from this measure.  We have a target of 8,000 ha that we need to afforest every year.  We must keep those two targets separate.  They can be mutually beneficial as we address the challenges of climate change.  However, it is imperative that the 8,000 ha target is what we judge our afforestation targets on.  I know the Minister agrees.</p></speech>

However, I do not believe this will be a silver bullet to meet our target of 8,000 ha per annum.  I spoke earlier in the D&aacute;il on this matter.  I have a couple of specific questions to put to the Minister.  The Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, has voiced concerns around the lack of detail given to the industry stakeholders regarding this amendment.  We all received messages and emails from that organisation.  What consultation took place with the industry regarding the amendment?  Will the involvement of registered foresters be mandatory for the planting of these areas?  Who is going to oversee what species of trees is being planted?  I know this has been a big issue for the Department.</p> <p>  How many plants per acre are being envisaged in these areas?  How will that compare to the current rates of afforestation?  When will consultation take place between the stakeholders to ensure that the measures developed will complement existing tree-planting schemes?</p> <p>  The species of trees involved are contained within the amendments.  The Chairman mentioned Sitka spruce not being included in that list while some strange species of trees are included.  I am not sure many people will grow native crab apple trees.  People have been cutting them down for years.  I find it strange that the Minister cannot broaden the list of the species of trees set out in the amendment.</p></speech>

This legislation only came before us recently so, with that in mind, we will take the questions individually, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#K01100"><p>Deputy Kehoe made the point that people have been cutting down certain tree species for years.  The culture is changing.  It needed to change and we need to encourage it to change.  We also need to make it as smooth and amenable as possible for those who want to plant.  In terms of small-scale afforestation, we need to encourage native trees and native tree plantations.  We can all envisage an addition to the countryside if we were to see, for example, more riparian zones alongside waterways.  That could be beneficial for the visual aspect of the countryside and, importantly, could also be beneficial for biodiversity and water quality.  That is something farmers are increasingly open to doing.  Small-scale plantations of native trees up to 1 ha can have a benefit from the point of view of biodiversity so that is why we put a lot of thought into whether this would be possible and amending the legislation around this.</p><p>Following on from this, if the committee and the Oireachtas decide to support providing a legal basis for such a scheme, we would proceed to develop such a scheme and engage with all representatives and those with expertise on this to ensure it is a scheme that works well and is as effective and practicable as possible for those who want to plant trees.  We would also look at an appropriate mechanism for incentivising and rewarding those who do that.  </p><p> This is entirely separate from afforestation targets for commercial forestry, which will be really important from a climate, emissions reduction and sequestration perspective.  It will also be really important in changing behaviour and materials usage in wider society over the next number of years, particularly in construction.  We will need to have the wood material if we are to displace some of the more emissions-intensive materials used at the moment and central to that is having the plantations.  We have a lot of work to do and getting to 8,000 ha will be really important alongside that.  This in itself is a very worthy initiative.  There is no crisis or emergency around it.  It is just something we think is a really worthy objective, which is why we looked at trying to bring it in as promptly as we can so that the scheme could be put in place and farmers who want to avail of it can get on with that.  This is why we sought the committee's discretion to be able to include it in this Bill so we could consider it together, move it along and give it further consideration on Committee and Report Stages, as it goes through the Seanad and, ultimately, in enabling the scheme to be introduced after that, working really closely with the sectoral representatives, interests and stakeholders regarding the structure of this scheme.</p></speech>

Is the Minister stating that the commercial target is still 8,000 ha and we will still aim for that as well as this but that it will not be counted as part of the 8,000?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#L00300"><p>All forests over 0.1 ha are included in our assessment as to our forest cover and inventory so it would be included and counted.  Obviously, we want to achieve that target of 8,000 but we want to go higher than that in the decades ahead so every contribution to that and every new piece of afforestation will be important.  Whenever we are doing at small scale, that is not necessarily as commercial in its structure or nature.</p></speech>

They will probably plant a hectare and that will be it.  That is the big fear.  The Minister is saying it will be included in the target of 8,000 ha.</p></speech>

The Minister has established that it is going in on the 8,000 ha even though it is not commercial.  There is no point in calling votes here because the result will be six to four no matter what we do but I have the right to table an amendment on this matter on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about a width of 20 m.  Only 20 m or less is not counted as part of the carbon sequestration survey.  I understood that one could do 40 m, 50 m or whatever equals a hectare.  Is one allowed to do that?</p> <p>  Almost every type of tree is allowed bar spruce.  Will the Minister consider adding spruce?  Pine is allowed.  I used to work in forests and above all timbers pine is probably one of the worst type of timber to grow because it grows crooked and does everything that one does not want it to do compared with spruce.  Farmers should have the option to grow spruce.  We have seen in shelter belts, and I have said this in the D&aacute;il, that one could have a spruce in a corner of a field but it could be 30 m or 40 m wide so one could go around in a semi-circle,.and one could have a few of them.</p> <p>  Anyone who is used to farming will know that one could have bits of land that are a few miles apart.  If lands are in separate parcels is one allowed to put a hectare into different parcels or is the scheme based on a herd number?  Is there an establishment grant?</p> <p>  I am raising these issues here so that I can table amendments when this legislation reaches the D&aacute;il.  I hope that the Department will have these issues teased out before we reach that stage.  We have talked to representatives of the industry today, and over the last couple of days as we got more information on this matter, who have expressed their fear that this is a fixer job for the 8,000 ha.  I will table an amendment that 1 ha, of what the Minister is calling non-commercial now, will be kept in a separate inventory to the commercial and that the 8,000 ha will be judged as a commercial operation.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to address my points.  I advise Ms Sarah O'Farrell, clerk to the committee, and the committee that I have raised this matter here so that I can table an amendment on Report Stage as there is no point in anyone calling votes today when we have not received amendments back. </p></speech>

The same applies in this case and that will be countable towards it.</p> <p>  In terms of the 8,000 ha target, in the first instance the forestry programme and, indeed, the European regulations require at least 30% of that must be native trees.  The provision does not seek to undermine the 8,000 ha target.  We will strive to achieve and surpass the target.  This is something that can contribute and make a positive contribution in terms of biodiversity, forestry and sequestration.  It is something that can allow many farmers to play a role in making forestry more of the farming enterprise and personality of an individual farm, and become more integrated.  The provision is a very useful and productive measure.</p> <p>  The point that the Deputy made about 20 m speaks against the first point that he made about 8,000 ha.  I mean his point that by virtue of the fact that it is less than 20 m then it may not be countable towards the 8,000 ha.  The idea behind the continuous line of up to 20 m is to facilitate riparian zones along waterways.    </p></speech>

A field is generally rectangle or square.  When one mows a field then one goes around in a semi-circle and there could be an area that is 40 m by 40 m.  My question does not contradict my first point.  Why do we not allow people to plant the hectare in whatever way they like?  For example, if the space is along a river then it should be three trees wide.   I would promote the planting of native trees for an area along a river.  If a person is doing a shelter belt or something that helps the environment then people should be able to put a hectare together or in two sections if they wanted that would be wider than 20 m.</p></speech>

The capacity to plant up to 1 ha covers that type of an approach.  While it might be wider, if it is within the 1 ha then it will cover it whereas the capacity to plant something that is above 1.1 ha but not greater than 20 m in width means that people will be able to plant more than 1 ha because there is no 1 ha limit but only if it is less than 20 m wide.  The provision targets a long riparian zone type that would be more than 1 ha in size but it would be a riparian feature in nature.</p><p> Regarding the establishment grant, we will put a scheme together if we have the legislative basis for it.  We will consult and engage with members and others on feeding into that.</p><p> On Sitka spruce, the objective is to try to encourage more native tree plantation and facilitate a scheme in that regard.  That is why we have structured the Bill in the way we have.  For riparian zones and smaller groves, we regard native trees as more appropriate. The idea is to introduce a scheme specifically to encourage the plantation of more native trees on a smaller scale.  I take the point the Deputy is making on Sitka spruce, but the objective is to try to promote small-scale native tree plantation.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, stated one of the purposes is to entice farmers into forestry.  If one is not communicating with anyone in any sector, it is next to impossible to build up the confidence that would make them to do as desired.  Like other members of the committee, I must point out my serious misgivings about how an amendment to the forestry legislation is being introduced at such a late stage through completely different legislation and with no consultation.  While I support measures that will help to increase the country's forest cover, I must take issue with the way the proposed measure is being introduced.  This is representative of the poor way the industry has been treated up to now.  I got a phone call from a forester this evening who stated that what has been done was done with no proper input from the forestry sector.  According to the Society of Irish Foresters, SIF, only a small minority in the forestry industry were made aware of this legislation.  They heard about it for the first time last Friday evening.  The organisation states there has been no discussion with the industry even though there are forms available to allow for the discussion of such initiatives.  I pointed this out earlier today also.</p> <p>  While the primary aim of the scheme is to fulfil environmental criteria and is not related to forestry as such, it is being described as a cosmetic exercise aimed at ticking boxes and making the forestry sector seem better than it actually is.  "Landscaping" is one of the words that was used earlier to describe it to me.  I have a couple of questions.  What engagement did the Minister have with the forestry industry before this amendment was submitted?  Has he targets for this measure?  Can the Department tell us whether the land a farmer may wish to plant under the scheme must be used for forestry alone in the future?  I have another two questions but would like answers to those three before I ask them.</p></speech>

The provision is to enable us to put together a scheme, on which we would consult and engage with all interested stakeholders.  We simply would not have the capacity to put a scheme together now to encourage the small-scale planting of native woodland and trees.  I do not see how anyone could object to the proposal.  It is a sensible and logical measure.  It is about making it easier to plant forests, within reason, at a small scale.  It is something we have been considering and assessing.  There is a lot of work ongoing within the Department through Project Woodland and the various work streams to try to streamline the regulation and forestry-licensing processes as much as possible and examine what is happening internationally.  There is a lot of work ongoing in that regard.</p> <p>  This is one small measure that we believe could be helpful.  We felt we would like to make the most of the opportunity that exists and to give people who want to engage in the type of afforestation in question the opportunity to do so.  Currently, the bottom line is that if the area in question is more than 0.1 ha, a licence must be applied for.  This is something we believe we can change.  It is entirely sensible to change it to allow people to plant more than 0.1 ha.</p> <p>  There has to be a first time for everybody to hear about the measure.  Over the past few days, we engaged with the committee and informed members that we would like to proceed using this legislation.  We felt that proceeding in this way, with the co-operation of the members, would be a practical approach.  It just makes sense to move it on.  Otherwise, we would have to start with an entirely new Bill, which would understandably take longer.  It is procedurally possible to proceed as we are doing, so it is really sensible to do so.  I appreciate the unanimous decision made when we spent an hour in the D&aacute;il seeking authorisation to do this.  We are now able to discuss the matter by way of a Committee Stage amendment.  It is an efficient use of all our time.  Importantly, it is also efficient in the sense that we can develop a scheme, promptly after the passage of the legislation, that gives people the capacity to engage in afforestation and increase the proportion of native trees.</p> <p>  This is not a cosmetic exercise; it could make a real difference and be economically beneficial to farmers.  Most farmers, when they examine their landholding, will see spots where they could incorporate native woodland to their benefit and that of the environment around them.  The mechanism is about empowering them to do that.  It was very dismissive of whomever the Deputy was communicating to describe it as landscaping.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the scheme would be beneficial to the landscape.  It would empower farmers to make use of their land in a way that would be beneficial to the environment and biodiversity.  Allowing them to avail of the scheme would also be financially beneficial.</p> <p>  The amendment facilitates the planting of riparian woodland along waterways.  This can have a positive impact, in numerous instances, on water quality because it provides a natural break.</p> <p>  We will engage further from this point on.  The matter will be considered further on Report Stage by the members, and it will also be considered in the Seanad.  I hope that, because we are proceeding in the way we are doing, we will see what we propose alongside the enacted legislation very early in the next D&aacute;il term.  We can then get on with putting the scheme into place.</p></speech>

I have no reason to doubt what the Minister is saying, but I am not the one who is planting and the Minister is not trying to entice me.  The people he is trying to entice have fears and concerns over not having been listened to before and the effort to introduce the measure in the way it is now being introduced.  The Minister said the measure was being thought about for a long time.  For how long has it been talked about?  Why were there no conversations with the very people the Department was trying to entice before introducing the measure in the manner it has been introduced?  It is not me saying it is cosmetic or landscaping.  It is the very people the Department wants to come on board in a small way who need convincing, not Martin Browne.</p></speech>

Again, I cannot see how anyone would object to making it more practical to facilitate some afforestation.  It is a positive, enabling mechanism.  We will engage with all stakeholders when putting the scheme together.  The more everyone reflects on this, the more they will realise it ticks the boxes in every way.  I do not see how anyone, on reflection, could come up with a reason why we should not do this.  It will be a really positive and progressive thing for us to do and consider.</p><p>We will take it forward if members approve it, to take action and engage with all stakeholders about how to do that best.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#R00200"><p>The principle here is incredibly good.  I would have suggested it.  I think everybody would have suggested that we need to make it easier for small plantations of native woodland to be planted across the country.  It is a shame that we have not had this type of scheme in the past.  The principle is not a point of debate.  The Minister is correct about that.  There are genuine concerns in what the sector is raised, which are fair enough.  Legislatively, it is not good practice to submit amendments to members of a committee on a Friday for consideration, including a briefing, D&aacute;il debate and a select committee meeting on the following Wednesday.  It does not give adequate time to identify potential problems in order that we can avoid them.  That goes back to our earlier debate.</p> <p>  To paraphrase the Minister, he is saying that plantations above 0.1 ha which are part of this scheme will be included in the overall afforestation figures, but he plans to achieve an 8,000 ha afforestation target separately to this.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#R00300"><p>Up until now, any plantation above 0.1 ha would count towards our figures but people would have to apply for a licence for it, even if it was between 0.1 ha and 1 ha.  This means that it is much more practical for anybody who wants to plant.  On reaching the target of 8,000 ha, up until now, the target would be for 30% to be deciduous or native trees anyway.  We need to be as ambitious as we can.  The target set out in the climate action plan is 8,000 ha.  I would like to go further than that and would encourage that we do.  That is the objective that we set out with regard to reaching the assigned carbon sequestration targets.  A hectare of forestry will contribute to that.  If 10 ha are planted 1 ha at a time, native trees on ten different farms will have the same sequestration capacity as 10 ha.  It is not in any way to inhibit or reduce our ambition elsewhere.  We will push in every way that we can and we should seek to surpass that 8,000 ha.  The figure of 8,000 ha is the target in the climate action plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2021121500002#R00400"><p>We were nowhere close to reaching the 8,000 ha limit last year.  It was about 2,400 ha.  The latest parliamentary question response I have indicates that it will be about 2,000 ha for 2021.  The Minister can understand the concerns that we are not coming close to reaching the 8,000 ha, so there is an attempt to make up figures through another scheme.  It is good and laudable from a climate action and biodiversity perspective to encourage farmers to plant woodland but it does not do anything for the forestry and timber sector.</p> <p>  My second concern is about the last point the Minister raised, relating to the proportion of native broadleaf.  I agree with and support the concept of trying to reach our 30% target.  I have a fear that this would let others off the hook.  Does the Minister plan to bring proposals?  Can this provision be amended to put a greater onus on Coillte to increase the level of native broadleaf trees in its stock?  I understand that it is below 20% at the moment.  It is the State's forestry company.  Does the Minister have any plans in that regard?  Can he give any assurances that native broadleaf trees planted under this scheme will not be used to allow other people to get off the hook with regard to meeting their own obligations?</p></speech>

This is not about trying to reduce any ambition but about increasing our ambition and using every possible tool and the willingness that people have to contribute in a sensible way.  This proposal stands on its own merits.  I believe it can only be looked at in a positive fashion and its purpose is to enhance and contribute to our overall progress and objectives.</p></speech>

In advance of Report Stage, I can get a briefing on what it is doing.  With regard to Project Woodland and the work that we are doing, there is significant effort to make sure that we increase the level of native plantation and trees planted.  That is something that Coillte plans to contribute to, as well as the fact that we need to try to encourage everyone to contribute inasmuch as they can, and to facilitate them to do so.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in the D&aacute;il earlier, the devil will be in the detail of the scheme.  As I mentioned a number of times, there is significant distrust with the forestry section.  What is the Minister's proposal to deal with that?  Does he propose to bring it back to our committee and the Oireachtas for approval or will it be another instance where there is a leak, we start to get questions, it takes a month to get the full details of the scheme published, and then we backtrack to try to fill in the exposed gaps?  Will the Minister consider bringing this scheme before the committee and Houses for approval in order that we can deliberate on the aspects of it and make sure that we iron out any potential problems?</p></speech>

This is a positive, progressive measure.  We want to get agreement for it to provide us with the legal basis to design a scheme to help to encourage this.  In doing so, we will engage with all stakeholders and take all views on board.  I would be happy to take the Deputy's and the committee's views on board and have a consultation with them about that?  It will be a matter for the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and me to approve and come forward with but we will certainly do so and will engage with all ideas about this.  We all want this to work.  We want all ideas and creative suggestions to try to encourage this.  It can be progressive and work well for farmers, the environment, the rural landscape and biodiversity.  It would be a positive move.  We want to engage and hear what the committee and anyone else have to say.  We want to do it in an open manner that embraces all that and to ultimately put together a scheme which will work and be successful, which people will want to avail of, and which will see trees planted.</p></speech>

One hectare of woodland might not be much, but in some parts of the country, there may be a substantial amount of forestry already.  If a number of farmers or landowners are engaged in it, an additional hectare might have a bearing that we would not see now on specific individuals or families.  Does the Minister anticipate a mechanism whereby people will be able to have their views known prior to plantation?</p></speech>

It is the finer detail that will be important and which we will bring together if we have the legal capacity to be able to develop such a scheme.</p></speech>

Part of our concern and part of the problem here is because there is so much administration involved for quite a small plantation, they are not happening, even though farmers might want to do them and want them to happen.  I am not aware of many such applications in the system.  We would like to have many applications like that but for a small area, we will not see them unless we make it as practicable as possible.  That is why I hope that by doing this and by taking this positive and progressive approach we can really encourage this type of plantation.</p></speech>

What will be the weekly output for licence processing will be next year?  I think we have averaged about 100 per week over the recent period.  As I said earlier today, that needs to increase.  Is that the Minister's intention?</p> <p>  Secondly, he previously mentioned that he will consider bringing forward legislation to provide a statutory period for the provision of processing applications.  Is there any prospect of him doing that in the early part of next year?</p></speech>

We are processing at least in excess of 100 per week at the moment and we are on course to meet 4,000 licences issued this year.  That is up from approximately 2,000, from memory, for last year.  That was an historic and unacceptable low.  We have made progress over the past year, especially in the second and final thirds.  There was an interruption over the summer due to a statutory requirement change and the process had to be adjusted.  We hope to push on significantly and further improve on that next year.</p> <p>  The legislation we introduced around this time last year enabled the capacity to put statutory timelines in place.  At the moment, the key objective is to get the number of licences up significantly and deal with the backlog.  When we achieve an equilibrium there is capacity to put statutory timelines in place but I do not have a timeline for that at the moment.  The key objective is to keep the graph going in the right direction, keep the output growing and deal with the backlog to get through it in the best timeframe we possibly can.</p></speech>

Whatever scheme the Minister and his officials are introducing, it must be simplified.  I agree with the previous speakers.  If the scheme is going to be complicated it is not going to happen.  I must be honest.  I was recently talking to somebody who was waiting three years to plant.  The Department, to be fair, granted the application but it was lost on appeal.  The Minister and his officials are serious but how then is it there was an appeal mechanism for land that was quite capable of being planted?  There were objections but if we are going to leave room for objections even to a single hectare then we are going to have problems.  People must be encouraged.  The forestry industry is on its knees.  In a few years we will not have the supply of timber and jobs in the industry, if we do not do something at this stage.  We have failed over the past year to implement the planting that we need and the licensing for people to fell their trees.  I am aware it has improved.  I must give credit where it is due; when it improves, it improves.  The Department worked hard on trying to get the licences approved.</p> <p>  My point is simple.  If the Minister and his officials are bringing this scheme in and they are serious about it, they should not let it be destroyed before it starts by virtue of the way they draw it up.  That is the only thing I ask.</p></speech>

This is about simplifying how people can grow forestry and making it as straightforward and simple as we can.  It is also about having proportionate and appropriate considerations on where it happens and how it integrates.  In designing the scheme we will try to make it as streamlined and as sensible as possible, to ultimately ensure there is a good output and a good outcome from it and that we get good plantations.</p></speech>

It would be sensible if a person could.  It is for small-scale plantations.  It would not be something that would be open to abuse in the form of putting several together to form a larger plantation that would require a licence.  However, within reason it should be possible to have more than one on a particular holding.  That is something we will examine in further detail and consult people on when we are putting the detail of the scheme together.  Certainly in principle and at this remove, it is something we would encourage.</p></speech>

I would say there has never been more consultation.  There have undoubtedly been real and significant challenges.  This time last year we were in a real crisis situation around the supply of wood.  We passed emergency legislation then with the co-operation and support of the members here and with cross-party support.  Thankfully, we have worked ourselves into a better position but there is still a lot of work to do.  However the situation is improving and progressing, and we are in a much better position now than this time last year.</p> <p>  There has been immense consultation throughout.  Project Woodland was established with three different project streams to look at how we can make our system work more effectively and look at what is happening internationally and try to implement any agreed changes that could improve the system.  That is ongoing.  Those project streams and work groups have been working all the time.  That is representative of all stakeholders.  Both myself and the Minister of State have had regular meetings with industry representatives as well.  Consultation has been really strong and will continue to be.  It will be strong on this measure also if we get the co-operation of the Oireachtas to facilitate the capacity to develop such a scheme and to engage and get views on how we can put in place a scheme that will work and be successful.  </p> <p>  While there have undoubtedly been challenges there has been immense and deep consultation.  There may not be satisfaction in the industry.  Indeed, none of us have been satisfied.  The Department is not satisfied about where things have been over the past year but we are all working to improve things and make progress.  Thankfully I feel we are doing that.</p></speech>

Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others in order to reduce the risks of contracting Covid-19.  All of the members who are participating will participate in this meeting remotely and from within the Leinster House complex.  The only people in the committee room are myself and the secretariat staff.  I hope that everybody is keeping well and safe.  Members are required to participate remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  No apologies have been received today as of yet.</p> <p>  This meeting will consider the role, functions and operations of the Companies Registration Office.  Earlier this year the joint committee wrote to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to seek its reaction to the reports that there were indications of a lack of bona fides in terms of many companies being registered in the State.  These reports raised questions about the role of the Companies Registration Office.  The Department responded to the committee's inquiry and recently provided an up to date development on the Companies Registration Office.  The Companies Registration Office implemented a new approach to assessing risks in this regard on which we would like more clarity.  More generally, the Department pointed to the broader provisions and reforms in the area of company legislation.</p> <p>  To provide further insight into these and other issues that relate to the Companies Registration Office I am pleased to welcome Mr. John Newham, Assistant Secretary, and Mr. John Shine, principal officer, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I also welcome Mr. David McFadden, legal adviser, Companies Registration Office.  The Secretary General has written to the committee to point out that the Registrar of Companies is unable to attend today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  The witnesses have already been advised that they may think it is appropriate to take legal advice on this.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been circulated to all members.  To commence consideration of our matter today, I invite Mr. Newham to make his opening remarks on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Shine, Head of the company registration and regulation policy unit in the Department.  Bearing in mind that the topic of this discussion is the role, functions and operations of the CRO, I would expect the discussion to touch on matters beyond my area of expertise that can best be answered by the CRO directly.  Unfortunately, the Registrar of Companies cannot attend today so we will try to contribute as best we can.  Thankfully, Mr. David McFadden, legal adviser to the CRO is also present to assist.<br/><br/>At the outset it might be helpful to briefly set out some background information on the work being undertaken by the Department to modernise and enhance the wider corporate law regime in Ireland as it pertains across a number of different areas.  Of particular relevance at this point is the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill, which is currently finalising its passage through the Seanad.  As Members are aware, this legislation is a milestone in the area of corporate enforcement and will transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, into a statutory and independent agency with additional resources to investigate and prosecute breaches of the Companies Act.  The Bill also contains provisions that require directors to provide personal public service numbers, PPSNs, to the CRO at the time of incorporation of a company, in the annual returns, and if details concerning a director or secretary change.  This is a significant support to the CRO in verifying the authenticity of directors.<br/><br/>Another key element of the Department's reform agenda is the development of legislation in terms of co-operatives.  The Department is close to finalising the general scheme of a co-operative societies Bill, which sets out proposals for the most far-reaching reform of the legislation in almost 130 years.  The legislation will allow co-operatives to operate under a modern, fit-for-purpose legal framework, and provide an attractive alternative to the company model for those entities who subscribe to the co-operative ethos.<br/><br/>A further important legislative reform initiative relates to limited partnerships.  Work on the preparation of the general scheme of a new limited partnership Bill is being extended to consider issues arising from the recent publication of material relating to the Pandora Papers.<br/><br/>I will now turn to matters that specifically relate to the CRO.  The office is a statutory office under the remit of the Department and the Registrar of Companies is administratively independent in the exercise of its functions.  The CRO maintains a central repository of public information, required under statute, on Irish companies and business names.  The main function of the CRO is to maintain the register of companies.  This involves the incorporation of companies; the registration of company post-incorporation documentation; the enforcement, prosecution and striking-off of companies from the register of companies; and the provision of information to the public.<br/><br/>These registers exist to provide transparency on key aspects of entities throughout their lifecycle. They are examined by a wide range of stakeholders, including those who have a commercial interest such as potential investors, professional advisers, financial institutions and suppliers.  Other interested stakeholders include civil litigants and regulatory or enforcement authorities.<br/><br/>I wish to make an important point.  The register records the details of companies and, in itself, is an exercise in transparency so that stakeholders can inform themselves, to a certain extent, of the status of a company before they undertake dealings with it.  Other requirements under Irish law provide additional assurance.  For example, in the context of anti-money laundering requirements, all new companies are legally obliged to register beneficial ownership details within five months of registration.  Companies that have not registered with the Register of Beneficial Ownership, RBO, are liable to enforcement action.  Such companies will also be unable to open bank accounts in the State as financial institutions are obliged, under the Criminal Justice Act, to consult the RBO as part of their due diligence when onboarding a new customer.<br/><br/>Company law is primarily concerned with providing the legislative framework for the structure and operation of companies incorporated in Ireland.  At the end of 2020, there were over 250,000 companies on the Register of Companies and 600,000 business names on the Register of Business Names.  This resulted in over 431,000 filings being made to the CRO last year.  In the region of 90% of filings are made online.  So far in 2021, there has been over 525,000 filings with the CRO<b><i>. </i></b>Bearing in mind such numbers, it is no surprise that the long-standing policy in terms of company incorporation has been for the CRO to accept the bona fides<i></i>of those filing documentation and process applications received so that the register is updated in a timely manner and made available to stakeholders.  However, completeness checks are undertaken to ensure that all necessary documents have been provided, and have been appropriately completed and signed.  This is in a context where the provision of false information to the CRO is a criminal offence under the Companies Act 2014 and subject to prosecution by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p><p>The CRO is keen to ensure that appropriate and proportionate checks are conducted and has developed a risk-based integrity checking process for applications for incorporation and notifications of appointment of directors.  The CRO actively follows up on issues arising and makes referrals, where appropriate, to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Department wrote to the Chairman of this committee on 22 November updating him on these matters.  Arising from the issues identified so far by the CRO and addressing those that came to light elsewhere, as of last month the CRO had made eight referrals to the Director of Corporate Enforcement with further referrals being prepared.  In total this covered some 39 companies already on the register and a further 47 cases where incorporation had been refused by the CRO<b><i>.  </i></b>I ask the Chair to note that the figures contained in the original draft of the statement submitted to the committee have been updated.  The committee will understand that we cannot go into any great detail concerning particular cases.<br/><br/>Ireland has a reputation for being a well-regulated and business-friendly country to establish and operate businesses, and the Department is keen to ensure that this is maintained and even enhanced.  Corporate law is kept under review on an ongoing basis and is updated and modernised as required, as evidenced by the legislative initiatives I have mentioned.  This is in a context where we seek to maintain an appropriate balance where business can set up and operate without unnecessary or costly burdens but within an effective, proportionate and robust regulatory framework.  This is particularly important in an Irish context where around 95% of entries on the companies register are classified as SMEs.  While we would want to ensure a straightforward process, the register must have high levels of integrity.  It is not in the interests of our companies that the system be undermined in any way.  On the specific issue of the abuse of the companies register, both the Department and the CRO take such matters very seriously, are keeping matters under review and will carefully consider further legislative and administrative change to ensure the appropriate regulatory balance.  I thank members for their attention.  I am happy to take any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  The first relates to the reform in the shape of the legislation on worker co-operatives.  I have a question about why it has taken so long.  The reason I am asking this is because we know that right across Europe, the co-operative model has been found not only to be productive, but to be competitive and highly resilient, which I think is extremely important.  Countries such as Scotland, France, Italy and Spain have demonstrated this.  We know that worker co-operatives are very good at keeping community-generated wealth local.  We know that they are good for local business and local jobs.  We know that they build really strong, resilient local enterprises.  We also know that they are very resistant and resilient in terms of bouncing back post the recession.  A study from the Democracy at Work Institute found that worker co-operatives in the US survived through their first six to ten years at a rate that is 7% higher than traditional small businesses.  Therefore, all of the evidence is that these are good things and we should be moving quickly on them.  I must ask the witnesses why this legislation is taking so long.  What is the delay?  The reforms are very much needed, but we should be prioritising that.</p></speech>

I might refer to my colleague, Mr. Shine, shortly, because he is dealing with that piece of legislation.  I do not disagree with any of the points the Deputy has raised on the model.  Frankly, it is a goal for us to place a co-operative model on a similar basis, in terms of the attention it is given, as companies, for all the reasons set out by the Deputy.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that it is a big piece of legislation.  It is going to be quite considerable.  We are nearly there with the general scheme.  I hope to go to Government at some point in February 2022 with a general scheme with a view to going through pre-legislative scrutiny with the committee.  On the content of the legislation, without giving too much away at this stage because we have not proposed it to our Minister, we will perhaps touch on some of the items that the Deputy might expect to see in the general scheme of the legislation.  I refer to my colleague, Mr. Shine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Shine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#B00500"><p>As Mr. Newham has said, it is a very complex piece of legislation.  It is seeking to update some legislation which dates back to the 1890s and a whole series of amendments that have been made since then.  It is a very fragmented legislative space.  Work has been going on intensively in this area for over two years and we are very close to having a general scheme finalised, which will update and modernise the legislative provisions and introduce a whole range of modernisation initiatives.  In some areas what we are proposing to do is to cross-reference provisions with the Companies Act, being mindful of the fact that co-operatives are very different in ways to companies.  There is a lot of good stuff in the Companies Act and we certainly do not want to reinvent the wheel.  There is a certain amount of cross-application that is intended and that requires very careful consideration of the Companies Act to ensure that that cross-application is appropriate.  In other areas, we are basing provisions on the Companies Act but making amendments to reflect the specifics of co-operatives.  We are also introducing some new provisions.</p> <p>  We are looking at a whole range of initiatives in relation to corporate governance, directors' duties, shares and audit exemptions.  I know that that is something, in particular, that has been raised in the past.  It is certainly something that we are intending to provide.  In short, a lot of work has gone in, but it is a very complex piece of legislation.  Even allowing for the cross-application with the Companies Act, we are looking at in the region of around 300 heads.  We are quite close to having it finalised.  As Mr. Newham said, the intention is to bring that general scheme to Government as early as possible in 2022.</p></speech>

I sincerely hope that when we see it, it does not fall into the trap of trying to make co-operatives companies, because they are not.  While issues relating to responsibility and governance are important, co-operatives are not the same as companies.  We will be resisting any move to try and make them all the same.  We need to recognise and celebrate their difference.</p><p>In the Department's submission, it is mentioned that Ireland has a reputation for being a &quot;well-regulated and business-friendly place to establish and operate businesses and the Department is keen to ensure that this is maintained and even enhanced&quot;.  In a recent interview conducted by Aaron Rogan in <i>The Business Post</i>, William Fitzgerald, who used to work for Google's policy unit, said that all they needed to do was drop one sentence into <i>The Financial Times</i>that Ireland was not a good place to do business, and that would &quot;put the fear of God into the Fine Gael press room&quot;.  I think it is quite a sad state of affairs to hear that.  In the witnesses' own experience in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, would an accusation that Ireland is not a friendly place to do business cause the kind of chaos that was reported in the <i>The Business Post</i>?</p></speech>

Some are important stakeholders and employers and we take any comments seriously but there is always a balance to be struck and that is what we are trying to achieve.  The short answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; in my experience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#C00300"><p>That is good to know.  I want to briefly touch on the area of bogus and fake companies.  Mr. Newham will be aware that my colleague, the Chair of the committee, an Teachta Quinlivan, has written to the Department about the CRO&rsquo;s response to this.  It is an area that I know the Chair has done quite an amount of work on.  I ask Mr. Newham to outline what the Department has done since reports by the <i>Irish Independent </i>and other media have stated that legitimate businesses like the HSE unit have had their addresses used to set up these fake and bogus firms.  These firms can be used to perpetuate a huge amount of fraud around the world.  They might have an address here but, as we know, the fraud they are engaged in does not recognise any borders.  We are talking about victims that could potentially be scammed out of millions of euro.  I would like an update from the Department on the work the CRO is doing on this.</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right that such activity knows no borders.  Once a company is incorporated, by its nature it is no longer bogus but I take the point the Deputy is making.  Having the use of those bogus companies, especially in an international context, is the matter we are most concerned about.  We are not so concerned about the activity taking place within Ireland or the EU because there are systemic protections in place, not just in company law but in other legislation, and we have mentioned those in the submission.  Bloom House was used as an address and we have pointed out that the building is complex as there is a firm of solicitors and there are residential addresses within Bloom House as well.  Having said all that, those checks have been increased to ensure that Bloom House and other notable addresses will not be used in future.  My colleague, Dr. McFadden, will set out the levels of checks that are in place and the programme of activities under way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David McFadden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#C00500"><p>It has been interesting dealing with these queries in recent months.  We have noticed an uptick in activities that have been a cause for concern and we have reacted by putting together an integrity checking group within the office.  That has involved bringing together staff from across the office who are involved in different aspects of the work the CRO does.  This includes staff who are experienced in company incorporation, the issuing of certificates and the checking of when a company has been set up, together with staff who are involved in enforcement of various aspects of filing for companies, with me as legal adviser.  A group has been put together and we are daily carrying out checks on aspects of what we have seen occur.  As mentioned, there has been a noticeable uptick.  It might not have been as big an uptick as might have been seen at first but a problem has been noticed.</p> <p>  We looked at some of the cases that were highlighted.  Having delved into those cases, we spotted certain markers which pointed us towards certain types of activity that could be ongoing.  I will be careful about the information I give on what we are doing but the markers we have spotted indicated certain types of activity.  We used that information, moved out from that and we noticed problems in a number of areas.  For example, there had been an attempt to set up a number of companies which we put on hold before those companies got incorporated.  Using the information we had garnered we were able to check, for example, that certain information that had been presented to us may not have been accurate and correct.  For example, the directors needed to be resident and we discovered those points the Deputy mentioned about the addresses being provided.</p> <p>  Unfortunately we also discovered that a number of companies had already been formed where certain questionable issues had arisen.  For example, once a company has been incorporated and a certificate of incorporation has been issued, that is conclusive evidence in law and it cannot be challenged that all that should have been done was done and that company is now a separate legal person.  Once that company is set up, if we now discover issues after the event, such as people&rsquo;s identities being used as directors when they did not give consent, we have taken steps proactively to address those problems.  We have contacted the individuals concerned and received evidence from them confirming that they did not give their prior consent to act as directors for these companies.  In those circumstances we have been able to remove those directors from the companies in question.  That has meant that in certain circumstances these companies have no longer had the required one director resident within the European Economic Area and that has allowed us to take the next step of striking them off and removing them from the register.  We have also referred files to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p> <p>  The evidence we are seeing is evidence of serious crimes.  The registrar has some enforcement function in a limited number of areas, including District Court prosecutions for filing type offences.  There are also serious offences which involve, for example, giving misinformation to the registrar, which amounts to impersonation and using people&rsquo;s identities.  These are serious offences that are indictable under the Act and they are enforceable by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the ODCE, or both.  The ODCE has a Garda unit and it is appropriate that we send those files to it.  In his opening remarks Mr. Newman mentioned that we had sent eight separate pieces of correspondence to the ODCE and there is more in the pipeline.  We have been taking proactive steps to address the problems that have been raised.  It is possible that there may have been issues in the past but we are certain that there has recently been a slight uptick in this.  We have reacted quickly and put together a team that is working on this on a daily basis.</p></speech>

Some 95% of the companies that are registering are SMEs so it is a delicate tipping point to ensure integrity and not create more red tape, which nobody wants but which SMEs especially do not want.  SMEs do not have the resources or expertise to wade through such administrative burdens.  It takes too long and they do not have the resources.  It is also troubling that there seems to be no verification of basic details such as directors&rsquo; addresses.  It is welcome that the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill 2021 will require directors to provide PPSNs.  Can the witnesses advise how the PPSNs will be verified?  Will there be some sort of automatic check with a different Department or will company addresses continue to be accepted on a good faith basis?</p></speech>

It is not that the CRO will hold those PPSNs and put them out there.  It will check that the individual directors have the PPSNs they provide.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David McFadden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#D00200"><p>I cannot really add much more than what has been said.  Mr. Newham was correct in saying we must be very careful in the use of PPS numbers for general data protection regulation, GDPR, purposes.  Also it would defeat the purpose if we were to retain those numbers and make them in some way available.  It would make name personation so much easier.  It is proposed that at the point where information is being uploaded onto the system, a person's PPS number would be submitted and verified via a portal through the Department of Social Protection.  We would get the all-clear that that person&rsquo;s details match or a flag will be raised at which point a query may have to be addressed.  It is certainly not in anyone&rsquo;s interest that we would be in a position where we would be holding that information and making it public.  That would be counterproductive.  I do not know if there is much more I can add to that.  It will certainly be a positive addition to ensuring integrity of information and, hopefully, avoiding some of the conduct I described to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly where people&rsquo;s identity had been personated.  If people's PPS numbers are being used to verify their identity in first instance, it will help to greatly reduce the personation we have noticed in recent times.</p></speech>

I note it was pointed out in the opening statement that it is a criminal offence to provide false information to the CRO.  Obviously, as with any law, that is only a deterrent when it is being enforced.  I appreciate the CRO has made a number of referrals to the Director of Corporate Enforcement in recent months since this issue gained attention.  Can one of the witnesses clarify the number of referrals that were made prior to the recent period?  It would be helpful to have clarify on the number of referrals that were made in 2019 and 2020.</p></speech>

It is safe to say our referral of cases involving the potential provision of false information to the registrar is a new development in our office and a recent one.  I am almost seven years in the office and I am not aware of any referrals having been made in my time or in the period prior to that.  I am not aware such cases have been referred to any parties for a number of years.  However, certainly, in recent times, as of this year, we have made referrals where have seen evidence of this.  We cannot investigate if we do not have those powers nor can we enforce.  Because it is a serious offence it is dealt with by the Garda or the ODCE or both.  We have been making those referrals this year and it is a recent development.</p></speech>

I am not aware they were made in the years immediately prior to my joining the office.  It is something we have been doing recently under the Act.  When we were examining the problems brought to our attention related to the establishment of companies where there was abuse of directors&rsquo; identities or addresses have been questionable, we started looking at how this might be addressed, what offences might have been committed and among those, one of the serious ones is the provision of false information to the Registrar of Companies.  Under that heading, there are two potential offences in respect of which we have made referrals to the ODCE.</p></speech>

It is not unusual for multiple companies to be registered at a single address.  It is not unusual for business activity to be registered at a residential address.  What is unusual, and this is what the reports have brought to light, is for multiple companies to be registered at a residential address.  That is what is novel in these circumstances and what has prompted the investigations by the CRO and the onward referrals to the ODCE.</p></speech>

I will not take too long.</p> <p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the presentation.  This time two years ago we were getting emails from people who were concerned about the upgrade of the Department's new software.  It had caused a certain number of glitches at the time.  I wanted to give the witnesses some positive feedback.  As they were coming before the committee today, I make inquiries of some people who had complained at that time and the feedback I got was extremely positive.  Well done, everybody on the work that has been done.  Those people have said the system is highly efficient and they are very pleased with it.  It is important to give positive feedback where it is warranted.</p> <p>  An issue raised with me was the requirement to have an audit in year two and year three for small microbusinesses that have missed a filing deadline.  I have been advised it is very onerous on those companies.  It has been suggested that an increase in the filing period for those years would be more appropriate because often micro-companies are the main sufferers.  One of the witnesses might comment on that.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that quite a number of stakeholders carry out searches to get information on companies that want to be business with them.  Could one of the witnesses indicate the number of such many searches that are carried out?  I know a fee is charged for them.  What was the income derived from those in the past year?</p> <p>  I am quite interested in the co-operative societies Bill .  I would like it to be advanced and I agree that it is long overdue.</p> <p>  Mr. Newham mentioned companies that are not registered with the Register of Beneficial Ownership are liable to enforcement action.  Could he comment further on that?  How many such actions have taken place in the last period?  That is linked with money laundering, about which I would be interested in learning.</p> <p>  It may not be directly linked with the CRO but I note the casual and occasional trading licence legislation was to be updated in 2018.  That was put off time and again and there is still no sign of it.  It affects microbusinesses.  Mr. Newham may not have that information to hand today and he might come back to us on that and let us know what is happening on that.  I note in 2018 and 2019 I had some information indicating it would be updated but nothing has happened.</p> <p>  I am very pleased Ireland has a reputation for being a well regulated and business-friendly country in which to establish and operate a business.  I advise my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, that the Fine Gael press office works very hard to ensure that we have a good reputation abroad.  I detect some disappointment on her part that we have a good reputation abroad.  We want to work to ensure we maintain that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#D01200"><p>I thank the Deputy for that feedback.  He has made us blush.  The system improvements have worked well.  I can advise that, as late as last week with the extended filing date, no problems were reported and people where in a waiting queue for only a few minutes.  Thankfully, that is working well.</p> <p>  In terms of the audit exemption for micro-companies, the Deputy is right.  We are aware companies, particularly micro-companies, may have missed a filing deadline perhaps through no fault of their own, and I have some sympathy for them.  One reason for the recent extension of the filing date was to recognise staff in some small accountancy firms were suffering from ill health and were not able to physically complete the work involved to make their client&rsquo;s filings.  However, it is the company that pays the price in such circumstances.  The legislation is not nuanced to deal with exceptional circumstances but the balance must be kept and we spoke of the bogus companies earlier.</p><p>If they missed their filing deadlines, we would like to see details of those audits because those would be micro companies as well.  It is something we are bearing in mind as part of the ongoing review of company law.</p><p> I will refer to my colleague with regard to searches and fees as I do not have that information to hand.  He might not have it to hand either so we can refer back to the committee.</p><p> I will refer back to the committee regarding the casual trading.  I will have to search my mind a little.  The Deputy will be aware that on the consumer side of my division we are dealing with the competition Bill and the consumer Bill as well as other legislation.  They had to be prioritised ahead of the others.  I will respond more formally to the Deputy on that.  Deputy O'Reilly asked earlier why the co-operatives legislation is taking so long.  I did not want to use this, but we have had three legislative measures in about 18 months in the company law area as a result of Covid, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, and whatnot.  That tends to displace resources at any moment in time.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. McFadden who might be able to comment on the searches and fees.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David McFadden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#E00200"><p>With regard to the searches, the Deputy might be surprised to hear that the volume of hits or searches on our systems is vast.  We get millions of hits.  There are some companies that have a system set up where they scrape our information many millions of time a day to constantly update.  The reason is that if a company is involved in a major corporate transaction, it must constantly update its information during the day when a transaction is about to happen, for example, whether a director is still there or whether something has happened to filings relating to a company.  Parties that are interested in ensuring they have up-to-date information relating to other companies constantly look for that updated information.  One finds that some lending institutions and due diligence companies hit our systems constantly.  Other companies have licence agreements with us whereby they buy the data in bulk from us, both in information and images, and they get an uploaded dump of information from us daily.  They in turn sell it on, repackaged and sliced, in a package that is of use to those persons to whom they sell information for various reasons, be it legal or lending institutions or people interested in making investments in companies who need up-to-date information.  The volume of searches on our systems is absolutely vast.</p> <p>  I am not sure if that answers the question specifically, but it would be very difficult to give accurate numbers.  They are huge.  I have heard it said that ours is the second most busy website or system in the State after the Revenue Commissioners.  That may not be the case but the volume of traffic on our systems is absolutely huge.</p> <p>  With regard to fees, I am not sure I understood the question.  I was trying to write down the information relating to the searches.  However, the fees are set in the fees order.  There are various fees orders.  They are set in legislation and are set at a rate that simply covers the cost.  We cannot be seen to make a profit from searches that are made on the system.  Does that address the question?  I am not entirely sure I got it right.</p></speech>

It shone a light on what is happening in the corporate world when he said there were vast numbers of searches happening.  Dr. McFadden can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that there are fees for searches and I am just curious about the income that is generated.  He said there is no profit and they just cover the cost, which is fair enough.  However, he also said, if I understood him correctly, that there are companies that get packages of information and then sell it on, presumably at a profit for them.  We know that data is the new gold or oil, and this is proof of that again.  The data the CRO has is extremely valuable to many companies.  It is interesting, and Dr. McFadden has answered my question.</p> <p>  I have a final question for either or both of the witnesses.   They mentioned the number of companies that have filed and registered with the office.  Can they say whether there has been a reduction or an increase in the number of companies year on year and how many companies have failed and deregistered because of that?</p></speech>

Over the pandemic in the last year and a half we suspended discretionary strike-off of companies, which was a major part of our enforcement function.  When the registrar decided to give extensions to allow companies to file, that was part of an overall package to ensure that companies had an opportunity to try to comply in very difficult circumstances.  That included not only giving additional time to file but also suspending discretionary enforcement activity.  Where companies had fallen into difficulties in the past they went into a strike-off regime whereby they went through a process which ultimately leads to them being struck off the register.  That was all placed on hold during the height of the pandemic, so the number of companies being struck off fell away very dramatically.  There may well be an uptick in due course with regard to liquidations and so forth, but that will wash through in time.

Like other members of the committee, I welcome the efforts of the office over the past two difficult years.  I note the reforms of the ODCE and the separate resourcing, which is a positive arrangement, and the announcement that the co-operatives Bill will come forward in the new year, which is also helpful.  The witnesses might expand briefly on the further limited partnership work they referred to in terms of the Pandora Papers.  I would have thought this was a very small number of companies.  I have a sensitivity to the SME sector at times.  The misdeeds of a very small and elite number tend to colour the sector publicly and I wonder about the direction the office is taking on that.  In addition, the witnesses said that 95% of companies registered with the office are SMEs.  Do they have a breakdown of what percentage of those the office classes as micro or small SMEs employing fewer than five people?</p> <p>  It is a pity the registrar is unable to attend today, but perhaps somebody can take up these questions.  One relates to the inflexibility of the year-end date for companies.  I have lobbied the Minister continuoally on this.  We have seen it extended at the last minute in recent weeks but accountants were working around the clock trying to get information, particularly during the Covid pandemic, and complete inflexibility was demonstrated by the registrar.  There is too much emphasis on compliance at times and inflexibility to small businesses.  Deputy Stanton mentioned this.  I was a small business owner some years ago.  My paperwork did not get into the CRO because of the breakdown of a courier and I incurred two years of auditing fees for a very small business.  That is most unhelpful and unwelcome.  There was no ability, other than to go to the courts, to seek an appeal on that.  That is still the case and it must be examined and addressed.  Some of the measures the registrar has implemented are punitive, particularly for the small business sector.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the new identity requirements.  What exercises is the office planning in terms of not making that too onerous for people who are trying to start small, not large, businesses?  My final question relates to defence against cyberattack.  The witnesses spoke about the amount of information the office has on its site and the amount of activity coming from abroad where people are evaluating it.  How is the office protecting the data it has there?  Similar to the banks, if there was a cyberattack within the office, that could damage many businesses.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses would deal with those issues.</p></speech>

To deal with flexibility, I touched on this matter earlier.  We take the point regarding flexibility in respect of filing dates.  I am not sure, but I think the CRO showed considerable flexibility throughout the Covid-19 pandemic regarding extending the filing dates.  The most recent issue was that we were hearing mixed messages from stakeholders.  While accountants, on one hand, did not want an express system and did not want the filing date extended generally, they did want the CRO to deal with problems on a case-by-case basis.  For example, where a small firm was undergoing difficulties due to the health of staff, it was desired that the CRO would take that into account and perhaps just extend deadlines for the group of files being dealt with by that specific firm.  The legislation, however, does not provide for that type of flexibility.  That is why it had to be a case of extending the filing date for everybody or for nobody.  That was the context of what was going on.  The CRO undertook consultations with stakeholders and that is what resulted in the extension.</p> <p>  Turning to the details, I take the point made about not introducing overly burdensome requirements regarding the additional details required.  I suspect that much of the additionality requirement can be achieved through system checking, rather than by requiring additional details to be provided by companies.  The PPSNs will take care of much of that, so we will very much bear that aspect in mind.  I will hand over to Dr. McFadden to deal with the question concerning GDPR protections, etc.</p></speech>

We are all very cognisant of this issue, to say the least.  We spent the last several years upgrading our systems.  We have introduced a whole new platform on which companies' information is present.  It is an issue that we are mindful of.  It must be borne in mind, of course, that most of the information we have is intended for public use anyway.  The idea is that people dealing with companies, be they consumers, other businesses, such as lending institutions, lawyers, accountants and people doing due diligence, need to have this information on the companies and those involved in running the companies.  Therefore, the data we have is almost entirely information that is available to the public in any event.</p> <p>  This is, however, a valid point.  We have had to take great care to ensure that a cyberattack would not take our systems down or take them out, because that would have a detrimental effect on business.  We have backup systems whereby at the end of each day our systems are backed up.  There is also a fallback system up and running, where we can go back to the information we had as of the previous day.  That contingency would not mean that we would not be affected by a cyberattack, but it would ensure that we have backup systems in place.  We must also take great care when planning the future use of PPSN numbers.  That is a little bit ahead, but a great deal of planning is required to ensure we are taking great care to ascertain that the information is protected.  It will be done through a system that will involve the Department of Social Protection, but we are cognisant of the inherent dangers if that information were not protected.</p> <p>  Therefore, I am not going to say that everything is absolutely guaranteed in this respect, but we are very cognisant that we must take great care to ensure that our systems can withstand attacks, that we have backups if they are attacked and that we try to do what we can to ensure the security of the information.  Regarding the query about the specifics concerning PPSNs, that information will be given to us at a future point.  I am not sure if I have answered the question.</p></speech>

Returning to the point made about the legislation not allowing for individual flexibility on the extension of deadlines, is there some provision in the legislation to allow for an appeal in respect of additional fines and penalties, and an extension in that regard, without having to go back to draft new legislation?  This is a problem for small businesses and it is a continuing problem.  To me and many others in the SME space, it seems that small businesses are the organisations that really lose out in respect of the missing deadlines.</p></speech>

We take the point, however, and this issue was raised by colleagues earlier, that this binary approach of it being a case of everything or nothing may require nuancing and we will be looking at that aspect.  I am conscious, because my colleagues told me, that I did not answer the question about the Pandora papers.  Perhaps we can address it later, if there is time.  I just wanted to flag that point.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that small community employment schemes, given the size and the nature of these organisations, were not heretofore required to provide full and audited accounts.  My information has come from a community employment scheme in my constituency of Mayo.  The witnesses will be aware that such schemes are funded through Intreo and the Department of Social Protection.  They have no other sources of income.  The organisation in question has been contacted by the CRO, which stated that it is necessary for the scheme to provide full and audited accounts.  This is the first time, however, that the organisation has been asked for such information.</p> <p>  The letter from the CRO refers to circular 13/2014 from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The circular itself, however, states in a footnote "that small community and voluntary groups will only have basic financial statements and receipts available as a basis for reporting".  I am sure the witnesses can appreciate the administrative and financial burdens borne by community employment schemes in this context.  The concern is that this reporting requirement will force some of these schemes to close.  Therefore, I would appreciate it if the witnesses could bring clarity to this matter regarding the reporting obligations of these community employment schemes.  It goes without saying, of course, that there must be full accountability where public money is allocated.  Having said that, is there any flexibility possible in this regard concerning the reporting requirements to be followed by community employment schemes?</p></speech>

I congratulate the Department.  The overhaul of company law, the corporate enforcement regime and the small company rescue process has involved a significant body of legislation.  It will improve levels of compliance and the ease with which the registration and enforcement system is navigated by companies.</p><p>It is important to stress that limited liability, which this confers, is an important privilege.  It is very important that we have compliance, ease of use and flexibility in the way it is used.  Does the Department track any international indicators of factors such as compliance rates?  Does it have a network through which information on emerging abuses of corporate structures we should be alert to is shared?  On the other side, does the Department track indicators of the cost of establishing small start-ups compared with the cost in other countries or the ease of doing business?  Do we have reasonable indicators?  How do we stand in that respect?  Allied to that, can we expect any significant reforms from either the registrar or the Department that we will need to consider?</p><p> The second topic I would like to raise is the experience of the past two years in respect of new businesses starting up and businesses getting into trouble or difficulties or even being taken off the register.  Does the Department have any indication of what the impact of Covid has been on the starting up and death of companies?  I know there is a bit of an abeyance as a result of the Government supports that are in place but are we likely to see a significant impact on the survival rate of companies when those supports start to be withdrawn?</p></speech>

In terms of international comparators, especially with regard to the ease of doing business, there are different comparators that drill into different details.  I might hand over to my colleague, Mr. Shine, on that matter.  The World Bank and the World Economic Forum carry out international comparisons.  Comparisons are also carried out at EU level.  We score fairly highly in respect of the ease of doing business.  I would have to look into the issue of compliance rates because different countries have different systems.  I would need to look into that further.</p> <p>  The Deputy had a query on the networks.  There are certainly international networks, especially at EU level, related to enforcement and so on.  Even in a national context, different features come into play.  For example, there are cross-departmental groups on money laundering that feed in information.  That may be relevant to the work of this office in respect of corporate enforcement.  There are such networks.</p> <p>  With regard to ongoing reform, high on my agenda is reform of the Limited Partnerships Act 1907, which goes back 100 years.  It is limited.  This may be relevant to Deputy Shanahan's earlier question.  With regard to the Pandora papers, the focus in an Irish context was on the use of limited partnerships.  That is an area of reform we would like to progress.  Things also bubble up in the work of the Company Law Review Group.  Matters arise at that level.  That group reports in to the Department.</p> <p>  On the question regarding the impact on companies, it is still early days.  There is a time lag.  We see insolvencies being notified to the Companies Registration Office but that takes place some time after the impact is felt on the street.  The Department is carrying out analysis in that area through another division, formerly Forf&aacute;s, so there is analysis.  It is fair to say that, as the Deputy has pointed out, the Government supports do appear to have stalled increased closures but we expect to see an increase in the number of insolvencies, especially in the sectors most affected by Covid.  That is one of the reasons the small companies administrative rescue process was progressed over such a short space of time.  That will provide breathing space for small companies in those situations.  The figures so far are lower than might ordinarily be expected.  Does that sufficiently answer the Deputy's questions?</p></speech>

They relate to the Companies Registration Office, CRO, and its referrals to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Did Mr. Newham say there were six such referrals this year or six since the issue was raised publicly?  He might come back with the correct number of referrals.</p> <p>  My main question is on setting up the new corporate enforcement authority.  How do the witnesses see the CRO working with that agency?  What plans does the Department have?  Have there been discussions on that?  Will the Department have somebody located in the authority?  Will there be regular meetings?  How is it anticipated that will work?  Will there just be engagement on a case-by-case basis?  If it is to be on a case-by-case basis, will engagement be initiated by the CRO or by the corporate enforcement authority?  I do not expect the witnesses to know 100% how they will work with the new entity but what is their vision in that regard?  I would appreciate it if Mr. McFadden could come in on that point.</p></speech>

With regard to the referrals, as of today, eight referrals have been made to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  More will be made as time goes on, as Mr. McFadden has pointed out.</p> <p>  On how the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and the CRO will work together, I have just explained how they currently work together.  This will not change radically.  Both organisations are members of the Company Law Review Group, where topics are presented and discussed.  Both organisations raise issues with each other directly where matters are at the interface between organisations.  They also refer matters to ourselves in the Department in respect of issues at a policy level.  For example, if the ODCE felt a particular area of law in respect of enforcement functions was ineffective, it might raise that with ourselves.  We might then refer to the Company Law Review Group or deal with the matter ourselves by amending the legislation.  It is the same case with the CRO.  There are a number of bridges between the organisations and that will continue.  Does that answer the Chairman's question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#G00900"><p>Yes, but I wonder whether there will be a new emphasis or new relationship as it goes forward.  We all support the corporate enforcement authority and the devolvement of new powers to it.  We just want to make sure the issue raised with us during the summer with regard to fake companies is addressed.  I appreciate the work the Department does in this regard, but the number of fake companies is bonkers.  We have seen some of the individual cases.  I obviously do not expect the witnesses to comment on any individual case but can we get some sort of assurance we will be more proactive on this issue in the future?  I still do not understand who will initiate action on an issue.  Will the corporate enforcement authority be waiting for the Department or the CRO to come to it?  How will action be initiated?  Mr. Newham has said eight cases will be done by the end of this year.  Are we just to go on as we are or will there be more co-ordinated integration of the CRO and the new corporate enforcement authority?</p><p>Fake companies can be very disruptive and damaging for consumers and so on, but they are a very small number of the companies operating in Ireland.  It is important that we say that.  The Department does a good job in registering the significant number of companies that it has to do.  We have no problem with that whatsoever.  The concern we have relates to the ones that have slipped through things.  Is there any plan for members of the new CEA and the CRO to sit down and look at that issue?  That is the concern I have.</p></speech>

We provide a bridge between both bodies, which is something that is high on our agenda.  In terms of business as usual, a programme of activities and reforms around planning is under way in the CRO regarding the matters we discussed.  That is a matter for the CRO.  The cases that have been referred to the ODCE are for it to investigate.  Depending on the outcome of those investigations, if tweaks are needed in the CRO's operations, or even the legislation, that would be reported both to the Department and the CRO.  I confirm that there is constant ongoing engagement between the two bodies, but also in a more formalised setting through the Company Law Review Group, CLRG.  Indeed, the Department has liaison meetings on a quarterly basis.  We do not wait for those liaison meetings - we raise issues.  When the CRO raises issues that have an impact on corporate enforcement, we relay that.  Those mechanisms are in place.  To answer the Chairman's fundamental question, no, this cannot be business as usual.  We do not want that.  We want this thing sorted out.</p></speech>

That answers my question.  We will move to round 2.  Deputy Stanton has seven minutes.</p></speech>

I have just done some quick searches on websites and it seems that Ireland is doing well in respect of being a place to do, and start, business and so on.  We are in the top ten or 12 and, in some cases, the top three so well done on that.  We probably need to maintain that and improve on it where we can.</p> <p>  I will ask a question in respect of small micro-companies missing the filing date.  It may have been covered already, but is there any possibility of an amnesty for such companies?  It has been acknowledged that a lot of hardship has been caused by companies having to be audited twice in the coming years.  Will the officials give us an idea of the extent of that?  How many companies have now missed the filing date, particularly small companies?  This is just to give us an idea of what it is like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021121500002#H00500"><p>The numbers are very low.  Certainly, there have been more filings this year than previous years.  I will have to get back to the Deputy with the actual data on small companies.  We will have to look at that data.  We will come back through the Chairman on that.</p> <p>  On the point regarding an amnesty, we cannot deal with every situation.  We are mindful, and Covid has reminded us of this, that there can be situations where the company has done everything it could, but did not meet the requirements through no fault of its own.  Perhaps its accountant was not able to file, for whatever reason.  We know that the company then has to pay for that.  In larger accountancy firms, accountants may say to the company "we will look after the audit for the next two years, sorry about that and we will deal with it", but not all accountancy firms offer an auditing function.  We are mindful of it.  That is something we will try to tease out and reflect upon in the context of future reforms.  Dr. McFadden will address the issue of additional times.</p></speech>

We are absolutely mindful.  We obviously have to follow what the statute states and carry out our function in that context.  Recently, additional time has been provided in law for companies to file.  Once year end comes at 31 December, for example, companies normally get nine months to commit a file, plus 28 days.  That has now been extended to 56 days.  In effect, if a company's year ends on 31 December, it has until the following late November, or almost 11 months, in which to file.  The system has been simplified in that what was a somewhat cumbersome two-step process - filing a return and sending in a signature page subsequently to complete it - is now all done in one stage and uploaded onto a system.  That additional time is given.</p> <p>  I am not suggesting that it solves the problems, but it was introduced to try to simplify the system to make it a bit more straightforward for accountants when dealing with smaller companies, in particular, in order that they do not have to go back and forward as much.  They are able to address the matter, take those actions in one step and have additional time compared with what was there previously.  Some mitigations have already been introduced in law, which have helped, or should begin to be seen to be helping, over the coming time.</p></speech>

I will refer to a newspaper article that referenced companies that have been in receipt of pandemic subsidies and have subsequently paid out dividends.  One company in particular - it is named in the article so I will name it here - O'Flaherty Holdings, which made operating profits of &euro;10 million in 2020 through MML Holdings, paid the dividend to a company registered in the Isle of Man.  This was the exact same amount, coincidentally, the company states, as the subsidies that it was paid.  It appears that this is only a breach of the spirit of the intention of the scheme and not an actual breach.  Although the Minister may have indicated initially that he believed it might be a breach, when he checked it apparently was not.</p> <p>  Do the officials have a view on companies that are doing this?  By all accounts, I am pretty sure that the company referenced is not alone in doing this.  If the State is paying subsidies, do the witnesses have a view on what the company's obligation should be?  In this specific case, the amount of the pandemic subsidy directly matches the amount paid in dividends to a holding company in the Isle of Man, which to me is a clear breach, certainly of the spirit of the scheme.  It is regrettable if it is not a breach of the law.  Do the officials have a view on that practice?</p></speech>

It would be useful.</p></speech>

Forgive me, but I have not read that article.  I will need to look into it.  I may have a view, but I would be reaching at this point.  If it is okay with the Deputy, we will put that on our list of items to come back to the committee on.  I take it the Deputy is referring to the generality of the issue.</p></speech>

I am sure he well remembers Celtic tiger times when a large number of companies, especially in the services and construction sectors, were falling over, were reimagined and were back in business within a week or two.</p><p> We are in similar circumstances with booming construction, albeit restricted at present.  There is no doubt that there is a construction boom, and I want to ask about guarding against what happened in the past.  How can people who were previously directors of companies come back into new companies following bankruptcy or a very quick liquidation?  I ask the witnesses to address that.</p><p> I refer to the reference to the amount of data held on individuals and company directors.  There is a significant amount of expertise across the SME sector, in particular at director level and among owners and proprietors.  Would the witnesses give any thought to inviting directors, if they wish, to list their expertise and ensure it is available online?  People can list such information on LinkedIn, etc.  Where people are prepared to engage, they could use the portal to try to drill down and find specific expertise small businesses might be looking for and which may be on offer to them.</p></speech>

The database references a lot of people with a lot of knowledge.  I understand the point that it would be useful to exploit that in terms of a wider benefit.  I would need to consider that carefully.  The register is in place for a specific purpose under the Companies Act and it might be appropriate for those with that expertise, where they so wish, to offer their expertise in other areas to use another system or feature.  I understand the point the Deputy has made.</p> <p>  On the broader question on liquidation and whatnot, the balance in the formation and reformation of different companies is always at play and of concern.  Each company has a distinct legal personality, but there are obligations under the Companies Act especially when a company closes in an insolvency situation in terms of its duties to creditors, including employees.  The CLRG is due to submit a report shortly on companies in insolvency situations where, prior to the insolvency, they have sold on their assets.  This issue was noteworthy last year following the closure of a number of notable retailers.  We await that report.  I know it is not quite what the Deputy referred to; it is a broader issue.  All we can say is that we constantly keep that balance under review.</p></speech>

If he or she comes to an agreement in the SCARP process, the various forms and whatnot will be lodged with the CRO as they would be in the case of examinership.  It is where an agreement is not reached that the courts might become involved.  In terms of the outcome of that, if the company becomes insolvent the various forms would be lodged with the CRO.  The CRO is more of a repository of the information and about the outcome rather than the process itself.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Hugo Sobral, head of cabinet of the Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Ms Elisa Ferreira, to today's engagement concerning EU cohesion policy and Ireland.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise to engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.  Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams prior to making his or her contribution to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Sobral to make his opening statement.  He has the floor.</p></speech>

First, I offer my apologies on behalf of Commissioner Ferreira.  Personal health-related issues have prevented her from being here today.  The Commissioner asked me to stress, however, that she recognises the importance of the committee's work, and she is keen that we contribute to these discussions.  Ms Ferreira is eager to meet the members in person and to travel to Ireland as soon as the conditions allow it.  I thank the members for permitting me to speak in her place.</p><p>It is always a pleasure to discuss cohesion policy with Ireland.  We have a long history of working together for the common European good.  Ireland is a success case of cohesion policy and has converged greatly with Europe since its accession but, as with every other country, it also addresses the challenges of internal disparities and that is why we are here to support and help.  This discussion is very timely as we are at the beginning of a new chapter of our history together, one which has opened this year with a new financial period and also with historical decisions which were taken last year as a reaction to the pandemic.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware the European Union has been a project of solidarity between countries and peoples and cohesion policy has been a concrete expression of that solidarity, from which we all stand to gain.  Solidarity also rhymes with self interest because in a union we are all better if everyone is better.<br/><br/>Today I would like to address two key expressions of European solidarity with the people of Ireland which are rooted in cohesion policy.  First, there is the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.  This is European solidarity in action with those suffering the economic and social fallout of Brexit.  As the committee is aware the European Union did not choose or ask for Brexit but we have to deal with its consequences and the Brexit Adjustment Reserve is a sign of solidarity with those most impacted by Brexit.  Since Ireland was precisely the member state most impacted, Ireland will get the most support of &euro;1.16 billion, which is a little more than 20% of the overall reserve.<br/><br/>A particular consideration should be given for the fishing industry in the use of this reserve, but member states have some flexibility and discretion in investing these funds in the sectors and regions that have been most affected.  Ireland will also be the first member state to receive prepayments under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.  Some &euro;361 million will be disbursed before Christmas corresponding to the 2021 tranche and these funds will be disbursed in three tranches.  We and our services are here to help Ireland with any and all practicalities that may be needed to ensure these investments reach all of those who need them most.<br/><br/>The second expression of European solidarity with Ireland, is the new PEACE PLUS programme.  This is a unique programme, unique in its goal of promoting peace and reconciliation between the communities across the Border, in its successful history and track record of making a real difference on the ground and in the broad support it commands, not just across the communities of Northern Ireland, but also across the European Union, and even with the UK authorities.  It is no secret that the post-Brexit relationship with the UK has not been as smooth as we would have wished.  Discussions have been intense on a proper application of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol but on the PEACE PLUS we have had good co-operation and a strong commitment from everyone involved to make this programme a continued success.<br/><br/>This is important because the situation on the ground has deteriorated and the PEACE PLUS programme is needed now more than ever.  We need a grassroots approach which draws both communities together.  The programme will be promoting economic prosperity to consolidate the progress made over the past 30 years and to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement.  For that, seamless co-operation between the two sides of the Border is necessary.  That is what we will be basically aiming at with the PEACE PLUS programme in the next number of years.  The programme is ready with &euro;1.1 billion of investment to promote peace, economic regeneration, empowering youth and promoting the green transition, among other things.  We are quite satisfied with the preparation.  There was a very good public consultation with thorough involvement of both communities on both sides of the Border.  Now we must finalise the last details so that the programme can start on time in the first quarter of 2022.<br/><br/>Let me also highlight the contribution of cohesion policy for Ireland for the next years and financial period with a total of &euro;1.3 billion, including this new Just Transition Fund which will support the midlands in transitioning out of peat extraction and peat for electricity generation.<br/><br/>Our discussions on the Partnership Agreement with the overall strategic orientation are ongoing and we hope that the funds can hit the ground in mid-2022.<br/><br/>I would like to finish with the words of an illustrious Irishman, James Joyce, who said:</p><blockquote>	I am tomorrow, or some future day, what I establish today.  I am today what I established yesterday, or some previous day. </blockquote><p>So, let us continue building on the solid ground established since Ireland&rsquo;s accession and lay the basis today with the funds and opportunities made available from PEACE PLUS, the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the mainstream cohesion policy for successful and prosperous next generations of Irish citizens.  I thank the committee very much.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Calleary followed by Deputy Howlin.</p> <p>  Before I let them in I do not have a question but wish to make an observation.  That has been as clear and as concise a contribution I have ever heard from anybody coming from anything to do with the European Union or the Commission.  It was concise and clear in language that was non-jargon-like and was very refreshing.  To hear language like we can "hit the ground running" in early 2022 and to looking at the PEACE PLUS campaign with a "grassroots approach" is the language that people are used to, even in respect of the midlands programme, together with his speaking of the PEACE PLUS programme starting on time in the first quarter of 2022.  I wanted to say that and I am very grateful.  Whether or not Mr. Sobral wrote it himself or his team helped him to do so, I wish to congratulate them and Mr. Sobral himself and no doubt the members will follow now in a similar vein with clear and concise observations and questions.  I call Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021121500002#D00300"><p>That will not be a challenge for me, Chairman.  I thank Mr. Sobral for his contribution.  It was clear and concise.  Unfortunately, it is clear and concise coming from Brussels, but when it gets to Dublin, that is where the problems start.  I come from the northern and western region of this country.  We were a developed region and now have slipped to being "a region in transition".  For us to get the major infrastructural projects, be they transport, industry, electricity or whatever, we find ourselves constantly having to battle an inertia among the permanent government that does not really see the potential of our region, despite having had the support of Mr. Sobral&rsquo;s unit and organisation.</p> <p>  In the context of Mr. Sobral&rsquo;s language around a grassroots approach and internal cohesion, what weapons does Mr. Sobral, his unit and the Commissioner have to push national governments to do more on internal cohesion?  The notion, given all of the investment that cohesion funding has put into our region, that we would once again slip from being a developed region to being one in transition is not the fault of the EU but lies within this island.  In respect of the involvement of communities, what supports are there?</p> <p>  Second, with regard to cohesion projects moving forward in the context of climate change, what specific role would cohesion policies have?  Mr. Sobral specifically mentioned the Just Transition programme in the midlands.  Given that it is rural and regional communities which are going to have the initial costs and, hopefully, many benefits of climate change, what role will the Cohesion Fund play in assisting communities and regions but allowing them also to maximise the benefits of new climate change approaches?</p></speech>

On the question put by Deputy Calleary, I alluded to this in my initial contribution.</p><p>Since its accession Ireland has been a successful case of cohesion policy and converging with the rest of Europe.  As I have also mentioned, it still has internal challenges and internal disparities that it needs to correct.  This is not exclusive to Ireland.  Many other member states, in fact almost all member states, have these internal disparities.  It is true that this is still the case in Ireland.  Between Dublin and Cork and rural areas we see a wide difference.  There are also the northern areas close to the Border.  We very much encourage member states to prioritise investment in this next generation of programmes.  Cohesion is about convergence between member states and about correcting internal disparities.  It is important that member states commit to the levelling up of various regions.  In the case of Ireland this is certainly necessary.  Deputy Calleary mentioned additional layers introduced at national level.  It is not exclusive to Ireland but it is true that while sometimes we in Brussels are accused of being too heavy on processes there is also the gold-plating that sometimes comes from member states.  For this generation of programmes we have tried to simplify their use as much as possible.  It is important this is followed at national level in how it is implemented.  Additionally, it is important that regional authorities are empowered.  It is important that as much as possible these funds and programmes are managed close to the people and beneficiaries.  Empowering regional and managing authorities is an important component of making the programmes more efficient in Ireland in future.</p><p> When it comes to the specific questions on the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to climate, the European Regional Development Fund has an obligation to contribute to climate.  A total of 30% of the fund needs to go towards climate-related expenditure.  I see a lot of potential in Ireland for energy efficiency of houses, which is an issue.  This area is also being tackled under the recovery and resilience plan for Ireland, where complementarity can be established with cohesion policy.  I also see a lot of potential in clean mobility and helping people to develop public transport systems that help people move from cars to buses and rail.  The PEACE PLUS programme will also look at the potential for green transition and geothermal and renewable energy.  There is a lot of potential for contributions from cohesion to climate transition in Ireland.  We are discussing with the Irish authorities the prioritisation of the climate dimension and the digital transition and innovation dimension.  These are the two big priorities we want to push across the board.</p></speech>

I send my personal regards to Commissioner Ferreira.  I hoped she would be here.  She and I were members of the environment Council during the 1990s, along with Michel Barnier and Angela Merkel.  I do not know where I went wrong.  They seem to have got on well since.  I was the Minister responsible for cohesion funding in the run-up to the previous multi-annual financial framework.  I want to make a political point first.  We in Ireland were hugely appreciative of cohesion funding for the years we really needed it to be transformative.  It is less important now.  I made a number of visits in advance of the previous round to places such as Wales that got enormous transfers of resources to their benefit but subsequently voted for Brexit.  I do not know whether we need to go back to better branding of the transformative nature of cohesion funding.  It seems domestic governments claim European funding as their own when it is good and blame the European Union for anything they disagree with.  In terms of the cohesion of Europe as opposed to the cohesion of Europe's economies, we need to have some view towards this.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the Brexit adjustment fund and this will probably come as no surprise.  I represent the south-east of Ireland.  My county of Wexford is a poor area in a rich region, relatively speaking.  One of the issues that is very important to us now is developing the potential of direct connectivity with Europe, with the impact on the land bridge being clear.  This has happened.  There is a 400% increase in conductivity between the port of Rosslare and a variety of continental ports bypassing the UK land bridge.  Mr. Sobral has told us &euro;360 million has been transferred, or is about to be transferred in the coming days or this week.  My understanding is that a significant portion of this will be for port development to make our ports Brexit ready.  I am interested to hear Mr. Sobral's specific perspective on how the money is to be spent to make sure that it is spent, as we have heard from the Court of Auditors, in a way that is entirely consistent with the legal aims and objectives of the Brexit adjustment fund.  Is it a matter of spending it first and clearing it afterwards?  Is there a requirement for projects to be specifically cleared with the Commission in advance of spending?  It will be a tight framework to spend the bones of &euro;1 billion over the next three years if there is a protracted project validation system.</p> <p>  My next question is on the PEACE PLUS process.  I was involved in negotiating the last round in the previous multi-annual framework.  We are in public session so I will be guarded in what I say about this.  I can say there was no great enthusiasm from the Westminster Government at the time for the programme.  The agreement we came to is that it would not object to it but it would not advocate for it within the Commission in the previous funding round.  I am a little bit concerned about how it will be sustained.  I am heartened by Mr. Sobral saying that despite tensions elsewhere there is good co-operation with the UK authorities on the PEACE PLUS process.  With regard to oversight, since it was overseen by the special EU programmes body here presumably it cannot be a special EU programme body if the UK is no longer part of the EU.  How does Mr. Sobral see this developing?</p></speech>

Even though I did not have a chance to work personally with him his name is still known precisely because of his previous responsibilities of being in charge of cohesion policy in Ireland.  I will certainly pass on his regards to Commissioner Ferreira.  She also has very fond memories of her time in the environment Council.  I agree with the Deputy's initial comments on the importance of cohesion for the European project.  Cohesion tends to be looked on as an old policy and a policy that needs to be replaced with other priorities but it is the vehicle through which we implement our priorities in a way that reinforces economic, social and territorial cohesion.  Deputy Howlin has given the good example of Brexit.</p><p>We know that the cost of living in certain territories comes back to haunt us at the ballot box.  We need, therefore, to do more to avoid internal fractures but also to communicate better, as the Deputy said, because sometimes it is not known that a certain type of support comes from the European Union.  This visibility of the support is very important.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's specific questions on the Brexit adjustment reserve, the reserve was conceived as a special instrument precisely to cater for the impact of Brexit.  A high degree of flexibility is given to member states.  In contrast with other programmes, instruments and inclusion policies, there is no need to programme and plan the investments.  We are not asking member states to send us a list of what they want to do.  We will be giving 80% pre-financing.  Of the &euro;5 billion, 80% of it will be pre-financed and it will be given it to member states in three trenches.  As the Deputy said, Ireland will receive the first one this year.<br/><br/>Member states then need to make their investments and implement their measures.  We believe they are best placed to assess which sectors, regions and communities should be supported and which are most affected by Brexit.  We give them a certain flexibility to make these decisions.  It is important, however, and I will underline this, that member states will then have to report in 2024 on what they have done and how they have used these investments.  It is an <i>ex post</i>rather than an <i>ex ante</i>assessment.  There needs to be a clear link with Brexit.  A fundamental condition for the use of the funds from the reserve is the link with the effect of Brexit.  This needs to be proven in the declarations of expenditure we will receive from member states.<br/><br/>In the case of ports and connectivity, we know that will be an area where Ireland will be using the Brexit adjustment reserve.  It is important to also make this link with the impact of Brexit and perhaps try to justify this investment.  For instance, how much of the port investment is related precisely to losses provoked by Brexit?  This is what we will be looking at and probably what the European Court of Auditors will be looking at afterwards.  As I said, however, there is wide discretion for member states to use the funds for business support, retraining and reskilling, connectivity, reintegrating citizens who may be coming back from the UK because of Brexit or border measures.  A wide range of measures can be financed.  The only important requirement is to prove the link with the impact of Brexit.<br/><br/>On PEACE PLUS, I assure the Deputy that this is probably the only bright spot in our current co-operation with the UK on post-Brexit matters.  The UK has decided to discontinue its participation in all programmes, including INTERREG programmes, with the exception of PEACE PLUS.  It said it is interested in continuing with this programme and has already committed to the same level of financing as in the previous period, meaning PEACE PLUS will have approximately &euro;1 billion.  The UK will finance two thirds of the programme and the UK and Ireland will finance the remaining third.  We are, therefore, seeing the same level of commitment to financing.  I can also assure the Deputy on the managing authority.  The special EU programmes body, SEUPB, will remain the authority running and managing this programme.  We are very happy with the way it works and the way it has been preparing the future edition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021121500002#F00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Sobral.  I promise I will not be succinct but rather more circular in my commentary.  I apologise in advance.</p> <p>  In fairness, some of what I was going to deal with has already been dealt with as regards the Brexit adjustment reserve.  There will be flexibility once this money is used as a mitigation of the impact of Brexit.  The fishing industry will need much more than what is in the Brexit adjustment fund.  We are dealing with the outworkings of the quota arrangements post the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the difficulties Ireland has always had in relation to the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  That is obviously for another day and another forum, however.  I am just stating the position.</p> <p>  On the PEACE PLUS programme, members of the republican ex-prisoner network had difficulties in that they did not believe they were sufficiently catered for.  This was brought to my attention, particularly by Mr. Kevin Mulgrew, who died recently.  He will be a serious loss to the community sector, republicans and others in Dundalk and further afield.  In my dealings with the SEUPB, I sometimes brought up the issue people had with governance and administrative difficulties regarding projects.  They have indicated that the difficulties sometimes lie here and whether it is the local council or the State, the governance rules are not necessarily taken properly from Europe and what is actually imposed is rather more difficult for people to operate.  Mr. Sobral might comment on that.  It may be necessary for training or whatever to be provided to the State regarding best practice around dealing with that.</p> <p>  Sometimes these projects are run through local councils.  In certain peace projects, there has not been flexibility and relatively daft scenarios have sometimes been imposed.  We all accept the idea of peace funding.  I know of a particular project, however, that required a significant number of interactions with the Protestant community in the South.  It is not that I can speak on behalf of Protestants but I imagine they do not quite see themselves in the same light as the Protestant, unionist and loyalist community in the North.  Sometimes people will end up putting on a paper show to make sure they tick the boxes to secure funding.  What really needs to matter is the impact of the projects and that we are carrying out projects that are viable and worth doing.</p> <p>  I will make an apology now because I am very quickly going to go above and beyond the remit of Mr. Sobral and what he has chosen to discuss.  I do so because he is appearing on behalf of the European Commission.  We have seen the ongoing solidarity that is being shown around the Irish protocol.  Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi had a private meeting with the committee last week in which he was very straight with regard to the Irish protocol being the only show in town.  He was very diplomatic in stating that there are difficulties in dealing with David Frost and the British but that he hoped to bring about a successful conclusion or what may be one of many conclusions.  Following that meeting, we heard that the British Government is proposing a nationality and borders Bill, which will create great difficulties.  I am from Dundalk, which is right on the Border.  Louth is my constituency.  This legislation would create difficulties for people living in my constituency.  These could be non-Irish EU citizens who may need to use some sort of online notification before travelling to the North.  It is obviously unworkable and something on which we require the Commission to be very strong.  The committee has already committed to do some work on the issue.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Sobral comment briefly on the EU's position as regards vaccines and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver.  There are serious worries that we are doing an insufficient amount on this.  We all accept the solidarity that has being shown across Europe with regard to the vaccine roll-out but none of us is safe until all of us are safe.</p><p>I would not be overly concerned if someone said it is an alternative to the TRIPS waiver.  However, they need to put in a solution that will deliver vaccinations across the developing world, particularly in the context of what we are now dealing with in the Omicron variant. </p><p> I would also like to know what the conversations are at European Commission-level about the energy crisis.  What particular role can Europe take?  I accept that some things are beyond national governments, but the European Commission is a major player.  It can obviously have more of an impact.  </p><p> On the cohesion funding, I agree with much of what Deputy Calleary in particular has said.  We may need this sort of funding into the future, because the fact is that the conversation on Irish unity has started.  While the Commission and the EU will not necessarily have to advocate for it, but they will have to have plan for that eventuality.  When we eventually deal with that, post the referendum, that the European Commission and EU will have to play its part in delivering a smooth transition.  I have no doubt that they will.</p><p> I thank the Chair and I apologise for going slightly tangential to Mr. Sobral&rsquo;s opening statement</p></speech>

He is here to speak about the specifics of his own role and competencies.  I know that the issue of the visas is not within his remit.  I will leave it up to him as to whether or not he would like to respond to that.</p></speech>

Briefly, on the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, we know that it will not compensate the entirety of the losses.  It is basically a sign of solidarity.  However, much more needs to be done.  We are currently in discussions with the UK about the total number of catches, since they are now no longer in the Common Fisheries Policy.  This is indeed a separate discussion.  It is not necessarily easier.</p> <p>  On the PEACE PLUS programme, I can confirm that the programming of this next period has been done following the right consultation across the communities.  As far as we know, there is satisfaction across the Border on the content of the programme, which follows largely some of the priorities that were there before, such as economic regeneration, supports for victims and youth.  It also introduces some new elements such as the green transition and the community and grassroots approach.  These are widely shared priorities.</p> <p>  As for the governance rules, we are taking it up with all governments, and certainly with Ireland, to make sure that these are as flexible and as simple as possible.  I would also like to point out the possibility of technical assistance.  The programmes of technical assistance can be used to capacitate both the beneficiaries and the regional administrations in making use of funds.  We will take this up with the Irish authorities in preparing the next programmes.</p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s three specific points are out my of remit, so I should be relatively cautious in replying.  However, I can say that we are working to have the Northern Ireland protocol respected and implemented.  We have already proved that the EU is looking at the real problems with implementation and trying to address them.  For instance, we will move ahead with the proposal on medicines to make easier the selling and export of medicines into Northern Ireland.  We have also tabled a series of proposals to make the customs processes much easier.  I will certainly report what the Deputy has just mentioned, as well as his concerns, to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi, so that both he and our UK service is aware of this cross-Border movement that needs to remain unhampered into the future.  </p> <p>  The vaccines is probably one of those areas where we are doing a lot but it is not sufficiently recognised.  The EU is already the greatest donor of vaccines.  We are the largest exporter.  We have exported more vaccines than were administered in the EU territory.  The issue of the TRIPS waiver is being discussed in the World Trade Organization.  There is a discussion to be had on that, but I would also say that the waiver is not a silver bullet to address the problem of lack of vaccines in developing countries.  There are the issues of protection, distribution capacity, the cold chains needed for certain vaccines, health systems and national programmes of vaccination that are needed.  We also need to look at those other aspects.  We are trying also to support developing countries in looking at these other dimensions, which are equally necessary for successful vaccine roll-out. </p> <p>  It is my guess that the energy crisis will probably be discussed soon.  There is a European Council taking place presently.  The Commission has proposed a toolbox of actions that member states can take to alleviate the rise in energy prices for citizens and, in particular, for vulnerable consumers.  These include social tariffs and reducing VAT for electricity, for instance.  All of this is within the remit of the member states.  However, we ourselves will work on increased energy storage capacity, precisely to avoid being faced with situations where we run out of gas.  We will also work on joint procurement, which will facilitate our dealings with third countries that are exporters of energy.  We are therefore taking some measures at European level.  There are other measures that could be taken at national level.  There needs to be a combination of both.  We are also looking at the ways in which the markets are functioning to see if the price-setting system is the most efficient one.  We are also looking at the demand transmission service and how it is working to make sure that there is no malfunctioning in the system.  As the Deputy knows, the current rise in energy prices is a result of different factors, such as the recovery, the gas-led rise of consumption in Asia.  There are therefore things that are beyond what we can do.  However, we can certainly do more to try to address this.  A number of measures are being taken.  While they will probably not produce immediate results, they will make us more resilient in the medium term.</p></speech>

I represent a Dublin constituency.  While it would be considered affluent in EU terms, it has significant areas of disadvantage as well.  The Structural and Cohesion Funds have traditionally been important for Ireland.  I am thinking about the 1990s and noughties.  This has resulted us now being a net contributor to the EU budget.</p> <p>  I make reference to Mr. Sobral&rsquo;s remarks about how the situation on ground in Northern Ireland has deteriorated.  He is right about that.  Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol have caused problems.  We have seen demonstrations by loyalist groups, buses set on fire, and so forth.  It is therefore important that Vice-President &Scaron;efovi concludes negotiations with the UK on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  I know that it is not through any fault of his own that these negotiations have not concluded.</p><p>The PEACE PLUS programme is very important in that context.  I would also draw the Commission's attention to the initiative by the Taoiseach and the Government, known as the shared island initiative, and dialogue that is under way in the regard.  The latter involves increased dialogue among civic society across all groups, with the main objective of ensuring peace.  The PEACE PLUS programme very definitely feeds into that.</p><p> My main question, which has been touched on by Mr. Sobral, relates to the ongoing monitoring of expenditure, the need to avoid misappropriation, the need to avoid waste and the need to ensure efficiency.  I know we are talking about a number of funds, and I do not know if Mr. Sobral wants to answer generally or in respect of all of the particular funds.  With regard to oversight, what role do the Irish authorities and Departments have in monitoring expenditure, what role does the European Commission have and is the European Court of Auditors responsible for the overall monitoring of these funds?</p></speech>

I hope the next level of cohesion policy can contribute to that.</p> <p>  On the initiative of the Irish Government, I certainly commend this shared island initiative and dialogue.  The Irish authorities have been very constructive and very good partners in all of these discussions related to Brexit.  We have a close interaction with them at different levels.  I know Commissioner &Scaron;efovi addressed the joint committee recently.  We are totally on the same page regarding the challenges we face in trying to make the best of a situation that we did not choose and a model of separation that we did not choose.  We are not responsible for that but we are trying to make the best of what is a difficult situation and make sure that countries stick to their commitments and respect the agreements that have been signed.</p> <p>  The auditing of cohesion programmes is a complex and multilayered process.  It involves, first, the national level, so there is a sort of devolution of competences to the national level to properly audit the national programmes.  Then, there is the Commission level and the auditors in the Commission can also basically audit the national auditors&rsquo; work.  Then, there is the European Court of Auditors that audits everyone else, and the European Parliament also looks at what we are doing.  There are different layers of auditing.</p> <p>  In Ireland, a couple of years ago, we had some issues related to the management and auditing process that we hope can be improved.  We will also be looking in this next period to ensure certain shortcomings that we identified in previous periods can be addressed.  This comes most notably from what I mentioned earlier, that is, the need to empower the managing authorities to have more competences in certifying expenditure and in being closer to the investments which are done on the ground.  A substantial part of it could be addressed if the managing authorities could have more competences and more power to manage the programmes.</p> <p>  Overall, we have a constructive relationship with Ireland on this one.  I am sure this is a dimension that will be addressed in our next partnership agreement.</p></speech>

With regard to the front-loading of the disbursement of 80% of the funding prior to the application deadline of September 2023, the Court of Auditors has raised concerns that this may lead to a situation where there are ineligible projects that get 80% funding and they will have to repay it.  What is Mr. Sobral's take on that?  Does he share those concerns of the Court of Auditors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugo Sobral" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021121500002#H00400"><p>Yes, it is true that the Court of Auditors has lately expressed some concerns with the way the expenditure will be done in the coming years.  That is not just specifically on the BAR; it is also on other decisions that we have taken.  For instance, the committee may be aware that we adopted a programme last year, the coronavirus risk investment initiative, which has totally flexibilised Commission policy on the way funds can be spent.  Basically, we have allowed member states to transfer money between funds and between regions in order to address the problems caused by the pandemic and, indeed, Ireland has made good use of this flexibility.  I think 60% of ERDF funds were used to buy personal protective equipment, a situation that was not originally foreseen.  The Court of Auditors has expressed some concerns on these extra flexibilities that have been given as a reaction to the crisis and the way this will be controlled and monitored in the future.  I think it is a legitimate concern but I also have to say it was a legitimate political decision to act in the way we have acted in basically giving this extra flexibility and this additional margin of discretion.</p> <p>  It is the same with the BAR.  With that, we are dealing with a problem that we have never dealt with before - one member state going out from the EU.  We do not know what the consequences are and we cannot anticipate how this will unfold.  It is only natural that we entrust member states with the possibility to address this and give them the flexibility to address it because they are best placed to assess this impact.</p> <p>  Of course, this does not mean we are neglecting the control and management dimension.  We are accountable and we always want EU taxpayers' money to be properly used.  We will just have to combine both.  It requires an extra effort from member states and from us, but I think the political decisions that underpin this flexibility were totally justified.  It is also justified that the Court of Auditors is concerned with a new method and a new way.  We need to be rigorous and member states need to understand that with this flexibility comes additional responsibility in making sure the funds are used for what they are supposed to be used for.  I hope that, together, we will be able to address that.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the point he made on the technical assistance relating to the PEACE PLUS project and those difficulties that sometimes arise in the context of governance.  It is possible to get a synopsis or brief from Mr. Sobral in that regard?  That would be useful.  I met with a number of groups that met with a facilitator the other night in regard to PEACE PLUS.  Mr. Sobral has the themes and the pillars, but there is the question of flexibility beyond that.</p><p>It ensures that best practice is being implemented by the councils, and whoever else, and that we are not overly impacting people in operating the governance rules too rigidly.  If we could get that from the witness, I would really appreciate it.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Trevor Lowry, chief underwriting officer.  I would like to start by providing a brief overview of RSA and 123.ie.  As RSA has been selling insurance in Ireland since 1721, we have been marking our 300th anniversary this year.  We are a multichannel insurer selling insurance directly, through brokers, and through affinity partners.  Our gross written premium was approximately &euro;370 million in 2019.  We employ almost 600 people across our offices in Dublin, Belfast and Galway.  This year we became part of Intact Financial Corporation, the largest provider of property and casualty insurance in Canada and a leading provider of speciality insurance in North America and Europe.  I note the committee's invitation focuses on general insurance and business interruption cover arising from Covid-19.  On business interruption, BI, we appreciate this issue has been of significant concern to sections of the business community, particularly small businesses impacted by Covid-19.  At the onset of the pandemic we implemented a range of customer supports including payment breaks and reduced exposures for our commercial customers, in addition to premium refunds for our personal motor customers.  We also established an enhanced process for assessing and responding to Covid-19 business interruption claims, given the impact of the pandemic on businesses.</p> <p>  Each business interruption claim we received had a loss adjustor appointed to establish the individual circumstances and merits of each claim.  At all times we have sought to provide clear communication to customers and brokers on our policy coverage.  While some of our commercial policies have extensions which may cover BI losses arising from Covid-19, coverage only applies if certain criteria are met, and in the vast majority of claims this has not been the case.  A small number of declined cases have been referred to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and these cases have been found in our favour.  In our statutory accounts we reserve &euro;46 million for Covid business interruption losses and we have paid out approximately &euro;13 million to date, including through interim payments.  We await the outcome of two court cases to help conclude these cases.  One relates to policy interpretation and the other will provide guidance on the assessment of quantum.  However we are maintaining our proactive engagement with claimants or their representatives to ensure claims can be progressed as quickly as possible once the court processes conclude.  In addition, we are very mindful of the need to support a recovering economy and business is central to this.  In 2020 to 2021 we increased our number of commercial policies in force by 7%.  </p> <p>  The second key issue for customers is insurers' response to the new Judicial Council guidelines.  We appreciate members' interest in this area, however, we are conscious of the requirements of competition law in this context.  I know many members of the committee have worked on insurance and claims cost reform for several years.  Like them, we welcome the revised guidelines and RSA has responded by passing on savings to customers.  It is important to note that we are still in the early days of the operation of the new guidelines with low settlement volumes and reduced acceptance rates.</p><p>Insurance Ireland has estimated that its members settled approximately 1,100 claims following the introduction of the guidelines, which is estimated to be 10% of what would settle in a normal six-month period.  There are also several challenges to the guidelines to be determined.</p><p> However, I can assure the committee that on our motor pricing, we have passed on the benefit of the reduced awards on price to date.  We keep this area under close review and we will monitor and respond to any further developments in the claims environment.</p><p> In this regard, I add our support for the proposed additional powers for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, as well as the proposals for changes to duty of care legislation as outlined in the action plan on insurance reform.  As highlighted by the national claims information database, for claims below &euro;100,000, which are the vast majority of claims, PIAB settles claims faster with broadly similar average compensation and with significantly reduced legal costs.  The implementation of these proposals, together with the Judicial Council guidelines, can lead to increased customer benefits and a less volatile insurance market.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to present and we look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I was appointed as FBD&rsquo;s chief executive officer in January and I am joined here today by my colleague, Kate Tobin, FBD&rsquo;s chief underwriting officer.  As Ireland&rsquo;s only indigenous general insurer, FBD is the fourth largest general insurer in the country with a branch network of 34 offices.</p> <p>  At FBD, we fully understand and appreciate the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our customers.  In 2020 and to date in 2021, FBD has provided approximately &euro;18 million in rebates to our commercial and motor customers.  We continue to provide rebates to impacted commercial customers.</p> <p>  Regarding business interruption cover, FBD is working to ensure it can pay valid claims as quickly as possible.  To date we have processed &euro;28 million in claims payments to 882 customers.  This includes an interim payment offer to all customers and additional payments for the policyholders who have engaged with us.  FBD has 1,076 customers covered for business interruption during the Covid pandemic.  Interim payments were offered to all customers, of which 759 accepted.  A total of 382 customers have engaged with us and accepted interim claims settlements.</p> <p>  There is an ongoing High Court hearing that will assist with the calculation of the final elements of claims.  Following this judgment, we are committed to finalising claims as quickly as possible.  We ask that members be cognisant of FBD&rsquo;s case, which remains before the High Court.</p> <p>  In addition, following the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman's findings on business interruption, we have applied the Central Bank&rsquo;s Covid-19 and business interruption insurance supervisory framework.  As a result of that, FBD has provided for &euro;13 million in compensatory payments to all our impacted policyholders.</p> <p>  Prior to the publication of the personal injury guidelines, FBD committed to reflect claims savings in reduced customer premiums.  Upon the guidelines being published, FBD immediately applied a directly proportionate premium reduction.  Based on six months' experience and following the PIAB report, we have introduced a further proportionate premium reduction.  We are supportive of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda to help reduce premiums for consumers, farmers and businesses.  The average premium for FBD private car customers has reduced by approximately 10% in 2021 and 25% since 2017.</p> <p>  We are currently adhering to the judicial guidelines in our claims process.  For claims which have not settled directly through PIAB, we await the outcome of court decisions and trust they will align with the introduced personal injury guidelines.</p> <p>  At FBD, we acknowledge the differential pricing report and are working to comply with the measures proposed.  We also continue to be very supportive of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda including the newly established fraud co-ordination office in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We welcome any legislation including amendment of the Road Traffic Act and the establishment of a motor third party liability database which will help to reduce the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, levy and ultimately the cost of claims.</p> <p>  Regarding commercial insurance, FBD operates only in the Republic of Ireland and we have ambitions to grow our farm and business book.  We insure 11% of Ireland&rsquo;s commercial market.  We are growing our commercial offering but must do this in a measured and sustainable way.  To date in 2021, we have grown business and commercial vehicle policies by 6%.</p> <p>  We are already the largest farm insurance provider in a sector which is deemed the most dangerous workplace in the country.  FBD provides insurance cover for many vital community organisations including marts, men&rsquo;s sheds and many local community events which are adjacent to the sectors where we operate.  We sponsor over 100 community-based events and organisations along with providing a wide range of education, research and development grants and projects for Irish agriculture and rural life generally.</p> <p>  We will endeavour to assist the committee as far as possible but as members will appreciate, we are constrained in what we can say on sensitive competitive dynamics such as pricing, including potential price changes, and on our confidential commercial strategy.</p> <p>  We would like to thank the committee for the work it has done to bring about reform in the Irish insurance market and we look forward to engaging with members today.</p></speech>

I thank the guests for appearing before the committee today.  Many people had concerns over payments for personal injury claims and lost faith in the insurance industry as a result.  The introduction of the personal injury guidelines on 24 April significantly reduced the cost of claims.  As soon as the guidelines came into place the insurance industry warned that premiums would not fall immediately and I want to discuss that today.  Insurance is priced based on the expected cost of claims in the future.  What percentage of the insurance industry's total cost is absorbed by gross claims incurred for personal injuries?</p></speech>

We have determined the proportion of personal injury claims we believe are affected by the changes to the personal injury guidelines.  We amended immediately on publication of the personal injury guidelines.  After six months, we have considered and further reduced in light of that experience.  Ours would be in concert with PIAB - roughly 40% reduction.</p></speech>

From our point of view, we regard that as 17% of the total loss cost.  When we move that along in terms of other technical prices, it works out as a 10% or 11% reduction on our technical price.</p></speech>

My question really is: if the claims under the category of awards have fallen by 40%, by how much can we expect the cost to have fallen?</p><p>What would that be in nominal terms and on a euro for euro basis?  We should expect premiums to have reduced by that amount solely as a result of the personal injury guidelines coming into effect.  What percentage have the average premiums across motor and public liability reduced by since 29 April?</p></speech>

They do not impact all claims directly and what we are seeing come through from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, equates to that level of reduction in the cases we have seen, albeit a small number of cases.</p></speech>

We saw that during the majority of 2020 the economy and society were under stringent public health measures, there were fewer cars on the roads and businesses were closed.  Traffic fell by 37% while the number of claims in motor insurance fell by 26% and the cost of claims per policy fell by 20%.  However, the average premium only fell by 7%.  The average rebate that the RSA Group, AIG and FBD gave to their customers was &euro;17, only 3% of gross earned premiums before rebates.

I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss issues related to insurance in Ireland.  I would like to begin by acknowledging the role the committee has played, during both the current and the previous D&aacute;il terms, in supporting the ongoing reform agenda that began five years ago with the establishment of the cost of insurance working group.  These collective efforts are delivering results.  One clear example of this has been the implementation of the personal injuries guidelines, approved by the Judicial Council in March and which came into effect in April.  When I appeared before the committee in May, I said we were hopeful that as the guidelines were implemented, award levels would begin to fall, leading to a reduction in overall claims costs.  The evidence available to date indicates that the new guidelines are having a noticeable impact.  Figures published by PIAB in October show the value of the average award made by PIAB has fallen by 40% year on year.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, motor index shows that average motor premiums have also fallen and are now almost 20% lower than in 2018.</p> <p>  For the benefit of members in understanding the cover AIG provides and how we support businesses and consumers, I would like to provide a brief overview of our business in Ireland.  AIG has been in operation here for more than 44 years.  American International Group Inc., AIG, is a leading global insurance organisation and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Our Irish business, which is run from our Dublin office, employs 160 people in general insurance and we have more than half a million customers.  AIG has been the insurance partner for large and small companies, not-for-profit organisations, and individual consumers in Ireland since 1977.  We support the insurance needs of Irish-based companies expanding in the EU and around the world as well as the insurance needs of US and other multinational businesses in Ireland.  Our business mix in Ireland is weighted towards larger, corporate customers and our principal products are financial lines, such as directors and officers insurance, liability and commercial property insurance, with motor, travel and accident and health plans in the consumer space.</p> <p>  I know that business interruption insurance is a particular focus for the committee in today&rsquo;s session.  AIG policies that include business interruption cover are typically property and commercial policies where the business interruption results from physical damage to property.  This is the basis on which our property and commercial policies are priced and these would include cover, for example, from fire, explosion, machinery breakdown and natural catastrophe.  We have had a small number of business interruption claims related to Covid-19.  AIG&rsquo;s priority for all our business customers is to support their efforts to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity by dealing with claims fairly and paying promptly where policies provide cover.</p> <p>  Following another year of considerable challenges and uncertainty in the face of the evolving pandemic, AIG remains focused on protecting the health and safety of our colleagues as well as continuing to serve clients, policyholders, business partners and other stakeholders.  AIG has introduced a range of measures to support its customers throughout Covid-19.  We have also applied discounts for policy renewals where this is appropriate, reflecting, for example, lower driving volumes while many people are working from home in accordance with the public health guidelines.</p> <p>  On the cost of insurance, the new personal injuries guidelines, as I have mentioned, are an important step towards achieving meaningful change in reducing Ireland&rsquo;s high cost of claims.  Enhancing and reforming the role of PIAB, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s action plan for insurance reform, is also welcome.  We support PIAB, we recognise its positive impact to date and we believe it should have more power.</p><p>Although average awards made by PIAB have fallen significantly since April, it is worth noting that there has been an increase in the rejection rate.  This means more cases will be going to court and greater uncertainty will exist around the ultimate cost of claims.  It is our view that where an injury is not catastrophic and if the PIAB award is not accepted within three months there should be a binding arbitration either to agree that the award was fair or make a different award.  This would reduce the burden on the courts and eliminate unnecessary delays and legal fees, which inflate costs.  </p><p> This year has been a difficult one for many customers and businesses.  We do not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead as we look to fully reopen our economy and society.  Against this backdrop, however, 2021 has also been a year of progress and reform which is delivering benefits to policyholders.  We look forward to working with the committee, the Government and all our stakeholders to continue this progress.</p></speech>

Recommendation 1 of the cost of insurance working group was for insurers to set out reasons for large increases in premiums to consumers.  It was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance in 2017.  I note that none of the insurance companies' websites gives price walking or dual pricing as a reason for customer premiums increasing.  Would the witnesses accept that they deliberately misled the Department of Finance and their customers by not including that?</p></speech>

I suppose that can be considered as dual pricing.  In terms of the specific practice of price walking connected to introductory offers, we would look to bring a customer back to the base price in the portfolio but importantly not beyond that over a number of years.  That will be under review as we implement measures in response to the regulations.  There would be potentially an unwinding of discounts over a short number of years, those being related to new business.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about the specific practice of using big data to determine who is more or less likely to renew and charging them more on that basis, it is not something FBD does.</p></speech>

We do have time-based discounts for new business.  For example, if the Deputy were to purchase a policy online there would be a 10% discount but that is based on the ability to deliver that at a more efficient rate.  We do not price based on propensity to renew.</p></speech>

My questions are about business interruption, the subject matter of today's meeting.  However, I want to focus on AIG and Mr. Connaughton if I may.  My question relates to the 2,200 GAA clubs in the country.  I thank AIG for its tremendous support of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael and the great Dublin team of recent years.  I am grateful to all insurance companies and brokers throughout the country that support Gaelic games.  Can Mr. Connaughton confirm that AIG provides cover to our 2,200 clubs?</p></speech>

I can say that we have property and commercial policies that typically provide business interruption cover where the business interruption results from physical damage to property.  That is the basis on which our property and commercial policies are priced.  Certain of those wordings will also provide further extensions for business interruption losses where there is an occurrence of disease on the insurance premises - not the wider outbreak - and where that outbreak of disease on the premises leads to the entity being closed either by Government or because of the disease outbreak itself.  I hope the Deputy can appreciate that I cannot answer the question in respect of a particular client.</p></speech>

The reason I am raising this today and the reason I asked the Chairman to bring the insurance companies in is relevant to the 2,200 clubs.  Some have come to me to ask these questions.  What they think they are insured for, and what the Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael website says they are insured for, is other than what a master policy document held by senior GAA administrators would say.</p><p>I will ask in a way that Mr. Connaughton might be able to answer.  One would imagine that there are not too many GAA-type clients among AIG's 500,000 clients in Ireland.  Each GAA club is covered individually and individually able to make claims relevant to its policy, which is on the GAA's website and is distributed to each club.  Would it be typical that a master copy or other copy be held by the national body and would it differ?</p></speech>

Each of the clients would have been advised on its specific policy coverage.  Where AIG insures those clients, we are conscious of the legal and regulatory obligations to our policyholders and we seek to treat them with honesty and fairly and professionally.

I want to cut to the chase with Mr. Connaughton.  The suggestion from some GAA clubs is that there is a clause in the policy with AIG whereby, subject to the courts, to AIG or adjudication on claims in the normal way - I am not coming down on one side or the other of that - each club could theoretically make a claim of up to &euro;5 million for business interruption and that, while this is not reflected in the policy document that was provided to them, it is reflected in the master policy document that seems to be in the possession exclusively of senior CLG administrators.  Under the consumer protection code, it seems to me that, as Mr. Connaughton rightly claimed, the broker, Marsh Ireland, would advise clients.  My research indicates that no GAA club around the country has been advised that it may be eligible to make a claim.  Whether such a claim would be successful is a different matter, but that clubs have not been advised seems to be a breach of section 7.1 of the consumer protection code.

We are talking about 2,200 GAA clubs around the country and the policy's wording seems to prohibit the appointing of loss assessors, which is a clear breach of section 7.1 of the consumer protection code.  Will Mr. Connaughton investigate this specific situation?  Is there a policy in existence with CLG telling it that clubs cannot appoint assessors?  In other words, AIG will insure clients but it will also tell them how much it will cost to fix their houses, cars or business interruption costs, which would seem to be sharp practice.  That is a personal view.</p> <p>  Regarding the Central Bank's code of conduct and guidance around test cases and so on, it has come to my notice that, unlike others before us today, AIG is the only firm that has not agreed to the test case process.  Sticking to the GAA example, if St. Whoever's from whatever county decided that it wanted to investigate whether it could make a claim of up to &euro;5 million, would AIG be prepared to go the test case route as opposed to the arbitration route, which as Mr. Connaughton knows would cost a minimum of &euro;100,000 per claim?</p></speech>

I have read the policy I referenced.  Not the master copy, though, because the GAA will not give it to the clubs.  It seems that AIG will not give it to individual clubs either.  There is nothing in the policy saying that clubs cannot claim and nothing to suggest anything other than each unit of the GAA is individually insured.  The clubs have not been individually advised of their right to claim.  I ask that AIG address this through Marsh Ireland and whomever the former deals with in the GAA.</p> <p>  AIG changed the cap applicable to this sort of claim to &euro;5 million in November 2019.  This relates to business interruptions owing to diseases such as Covid and the like.  Unless AIG had a crystal ball, I wonder how it managed to guess so correctly when the first cases were just three weeks away.</p></speech>

The only issue I wish to raise is that of the impact that the personal injuries guidelines have had upon insurance premiums.</p><p>As I am sure the representatives will be aware, the Oireachtas went through the considerable decision to enact legislation to give guidelines to the Judiciary under the Judicial Council Act 2019 for the purpose of reducing awards.  The reason we did it was primarily because we were informed by the witnesses' organisations and others that if we could get awards reduced, this would have a consequential impact on premiums.</p><p> I will start by asking Mr. Thompson in respect of motor insurance in the first instance.  I believe he mentioned in his opening statement that there was a reduction and that has been passed on to the consumer.  Will he give me an indication of the percentage of reduction in premiums since the guidelines came in last March?</p></speech>

We welcome the work that has been done and the new award levels.  We are sticking to the new award levels ourselves in terms of claims assessment, but as per my opening statement, we are cautious because we know that a number of settlements are far less than what one would expect in a normal trading environment for claims.  We know as well that there a few cases before the courts challenging the guidelines.  From the point of view of taking it on good faith that this will all roll through and the new low level of awards will stick, however, we have passed on those premium reductions.</p></speech>

Obviously, the personal injuries guidelines have reduced awards by more than 10%.  I am not saying there should be an absolute correlation between a reduction in the awards and a reduction in the premium, but is it envisaged that the RSA Group will have greater reductions it will be able to pass on to the consumer?</p></speech>

We will monitor it.  We wholeheartedly support what is being done.  We advocated for it as an industry.  The RSA Group is fully supportive of it.  I come back to my earlier comment in which I was responding to a question whereby we have seen a 40% reduction already, although be it from low value claims coming through from personal injuries board.  We know that is 17% of our total loss cost, which equates to 10% of our technical price.  As those figures move, we will move in terms of what we see coming through.</p></speech>

Do not misread that for our lack of support in terms of monitoring.  If we see the benefits, then the customer will benefit.</p></speech>

A significant proportion of that is associated with the personal injury guidelines.  We did undertake to monitor the impact of the guidelines and reflect them periodically as the impact is felt.  Upon the initial publishing of the guidelines, we moved in good faith.  The actual reductions we experienced on a very small population were above what we initially thought and we have moved again to bring that in line with the experience of that small population.  We have undertaken that.  As we see, the personal injury guidelines have an impact on claims.  We are committed to giving that reduction to our customers.</p></speech>

It is 5.16%, in fact.  We are seeing the same green shoots everybody is seeing from the personal injuries assessment and the judicial guidelines.  Our concern is very much around the rejection rate.  The rejection rate is roughly 70%, which is phenomenally high and will lead to significant uncertainty.  At a practical level, insurers would typically have approximately 50% of their claims in litigation.  The litigated claims can take four to five years to get washed through the system, if you like.  Although we are seeing reductions of up to 40% with regard to the awards, the current Government reforms do not address any of the legal costs associated with claims.</p> <p>  Two things are happening there.  One is that we have a rejection rate that is very high, which will lead to uncertainty, more claims moving into the litigation process, and those claims taking longer to get sorted, which will delay any benefits that policyholders might hope to reap from the judicial guidelines change.  We are also seeing the impact in the courts now, through the District Court and Circuit Court, where we have significant backlogs of litigated claims.  To get a hearing now in the District Court could be as far away as 18 months at this time.</p> <p>  While we are seeing the green shoots and while we have started on the journey to reducing premiums, there is a level of uncertainty going forward.  We perhaps need a little bit more certainty as an industry in terms of the judicial guidelines being stuck to.  There are even a couple of, or even five or six, High Court challenges being taken against the judicial guidelines as they stand today.  There is, therefore, a little bit of uncertainty but we have started on the road to reducing premiums.</p></speech>

I am not saying Mr. Connaughton gave this assurance but the political world was given an assurance that if personal injuries guidelines were introduced and imposed, there would be an immediate change in premiums.  I am slightly concerned that Mr. Connaughton is saying there are other imponderables and factors that must be taken into account before we can commit to a full reduction in premiums.  Does Mr. Connaughton want to respond to that?</p></speech>

Back in 2004, when we had a significant breakthrough, we saw a number of years in which insurers responded very positively to the reduction in claims costs.  Over time, however, matters crept back to levels that were there prior to 2004.</p> <p>  We have just implemented a significant catalyst for change in the judicial guidelines, but we are now beginning to see a little bit of pushback from certain parties with regard to the implementation and execution of that.  As an insurer, we are accepting 100% of the assessments from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board but we are seeing from plaintiffs or claimants a 70% rejection rate.  There is, therefore, an inevitable concern around taking rates down too rapidly.</p><p>We have responded based on the positive shoots seen to date.  AIG has reduced motor rates by 5.1% since the implementation of the judicial guidelines in April.</p></speech>

The NCID report shows the average premium from 2017 to 2020 decreased in the industry by 10%.  AIG in that period reduced its rates by 16%.  We gave customers a 4% discount for reduced driving through Covid in 2020 and repeated that 4% discount, which is currently being applied to policies falling due up to the end of April 2022.  We have taken significant action.  Whether it is at the same level, a little behind or a little ahead of other players in the industry, that is a matter of timing rather than anything else.</p></speech>

We have taken what we have seen on good faith from a small sample of claims at the lower end of value which have been assessed by PIAB and one or two court decisions.  We have looked to pass on the benefit to customers.  Our area of caution is around how these cases will ultimately be contested in the courts.  There are one or two cases before the courts contesting the guidelines.  We have to watch the rejection rate, and that rate has increased.  We are open-minded from an RSA perspective.  We monitor it with an open mind and will adjust quickly as things develop.  If they develop in a positive way, we will act in a positive way.</p></speech>

Immediately on publishing and without any experience, we applied it.  We reviewed it and applied an increased reduction based on the experiences of what had occurred.  I do not believe the reductions are slower than expected.  They are given in line with the publishing of the guidelines, effectively in advance of any experience and upon a six-month review of the experience.</p></speech>

I will give an example.  We had just under 700 claims settled in AIG between April and November 2021.  Of those claims, only 86 went through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board settlement process.  Of those 86 claims, we have a 70% rejection rate on motor claims and about a 40% rejection rate on liability claims.  There is a concern about the elevated level of rejection.</p> <p>  The other item to address is that we have circa 50% of the claims in litigation.  Evidenced by that, it will take longer for those claims to wash through and for us to see the deeper results of the reduced awards from the judicial guidelines.  According to the last NCID report, the average claim settlement in PIAB is about &euro;24,000 while in litigation it is about &euro;24,000 in those lower level claims.  However, the legal costs associated with PIAB are &euro;800 while those associated with litigation are 20 times higher.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it is important that if the award is rejected in PIAB, within three months we move to a binding arbitration within PIAB to identify whether that was a fair award or change it and bring the settlement through much quicker.  Expediting the settlement and giving more powers to PIAB would be an even more positive step than what is there today.</p></speech>

They have chosen to go on into some form of litigation or pre-litigation settlement.  It indicates claimants are somewhat more reluctant, which other parties referred to in their statements.  There is an element of reluctance that causes us some caution.  Claimants, by virtue of their decline from 50% acceptance to 40%, are at this point somewhat cautious.</p></speech>

We are seeing a higher rejection rate.  That means plaintiffs or claimants are refusing to accept the award.  One can only assume they take the view the award is too low.  There are five or six High Court challenges now.  I read one in, I think, <i>The Irish Times </i>on Thursday or Friday where a lady received an award of &euro;3,000 for an injury and felt that under the book of quantum the award would be between &euro;8,000 and &euro;16,000.  If that level of uncertainty exists, we need to see those cases come through the High Court and be adjudicated on.<br/><br/>That is one area and the second is that throughout Covid-19 we have had lockdowns and courts are closed.  We have backlogs now in the courts.  Where a typical claim may be settled in PIAB with the acceptance of an award within a year, a litigated claim can go to four or five years.  We are seeing a lengthening of the litigation process, I am afraid to report, rather than a shrinking of it.</p></speech>

I have two fairly straightforward and simple questions to put to the three companies.  Would they support a 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas and towns and on residential roads in order to reduce the risk of fatalities by being struck at a speed above 30 km/h?</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, we have a telematics product currently in place providing coverage and driving behaviour statistics to us in regard to young drivers in particular, and we entered the young driver market with that technology.  The sole aim of that technology is to give us additional protections.  Therefore, we do have a product, we have shared that product with the Road Safety Authority and we believe that product provides very significant benefits to young drivers in terms of improving their driving behaviour.  Overall, I would tend to agree with the Deputy that speed is a very significant factor on Irish roads, as is mobile phone use and a number of other things which, anecdotally, we would say are a concern, although it may be a bit more difficult to prove that on the ground.</p></speech>

At 30 km/h, there is a 90% chance that there will not be a fatality, although there will be other injuries.  I ask the question in that context.  The prevalence of SUVs, crossovers and high-fronted vehicles also increases that risk.  The question still stands.  Would the companies support a 30 km/h speed limit in towns and villages and on residential roads?  Do they recognise the increased risk from high-fronted vehicles in regard to fatalities?</p></speech>

It is something we wish to pursue.  My second question is also quite simple.  It comes directly from a constituent who was shopping around for new home insurance and was told that a tree in his garden would be grounds for refusal of insurance.  Do the three companies have any requirement on people taking out home insurance or looking to renew home insurance if they have trees in their garden?  Do they consider trees of a certain height or age in gardens to be a risk?  Do they place any requirement on landowners to remove trees to reduce any risk they might perceive?</p></speech>

I ask the companies to look into this matter and furnish the committee with some information.  In 2016, a report indicated that Ireland spends just over &euro;12,000 <i>per capita</i>on insurance premiums, which is four times higher than the average rate in the European Union.  That finding was skewed somewhat in that insurance costs also cover multinational companies, which have a bigger presence in this State than in others.  However, the report points to the fact that insurance is a bigger cost per person in this State than it is in other countries.</p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission conducted an investigation into price signalling, a policy whereby companies signal prices to each other to reduce competition in the market.  The motor insurance companies have indicated they will refrain from signalling prices in the future.  By how much should this reduce the cost of insurance?</p></speech>

As a result of the investigation, we undertook to implement training to ensure there were no further considerations by the CCPC.  We also undertook to comply with an annual audit by a third party to confirm adherence to the CCPC.  Given that there was no breach of competition law, I do not think there will be a straight line to the cost of insurance to which one could point.</p></speech>

It closed with no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour on the part of AIG.  We signed up to undertakings at the request of the CCPC.  Similar to Mr. O'Midheach, I do not see a direct line in relation to the competitiveness of premiums as a result of the CCPC investigation.  We would always look at premiums based on the trends of frequency and severity.  We will continue to do that as we have done before.</p></speech>

Of the 700 claims, only 86 went into PIAB for judicial review.  Of the 86 claims that went to PIAB, 70% of the motor awards were rejected and about 40% of the liability awards were rejected.  It will take a number of years for claims to wash through the litigation process before we see the full impact.  The Deputy is correct that the awards have reduced by between 35% and 40% since April, under PIAB.  There has not been any impact on legal costs and we also have a significant number of claims that still have to wash through the litigation process, which could take a number of years.</p></speech>

For those who have gone through PIAB and settled, they are being settled at the judicial guideline levels.  AIG is following the judicial guidelines in the awards we would look to make.  The issue is that the rejection rate is still significantly higher than it was pre-April, which is a concern for us as an industry.</p></speech>

For claims that are litigated, which is still a significant number, those litigated claims will probably still be washed through at the book of quantum level rather than the judicial guidelines level.

We have our own dedicated special investigation unit, part of which is staffed by former garda&iacute; from the national crime unit.  On our reporting to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, from 2019 to 2021, we made 872 reports and we provided 196 statements to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help it combat fraud, both at an individual policy level and at a claim level.</p></speech>

We have a strong internal review.  Ultimately it gets to a small investigations unit.  This year, I think we presented 17 cases for follow through by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for fraud.  The figure may have been slightly less in 2019 and 2020 for prosecution.</p></speech>

We had five cases referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for fraud in 2021.  We have had one prosecution through the courts for fraud earlier this year.  We fully support the new insurance fraud co-ordination office as a central mechanism to help identify false claims.  We need to be careful about the difference, though, between fraudulent claims and exaggerated claims.  The burden of proof regarding fraud is significantly higher than the burden of proof for a claim that might in our view be exaggerated.</p></speech>

This was brought up previously by another Deputy in this committee.  There was a controversy at the time between the estimated percentage of claims that are deemed, understood or at least priced to be fraudulent within the insurance companies and the amount that actually go to the Garda.  As legislators it is important we know the difficulties.  If many fraudulent claims are coming in and if, for whatever reason, insurance companies cannot act upon them in a legal capacity, with a cost being added to insurance as a result, we need to know why that is, how much it is or what proportion it is.</p></speech>

I was listening earlier on, and one insurance company - I apologise that I cannot identify which one said this - claimed it had 100 community organisations on its books.  Is it not true that insurance companies are stepping away from or retreating from this space of community-based events?</p></speech>

We were the insurer, I think, that mentioned its involvement with community organisations.  We also mentioned that FBD is an indigenous Irish insurer.  We are a small insurer in the context of the global insurance market, even though we are fairly significant in the Irish insurance market.  How we approach our underwriting and risk assessment for community organisations is that we try to write business that we already know or that is adjacent to our traditional types of business, which is around rural and farming backgrounds.  That is where most of our share of community organisations has come from.  We find it difficult to write in segments we do not know, and this is for two reasons: one, a lack of expertise within the area, and two, the item the Deputy just raised, namely, the difficulties with occupiers&rsquo; liability and the duty of care.  However, we endeavour to build out into adjacencies with our customers based on our local knowledge with the branch network we have.</p></speech>

However, we would look at our knowledge base and at our expertise and try to focus on our understanding of those risks we can underwrite and can price appropriately.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have been covered but I have one about insurance to do with the diverse leisure industry, such as ice skating rinks and bowling alleys.

It covers the Covid-19 and business interruption insurance expectations in relation to costs and the criteria for test cases.  The letter sets out the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s expectations, which include arbitrations, proceedings before the courts, or indeed the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  I want to get the companies&rsquo; reactions to that letter and see what actions they have taken arising from it.  The letter talks about an impact assessment to ascertain whether there should be wider beneficial impacts, and it requires the companies to do this.  Will the companies brief us on what they have done to date?  The letter asks that the companies consider the publicly available outcomes of legal actions.</p><p>It then goes on to state: "In light of the expectation that an impact assessment will be carried out, certain legal actions may be capable of acting as a test case."  I ask the witnesses for their attitude towards that.  Further down in the letter, it mentions that "the Central Bank's expectation is that where the outcome of a legal action could be said to apply to a number of other policyholder customers, the plaintiff in such a case should not suffer financial prejudice as a result of taking the legal action and the relevant insurer should agree to pay the reasonable costs of such customer plaintiffs."  The final page of the letter states: "The Central Bank may request insurers to produce their analysis of whether a legal action is likely to have a broader application to the position of customers other than the plaintiff."  The letter goes on to say that the Central Bank expects insurers "to take an appropriate position in relation to the costs of any test cases."  What is the witnesses' general reaction to that?  Have the organisations represented responded in detail to the Central Bank on each of those points?  What steps have the organisations taken in compliance with those requirements?  I ask for a general comment on the impact assessment and the legal analysis.  Have the organisations represented provided their legal analysis of the requirement for a test case to the Central Bank and will they provide a copy to the committee?  I will start with the representative of FBD Insurance.</p></speech>

There has been a judgment and we are awaiting a quantum hearing associated with that judgment.  As I have said already, we have undertaken to pay reasonable costs associated with that.  It is providing a test case.  It has been brought by four plaintiffs.  It will be applied to the 1,076 customers, as I have already articulated.</p> <p>  With regard to some of the other questions from the Chairman, on the consideration of the framework and the wider beneficial impacts of any decisions, we had four adverse decisions with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.  We considered those decisions collectively.  We consider them to be universally applicable.  The decisions concerned inconvenience caused to the plaintiffs.  We considered whether that was applicable to all publicans covered by business interruption under the framework and deemed that it was.  We made a provision for &euro;13 million and have gone about paying the 1,076 customers with regard to that FSPO judgment.  We have probably paid &euro;10 million of the &euro;13 million out to date.  We have considered the framework and we have engaged with the Central Bank.  We have applied it and we have paid.

What we have sought to do through the changes we have made to the wording has been twofold.  The first was to clarify the situation in respect of Covid-19.  The second was in response to the fact that we purchase reinsurance ourselves and in response to a limitation that was put on our reinsurance coverage.</p><p> I am not sure I fully understand the Chairman's second question but it probably relates to the renewal of policies where there was business interruption during 2020.  Those policies, when they renew, will not confer the same coverage as before by virtue of the wording change but they would have the benefit of the coverage as per the original contract up until renewal.</p></speech>

Why, heretofore, has it not opted for the test case route?  Arbitration is in secret, costs on average  &euro;100,000 per claimant and is non-binding, whereas a test case, according to the guidance outlined by the Central Bank, prescribes that AIG as the insurer would pay the reasonable cost, it would all be in public and that if the test case were to prove beneficial to a client, those benefits would accrue to other clients insured with the company.  Is it not, therefore, fairer?  At the risk of my being totally wrong, and I will give the representatives of AIG an opportunity to defend themselves, is AIG actively avoiding the test case route because of the fact that it may expose the company?</p></speech>

As for the test case route, it would be only reasonable for me to point out that we do not have a significant involvement with the tourism and hospitality sectors.  We have a handful of claims for business interruption, which we are dealing with.  I think we had almost 628 claims in total, with almost 600 of those falling under a wording that had very clear coverage as being not applicable in respect of Covid-19 claims.  The ombudsman route is a free route, so we have not had-----</p></speech>

PLI has operated the national lottery under licence and regulation since November 2014.  PLI is owned by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, OTPP, An Post Pension Funds and An Post, who together, have considerable experience in operating state lotteries.</p> <p>  The national lottery commenced operations in 1987 and has the purpose of raising funds for good causes by providing lottery entertainment in Ireland.  On any week, more than one third of Irish adults participate in the national lottery.  Participants have contributed more than &euro;6 billion to the funding of good causes in Ireland since the national lottery commenced.  Under this licence, 57% of national lottery ticket sales went to players as prizes, 28% went to good causes funding, 6% went to local retail agents in commission on their sales and 9% went to PLI to run the national lottery and generate a return on investment.  </p> <p>  PLI has invested more than &euro;71 million, predominantly in technology infrastructure, and doubled its workforce.  It has renewed the national lottery games and, in 2015, it responded to customer feedback for higher jackpots by launching a new 47-ball lottery game with a jackpot cap.  Since 2015, national lottery ticket sales have grown by an average of 6.6% per year, a turnaround from the previous seven-year period during which ticket sales shrank by 20%.  Sales of lottery games were also higher in 2020 than in 2015, a stark reversal of the 41% drop experienced in the last full six years of the 45-ball game.  By 2020, annual funding for good causes had increased by &euro;66 million from its 2015 level to reach &euro;254 million.  Players won &euro;529 million in prizes, creating 33 millionaires in 2020 alone, and lottery agents received almost &euro;50 million in commission.  </p> <p>  The recent rollover of the lottery draw has received significant attention in past weeks with two specific concerns raised.  The first is whether there is something amiss with the draw process.  Lottery draws are operating in accordance with the game rules, with nothing amiss.  Lottery jackpot wins are transparent to the players.  They are awarded to players whose tickets have the six numbers that match those randomly chosen at our live televised draws.  These draws follow prescriptive processes and are observed by KPMG.  The numbers drawn are retrospectively tested to check that no anomalies are evident.  The supplier of the central lottery IT system also supplies 35 other lotteries and that system is secured by several layers of protection which prevent malicious intrusion.  Checks and balances confirm that the game is operating according to the rules. </p> <p>  The second concern expressed was that the lottery game design is unwinnable.  The lottery jackpot can be won, as the six-year history of the current game design clearly shows.  A ticket has the same chance of winning in each lottery jackpot draw, the lottery plus 1 draw and the lottery plus 2 draw, each of which have 47 balls.  Since 2015, there has been, on average, a winner of the lottery jackpot every five weeks, with an average value of &euro;5.8 million; a winner of the lottery plus 1 top prize every six weeks, and a winner of the lottery plus 2 top prize also every six weeks.  In the period since this lottery jackpot started to roll on 9 June 2021, there has been, on average, a winner of the lottery plus 1 top prize every four and a half weeks and of the lottery plus 2 top prize every four and a half weeks.  The main lottery draw can be won and it frequently is.  </p> <p>  It is highly unusual that the current lottery jackpot still has no winner.  Given the tickets purchased since early June, the chances are akin to rolling a die 37 times without the number six arising.  Then again it was somewhat unusual that we had lottery jackpot winners on three consecutive Saturdays just before this long roll.  Variation in jackpot roll lengths occur because each lottery draw is a pure game of chance without memory.  Some &euro;46 million has been generated for good causes from Lotto ticket sales in this current jackpot roll.  Since the jackpot capped at a record &euro;19 million, 215 winners of prizes below the jackpot have shared in the &euro;18.1 million of prize money which would otherwise have grown the jackpot further.  In this way, as the roll has continued, the game design has rewarded participation with large prizes.</p> <p>  It is in the interests of PLI, and those of all stakeholders of the national lottery, including our customers, that winning the jackpot is seen as both aspirational and possible.  That requires jackpots to be both large and won frequently enough.  This is a balance.  We know our customers want this lottery jackpot to be won soon, as do we.  We have sought regulatory approval to introduce a "must be won draw" into the lottery game rules, which would ensure that such an improbably long wait for a capped jackpot win cannot occur again.   That would also allow us to provide certainty to lottery players as to the latest date on which this record &euro;19 million jackpot will be won.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention.  I am happy to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

It has been running for six years.  As chance has had it, the game has been won on many occasions but this particular jackpot has not been won and has been in a roll since June.  The broad direction of the proposal which we have made to the regulator is that we would have a draw whereby if nobody wins the jackpot, that is, matches the top six numbers, the moneys would instead be won by winners in the tier below that where there are winners and as a result it would be certain that the jackpot amount is paid to players.</p></speech>

I will ask questions now, Chairman, and you might possibly let me speak again at the end.  Mr. Algeo said in his initial statement: "Since 2015, national lottery ticket sales have grown by an average of 6.6% per year, a turnaround from the previous seven-year period during which ticket sales shrank by 20%".  Has he any idea why they shrank by 20% in the seven-year period he mentioned?  Has it not more to do with the national economic crash, which covers that period exactly, when people did not have as much money to speculate?  Was that not the reason the lottery faltered during that period, as opposed to taking credit for the fact that it has grown in the subsequent period of national economic revival?</p></speech>

It coincided with the rejuvenation of the games and improvement of the customer experience in general.  I believe that those are material contributing factors to the turnaround in the fortunes of the national lottery.</p></speech>

This is something that is of great interest to many people.  My first question relates to the probabilities of this happening.  It is my understanding that with 47 balls an individual has a one in 10.7 million chance of winning.  An average of 1.4 million tickets are sold per game.  Therefore, there is a 13% probability of winning and, obviously, an 87% chance of it being rolled over.  That is 13% if each of the 1.4 million tickets per game is different.</p> <p>  Regarding the 87% chance of it being rolled over, the probability of that happening 54 times in a row is 0.005%.  Obviously, a probability of 0.005% is highly unusual.  Mr. Algeo said in his opening statement that it is highly unusual that this lotto jackpot still has no winner and that given the number of tickets purchased since early June the chances are akin to rolling a dice 37 times without the number six arising.  My calculations on that is that it is double that on the basis of the 1.4 million tickets sold per game and that the probability would be 0.01%.  Could Mr. Algeo clarify if it is that the number of tickets sold per game has reduced?  From my calculations that would mean that there would be approximately 847,000 tickets sold per game.  Perhaps he will clarify that initially.</p></speech>

There is no estimate or average in it.  It is simply the multiplication of the probabilities of each draw, looking at the actual sales, being won multiplied by each other and that brings us to that sentence.</p></speech>

If ten players bought tickets, but two of them had picked the same numbers, then the overall probability of the draw being won would be affected.  The draw would pay the jackpot between two people if those numbers came up, but it would not be ten possible winning tickets.</p></speech>

I wish to go back to the point when the national lottery was privatised by a Fine Gael Government in 2014.  Two additional balls were added to the total numbers needed to match and win.  This was always going to decrease the number of winners and increase the number of losers, which is really privatisation in a nutshell.  However, we are here today because of the concern expressed by some about the extensive run of jackpot rollovers.  We have just spoken about the low probability of that happening.  In my view, while the extensive run of rollovers might not have been predicted, surely it should have been prevented at the outset in the setting of the national lottery's game rules.  Is Mr. Algeo aware of any risk assessment that was done at the time by the Government?  I know he is not here to speak for the Government, but I am interested in whether he was aware of whether there was a risk assessment carried out at that time.  When the sale was agreed did the Government of the day raise with PLI the issue of unlimited jackpot rollovers and no requirement for unclaimed prizes to go to charitable causes?  I am interested because this is now the issue of the day, but it probably should have been looked at in 2014 to ensure it could not happen.</p></speech>

Looking at best practice, in Britain a jackpot can only be rolled over five times.  I am startled that this was not examined at the point when the national lottery was privatised.  The other major biweekly lottery, the EuroMillions, is the same in that the jackpot can only be rolled over five times.  Is Mr. Algeo aware if that was discussed at any point at the time of the privatisation or, indeed, what are his views on that?</p></speech>

The market research had a number of game designs tested and the strong customer preference was to have larger jackpots.  That is what is brought about by having a larger number of balls.  The 52% or the portion of money that goes to prizes and the portion of money that goes to good causes and so forth were not affected in that.  It is not a matter of less or more money going to prizes, it is just how frequently the prizes are won and how big the prizes are.  That is a balance, and the balance, on the basis of market research at the time, was to increase the quantum of the jackpot while reducing the frequency of the jackpots.</p></speech>

I am sure the people who have not claimed their prizes will not be too happy to hear that they missed them.  Can Mr. Algeo specify exactly what happens to the money in the unclaimed prizes?  In Britain, unclaimed prizes are directed into the relevant national good causes fund after 180 days.</p></speech>

As the Deputy noted, the quantity of unclaimed prizes was &euro;17 million in 2020.  That is actually a reduction on the previous year and the year before that.  It has been going down.  In 2020, it was less than 2% of sales for the first time.</p></speech>

My apologies for returning to this issue.  Mr. Algeo stated that the probability of having 54 rollovers is the same as that of a die being cast 37 times without a six being rolled, which is 0.01%.  We have agreed on that.  For the same probability to apply to the run of rollovers means that fewer than 1 million unique tickets would need to be sold per game.  Obviously, that is lower as a percentage of chances of winning.  Does Mr. Algeo agree that is a lower percentage of chance of winning the national lottery compared with the British national lottery?</p></speech>

I refer to the seeking of regulatory approval to introduce a must-be-won draw.  Mr. Algeo referred in his opening remarks to knowing his customers.  Let us be frank: if it were not for the campaign by Deputy Durkan, Mr. Algeo would not be doing this.</p></speech>

We have been working with our suppliers and, indeed, we notified the regulator in early November of our intention to introduce a device such as this.  As the national lottery has so many checks and balances, parallel systems and layers of governance over every draw, it is not a trivial thing to change games rules.  The process of introducing a contingency to a very long draw, or this very long draw, has been in place for some months.</p></speech>

The purpose of the national lottery is to raise money for worthy causes and to have a regular prize draw for the public.  That is not happening at the moment, so it is clear the system is broken.  It is clear that what we have today is not what was designed in the first place.  It has not happened by accident.  The addition of 11 balls has obviously changed the game.  The addition of extra balls since 1988, and including some since Mr. Algeo's company took over in 2014, has made it more difficult to win and, therefore, more likely that jackpots are not won regularly.</p> <p>  What was the turnover of PLI in the first six months and how does that contrast with the second half of the year?</p></speech>

We report on an annual basis as stipulated in our licence.  The game itself has been<i>in situ </i>for more than six years now and has produced jackpot winners on average every five weeks.  Similarly, the lotto plus 1 and lotto plus 2 draws have produced jackpots on a frequent basis.</p></speech>

There is probably a flipside, however, in that if it gets into the public psyche that a draw or jackpot cannot be won, it hurts sales, which might motivate a private company to seek regulatory change in that regard.

Accounts have shown that PLI has racked up about &euro;120 million in interest on loans from the consortium since 2014.  The payment of the interest is having an effect on reported profitability.

Mr. Algeo was asked earlier to break out the figure, as he put it, but the figure is already broken out because the money has to be ring-fenced for promotion.  We can safely say that, for PR and promotion, all of this money was spent.  Therefore, we have a figure that is broken out from the company&rsquo;s accounts.  Can Mr. Algeo describe for me what promotion actually means?  What comes under the heading of promotion in the accounts?  Is it advertising?</p></speech>

I can say that in general it really is a very wide range of prizes, although, as the Chairman might imagine, the larger prizes are more likely to be claimed, not least because PLI, as a condition of its licence, advertises extensively when a large prize has not been claimed.  Such advertising can be heard particularly on local media when there is an outstanding large claim.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Mr. Derek Donohoe, deputy regulator and head of audit and finance.  The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery was established in 2014 as an independent regulatory office under statute by legislation passed by the Oireachtas, the National Lottery Act 2013.  The regulatory role includes to procure the holding of the national lottery; to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator with the National Lottery Act 2013 and the 2014 licence awarded to it; to manage and control the national lottery fund to ensure the amounts going to prizes, good causes and the operator are correctly accounted for; to consider for approval certain matters relating to the national lottery, including schemes for national lottery games proposed by the operator; and to exercise the enforcement rights of any trademark of the national lottery.<br/><br/>I took up the role of regulator in 2017, following a career in competition and consumer protection law and policy.  I am trained in economics, law, and regulatory governance.  Our aim is to ensure a safe, sustainable, properly run national lottery maximising funds for good causes.  I am assisted in this role by nine staff who are experienced in law, accounting, auditing, psychology, research, communications and risk management.  As Regulator of the National Lottery, I and my staff work to ensure that the national lottery is run with all due propriety and that the interests of all those who participate in the national lottery are protected.  While those who purchase tickets for the national lottery do so in the full knowledge that it is a game of chance, as are all lotteries, my office seeks to provide them with the confidence that the national lottery is being run to the highest standards of probity and consumer protection and that their interests are safeguarded. <br/><br/>The regulator&rsquo;s office oversees the holding of national lottery games in several ways.  Any new game, or any change to an existing game, must be submitted by the national lottery operator to the regulator for approval prior to launching the game.  The regulator&rsquo;s office then determines whether the scheme for the game is compliant with parameters set out in the Act and licence.  Only certain game types are permitted, certain information must be made available to players and the game must complete extensive testing requirements.  Every proposal from the operator goes through a rigorous set of checks by the regulator, the head of audit and finance, our legal and compliance team, and the head of player protection and research.  Our objectives, given to us by the Oireachtas, are to ensure: the game is run with all due propriety; that the interests of players are protected; that the long-term sustainability of the national lottery is safeguarded; and, after that, we consider the return to good causes generated. <br/><br/>Commercial considerations such as the price of a ticket or the prizes to be won are reserved to the operator under the Act and the licence.  The financial model in the licence incentivises the operator to maximise returns for good causes in the design of its games.  In each game, 65% of the proceeds, after prizes, go to good causes and, after retailer commission and the regulatory levy, the remainder goes to the operator.  <br/><br/>When a game is approved, my office then continuously monitors the operator to ensure that it is operating the game in compliance with terms of the approval, and the Act and licence.  My office performs numerous checks and reviews across a broad range of aspects of the game and areas of the operator&rsquo;s business - from ticket sales through to draw operations and prize claims - using a risk-based approach.  We vary our checks and interrogations across the entire operation in order that the operator is focused on being compliant in all matters.  Some examples of the checks and balances in place are as follows.  There are strict tests and process protocols in place for how each and every draw is conducted.  An independent company performs statistical checks on ball sets.  The appointment of this company is approved by my office.  Each week we review sales figures for every national lottery game and perform checks to ensure the proceeds are correctly allocated to prizes, good causes, retailers and the operator.  We receive regular reports from the operator on the speed of prize payments, on who has access to the secure areas and on online play patterns.  My office has conducted proactive expert reviews of the quality and capacity of the operator&rsquo;s IT and communications systems, including its cybersecurity, to check that it is capable of operating the national lottery games with all due propriety.  We monitor the advertising and public relations of the operator to check that the content and location meet the relevant standards and take enforcement action where required.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>With regard to the current unprecedented rollover of the lotto jackpot, I can assure the committee the lotto game is operating in line with the game rules and there are no regulatory issues.  Independent observers from KPMG attend every lotto draw, although they are not on camera any more, to ensure the strict protocols in place are followed to the letter.  The &euro;19 million cap on the lotto jackpot is part of the game rules introduced in 2015.  The cap allows prize moneys that ordinarily go to growing the jackpot to go instead to growing the value of the next highest prize won and this flow-down of prize money has been operating correctly.  Since the lotto jackpot reached its cap on 29 September, 215 players have won much larger amounts than would ordinarily be available for matching five numbers or five numbers plus the bonus ball, 27 of these players won prizes ranging from almost a quarter of a million euro up to &euro;1.25 million, and the remaining 188 won match five prizes ranging from &euro;22,872 to &euro;35,234.<br/><br/>Importantly, the split of the proceeds from lotto sales are, and have been, the same in every draw, regardless of the jackpot level.  For every euro spent on lotto tickets 52 cent go into prizes, 31.2 cent is returned to good causes, 6 cent go to the retailer in commission and the remaining 10.8 cent go to the operator from which they pay the costs of operating the game.<br/><br/>The current extended period without a jackpot win is unusual in the history of the game but it is not unusual in the history of lotteries.  Statistically unlikely events are part of the nature of games of chance and lotteries.  It was also statistically unlikely that the lotto jackpot would be won three Saturdays in a row and yet this happened at the end of May and over the June bank holiday weekend earlier this year when players won jackpots totalling more than &euro;11 million in three consecutive Saturday draws.  Lotto sales have attained sustained high levels since the record-breaking jackpot was reached and good causes have benefited significantly from this.  Approximately &euro;46 million has been earned for good causes by lotto since the jackpot was last won. <br/><br/>I have provided further details to accompany my statement that I hope is helpful to the committee in providing an overview of the role of the regulator.  I look forward to answering any questions the members may have. </p></speech>

Has she a response to an injudicious text I received from a constituent to the effect that he inquired whether some change would be made?  He asked if a handbrake, lever or switch had been pulled or if some technical or IT change had taken place that might have brought this into focus in June and currently would it be done to level the playing pitch once again, as he would see it.  For instance, from here on in, what will change that did not change before?  If we have the same technology, draw, lottery and methodology, how will it be possible to change from a non-winnable to a winnable situation without somebody, somewhere, changing the technology?  That is what that constituent is saying.</p></speech>

Lotto has always been a game where if you match the six numbers, you win the jackpot.  If we are to bring in a feature whereby even if there is no winning ticket matching the six numbers drawn the jackpot money will be won because all of it will roll down to the next highest prize won, that requires a change in the technology.  Those are the kinds of checks my office is currently performing.  They include, for example, what is the mechanism that will be applied to make that happen, how it is being tested and whether it will be tested sufficiently and appropriately to make sure it operates correctly every time.  Those are part of the checks my office conducts any time a lottery game is amended.  The other kinds of checks we have to conduct on this proposal include, for example, how the mechanism is described in the game rules.  First, what kind of a must-be-won feature will it be?  As some Deputies have outlined, different kinds of must-be-won features can be introduced.  What exactly is the one the operator is proposing and how is it described in the game rules?  I have to be sure there are no unintended consequences in the future.  I want to make sure it is correctly and appropriately described in the game rules.  We also check for the impact on the risk of the game to players.</p></speech>

It was the operator&rsquo;s initiative to see if it could bring in a must-be-won feature.</p><p>It was first mentioned to me in early November that the operator was examining exactly what technology changes and tests might be required, including how long it would take to perform all those tests, so that in the event that the lotto jackpot continued to roll over for an extended period, it could apply for such a facility to be brought in.  When the operator decided it did want to bring this in, the actual application came in on the evening of 7 December. </p></speech>

If that is so, what prevention measures have been taken?  For example, if the HSE was hacked, it is quite possible that somebody somewhere would attempt to do so with the national lottery, which has a rolling prize of &euro;20 million or thereabouts and several other prizes.  Will Ms Boate tell me, if she can, the methodology used to prevent that?  Some methods may be electronic and some may be technical.</p></speech>

Towards the end of last year, I sent in expert independent IT consultants from the firm Grant Thornton to conduct a review of the quality and capacity of the operator's IT systems, specifically including its cybersecurity preparedness.  I received that report earlier this year.  Based on its findings and other evidence and information available to me - I get regular reports about aspects of its systems - I am confident that the operator is taking all the appropriate steps to protect the national lottery from cybersecurity attacks.</p></speech>

The licence requires that expired unclaimed prizes are given to the operator, in the first instance, to spend on promoting the national lottery.  At least once a year, I get a report on how much money has expired in unclaimed prizes and how much money the operator has spent on marketing and promoting the national lottery.  I am able to compare those, in addition to other reports going on in the background, to ensure and check that the money is being correctly spent in accordance with the terms of the licence.</p></speech>

It is not unusual for a budget to be created for the operator in the design of a licence.  I noted some earlier comments about the UK model and I have looked into this previously.  In the UK model, expired prizes go to good causes.  However, money is also regularly taken out of good causes and given to the operator to promote the national lottery, which I believe is of a similar order to the design of our licence model.  It is not an uncommon feature of lottery licences.</p></speech>

Does how that money might be used in the promotion of the lottery not cause some concern?  It might be used to encourage more people to spend on the lottery, while at the same time it could be used as a means of preventing people from winning because of the particular system that now operates.</p></speech>

It goes back again to my texter.  He is obviously suspicious that there is a machine somewhere that predetermines what happens.  Is Ms Boate satisfied that is not the case?</p></speech>

Going back to the example of the lotto draw, we still use ball machines for that.  It is a physical draw that takes place on live television.  Everybody can see the balls that are drawn and the winning combination.  Everybody who has purchased a ticket has a copy of it.  It is very transparent.  We do not use random number generators such as those used in other jurisdictions.  Again, we use the ball machines for daily million, EuroMillions plus and other games that are similar but not broadcast on television.</p></speech>

Who has access?  Who are the custodians of that technology or mechanisms that are used to determine, by the ball system or whatever it is, who the winners are?  Who has access to that?  Where is it stored?  Can people bring it home with them at night, for instance, when they are working from home or whatever the case may be?  Will Ms Boate shed some light on that?

The technology that runs the national lottery is a web of hardware and software processes and procedures.  The core gaming system is one designed to record all the tickets sold and all the prizes won to be paid out.  That came from an international company that specialises in these types of systems, of which there are only a few in the world.  That is held by the national lottery and only certain staff members are allowed access to it.  They certainly could not bring it home.</p> <p>  Perhaps one of the useful things to understand is that a separate independent verification system is being operated at the same time to also record all the tickets that are being sold for the draw.  It is operated by a separate independent team and the draw is only allowed to take place if those two systems match.</p></speech>

I will pick up on her initial replies to him.  She said, in line with what the previous witness said, that PLI had mentioned in early November the prospect of a must-win draw, which it subsequently requested on 7 December, eight days or - correct me if I am wrong - two draws ago.  Had it ever mentioned it before then?</p></speech>

Is this something that has been invented to address a growing concern highlighted, as I mentioned, by Deputy Durkan, or is this common practice in other games across the world?  Would this be happening if very serious attention was not being given to it, by this committee and others?</p></speech>

It would have been highly unlikely, but it is also highly unlikely for it to happen under this framework.  We are talking about degrees of how highly unlikely it is.  I do not know why consideration was not given to including some kind of "must be won" feature in the event this highly unusual situation arose but I do know that this was never proposed to my office and approved.

Indeed, I always remember the very pleasant gentleman who used to nod at the start of the draw.  When we talk about the independent observer, which is consistently the same company, I wonder what the application or tender process for that very important role is.</p></speech>

I then have a role in approving that appointment.  All key contractors, such as KPMG, the gaming system provider and the cleaners who clean the room where the machines are kept, are subject to approval with regard to their fitness and probity.  I also must ensure there has been a proper tender process.  We check that an appropriate tender process has been run for contracts of this nature.</p></speech>

I will make sure to keep the questions as quick and easy as possible.  Perhaps the answers could be as well, if that is okay.  I missed some of the debate because I had to pop out for another meeting.  Why does this State differ from other jurisdictions with regard to regulatory oversight?  Why does responsibility for the national lottery remain with a regulatory body and Government Department separate from those responsible for Paddy Power and so on?  What is the reasoning behind that?  If we look at other jurisdictions such as Britain, Sweden and France, we see that one independent regulator oversees the whole gambling sector, including national lotteries.  Will Ms Boate comment briefly on that?</p></speech>

It was part of the awarding of the licence that there would be an independent regulator who would approve games and so on as opposed to the Minister doing so, which was the previous system.  There was a necessity for a regulator at that time.  As to whether we would ever be merged with a gambling regulator, that is a matter for government.</p></speech>

I have a question arising from a question Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked in the previous session.  I took a quick look at the audited financial statements of Premier Lotteries Ireland.  It was a brief look so I am open to correction if I have got this wrong but, from what I can see, PLI paid no tax in 2019.  It actually got a refund of &euro;100,000.  It paid tax in 2020.  I note from its financial statements that the shareholders of PLI have given it significant loans.  Note 19 in the financial statements says that non-current liabilities, which total approximately &euro;250 million "represent the balances repayable to the Company&rsquo;s shareholders [...] which are repayable by 2034 and bear interest at a rate of 9%."  Obviously, we know that interest rates are extremely low at the moment.  This is a very high rate of interest for a company such as Premier Lotteries Ireland to charge.  It is above market rates.  Why would shareholders charge a company that they own such a high rate of interest?  Is Ms Boate concerned that such interest rate payments may be reducing the money that is due to the taxpayer?</p></speech>

We keep an eye on them to make sure there is no question that the company is not complying with the laws of the land and that there are no questions around its solvency but, as no questions of that nature arise, those are really private matters for the company.  My job is to make sure that the amount of money being returned to good causes is correct.</p></speech>

It just seems unusual for a company that is profitable.  I understand that this does not fall within the regulator's brief.  We are under time pressure so I will move on.  In respect of the distribution of funds to good causes, the regulator is concerned with proper administration.  An issue that has been raised with me is that, under the model in England, an entirely independent body administers the funding to good causes while, under the Irish system, the decision lies with the Minister.  I would like to look at how the funding is allocated.  It has also been raised with me that successive Ministers responsible for the environment and national heritage have failed to request funding given that it would impact on the discretion of their colleagues to benefit causes in the constituencies.  The natural environment was added as a beneficiary under the Act in 2013 but it has not benefited since.  Does the regulator have any comment on transparency in that regard?  It is something that has been raised with me and it is an interesting point.</p></speech>

We transfer that money to the Exchequer.  I am afraid that what happens afterwards is not within my remit.  However, I know the Minister is aware and concerned that there could be more transparency with regard to how one accesses national lottery funding and where it goes.  He has commissioned Indecon to prepare a report for him on that issue.  I believe that report is due in the new year.  Perhaps that will shed more light on the issue for the Deputy.</p></speech>

In the first session, the committee will engage with representatives from SIPTU.  I welcome from the union Mr. Ted Kenny, sector organiser, Mr. Geoff McEvoy, industrial organiser, Mr. Greg Lyons, ambulance sector president, Mr. Luke McCann, Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, convener, and Mr. Peter Ray, president of the Irish Ambulance Representative Council, IARC.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I point out to our guests that uncertainty regarding parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence given from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I should declare an interest in that I am a member of SIPTU.  I invite Mr. Kenny to make his opening remarks.  He is very welcome.</p></speech>

SIPTU represents more than 1,600 members in the National Ambulance Service, all of whom are critical to the delivery of care in emergency services in our communities.  The HSE National Ambulance Service provides the following supports to the public throughout the State: emergency ambulance service; immediate care transport; mobile intensive care ambulance; and neonatal intensive care ambulance.</p> <p>  In Dublin, a dual system is operated by the NAS and the DFB, which has served its residents well over many years.  Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service employs 110 personnel in all grades of ambulance professionals, inclusive of more than 80 advanced paramedics.  Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service requires back-up support from 840 paramedic first-response firefighters, backed up by 21 paramedic first-response fire appliances and two emergency fire appliances, offering a rapid first response deployment to any pre-hospital emergency.</p> <p>  Ambulance capacity in Ireland has been at a low level historically, with demand increasing over the years.  For example, monthly demand in the second half of this year is at levels normally experienced in December pre-Covid.  Covid has, obviously, affected all aspects of the health system, from primary care to hospital care.  There are very high levels of hourly use of emergency ambulances and pressures on these areas of the system have had a knock-on effect on ambulance services.  Hospital offload delays have increased in number and duration.  Call volume to emergency control centres has increased, and the time duration of each call has extended due to the additional personal protective equipment, PPE, and effective prevention control measures that are required when managing Covid.  Ambulance crews are experiencing the effects of lengthening response times, which in turn have an effect on the welfare of staff working in such a busy system, both in the control centres and operationally.</p> <p>  SIPTU representatives have expressed deep concerns over the high level of pressure on the ambulance service, with paramedics frequently having to be diverted from other parts of the country, under a system that has been widely criticised by staff and has resulted in many members suffering from burnout.  Staff recruitment and retention in the service has become a serious issue.  In Dublin Fire Brigade's fire-based emergency medical service, ongoing manning shortages have meant that, at times, up to 20% of front-line DFB fire appliances have been taken out of service, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the number of available paramedics.</p> <p>  In representing members in these vital services, we want to share our concerns about the effect this is having on the morale of our members who provide front-line ambulance services throughout the Republic of Ireland and the concerns our members have about the perceived lack of public confidence in an essential, life-saving service.  As the Chairman and committee members will be aware, from both their work on the committee and their work in their constituencies, public concern has grown throughout the country as a consequence of several high-profile cases in which ambulance responses to a specific incident or event have been flagged in the media as a matter of concern.  We are here to assist the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to examine all factors involved in the delivery of the ambulance services, to do what we can to establish the growing challenges confronting this essential front-line service and to assist the professional ambulance personnel committed to providing these services.</p> <p>  Ambulance professionals, in both the HSE National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade, have a proven tradition of putting the care of the patient first, and this ethos has been well demonstrated by their commitment to developing the service from being a patient-transport service to a sophisticated first-point-of-control medical intervention.  This has required the strategic educational development of personnel, whereby ambulance professionals are trained to the level of medical technician, paramedic and advanced paramedic, all of whom are equipped to deliver the earliest possible medical intervention, thereby giving the patient the best possible medical outcome.  This also provides the added benefit of taking pressure off accident and emergency departments through earlier interventions.  Our members are also committed to the bachelor of science degree programme in pre-hospital emergency medicine supported by University College Dublin and University College Cork.  Those who deliver front-line emergency ambulance services are deeply affected when a failure to deliver the best medical intervention or to meet the recommended response times is linked to an adverse outcome for a patient, given many of our members who work for the ambulance services live in the communities they are deployed to serve.</p> <p>  Despite restrictions on resources in these difficult times, ambulance professionals continue to develop their skill set to serve in the interests of the public.  SIPTU has been at the forefront of the development of the professionalisation of the ambulance services, which has evolved since 2001 and has been overseen and regulated by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, which is also the licensing authority for all qualified ambulance personnel.  In order for a proper discussion to take place on the resources required for the State's ambulance services, it is imperative the recommendations of the NAS capacity review be implemented.</p><p>SIPTU members are committed to working with any and all processes, including future capacity reviews, that will advance the ambulance service.  The huge advances made by our members from the ground up are testament to our credibility in improving the ambulance service through the development of ambulance personnel and services.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for their consideration on this submission.</p></speech>

I have good reason to thank the members of the National Ambulance Service in that on two occasions this year my uncle received wonderful treatment from paramedics and hospital staff.  He is in a nursing home now, having suffered two strokes this year.</p> <p>  On the operating model, as part of a delegation from the constituency a number of years ago I visited the centre in Tallaght.  There are some complaints in regard to ambulances being brought from one county into another.  Is that process operating correctly or is there need for change in terms of improving efficiency of delivery of ambulances?</p></speech>

An example would be from Castletownbere into west Kerry.  Another example would be an ambulance from the midlands being sent into Sligo or as far away as to Galway.  Improvements have to be made in those areas.  Improvements are being discussed and negotiations are ongoing with management on how to alleviate those problems.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is a measure that has been put in place to ensure that there is an ambulance on the road to meet a patient but, unfortunately, if that ambulance has been taken away from its home area that means if there is an incident or a call-out in the home locality there will be no ambulance.  If my understanding is correct, under the old methodology ambulances were provided in geographical areas and they were not permitted to operate outside of those areas.  I can see that that might not have worked well either if there was a call-out on the border of a geographical area and the ambulance was elsewhere.  In regard to the changes that are being recommended, will they improve delivery of the valuable services?</p></speech>

On the issue of call volume and call times, much of the time paramedics are telling us that they are attending calls that there is no need for them to attend.  I am sure my colleagues in DFB will agree with me on the need for an educational programme not only for the general public but for GPs in regard to what type of calls should be allocated to the National Ambulance Service.</p></speech>

They have been called to attend in respect of a person with an eye infection or a broken toenail.  These are matters in respect of which people could make their own way to accident and emergency departments.  There are times when they do not have to attend accident and emergency and can be treated at home.</p></speech>

Within Dublin Fire Brigade, the current system of resourcing previously operated at approximately 5,500 calls per month.  Given the increase in the size of the city, that has increased to approximately 6,500 calls per month.  During the Christmas period, that increases to approximately 7,500 per month as there are more people out and about generating more calls.  The resources have not increased to match that demand and that is creating the problem.  The level of resources that have been in place since the height of the Celtic tiger days are being stretched to meet the needs of a growing city.</p></speech>

I want to start with the issue of staff burn-out as highlighted in Mr. Kenny's opening statement.  It is an issue Mr. Kenny and I have discussed several times.  What is the current level of staff burn-out?  How bad is it and how difficult or challenging is it for paramedics across the board?  I ask Mr. Kenny for a brief overview in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#B02000"><p>I will give two examples.  The service operates on a two 12-hour shift basis, that is, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  Owing to current call volumes, extended duties could run into 16, 17 or 18 hour shifts.  We also have situations where paramedics who answer and are dispatched to calls, especially in rural Ireland, are being stood down when another ambulance becomes available that is closer to that call.  That ambulance may then respond to another call only to be stood down again.  We have examples of paramedics travelling nearly 500 km without ever attending the scene of a client.</p></speech>

Is that prominent right across the board?</p></speech>

Working groups have been set up.  It is hoped the recommendations of those groups will be finalised this evening.  This work will, hopefully, go a long way towards alleviating those problems.  Owing to extended duties we are experiencing high levels of burn-out throughout the staff population.  I would imagine the same applies to personnel in the DFB.</p></speech>

There are two main issues, one of which is the capacity review.  There have been a number of capacity reviews in recent times, including a capacity versus analysis review which commenced in July on which we will engage with the National Ambulance Service and the HSE later.  The capacity review has to look at increasing the staff complement, increasing the fleet and so on.  If I am correct, the working groups will focus on the terms and conditions of employment and some of the other issues raised by Mr. Kenny.</p><p>Am I right in saying there is a number of them?  There is one on the late finish, one on meal breaks, one on rules of engagement and one on emergency deployment points.  Are they the four working groups that are in play?</p></speech>

Is Mr. Kenny satisfied that issues regarding breaks, late finishes, late call-outs and late discharges at the end of shifts will be covered sufficiently in the recommendations from the working groups?</p></speech>

As it is an ambulance service, the ECHO and emergency calls will have to be responded to.  There is no ambulance professional in this country who is not going to attend the scene of a cardiac arrest, regardless of meal breaks or anything else.  That is imperative and all the staff in both the National Ambulance Service and DFB are committed to that.</p></speech>

In the previous contribution Mr. Kenny spoke about some of the call-outs not being calls that an ambulance crew should be responding to.  There is a need for a public awareness campaign in that regard.  How much of a difficulty or challenge is it, especially when there are major pressures on the system, if ambulance paramedics are being called out to calls they should not be called to perhaps because people cannot get access to out-of-hours GP services or whatever the issue might be that is driving that?  How problematic is it?</p> <p>  Second, we have been hearing for some time about the treat and refer policy as well, where a paramedic would be able to manage a person in the home or wherever the person is at the point of the call-out and may not necessarily have to bring the person to an acute hospital, if possible.  What is the position with that at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#C01200"><p>There are two pilot projects at present - one in Cork city and one that has started in Tralee - where those systems are up and running.  It has alleviated pressure, as patients are treated at home and do not need to use an ambulance.  It frees up spaces in the emergency department.  We want to see the roll-out of that across the country, to be honest, because ambulances being dispatched to calls that do not necessarily need an ambulance is a core fundamental issue for our membership.  The sooner we take them off the table and treat them either at home or by GPs, the sooner that will free up the ambulance for the emergency and urgent work that is needed.</p></speech>

The firefighters in Dublin Fire Brigade are facing a serious crewing shortage at present.  As can be seen in our submission, that is resulting in, at times, up to 20% of the fleet not being available for service and scenarios where the fire brigade is becoming increasingly reliant on overtime to try to cover the city to the greatest extent possible.  Potentially, up to 150 new firefighters need to be recruited into the service.  All of this is having a massive impact on the morale of staff and their fatigue levels.  It is becoming increasingly detrimental.  However, I am sure the committee will join me in paying tribute to the personnel in both the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service because despite those challenges, which are increasing, as the members of the committee will learn in the course of this meeting, they are continuing to make life-saving interventions and are saving lives in this city in the case of Dublin Fire Brigade and around the country in the case of the National Ambulance Service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#C01600"><p>Absolutely, and I echo that.  I have two brief questions before finishing.  I will refer back to Mr. Kenny.  There are the capacity reviews and there is a staff complement of just over 2,200 in the National Ambulance Service.  Comparisons were made to Scotland, which some would argue is the best comparison that can be made to our service.  That comparison would lead to a very substantial increase in staff numbers as Scotland has approximately 5,000.  Is the review looking at the Scottish model or has it looked at it and what additional capacity is needed?</p> <p>  Second, I have received a great deal of correspondence, confidentially, from some ambulance paramedics.  They have not made protected disclosures so I have to be careful how I present this.  They are ambulance paramedics who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  What industrial relations processes are in place to assist and support paramedics who have gone through that?  Are they appropriate and are they working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#C01700"><p>On the first question about the capacity review, Scotland has 5,000 personnel and the National Ambulance Service has just over 2,000 personnel.  We want that to grow to double the number.  We also want to see the number of ambulances extended by at least 100, if not 200 ambulances.  We want that to be done in the next three to five years, at a minimum.  The National Ambulance Service has been modelled on the Scottish system.  We have been over to Scotland and seen how that works but, sadly, the investment in the national service in Ireland has not been to the same extent as it is in the Scottish system and we have fallen drastically behind.</p> <p>  I concur with what Mr. McEvoy said.  The reliance on overtime in the National Ambulance Service and the DFB is causing massive burnout.</p> <p>  On the question relating to post-traumatic stress among our membership, there is a wide range of supports in the National Ambulance Service.  I believe there are not enough and there should be a lot more.  The professional ambulance personnel in this country are the first to horrifying scenes involving all ages, be it road traffic accidents or sudden cardiac arrests in young people or in all ages.  There should be more resources for those personnel to help them recover after the call to such traumatic scenes.</p></speech>

I also pay a big tribute to the front-line workers who work in the ambulance service and the fire brigade.  I do not know how they keep going, particularly in the current circumstances.  Could Mr. Kenny give a little more detail about the investment in, and better staffing of, pre-hospital emergency care?  There is no doubt that it could assist and remove pressure from the ambulance service.</p> <p>  With regard to supports for staff in general, mental health support is an area in which I have a specific interest.  I believe that everybody who works in the ambulance service and the fire brigade needs that support, regardless of whether the person asks for it.  I cannot imagine the trauma of going to work every day and having to face God only knows what.  Can Mr. Kenny expand on the supports that are there?</p></speech>

There must be a commitment by the Government that it will fully resource whatever the review's recommendation on numbers is.  If we want to grow the NAS by doubling its staff over the next three to five years, funding must be made available not only for staffing, but also fleet resources.</p><p> The retention of staff is under consideration.  It is a major issue.  We have people coming into the organisation - Mr. McEvoy can comment on the DFB - who are not staying within the NAS.  They are moving on, either into the wider HSE or to other jurisdictions.</p><p> Regarding burnout supports, there are in place employee assistance programmes which staff can attend.  There are also occupational health services which they can seek.  The mental health issue should be explored more and more resources should be put in place.  Many paramedics whom I meet outside the job tell me about the horrifying calls they have attended and how, after returning to base, no member of management approached them to see how those calls went.  Even though management and the call centres were aware of the calls, there was no follow-up with the paramedics, advanced paramedics and other ambulance personnel.  This issue has to be examined.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#D00300"><p>I will speak to some of the points that the Senator raised.  On investment in staffing and recruitment, there is a critical need for additional recruitment into the fire service in Dublin.  This issue is impacting on ambulance provision, which is the subject of today's discussion, but also on the fire service.  It is jeopardising the safe system of work under which firefighters need to operate and is creating health and safety concerns in that regard.</p> <p>  On early interventions and pre-hospital care, it is worth reminding the committee and anyone who is watching about the service that the personnel in the DFB and the NAS can provide.  It is not simply that someone calls an ambulance, it arrives at the scene and the person is put into the back of it and taken to hospital.  The personnel are trained to be able to deliver critical paramedic care as soon as they arrive.  That is saving lives and producing better outcomes for patients but it takes longer.  When we consider questions of response times, we also need to factor in the type of care and work that is going on during that time.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned supports.  I will not go into the details but perhaps some of my colleagues can provide them.  It is the case that DFB crews see the worst that life in the city has to offer.  They arrive on scenes involving road traffic accidents, domestic fires and incidents in the city centre.  They deal with the absolute worst on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I will make a comment while he unmutes himself.  I can only imagine the trauma of what ambulance and fire brigade personnel must face on a daily basis.  With my therapist hat on, we are committed to getting supervision for some of the work that we do.  What we do is nothing compared to the trauma dealt with by ambulance and fire brigade personnel.  Could supervision be considered?  I understand that this all comes down to resources but it is vital that workers in this area be supported whereby they can have supervision and speak about the trauma they meet on a daily basis.  They could encounter not one, but two, three or four major traumas per day.  I cannot imagine how they do that and then go home and try to live normal lives.  It is extremely stressful and should be addressed.</p> <p>  I see that Mr. Ray has raised his hand.  Does he want to reply?</p></speech>

The NAS also services Dublin city and faces the same challenges in terms of mental health and the calls its personnel meet.  We often collaborate with our colleagues on the same scenes.  We all share the same experiences, both in Dublin city and in the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I congratulate and thank them for the work they have done over the past couple of years in particular but also on an ongoing basis.  We must acknowledge that the public rely on them in the emergency situations to which they respond.  It is appreciated.</p> <p>  Apropos of the questions on capacity and so on that have been raised, the witnesses will say that there is a requirement to improve capacity significantly, but do they believe it can be improved sufficiently to meet the kinds of exigency they have in mind in light of what has occurred in recent years?  Will the augmentation be sufficient to meet those requirements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#D00900"><p>It will if the numbers in the NAS and DFB are increased significantly but the problem throughout all of the health sector is the recruitment and shortage of staff.  Not only has the NAS a problem in recruiting staff but we also have a retention problem.  This is why there is a job in hand in the NAS in terms of roles and responsibilities.  I have been dealing with the NAS as an official for the past 25 or 26 years.  It is only recently that I took over the role of sector organiser dealing nationally with the Irish Ambulance Representative Council, IRAC, and the sectoral committees in trying to resolve those issues.  We hope that the roles and responsibilities will be finalised next week.</p> <p>  There are not many people who are interested in becoming paramedics right now.  Two issues are affecting this, the first of which is bad press about long distances.  Why would anyone want to do a shift of 15, 16 or 17 hours?  Why would anyone want to join an organisation where he or she cannot get meal breaks?  These are fundamental issues.  Another is that the rates of pay attached to the NAS have fallen far behind other health professionals' rates.  The job in hand in respect of roles and responsibilities will address that.  I hope that it will be accepted by the HSE, the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government and that, whatever comes out of that work on roles and responsibilities, it will be supported by the Government in order to allow us to grow capacity within the NAS.  It is all incorporated.</p></speech>

It is becoming more difficult to source staff in services, manufacturing and almost all other areas of our economy.  It is just a feature of the times.  Will the witnesses indicate what the starter rates are?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.769" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Ray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#E00200"><p>Regarding the challenges on the rate of pay, for the training grade the salary is approximately &euro;25,000.  What has to be considered is that people are entering a bachelor of science degree programme over three years.  The difficulty is that we generally get people into the organisation who have a bit of life experience.  It is the type of profession where people need life experience.  We cannot have school leavers coming into the type of job we do; that is not going to work.  It can be economically challenging for a lot of people to consider this career.  Starting on a salary of &euro;25,000, getting a bachelor of science degree, moving to a salary of just over &euro;30,000 after qualification and then having an 11-year wait to move through the pay scales is difficult.  People may have a strong desire to enter this profession, but the difficulty is economic.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.771" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Ray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#E00400"><p>For the first eight years they are applied every year, and the final long service increment has a three-year wait.  It takes people 11 years to get to the top rate.  There is nothing unique about this; it is linked to HSE pay scales.  The difficulty is that the ambulance service looks for people with a significant amount of life and coping skills to ensure they are able to deal with what they will face.  A lot of people who come into this job have families and we have challenges with relocation to anywhere around the country due to the fact it is a national service.  We have tried to ameliorate the situation on a number of occasions, but there has been limited success.</p> <p>  Generally it takes people a bit of time to get back to where they want to be.  The crippling costs of relocation post qualification in the National Ambulance Service are very economically and domestically challenging for a lot of people.  Within the capital, there is a difficulty with rising rents and housing costs.  We face the same challenges as all other professions.  The challenge is whether people can live a comfortable life on the pay rate that currently exist.  Unfortunately, the answer is "No" considering what people put into and get out of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#E00500"><p>Do the witnesses think that the infrastructure in the ambulance services generally, including the number, quality and condition of ambulances, is in accord with what one would expect in an ambulance service responding to emergency cases and the need to be ready and in tip top order at all times?  I refer to how the ambulance service works nowadays.  For example, ambulances had to wait at hospital when delivering patients and were ticking over while waiting to go to the next call.  They were out of service throughout the waiting period at ambulance bays in hospitals.  To what extent has that been eliminated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#E00600"><p>On the first question, the National Ambulance Service has significantly improved its fleet.  The ambulances are of a high standard.  Waiting times in accident and emergency departments are a major issue and challenge for us on two fronts.  Given the Covid pathway in accident and emergency departments, ambulances could wait for five, six or seven hours to get Covid patients through a department due to the availability of beds.  There are now many protocols around Covid, PPE and cleaning and decontaminating vehicles and beds in accident and emergency departments and hospitals.  They are all challenging aspects for the National Ambulance Service.</p> <p>  The waiting time for non-Covid patients in some accident and emergency departments can be anything up to two or three hours.  That is an issue that has to be addressed.  Scotland has hospital liaison officers attached to each acute hospital who liaise to free up ambulances.  That is being considered by a working group.  There is a belief that after its meeting later today there will be a recommendation that will help to alleviate the problem and free ambulances to go to the next available call.</p></speech>

Nothing can ever underestimate the amount of work our ambulance paramedics and fire service have done, in particular during Covid.  It worries me that we are not giving them the recognition they deserve and that some are burned out.  That is something we need to address.  It is concerning.  We know that there is a process of discussion with SIPTU through the IARC.  Can Mr. Kenny tell us who elects the IARC and what it is?  Does ambulance management ever talk directly to staff?  Is there a process by which to do so?  Can he explain how this works as a possible assistance in improving things?  There are definitely huge issues.</p></speech>

It is made up of not only SIPTU but the Unite trade union.  SIPTU, Unite and F&oacute;rsa represent the National Ambulance Service.  F&oacute;rsa represents the clerical staff and some officers, along with SIPTU.  Unite normally represents paramedics and ambulance personnel in the Waterford area and certain parts of the north east and north west.</p> <p>  The IARC committee is elected throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  There are 13 representatives in total and they are elected for a period of five years.  That committee deals directly with management.  Each IARC committee member feeds back directly to members in his or her locality.  That is how the system operates.  There are a series of general meetings with staff members and the officials.  </p> <p>  I deal with the National Ambulance Service on behalf of SIPTU for all of the national issues.  We have a number of local officials who deal with all of the local issues in various counties.  They in turn meet members.  Over the past 18 months to two years physical meetings have not happened because of Covid and a lot of meetings are now done through Microsoft Teams.</p></speech>

Is there any way of improving that?  I have seen this in different areas.  Ambulance paramedics can address issues and problems they know about in their local areas.  I welcome the involvement of management, but as the witnesses know paramedics know what is happening locally.  If they cannot bring a particular issue to the attention of management or unions that then becomes a major issue.  Do the witnesses have concerns about that?  Do they feel there is another way to address members to ensure they have more of a say?  Having spoken to paramedics, I feel that some of them want to be listened to.  Do the witnesses think that can happen?  How can we make those changes?</p></speech>

Within the general membership we are trying to get a shop steward set up in each ambulance base in Ireland.</p><p>We are in the process of issuing a newsletter to all SIPTU members outlining everything that has been achieved since we took over on 1 July, with all the concerns that have been raised across the country on behalf of our membership.  If members in any part of the country have any issues, they will contact their local shop stewards, who will, in turn, contact their local official.  If it is a localised issue, it will be dealt with locally and if it is a national issue, it will be referred to me and dealt with through the IARC.</p></speech>

Is there a lot of movement of roles from one area to another?  That is another issue that might need to be looked at.  Things are changing all the time.  Many management posts and other posts are not permanent.  There are part-time posts and whatever else.  There is a lot of movement within the sector.  Is Mr. Kenny concerned about that?</p></speech>

What is the situation with regard to management roles?  Are there full-time management roles that are there constantly?  Are there other issues?  Is there movement from one area of the country to another, or whatever?  Is there always someone in the base to represent the ambulance paramedics?</p></speech>

The situation is quite clear.  Management of the National Ambulance Service operate 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, Monday to Friday.  No one is there after 5 p.m. until 9 a.m. the following morning between Monday and Friday.  There is no one there from 5 p.m. on Friday until 9 a.m. on Monday morning.  We represent the officers in the National Ambulance Service, along with our sister union, F&oacute;rsa.  A business plan has been submitted to the Government and approved for an increase of approximately 136 officer positions in the National Ambulance Service over the next three years.  That will necessitate 24-7 cover and that will come into being.  Our officer grade members have issues around that.  Those need to be addressed.  However, that is a separate discussion to the discussion we are having today about delays on the road.</p></speech>

We have all learnt a lot as a result of this morning's engagement.  I have a couple of questions.  What is the average call-out time, if our guests have that information?  From the time someone requests the assistance of an ambulance, what is the response time?  Have our guests the average response time for 2021 and can they compare that to the average time ten years ago?</p></speech>

All I know is there have been recent examples where people have been waiting for an ambulance for up to three, four or five hours.</p></speech>

My mother fell two weeks ago and broke her hip.  The ambulance was there in 40 minutes.  I am being told that is a good result, given the fact that people in a similar situation can be waiting up to two hours.  The biggest problem is the reliance on overtime.  That seems to be a major problem.  Overtime should be considered a stopgap, something that is used in rare situations when required.  It certainly should not be standard on a weekly basis.  Are our guests aware of much absenteeism as a result of Covid-19?  Have many members of our guests' organisations been hit with Covid?  How has Covid affected our guests and the jobs they are doing?  I know there is increased use of personal protective equipment and so on.  Would many members of our guests' organisations feel they contacted Covid through their work?  Have many been off sick with Covid?  Are many of them now suffering with long Covid?</p></speech>

We all remember when that flight arrived from Bologna and the passengers on that flight were all contacted.  I happened to be on duty at that time.  From then, day one, there has been significant staffing resilience when it comes to Covid sick leave and all the associated matters.  The same has applied to us as has applied to anyone else working in healthcare.  The difficulty was that we did not have the back-up staffing resilience within the organisation to face the issue head-on.  We redeployed staff to pop-up swab testing sites and vaccination teams.  We were at the forefront and centre of that.  The ambulance service traditionally has quite a gung-ho approach to atypical circumstances, as is true of all other emergency services.  We took that approach without question, even though it had an impact on the delivery of traditional, day-to-day services.  Covid has had an enormous impact overall.  We do not know how long that will continue.</p></speech>

Our support and solidarity go with his colleagues who have suffered from Covid.

Is there a particular black spot in the country that our guests would like to use this meeting to highlight?</p></speech>

Using County Kerry as an example, we have ambulance bases in Tralee, Killarney, Dingle, Listowel, Caherciveen and Kenmare.  A couple of weeks ago, all those ambulances were either tied up in the accident and emergency department of University Hospital Kerry or were out of the county.  There was a road traffic accident in Slea Head, outside Dingle, and the ambulance sent to the scene was dispatched from Castletownbere, two and a half hours away.  If there was an incident in Castletownbere when that ambulance was on route, an ambulance would have been dispatched from somewhere else.  There is a triple effect all the time.</p></speech>

As others have, I thank them for all the work they have done, both seen and unseen, over the past year and a half, and for the essential emergency service they provide.  Mr. Kenny spoke about Slea Head, an area I know intimately because my mother was from Ballyferriter.  The idea that an ambulance would have to come from Castletownbere to Slea Head is pretty shocking.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Kenny for his presentation.  He has already answered most of the questions I was going to ask but there might be one or two that have not yet been answered.  How effective does Mr. Kenny think a dispatch system is if it sends crews on a call from Donegal to Tipperary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.796" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#F01800"><p>The problem with the dispatch system that is there is that it is all based on HIQA standards and response times.  That is where the fundamental issue arises for our membership.  Senator Conway asked how long it takes for an ambulance to be dispatched.  He asked whether I know the average response time.  I am sure management, who will be attending the following session of this meeting, will be able to give the committee those times.  We have not been furnished with those times and have no access to them.  Since the cyberattack, the HSE does not publish those details.  The situation is quite clear.  Once a call comes in, whatever is the next available resource is dispatched.  As the Deputy said, that could well mean an ambulance in Donegal is dispatched to a call in Tipperary.</p><p>We have no hope of getting to that scene in any realistic time.  It is only done just to keep the figures under HIQA standards on track.  I am not sure about the incident the Deputy is talking about and whether the ambulance actually arrived on scene.  If it did, I would imagine it would have taken anything up to five hours to get to the scene.  Normally the ambulance would be dispatched and if another ambulance became available closer to the scene, the ambulance from County Donegal would be stood down and the other ambulance sent.</p></speech>

Is this a regular occurrence or is it completely out of the question for a dispatch system to send a crew on call from County Donegal to County Tipperary that is diverted en route to Mullingar, then to County Mayo, and then to County Donegal?  Is it completely out of the question that this could occur?</p></speech>

It happens on a daily basis.  As I said earlier, we have crews that have put up 500 km and in some cases 700 km in a day, being dispatched to calls and being stood down without actually arriving at the scene of any call.  They have seen no patient in the course of their duties but they still put up 500 km or 700 km in that day.  It is absolutely frightening what is going on.</p></speech>

The resources are not there.  That is what we are saying about the capacity review.  That is the fundamental argument we have.  At the moment the National Ambulance Service has approximately 2,000 employees.  Scotland, the nearest comparable service the NAS has looked at, has 5,000 personnel.  We are behind.  The investment in the service has not been there for the past six or seven years.  It is shocking and to the detriment of the service that this has been allowed to happen.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we are in a national forum so I do not want to go into specifics.  There have been incidents widely covered in the national media.  A situation was described on Cork local radio, 96 FM, a couple of weeks ago, where a person was only 20 minutes from a hospital.  I think it was his mother who went into cardiac arrest and the nearest available ambulance was two and a half hours away even though the hospital was only 20 minutes away.  That individual was advised to transfer his mum to the hospital.  Sadly she died in the car on the way.</p> <p>  The answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes", undoubtedly.   It is happening across the length and breadth of the country.  We saw harrowing testament in the National Ambulance Service.  I am sure my colleague, Mr. McEvoy, or Mr. McCann in Dublin Fire Brigade have similar instances of that happening within Dublin city.  My colleagues Mr. Ray and Mr. Lyons, who work with the NAS in Dublin city, will say the same.</p></speech>

I have had very close contact with them as a Deputy over the years.  There are reports claiming that HSE figures show that ambulances turned up to life-threatening events more than an hour late on 300 occasions in the first six months of 2021.  Is that accurate?</p></speech>

I would imagine management will be able to answer more categorically in the committee's next session.  I see no reason to dispute those figures from my knowledge of what is happening in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Kenny elaborate on why emergency departments cause such delays?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#G01100"><p>I covered this earlier.  When an ambulance arrives at an emergency department there are two pathways.  First is a Covid pathway.  If a Covid patient arrives, there could be a delay of anything between five and seven hours to transfer him or her from the back of an ambulance into the hospital.  In normal situations where Covid is not a factor, it can take anything up to two and half or three hours to transfer a patient from an ambulance.  That is all being considered at the moment in respect of working groups and that.  We hope to have recommendations out this afternoon to address those issues.</p> <p>  The issue is twofold.  We are relying on the handover from staff in the emergency department and they are under-resourced as well, there is no point saying any different.  Because of the Covid situation there is a shortage of beds in acute hospitals.  That is where the delays start.  There have been times in acute hospitals where we could see between five and seven ambulances outside the emergency department, waiting for between two and seven hours.  That has a knock-on effect when calls come through the national control centre for emergency work and there is no ambulance available.  That is why we have an ambulance coming from County Donegal to County Tipperary.</p></speech>

I am sure they are dealing with very challenging situations on a daily basis.  I thank them for the care and service they provide.</p> <p>  I want to touch on two issues.  One is turnaround times at hospitals. Does the ambulance service sit down and discuss the issues with management?  Are the front-line medical people also involved in those discussions or is it just purely with management?  I have heard of a number of cases where the ambulance service seems to have the answers and knows what the problems are but is not being listened to by the hospitals.  What level of engagement is there and who is involved?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#G02200"><p>I had a few pieces to add in response to Deputy Lahart's questions about mobilisation and the queues at hospitals.  From the Dublin Fire Brigade point of view, they allow for approximately an hour for an ambulance call-out from dispatch to delivery at the hospital and returning to duty.  That factors in 20 to 30 minutes of a hospital wait time as per Mr. Ray's contribution.  Before Covid there was a small percentage of hospital waits that exceeded 30 minutes - approximately 4% or 5%.  That figure has tripled since Covid.  The Deputy was asking about dispatch within an hour.  If we are seeing ambulances that could be returning to service idling for an hour outside hospitals, that will clearly have an impact on the wait time for dispatch to the next call.</p><p>As Mr. Kenny said, we know the problems and the staff are under great pressure.  However, because of the importance of maintaining the critical chain of care, ambulance crews must stay at hospitals until they can pass over to personnel in the accident and emergency department.  Unless those structural problems facing our colleagues in accident and emergency departments in hospital environments are addressed, this problem will not be entirely solved.</p><p> On resources, there was reference in our presentation to unit mobilisation.  That refers to the hypothetical maximum capacity if every ambulance in Dublin Fire Brigade was on the road 24 hours a day, 365 days a week.  Dublin Fire Brigade is operating at approximately 85% of that capacity.  Ideally, it should be between 45% and 55%.  This shows that more ambulances are needed and more personnel need to be hired because the 85% figure does not factor in break times for crew or periods during which vehicles need to be serviced.  For example, an ambulance involved in an accident may be out of commission.  There is no capacity in the existing service without additional resourcing.</p><p> Deputy Burke's question might best be addressed to our colleagues in management because there is communication at managerial level between Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service.  That question might be best directed to those colleagues.  I note my colleague, Mr. McCann, wants to respond.</p></speech>

Would Mr. Kenny deal with the issue I raised about the link with hospitals?  Is that link purely with management or are the front-line staff in accident and emergency departments such as the nurses and doctors involved in those discussions?  I have heard from ambulance personnel that they have a solution but they are not being listened to.</p></speech>

Various ambulance officers at ambulance bases attached to or in the area of acute hospitals with accident and emergency departments would liaise with managers in the hospitals when there are delays.  In Kerry, where I am based, I have spoke to the general manager of the hospital more than once about ambulance waiting times outside the accident and emergency department to see what can be done.  It is a challenging problem.</p></speech>

We bring the concerns of our membership about waiting times in accident and emergency departments to management.  Ambulance service management bring those concerns to hospital management, which will discuss them.  There should be a co-ordinated group.  The Deputy is right and we have asked for that.  Meetings should be set up with all the stakeholders, namely, accident and emergency nurses, consultants, ambulance paramedics, advanced paramedics, ambulance management, hospital management and the unions to discuss all of that and draw up a template.  That should be done not only on a localised hospital basis but for all hospitals nationally.</p></speech>

I might get a call tomorrow morning to say that paramedics were delayed by five or six hours in University Hospital Kerry.  If so, that would be addressed the following morning by ambulance management and hospital management to make sure the problem is alleviated.  There is no national approach, however, which is a pity.</p></speech>

We have been endeavouring to get that involvement.</p> <p>  From the perspective of the National Ambulance Service, a hospital liaison officer should be deployed in hospitals.  That would free up accident and emergency departments and deal with the issue of transferring patients from hospitals to free up beds.  That approach works extremely well in Scotland.  It was done on a trial basis in University Hospital Kerry and it worked well.  It reduced the cost of patient transport for the hospital.  The National Ambulance Service provided most of the transfers, which previously were provided by taxis and private companies.</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny spoke of a hospital liaison officer.  In other jurisdictions that development has worked very well.  The hospital liaison officer is on the bed management teams in hospitals and, therefore, is intricately involved and has an understanding both from the ambulance perspective and the hospital perspective.  It is a good bridging mechanism between the ambulance service and the hospital.  In addition, with control centres, other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland, have a dedicated bed availability desk where they can see the availability across all hospitals they serve.  That is another helpful element.</p> <p>  A third element is an expansion of the intermediate care vehicle, ICV, service.  The more patients moved from hospital back to tertiary treatment - a lower level hospital or nursing home - following treatment, the better.  We need an expansion of the ICV service to come under the remit of the National Ambulance Service.  That service is somewhat lacking.  It is a matter of attracting people into that service with the proper pay rates.  Those are the solutions.</p></speech>

The figures from Dublin Fire Brigade show there were 8,532 calls in November 2020 whereas there were 12,657 in November 2021, an increase of more than 4,000.  That is a substantial increase in one year for the same month.  Is there any explanation for that dramatic increase in a 12-month period?  Could some of those people have used a means of transport other than an ambulance to get to a medical facility?</p></speech>

A number of factors are causing the increase in the number of calls.  Demographic change is one.  One of the challenges, which we referred to in our submission and my colleague, Mr. Kenny, also referenced, is with respect to the designation of urgencies in ambulance calls.  We have an echo call for cardiac cases and a delta call for the life-threatening but non-cardiac cases.  Delta calls account for nearly half the call-outs for Dublin Fire Brigade but there is no capacity to drill down into them in any more detail or to subdivide them further.  As such, that becomes a less useful metric.  When members speak to the representatives of management they will probably be able to give a much more detailed breakdown of the figures to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

It happens daily.  We see GPs and members of the public using, or trying to avail of, ambulances for incidents or illnesses that do not necessarily require one.  The people concerned, or their relatives, could use their own transport to get to an accident and emergency department.  Equally, it could be the case that there may be no need to go to an accident and emergency department at all and treatment might be possible at home.</p> <p>  We are aware of instances where ambulances have been sent out to people with eye infections and broken toenails, and absolutely crazy stuff like that.  As I said earlier, there must be a media-driven campaign targeted at GPs and the public to clarify the circumstances in which an ambulance should be called.  Ambulances should be called in an emergency.</p></speech>

Recently, we heard proposals from the Minister to fill vacancies.  How would the witnesses respond to those proposals?  Are they ambitious enough?  Will they be sufficient to fill the gaps in the services?</p> <p>  In addition, regarding the joint emergency medical response model operating in the Dublin region, it has been suggested that paramedics be trained up in this regard.  Donegal was mentioned earlier, and it has been suggested that this joint emergency medical response model should be replicated and rolled out across the country.  Are staff skill sets countrywide sufficient to facilitate this model, or is the required availability unique to Dublin?  Those are my two quick questions.  Who would like to take them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.842" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#J00700"><p>I will take the first part.  The reality is that the proposals put forward thus far are not sufficient.  As I said earlier, we need 450 firefighters to be recruited into the service.  Each new intake of recruits will bring in 45 new firefighters.  The educational process then takes about six months.  Therefore, by the time those six months have passed, there will have also been six months of retirements, etc.  At the rate we are going with recruitment overall, it will not be possible to catch up with the problem.  We are so far behind now that recruitment must be drastically accelerated.  In addition, a competition for promotion into officer grades is under way in Dublin Fire Brigade.  That is fantastic.  A panel will be created for the competition, and good luck to everyone on it.  Equally, though, the vacancies created will need to be backfilled with extra firefighters.  At the current rate of recruitment we are never even going to catch up with the problem, let alone get ahead of it.  Rapidly accelerated recruitment will be required in the next one or two years to get staff levels up to where they need to be.</p> <p>  Regarding the joint emergency medical service provided for in Dublin and the co-operation that exists between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade in that respect, one thing to add is that there are also staff who are retained firefighters who could enhance that service by answering medical calls.  The main point to make about the service, however, is that it has been extremely valuable to the people of Dublin.  The system's capacity to respond to medical emergencies and serious incidents is beyond comparison.  I do not know if the capacity exists around the country to replicate the model, but it is one which has worked wonders and saved lives within Dublin city.  It has ensured that a fleet of vehicles is available from the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  Their facilities are already spread around the city.  For example, there are 12 full-time fire stations and two part-time, retained, stations in the city.  </p> <p>  The capacity to dispatch ambulances, paramedic crews and fire appliances to incidents means it is possible to intervene in the critical life-saving minutes, for example, if there is a cardiac incident.  Equally, the capacity exists to deal with a serious incident or a road traffic collision in respect of creating a safe environment in which personnel can operate to bring people safely out of vehicles and transport them to accident and emergency departments, and then to reopen the area.  I am not sure that the people of Dublin know or can fully appreciate the true value of all that is achieved by colleagues from different services working holistically together.  I refer to the context in this regard of the training which exists within Dublin Fire Brigade.  Working in conjunction with the staff of the National Ambulance Service, personnel arriving on the scene can attend to putting out a fire, rescuing people from vehicles, operating the equipment and working as paramedics.  I am not sure if similar capacity is available across the country.  Perhaps Mr. Kenny can speak to that aspect.  I can only speak about what the model has achieved in Dublin.  If it could be replicated, the outcomes for people countrywide could only be beneficial.</p></speech>

To address the Chair's question about skill sets, they exist within the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade in respect of advanced paramedics, etc.  There is an eagerness to deliver the services that the people in the capital and around the country deserve.</p> <p>  The National Ambulance Service needs more staff than are graduating from the National Ambulance Training College.  The Dublin Fire Brigade is in the same situation with its Fire Brigade Training Centre at the O'Brien Institute.  We would also like to endeavour to increase our capital and estate footprint across the city.  Every organisation realises that having more resources also gives rise to a requirement for a matching increase in related facilities.  For example, the more vehicles available, the greater will be the need for locations to put them into, etc.  Therefore, we share the same sentiments, and we work well together.  Equally, we deliver, and endeavour to deliver, a premium service to the people of the capital city.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we want to increase the number of ambulance personnel to between 4,000 and 5,000 in the next three to five years.  To do that, we must ensure that the job is made attractive enough to ensure that people will apply for the posts.  The only way that can be done is through the roles and responsibilities and the rates of pay attached to the new job descriptions.  We will only see people applying when those aspects are finalised for intermediate care operatives, paramedics, advanced paramedics, leading emergency medical technicians, clinical paramedic supervisors, and all that is accepted and agreed by the Government.  It will then be necessary to address issues such as meal breaks, extended duties, etc.  I reiterate that I hope we will have good, structured feedback from the working groups this evening and that implementation processes will be put in place.  It will only be when all those aspects come together, under the capacity review, that we will be able to entice people with the required skill sets into the National Ambulance Service and to expand its operations.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Morton, Dr. O&rsquo;Donnell and Ms Mahon.</p> <p>  NAS is the statutory pre-hospital emergency and intermediate care provider for the State.  The service has more than 100 locations, in excess of 2,000 staff and a fleet of 630 vehicles.  Since 2015, NAS staffing has increased by over 500.  Since 2019, the NAS fleet has increased by 21%.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan acknowledges that there is an ever-increasing need to support healthcare in moving away from a hospital-centric model that results in high emergency department, ED, attendance and high hospital occupancy rates. The NAS strategy to 2020 focused on achieving a shift in the operating model from an emergency medical service to a mobile medical service.  The NAS strategy to 2026 will continue to accelerate this shift by developing more services to treat more patients in the right setting, improving patient experience and clinical outcomes and supporting a reduction in pressures on EDs.</p> <p>  Additional funding is required to support this continuing transformation.  NAS&rsquo;s 2021 opening budget was &euro;187.5 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;13.6 million, or 7.8%, and is the largest year-on-year budget received by NAS.  In 2022, the total budget available to NAS is expected to reach &euro;200 million.  NAS will play a continuing role in the public health response to Covid-19 and will receive in excess of &euro;10 million to recruit 160 dedicated posts in 2022 for mobile testing and outbreak teams.  In 2020, NAS responded to more than 362,000 ambulance calls.  Its intermediate care service transports approximately 40,000 patients per annum, co-ordinates and dispatches more than 800 aeromedical calls and completes 600 paediatric or neonatal transfers.  In the Dublin metropolitan area, ambulance services are provided by both NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB.</p> <p>  NAS resources are dispatched to calls received by the national emergency operations centre, NEOC, which operates across two sites, Dublin and Ballyshannon, and represents a &euro;50 million plus investment by the State.  NEOC operates on a nearest available to the incident basis and not on a county boundary basis.  NEOC represents international standards and best practice in clinically triaging and prioritising emergency calls.  Therefore, life-threatening calls receive an immediate and appropriate response, while lower acuity calls may have to wait until a resource becomes available.  Resources are dynamically deployed to areas where cover is required, or to respond to incidents as they arise, to ensure that the nearest available resources respond to emergencies.</p> <p>  The current deployment model is designed around international best practice and has eliminated previous practices where the nearest ambulance was not always dispatched due to former legacy boundaries.  For example, an ambulance based in Killarney may be dispatched to a call in Cork, if it has just handed over a patient at Cork University Hospital and is the nearest available ambulance to the incident.  In addition, NAS is expanding the hear-and-treat alternative care pathway for low acuity calls operated by doctors and nurses and, in due course, specialist paramedics, in NEOC&rsquo;s clinical hub for patients not requiring the dispatch of an emergency ambulance.</p> <p>  Response time standards for life-threatening calls were first published by HIQA in 2011 and remain as recommended standards.  The HSE adopted these as key performance indicators, KPIs, based on the following targets: 80% of echo calls at a national aggregate level to be responded to within 19 minutes and 70% of delta calls at a national aggregate level to be responded to within 19 minutes.  The HSE service plan includes these KPIs on the basis that the expected volume of 112 and 999 calls, and ambulance turnaround times at EDs, will remain within expected tolerances as published in the plan.  These calls account for approximately 45% of all emergency calls.  All other emergency calls are not encompassed by any response time standard, target or KPI, which reflects their low acuity status.</p> <p>  Since the pandemic began, NAS has experienced longer offload delays at EDs.  Infection prevention and control measures have increased the length of time spent dealing with patients resulting in longer call durations.  Recruitment of paramedics and intermediate care operatives is an ongoing challenge both to fill existing vacancies and resource new developments.  A NAS 2015 baseline capacity review found a significant number of additional staff would be required over the coming years to support NAS.  Since 2015, NAS has increased its staff numbers each year.  However, each year the level of demand for services is also growing.  This year, recruitment to NAS is being outpaced by demand for our services, which has grown by almost 30%.  There is no ready supply of paramedics in Ireland and NAS, for the most part, must educate its own workforce in its own college.  The paramedic programme is degree level and represents four academic years completed over three calendar years.  There are currently more than 200 student paramedics at different stages of the programme.  The surge in demand for the service has come at a time when staff are working hard to support Covid-related activities.  The level of demand now exceeds levels experienced in 2019.  The pressure on everyone working in NAS has been immense.  However, both our staff and our trade union partners have stepped up at the time of our greatest challenge.  Their contribution has been enormous.</p> <p>  In the period 2017 to 2027, NAS predicts demand through 999 to increase by 107%.  Given the rapidly widening gap between capacity and demand, NAS commissioned a new independent capacity demand analysis in July 2021, which is now well under way, to inform future workforce planning.  The outcome is expected to represent a significant and sustained increase in NAS staffing each year over the next five years.  This month, 80 paramedics will graduate from NAS college.  In 2022, and in advance of the outcome of the independent capacity demand analysis, NAS is already planning to recruit 200 additional student paramedics and 200 additional emergency medical technicians.</p></speech>

Firefighters are also trained paramedics and rotate continuously between firefighting and emergency medical service duties.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation.  I welcome the opportunity to attend and discuss the issues facing the ambulance services.  I am the chief fire officer for Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance service.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, district officer Martin O&rsquo;Reilly and senior executive officer Una Joyce.</p> <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade provides the function of the fire authority for the four Dublin local authorities, namely, Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council.  The brigade operates a 24-7 fire, rescue and emergency ambulance service from 12 full-time and two retained fire stations.  We also operate the east regional communications centre, an administrative headquarters, a fire prevention and enforcement section and a brigade training centre and logistics.</p> <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency cover to Dublin city and county, a region with a population of more than 1.43 million or 28.5% of the total population, covering an area of 922 sq. km.  In 2020, Dublin Fire Brigade processed in excess of 173,000 emergency fire and ambulance 999 or 112 calls.  There were 31,723 mobilisations to fire and rescue calls and 96,000 mobilisations to ambulance calls.  Dublin Fire Brigade is particularly proactive with respect to safety and has achieved international accreditation, and-or memoranda of understanding, for all aspects of its service delivery, including ISO 9001, ISO 45001, and an International Association of Emergency Dispatchers centre of excellence.</p> <p>  The service is guided by the range of policies and procedures issued by the national directorate for fire and emergency management, NDFEM, which sets the national policy for fire authorities, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, and HIQA.  The objective of Dublin Fire Brigade is to respond and deal with fire and medical emergencies as statutorily obliged.  Our vision is to make Dublin a safe place to live, work and enjoy by being a modern, community focused and influential fire and emergency ambulance and rescue service.  As part of my submission, I have also included a brief report that outlines the challenges faced by Dublin Fire Brigade into the future.</p></speech>

The reason we invited the ambulance services here is many of us have been receiving information from paramedics and ambulance workers throughout the country complaining about stress, fatigue, being worn out and constantly required to do overtime or essentially, pardon the pun, constantly firefighting.</p> <p>  We get many stories of situations throughout the country where no ambulances are available; the time between somebody dialling 999 and an ambulance arriving being anything up to two hours and situations where ambulances are parked up because there are no paramedics available to drive them.  The weekend before last, in Athlone, there were no paramedics available to drive ambulances and that is just one of many examples we get.  Obviously, that concerns us.  We all understand there is a challenge in recruiting paramedics and that it is a challenge experienced not just by this country, but every country.</p> <p>  How short staffed are the ambulance services?  How long will it take to get the critical numbers up to be able to provide a service where the system of the nearest available ambulance actually works?  With the complement of paramedics and so on being so low, surely that system does not work.  It can only work when the system is properly resourced.  I ask for the witnesses' reflections on their reactions to what paramedics and ambulance workers are telling us the length and breadth of the country.</p> <p>  I will finish my comments by pointing out one thing that SIPTU said to us this morning.  I asked SIPTU whether it could point to one particular black spot in the country that we could use as an opportunity to highlight.  The answer was that every area, at this stage, is a black spot.</p></speech>

Our colleagues, Mr. Paul Reid, CEO and Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, HSE, were asked a similar question before the Committee of Public Accounts.  At that time, Ms O'Connor indicated we needed approximately 90 extra ambulances.  Some 90 ambulances throughout the country would equate to approximately 1,080 additional staff.  That is what we believe is the current requirement, but the evidence base for that will very much be the capacity review to which Mr. Kenny and his colleagues referred in the session this morning.</p> <p>  In terms of how long it will take to get there, at present, we currently have the capacity to train approximately 200 to 220 paramedics every year.  That is generally our current educational capacity.  In that case, it would take us at least five years to recruit, train and qualify 1,000 staff, bearing in mind the people who start this year will not qualify for three years.</p></speech>

The standard response time is approximately 19 minutes.  In 2021, the average response time for delta and echo calls throughout the country, but specifically delta calls, which make up the vast majority of calls, is 25 minutes in the south of the country, 22 minutes in the west, and 21 minutes in the east.  Those are average times.  In some cases, we respond much faster than the actual standard time and there are exceptional cases where we are very slow to get to patients.  Sometimes, it takes us up to two hours to get to a life threatening, but not cardiac, call.</p> <p>  The average time is 21 to 25 minutes.  If one was to extrapolate from that there is a degree of risk, the answer is "Yes" but broadly speaking, we would say our services are very safe.  We deliver a high quality of care and measure the effectiveness and safety of the service through our quality and safety committee.  I will ask my colleague, Professor O'Donnell, to touch on how we-----</p></speech>

In a situation where a 999 call is received and one knows one cannot get an ambulance there for two hours, is a crisis management structure kicked in to try to assist the caller to get other assistance or help?  What does one do if one knows an ambulance will not be there for two hours?</p></speech>

First, we have a safety netting process where we call back the patient to make sure his or her condition is not deteriorating.  If there is an indication the patient's condition is changing, we will then upgrade the call and reprioritise a resource that might be on another call in the area at that time.  We will also try to find a first response available.  There may be a manager in the area.  However, in extreme circumstances, we will look to other emergency services, as well.  We will call the Garda.  If it is a cardiac arrest, the Garda may have an automated external defibrillator, AED, in the boot of the car.  We try to do various things to safeguard a patient in those circumstances.</p></speech>

Are there any examples of where, unfortunately, we have lost people, while that process is in operation?</p></speech>

However, that is why we monitor it very closely and why we have a quality and safety committee in place.  It is one of the reasons we have a full-time clinical director who basically oversees the clinical governance of the organisation.  That is why it is so important to have that position in an ambulance service.  Effectively, the clinical director is the patient advocate in the service.</p></speech>

Clearly, the time an ambulance takes to get to a patient is important, but we also need to balance that with what happens when the ambulance gets there and where we bring the patient after that.  We have a very highly trained workforce.  All of our paramedics are highly trained.  It is exactly the same for Dublin Fire Brigade because we operate to the same standards.  They are all very highly trained healthcare professionals and bring significant clinical assessment skills and treatments to patients.</p> <p>  I should preface that by saying that the treatment, in some cases, starts before the ambulance arrives because our call takers give what are called pre-arrival instructions to the caller in order that we can coach through the person on the other end of the phone, depending on the situation, to help the patient.  The quality of the care we deliver when the crew gets there is as, if not more, important than how long it takes us to get there.</p> <p>  The other point is we have a very sophisticated system of hospital bypass procedures in order that we will bring the patient, not necessarily to the nearest hospital, but to the best hospital for their needs.  For example, in the west of Ireland, if one is having a heart attack in Mayo, Castlebar is the nearest hospital, but one might be better served by going to Galway to the specialist cardiac unit there.  We have procedures and protocols to do that and also access to a helicopter network that can get those patients to those centres in as timely a manner as possible.  Without going on about it too much, the point I am trying to make is that speed of response is clearly important, but what happens when we get there is equally important and needs to be considered.</p></speech>

I possibly will not get to all of them because our time is limited.  I will direct each question at who best and appropriate to take it.  If we can avoid multiple answers to the same question, that would help, because time is limited.</p><p> My first question is for Mr. Morton.  Recently, the Minister for Health, speaking in the D&aacute;il in response to a Private Member's motion regarding the National Ambulance Service, stated, "I am aware that ... the wait times for lower acuity, non-life-threatening calls have presented a particular challenge recently as the NAS has been experiencing unusually high demand [which we all accept]."  I assume that relates to the Alpha, Bravo and Charlie responses.  Our guests might forward to the committee a copy of the average response times over recent months, on a month-by-month basis, for this year.  I do not have the time to go through it all because I want to get to the Delta and Echo response times, which are important.</p><p> Mr. Morton outlined the average time in the State in a previous response, which I acknowledge.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on this issue, copies of which I have in front of me, but unfortunately the responses run only to May.  Mr. Woods earlier stated that 80% of Echo calls and 70% of Delta calls should be responded to within 19 minutes.  From January to November of this year, does Mr. Morton have the figures to hand, in respect of both Delta and Echo, for the percentage of calls that have come in on target?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.867" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#N00200"><p>The latest figures run to the end of October, when the figure for Echo calls was 71% within 19 minutes, while the equivalent figure for Delta calls was 40%.  In both categories of calls, compared with the previous year, there was a 38% increase in the volume of Echo calls within our overall call volume and a 30% increase in the volume of Delta calls.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.868" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#N00300"><p>To put that in context, the key performance indicator target and the HIQA standard that has been set for Echo calls is 80% and the figure that was reached was 71%, while for Delta, the target is 70% and the figure reached was 40%.  Mr. Morton is saying that is down to the levels of increased demand on the system as well as not having the capacity he talked about earlier.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

The most significant change we see relates to the overall job cycle time.  The issue with the job cycle time is that it relates to mobilisation and journey times, which is a reflection of capacity and of whether there is resource displacement.  If the ambulance is the starting point, that is the ideal, but it could be somewhere else.  Arrival handover delays, obviously, are a feature of that.  Another issue is on-scene time, which has become more pronounced because our crews now have to engage in PPE and much more infection prevention and control.  It is a combination of factors but the main one relates to capacity.</p></speech>

Mr. Morton might forward to the committee a month-by-month breakdown of the average response times for Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Echo.  That would be helpful for our future deliberations on this issue.</p> <p>  Turning to the capacity issue, a number of capacity reviews have been commissioned.  Mr. Woods referred to a 2015 NAS baseline capacity review.  I read last night about the National Ambulance Service fleet and equipment plan review.  Mr. Woods spoke also about a new independent analysis of capacity versus demand, which commenced in July 2021.  Is that analysis ongoing or has it been completed?</p></speech>

One issue I have picked up from speaking to paramedics is that there are not enough staff.  Mr. Morton stated there is a 30% deficiency in staff and capacity throughout the system.  As far back as 2015, there was the baseline capacity review, then there was the 2020 review of fleet and equipment and now there is the latest review.  Mr. Woods indicated that more funding has been provided in recent years and more staff have come in.  Will our guests directly address the 30% deficiency in capacity that Mr. Morton mentioned?  In real terms, how many additional staff would be required to bring that up to a sufficient level?</p></speech>

I do not want to take a guess if Mr. Morton might has a more accurate figure, but I imagine at least half will be replacements.</p></speech>

In 2022, for example, when we hope to start 200 additional student paramedics, that will include a backfill of vacancies.  We will also hold promotional competitions, which will create some additional vacancies that will need to be backfilled.  The figure also includes new developments, of which a range are planned in 2022, including both additional ambulances and additional community interventions, such as frailty teams or the expansion of our clinical hub.  It is about standing still and getting to a good place with the 90 additional ambulances.  The independent capacity review, which Mr. Woods referred to and which is due in the first quarter of next year, is likely to give us an indication of what sort of workforce we will require up to 2027.  We expect that-----</p></speech>

My point is it will take us a long time to get to where we need to get to, simply because of how many staff the HSE trains every year versus how many are needed, and that is my concern, not least because of the burnout and difficulties and challenges the service's members face.  I have heard from many of them over recent months, in different parts of the country when I have visited various constituencies, that it will take an awfully long time to deliver on that.  I will leave it at that because the prioritisation of resources is a political issue.</p> <p>  I raised this final point with the representatives from SIPTU.  I engage with many paramedics and the vast majority love their job.  They are working in very difficult circumstances at the moment and, obviously, Covid has made everything more difficult for everybody.  There is considerable additional demand on the system and people are out sick.  It is the same everywhere in healthcare; it is very difficult.  I have also met paramedics who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and many of them have told me - I am relaying this to Mr. Morton and Mr. Woods - that their experience has not been good and that they have not been properly supported.  What are the processes?  We know how difficult and challenging being an ambulance paramedic is.  They have to respond to very difficult calls and, at times, see children in great distress.  They have told me they have had really bad experiences and some of them have left the job.  Some of them have expressed hesitancy about going back on the front line after bad experiences without being properly supported.  Will our guests explain the process in order that I can better understand it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.880" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#N01500"><p>There are two sides to it, namely, the formal and the informal levels of support.  As for informal supports, the most important support available to any emergency medical technician, EMT, or dispatcher or call-taker in the National Emergency Operations Centre, NEOC, environment is his or her supervisor.  The attitude, approach and level of support, psychological or otherwise, offered by that person colours the worker's experience of work every day.  After that, there is the line manager.  We consider those two supports together to be the most important informal supports.</p> <p>  Formally, if someone needs support beyond that, whether psychological or physical, the HSE provides a range of supports, including occupational health employee assistance.  We have a joint partnership group with our trade union partners, known as the critical incident stress management committee, which focuses on creating an holistic network of peer support workers.</p><p>These are individual paramedics, EMTs, intermediate care operatives, call takers or dispatchers who have volunteered to act as a support to their colleagues.  They receive specific training in critical incident stress management.  We have been to the forefront in this area for probably the best part of 20 years and it has worked quite well.  However, it is fair to say that the holistic range of supports are not necessarily holistically wrapped around the individual staff member.  Our HR department has worked over the past two years to create a programme called WellNAS, which is widely promoted.  One of the learnings from the programme is that we recognised that we need to better prepare our clinical staff and, broadly speaking, our operational staff for the job.  For the past two years in particular, we have introduced personal resilience training for all new graduates coming into the NAS.</p><p> We hope these programmes are beginning to make a difference.  We need more supports and we have plans to looking more at occupational psychology and more clinical psychology support but we recognise that the environment within which our staff work is changing dramatically and we need to increase the level and range of supports available.  Importantly, we need to make sure that our managers and supervisors are focusing on supporting their colleagues.  That is the most important intervention we could make.</p></speech>

Mr. Woods mentioned a shift in the operating model during the last plan bringing us up to this year.  I think it was for the period 2016 to this year.  In terms of developing mobile service, what is the assessment regarding the progress made on that and its implications?  How has this shift gone?</p></speech>

Overall, they are having the effect of providing service to people at or closer to home without in some circumstances having to come to the hospital environment at all.  A project like Pathfinder is an example.  It might be better for me to ask Mr. Morton to detail those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#O00300"><p>We are working on about five different initiatives.  In total, the number of patients who have, thankfully, benefited from all of these schemes is approximately 10,000 to date this year.  What this basically means is that the majority of those patients are captured at what we are calling the clinical hub.  Effectively, it is where we review and triage a call and determine that there may be a better alternative for that patient.  They will speak to a nurse or doctor.  As a result, we have nurses and doctors working in our national emergency operations centre.  What they are able to do is either discuss the patient's care, come up with alternative solutions or make an alternative referral.  That is working very well.  We have other initiatives, one of which is the community paramedicine project, which, again, is proving to be very effective.  In the region of 50% of the patients that are being seen are staying at home or being referred to their GP.  Those community paramedics have specialist training and undertake a master's degree programme.  It is a joint programme.  I might ask Dr. O'Donnell to touch on it because he was one of the leaders in putting the programme together.  This model is operating in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Tallaght in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  To put that model into every community health network in the country as it rolls out is part of the enhanced community care programme.</p> <p>  We also have the Pathfinder model, which is in operation in north county Dublin.  As part of the HSE's winter preparedness plan, we are in dialogue about the funding to roll that out to nine further centres - six model 4 sites and three model 3 sites - in Kilkenny, Letterkeny and Tralee.  Overall, we are going in the right direction.  The main thing has been to prove the models worthy and safe.  Now that we are satisfied that the evidence is there, we are moving an issue of scaleability.  I might ask Dr. O'Donnell to touch on the clinical aspect.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Morton has covered it very well.  We target all of these at low-acuity calls.  In particular, we are interested in the frail elderly because much the time patients would be better served by not going to a busy emergency department and they do not tolerate some of the delays we see in emergency departments well.  In particular, the community paramedicine programme, the Pathfinder programme and what is called the alternative pathway programme in Cork are now transitioning from projects where we were testing the safety and effectiveness of them and we are now mainstreaming them.  Pathfinder is a good example of that.  It is a collaboration with Beaumont Hospital whereby we put an advanced paramedic and either a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist in a vehicle and they respond to low-acuity calls from the frail elderly.  This has been so successful that we are looking at expanding it to eight further locations throughout the country.</p> <p>  One thing Mr. Morton did not mention that will also have an impact is the fact that the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council has finalised and released treat and refer clinical practice guidelines.  The important thing about those is that they will apply to every single paramedic in the NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade and will allow paramedics to safely assess and not transport someone as per protocol.</p></speech>

In 2022 we also need to begin to increase our educational capacity.  One of our rate limiting factors at present is our ability to educate people.  This includes internships.  It means interns have to have one year's experience on an ambulance.  There are only so many places in the country where we can put interns.  As the capacity of the National Ambulance Service grows, its educational capacity grows with it.  It will be an incremental process.  This will not be quick.  It will take at least five years to get well under the bonnet of this issue.</p></speech>

I want to touch on an issue I raised at the previous session on co-ordination between the National Ambulance Service and hospitals.  The reply I received was that while the front-line ambulance personnel and their representatives communicate with hospital management it does not appear to be a three-way process as they are not able to communicate with front-line medical people in accident and emergency departments.  Surely where ambulances find they are being delayed when they come to hospitals, any discussion should include all of the stakeholders, not only the hospital management but also the ambulance crew, people working in accident and emergency departments and people in the hospital itself.</p></speech>

It is probably our single biggest patient safety issue.  It is a huge problem.  I have been in this job for 11 years and it is getting worse.  I have to say that I fear for the winter ahead.  I was looking at some figures before the meeting started.  Last month alone, 17,000 ambulance calls had delays at emergency departments.  The agreed handover time is 30 minutes.  Of this, 20 minutes is for clinical handover and there are ten minutes to allow the crew to maintain the vehicle or restock.  In October we failed to meet this key performance indicator 17,000 times.  Every day, we lose between 5% and 10% of our capacity.  Today we have 180 ambulances on duty.  Roughly speaking, between nine and 18 of them are not available because they are held up at an emergency department.  When we get a concentration in a particular hospital, which we do see because it is uneven, it can have a huge impact on our availability to respond in a timely manner to a call in the area with the hospital offload delay issue.  As Mr. Morton said, we work closely with our hospital colleagues nationally and locally.  At my level, I link in with clinical directors.  There are no easy answers to this.  It is a hospital-----</p></speech>

Perhaps this may be in only one part of the country; I am not sure.

Let us take it down to brass tacks.  A delay at a particular hospital where there are three, four, five or six ambulances held up is not an unusual occurrence.  We have ambulance supervisors who are part of front-line crews and are part of our management structure.  They engage there and then with nurse managers and doctors in the emergency department, as well as escalating the issue.  Front-line staff in our organisation absolutely actively work to deal with such problems on the ground every day, as well as having the processes Mr. Morton and I are engaged in at regional and national level.</p></speech>

It is with regard to demand for the ambulance service and a report from Dublin Fire Brigade.  The number of call outs in November 2020 was 8,532 and in November 2021, the number was 12,657 call outs.  This is an increase of more than 4,000.  Is there any reason for such a change in the same month of the year?</p><p>There is such a change for the same month of the year.  That is an increase of more than 50% on the previous year in one month.  Is there a particular reason for that?<br/><br/>My other question follows on from that and relates to situations where ambulances are called out but people could have arranged their own transport to the hospital, without the necessity of an ambulance.<br/><br/><b>Mr. Liam Woods:</b>I will respond to the first question.  November last year would have been a time of societal lockdown.  The data have been unusual for almost two years now because of the impact of Covid.  The pandemic has had the tendency to both increase and decrease numbers.  As Mr. Morton said earlier, we are comparing against 2019 numbers to get a sense of what is happening in the medium-term trend and the National Ambulance Service is well ahead of that.  The trend between November last year and November this year is, in a sense, less meaningful because of the impact of Covid and the fact that society was in lockdown at that stage. <br/><br/>I will ask Mr. Morton to deal with the other issue raised by Deputy Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.929" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#Q00200"><p>In terms of our experience in 2021, as the data indicate, in the week beginning 8 February we responded to around 3,800 calls.  That figure seems low but on 6 September, which was probably our most difficult day so far this year, we responded to almost 5,000 calls.  What we have seen this year in the data is about a 30% increase but, as Mr. Woods said, it is best to compare 2021 with 2019 because 2020 is very much a confounding year in terms of data.  Against 2019, we are probably up about 6% to 6.8%.  When we look back historically over ambulance demand, we generally tend to see an increase in demand of roughly between 4% to 6% per annum.  We are seeing the expected rate of increase but we are also ahead of that expected rate of increase.  Our sense of what is driving that centres on three issues.  First, we are seeing a shift in acuity.  When we look at the delta and echo calls that we responded to, there were more of them.  Patients are sicker when we reach them and we are spending longer periods of time treating them.  We also know that when they get to hospital, they are spending longer periods of time in the emergency department as well.  That is not just because there is no bed availability but also because of the care they require in the emergency department.  Acuity is definitely one issue.</p> <p>  The second issue is that we are seeing a step change in health seeking behaviour.  One of the unfortunate successes of the National Ambulance Service during the pandemic is that it has been high-profiled so well.  As earlier witnesses said, we have stepped up to whatever challenge has come along and have basically profiled ourselves in the public consciousness.  We are up there now, front and centre, as a gateway to services.  The third issue that we must reflect on is the fact that we are asking our GPs around the country to do an awful lot but they simply cannot do everything they are being asked to do.  GPs are involved in vaccination programmes, a range of chronic disease programmes and so on.  The number of GPs available is not necessarily growing and what we are seeing in our data is a shift in demand away from calls that would have traditionally come to us through GPs to calls that are now coming directly through the 999 system.  That is what we are seeing in terms of what is driving the demand.</p></speech>

This is a problem in some areas with the number of GPs available at night, whether through SouthDoc or other out-of-hours services in other parts of the country.  Could we be doing more to make sure that GPs are available at night?  Should we be employing GPs specifically to do night work because the current system certainly has its challenges at the moment?</p></speech>

Bearing in mind that the majority of health professions are currently challenged at the moment in terms of overall recruitment, the solution probably lies in a hybrid model.  Dr. O'Donnell might be able to say more about this but we are conducting some trials around telemedicine at the moment and are working very closely with colleagues in primary care.  Our community paramedics work in GP practices one day per week as part of the practice team.  In many ways the future model is not so much a separate ambulance service or separate primary care service but one under which these services come together, where we synergise and acquire the power of all of these people working together.</p></speech>

While we wait for Deputy Durkan, I wish to follow up on a point made in the previous session.  A suggestion was made about the introduction of hospital liaison officers to address difficulties with accident and emergency departments in particular.  We heard evidence this morning that people were waiting five or six hours at hospital accident and emergency departments.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?  Apparently it is working very successfully in Scotland.  Do the witnesses believe it might work in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.933" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#Q00600"><p>There are two aspects to that.  While a dedicated liaison officer role, which is what the witnesses were referring to this morning, has proved relatively successful in the UK, it comes down to the personality of the individual doing the job.  The role requires somebody who has very strong relationship building skills.  The officer has to be able to build a relationship with colleagues in the acute hospital to effect the sort of changes that are required.  Fundamentally, however, that role does not take away from the capacity challenges to which Dr. O'Donnell referred.  Were we to introduce that role in Ireland, we would have to recruit 174 additional managers at a cost of &euro;16.5 million.  It would not be a simple solution.  We are currently looking at a hybrid model.  The witnesses this morning talked about 24-hour management.  We are currently proposing to put in place a 24-hour management system across the NAS this year, involving shift managers in teams of six across the country.  One of their duties, but not their only duty, would be to engage with the hospitals.  We feel that will make some degree of difference but there are other measures that we can take and we are working with our trade union partners to develop some solutions.</p></speech>

I wish to return to a number of issues that were raised earlier.  What is the simplest, quickest and most effective way to address the problem of waiting at ambulance bays at the hospitals for longer than expected periods of time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.935" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#Q00800"><p>There are mitigation measures that we can implement.  One such measure, which is frequently used outside of Ireland, is a process called cohorting.  Effectively, if there are four ambulances parked outside an emergency department, two crews are asked to look after four patients and the other two crews are released.  It does not fix the problem but it does mitigate the risk to the patient who is most affected, namely, the patient awaiting a response in the community.  That is the patient we are aiming to get to all of the time.  The patient in the back of the ambulance is experiencing some degree of risk, as is the patient who is waiting in the corridor in the emergency department, but the patient most at risk is the one who is waiting in the community for a response.  That is just one of the measures we are considering.</p> <p>  We are also looking at things like rapid handover protocols and a process known as fit-to-sit.  Under the latter process, we ask whether all of the patients that we bring to the emergency department really need to be on a trolley.  That is something that we have to ask ourselves honestly and it may be more appropriate for some patients to sit in the emergency department rather than waiting for a trolley to be handed over.  There are no immediate fixes, as Dr. O'Donnell said earlier, but there are some mitigation measures that we can take that we are actively working on at the moment.</p></speech>

Crews are important.</p><p>There is an acute shortage and difficulty in creating the necessary cover.  What about the number of ambulances tied up in waiting bays?  Is that at tolerable levels or does it create further problems for attendance at emergencies?</p></speech>

We would have to make sure that we have spare trolleys available.  That sounds easy, but it actually costs &euro;12,500 to buy an ambulance trolley.  They are not cheap.  At the same time, we have to have spares.  Some jurisdictions have put dedicated teams on the road with a van and extra equipment.  In the event that the build-up of this problem can be predicted, with five, six or seven crews held up for hours, a dedicated team can be mobilised to go with extra trolleys and equipment, to provide the infrastructure to release the vehicles and crews to respond to calls.  It is not easy but there are things that we can do.  Those are the measures that we are exploring at the moment.  It also requires a change in work practices.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.942" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#R00600"><p>There are probably two parts to that question.  When we experience a surge in demand, we have the ability to meet the needs of patients who are acutely unwell.  The consequence is that patients who are not particularly unwell, who are often referred to as lower acuity patients, find themselves waiting for much longer for an ambulance to turn up.  The second area to think about relates to a major emergency, whether it is declared as a standby or an actual event is occurring.  At that stage, the emergency services approach a state of being overwhelmed.  The State's major emergency plans provide for a range of extraneous measures that we would not normally use.  In our case, for example, we would call on voluntary organisations, the Defence Forces and private ambulance companies.  We would set up casualty clearing stations and field hospitals, for example.  In that sort of situation, there are active plans in place.  Before Covid, those plans were regularly exercised.  Covid has given us a different type of experience and we are far more practised now in measures that would be of benefit to those situations than we were previously.  The plans are in place but I would be stretching if I said we would not be stretched.  It would be a challenging situation for any emergency surface.</p></speech>

That leads me to my next question.  In the event of being in that type of fully stretched situation, does the ambulance service have the capacity to activate the entire emergency plan and ongoing plans to deal with routine requirements?  Can all those procedures be activated together in a short time, without a waiting time of three, four or five hours before the plan is activated?  In my previous experience on a health board, cold runs used to take place, where all the emergency services were called out and tested to see how fast they could react to a given situation.  They tested those reactions to the best of their ability.  Can the ambulance service call on all those in a short time?  How short a time is it?</p></speech>

There are structured processes in place in the wider HSE.  There is a national crisis management team, which would be called upon straight away, chaired by the chief executive.  There are area crisis management teams, where the broader range of supports is brought into place, including acute hospital, public health and community health colleagues all coming together, as well as people involved in procurement.  Whoever needs to be at the table is there.  Every resource available to the HSE is called upon.  In the event that the HSE needs to engage with other services, we do.  The plans provide for that.  The three principal response agencies of the State are the local authorities, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They exercise their response through their principal emergency services, which are the ambulance service, the fire service, and the garda&iacute;.  Those plans are in place.  They are well structured.  We have a great degree of competence in our frequency of practice of those processes.</p></speech>

There are regular meetings, both regionally and locally, between the three principal response agencies.  While Covid has had a detrimental impact on the level of that engagement, it continued throughout the Covid pandemic and it continues today.  The requirement for each of the agencies to have their emergency plans practised, prepared and fit for purpose is a part that they all take seriously.  We are well versed in the issue of emergency management in Ireland.</p></speech>

There are dedicated personnel within each agency to do that.  Within the fire service, a senior officer grade can call it.  There is a directive within the Garda and the NAS  There are written procedures on who can do it.  There is a formal structure for how it is done.  Each agency is very much aware that either an impending major emergency or an actual emergency has occurred.  This links in with the Deputy's primary question.  When the resources of a particular agency are in serious jeopardy, that can be a deciding factor that it is becoming a serious emergency and we can no longer cope as a single entity.</p></speech>

We are having some technical difficulties.  While we are waiting on them, I will ask a few questions myself.  I am told that Dublin is one of the best cities to have a heart attack in, if there is any good place to have one.  That is largely down to the network that Dublin Fire Brigade and the ambulance service have been able to build up.  Does Mr. Keeley believe that this will be affected if Dublin Fire Brigade is removed from the equation and the joint response model is done away with?</p></speech>

I do not believe that is the case.  We are in discussions about the model in future, with our colleagues in the NAS.  Those discussions are looking for the optimal service model and how to deliver it.</p><p> The fire service's role in the network was mentioned.  The service's contribution to pre-hospital emergency care in Dublin is well known and documented.  As chief fire officer, I am very proud of the service we deliver.  As mentioned, however, resources are, as is the case with the rest of the country, a significant issue for Dublin.  Dublin Fire Brigade is suffering as a result of everything that was mentioned earlier.  Handover delays at hospitals are something that we work to alleviate with colleagues in the NAS and with hospitals directly.</p><p> One thing that has not been touched on so far during this session but that was touched on earlier is recognition for our front-line staff.  As chief fire officer, I acknowledge the tremendous work done within Dublin Fire Brigade but also by all emergency workers who have been working day in and day out, particularly during Covid.</p></speech>

We heard earlier about capacity, with between 200 and 220 staff being trained each year.  Is there any possibility of that being increased?  Is there any capacity in the system to upskill more people.  We heard from the Minister that part of the delay has been due to Covid.  Training was not happening.  I believe it has now resumed.  Is there any capacity in the system to increase the numbers.  Do we need to increase the number of people on the panel if we are talking about bringing in significant extra staff over the next five years?  What can be done to get the system ready if people are available?  Is the system capable of facilitating more people training?</p></speech>

The Chair quoted figures which Mr. Morton and Mr. Woods related to the NAS.  People will be aware that there have been ongoing staffing difficulties within Dublin Fire Brigade for some years.  It is more complex than recruiting more staff.  There are other factors that we are trying to work through with our colleagues in the trade unions.  We have a class that will finish its training very shortly, at the end of this month, and will become available to Dublin Fire Brigade over Christmas.  A new recruit class of 45 will start in February and there will be another class later in the year.  We hope to advertise for another panel.</p> <p>  The complexity of training and its duration was mentioned earlier.  It is very difficult.  Dublin Fire Brigade has conducted training throughout the Covid pandemic.  That presented challenges to the training centre, its staff and the students who went through it.  Dublin Fire Brigade is trying to engage with the trade unions.  Much of the question has been advanced and we want to get the final piece across the road which would allow us to release more personnel into the system.  We hope to fast-track training for next year for the second class, which is so vital and badly needed.  That has to be acknowledged.</p></speech>

I want to compliment our fire service staff and our ambulance paramedics.  They must be recognised for the work that they do.  They have always done a good job but during Covid they have excelled.  It is important to recognise.</p> <p>  I am not a member of the committee.  I am attending because I feel so strongly about the ambulance paramedics in my area and because I am really worried about this matter.  We spoke about the ambulance services there.  People in my area have had to wait for hours for an ambulance because one of our own ambulance paramedics could have been sent to Dublin or elsewhere.  There could be an ambulance sitting at the base and there is no one there to take it out.  I have a great concern in this regard.  Has there been any consultation with the staff in order to try and improve the services?  I am not happy with the new model.  I believe there are many failings.  I am wary of emergency centres where you lose the local contact.  At the end of the day, it is all about local contact.  You cannot beat that in an emergency or to make a plan.  The new model is there but I am not happy with it.  It is unacceptable to have anyone waiting hours for an ambulance and I have come across that on a good few occasions and I have reported them.</p> <p>  Is there any process to put permanent managers in positions regionally and nationally.  So many managers are working in acting or part-time roles in the service.  That can affect the running of the services when there is no clear decision on implementation.  It could be changes in the roster or local problems.  It all boils down to local.  Similarly, how many officers are working in acting, part-time or temporary roles in the service, including senior management?  Everyone is doing their best but a good system needs consistency.  I can only speak about my area and the concerns I hear daily when people come to me.  The model is failing.</p> <p>  From speaking to ambulance paramedics, I feel that they are not being listened to.  We are all in this together, no question, but for us to make those changes, and we do need changes, that all of us have a role to play.  We have to address the issues that I have come across in recent months.  I compliment our ambulance paramedics on the great work that they have done but I just do not know about the system at the moment and I ask that it be re-examined.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the shortage of staff.  We have been talking about a recruitment plan for 2022.  That is a concern.  Our ambulance paramedics are at burnout.  They are doing such a good job.  We are dealing with people's lives and I know that is a priority but it is very difficult to explain to someone that they cannot get an ambulance to them because I have sent it to Dublin and that is unacceptable.  I have done a lot of work on this and I have made it a priority.  I will continue to work on it and make sure that we look at this.</p> <p>  Maybe someone could come back to me with some answers.  I again thank everyone for coming before the committee.  I look forward to their answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.957" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121500002#S00500"><p>I picked out three questions.  On consultation, the most important consultation that should take place is between the supervisor, the manager and the staff member. There are supervisors in Carlow and Kilkenny and there is a manager in the area.  The first person that I would expect to listen to and to speak to the staff is the local manager.  That is critically important.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about whether managers are permanent or not.  In order for that consultative relationship to be effective, you need stability of leadership.  It is fair to say that the south east in particular - and, to an extent, the south west - has suffered from a fluidity in managers.  That is partly because people have left the NAS to pursue other opportunities in the wider HSE or perhaps they have left the HSE altogether.  While the NAS is a relatively large ambulance service in global terms, it is a very small service in the HSE.  There are many more managerial opportunities for people to pursue their careers in the wider HSE.  That has been one feature.  From a management perspective, 2022 will be the year of stability.  We have approval from the HSE and the Department for plans.  It will be reflected in the service plan which the Minister will publish in the near future to bring about changes in the management structure which will stabilise and improve the position.  The Deputy's point is well made.</p><p>I completely accept it in that a lack of stability in leadership has a detrimental impact on staff and whether they feel listened to.</p><p> The other issue to touch on is the local centre.  It is probably important to reflect on why the centre arrangements changed.  I am from Laois, as members can probably tell from my accent, but I have vivid recollections of the Carlow ambulance not going to Graiguecullen because it was in a different county.  If you needed an ambulance in Graiguecullen, it had to come from Portlaoise.  Likewise, if the ambulance in Carlow had gone to Kilkenny, the ambulance in Athy would not go because it was in a different county and under a different control centre.  The national centre has got rid of all that.  The fundamental reason the Deputy and her constituents are having the experience they are having relates to the capacity issue.  If we address that, the national control model will come into its own and will prove to be the effective model we know it is nationally and internationally.</p></speech>

I take it that the draft minutes of our latest public and private committee meeting of Wednesday, 1 December, are formally agreed and that there are no matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Before we continue with today's meeting, I wish to make a statement on behalf of the committee.  I refer to our recent meeting of the committee on 3 November convened to examine governance and other matters with a sporting organisation.  Having viewed the record of the meeting, I wish to now read into the record that it is the right of this committee to pursue all legitimate lines of inquiry within the orders of reference without fear or favour and any suggested interference of political partisanship during such committee engagements will not be allowed.</p> <p>  I also want to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathy to two of our committee colleagues.  I offer my condolences to Senator Hoey and Deputy Mythen.  They both had personal and family bereavements in this term and I publicly want to say that they are in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time during their bereavements.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it to discuss this important topic and for the opportunity to outline some of the actions the Government is taking to address the challenges facing women in sport.  The committee has done some important work in facilitating progress in this area.  I acknowledge that at the outset.</p> <p>  Equality in sport is a key priority for the Government.  Our overall vision is for women to have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  The programme for Government and the national sports policy are unequivocal in their commitment to making this a reality.  Making progress in this area is something I am personally committed to and passionate about.  It has been a focus for me throughout the past 12 months.</p> <p>  This year has been dominated, as we know, by amazing moments for women's sport.  They include Rachel Blackmore's historic Aintree win, Leona Maguire's performance at the Solheim Cup, Kelly Harrington's homecoming, Fionnuala McCormack's second fastest ever marathon time, the biggest ever victory for the women's football team, Amy Hunter becoming the youngest ever batter to hit a century, Emma Slevin becoming the first Irish gymnast to qualify for the all-around finals of the world gymnastics championships and, as we all know, the battle between Dublin and Meath in Croke Park during the summer.  All of those moments are inspiring the next generation of women and girls to take up sport, get out and get active and be the next generation of sporting heroes who will inspire us in the years and decades ahead.</p> <p>  We are prioritising the growth in grassroots participation all the way through to high performance via the sporting system, including Sport Ireland, the national governing bodies, local sports partnerships and the Federation of Irish Sport, all of which are contributing to the increase in the number of women and girls taking part in sport.  For the information of the committee, I intend to provide a brief update on funding, participation and women's participation in leadership positions.  I intend to touch specifically on Gaelic players and on women's rugby.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the women in sport funding programme has been in place since 2005.  Since then, more than &euro;20 million has been invested through the national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships around the country.  In 2018, funding under the women in sport programme was &euro;600,000.  It has increased significantly and Sport Ireland announced investment of &euro;4 million for 2021 and 2022.  This investment is having an impact across the sporting system, with 45 sporting organisations set to receive funding under this investment.  A further &euro;265,000 has been invested this year in local sports partnerships under the programme.  These increases are in the context of an increase in funding for Sport Ireland in the budget for 2022, bringing its total current expenditure budget to more than &euro;96 million compared with &euro;92 million for 2021.  This will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support governing bodies and local sports partnerships in delivering programmes for all participants, male and female.</p> <p>  One of the key aims of the national sports policy is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport support entirely by 2027.  The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor, ISM, report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years.  Unfortunately, while the ISM report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest ISM figures for quarter 3 showed that the gender gap was beginning to re-emerge as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted.  In quarter 3 of 2021, male sport participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels, at 48%, while female participation was 38%, 7% behind the level measured in 2019.</p> <p>  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus, concern and ongoing monitoring.  It is now crucial that we move to ensure that the gap is narrowed and closed.  To this end, many governing bodies will begin to deliver women in sport in dormant accounts funding programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have disproportionately been impacted by the pandemic, including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.  These targeted activities will form part of a winter initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions.  The funding provided by the Government and increased participation we are seeking to support will need to be backed by progress at the leadership level.  We recognise the importance of ensuring strong gender representation on the boards of governing bodies.</p> <p>  Research in this area consistently shows that balanced boards lead to better outcomes and we need to ensure that this happens in sports.  The national sports policy set a target of 30% of either gender on the boards of funded bodies by 2027.  In the new action plan for sport I have strengthened that target and we are asking all governing bodies to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the figure of 40% reflects this prioritisation.  I firmly believe that the leadership of sporting organisations needs to reflect their growing female membership.</p> <p>  One of my priorities this year was to eliminate the funding gap that exists in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players.  I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and ensure that we now have parity in grant funding.  Additional funding of &euro;1.7 million has been provided this year, and for future years, for enhanced support for female intercounty Gaelic games players on an equivalent basis to that being provided to their male counterparts.  This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4 million.  This is a very important development for women's sport and demonstrates the commitment of the Government to equality in sport.</p> <p>  As I am sure the committee members are aware, on Friday the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and I received a letter from 59 female international rugby players, both currently active and retired, regarding issues they have with the IRFU.  We have responded to the group to advise that a meeting will be sought with the IRFU, and Sport Ireland will also meet the players to discuss the issues raised.  That meeting will take place before Christmas.  The Minister and I have indicated that we are also happy to meet the players should that be needed and we hope to be able to do that in the next week or so.  We will also provide any assistance or guidance that will help to address the issues raised.  Sport Ireland has a particular expertise in working with national governing bodies and high-performance athletes and it will work with the players and IRFU to address the issues that have been raised.</p> <p>  Equality in sport is a key priority for the Government.  We want to achieve a sporting landscape where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  While there has been good progress for women in sport, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed.  My officials and I continue to work closely with Sport Ireland and the sports sector with a view to achieving a much improved landscape for women and girls in sport.  I am happy to take any questions from members.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

I am glad he did not forget the Meath women in the list of accomplishments he rattled off.  He could not congratulate them at the end.  I note that six of the eight nominees for sportsperson of the year in Ireland in the RT&Eacute; awards on Saturday are leading female athletes and footballers from across the country.  That is noteworthy.  I hope the judging panel do the right thing and pick Vikki Wall, our Meath full forward, for the award.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for his remarks in respect of the &euro;2.4 million for Ladies GAA.  We met him earlier this year and said he was committed to it, and he has delivered on that.  Plenty has been written and spoken about women's sport in the past 24 hours, in particular the game of women's rugby</p><p>I hope that all those people who are tweeting about this bother their asses to come out and support some of these games.  If they do, we will have a full Aviva Stadium and Croke Park for all of these games.  I hope that all the Twitter bots bother to come to support the games in person.  In respect of the controversy that has blown up, what was most disappointing was the IRFU's response that it refuted the tenor of the statement by the people who signed the letter.  One person who signed that letter is Lynne Cantwell, a Rolestown native I interviewed in my days as a sports journalist.  I know her character and she did not do that lightly.  How far will this meeting with the IRFU go?  The Minister of State and the Government committed significant Covid support funding, of &euro;18 million, to the IRFU on Monday.  Will he threaten to withhold some of that funding from the IRFU if it is not willing to display the necessary changes that are being demanded by these international players?</p></speech>

Before I answer his question, I congratulate the Meath ladies.  It was fantastic to see a team go from intermediate all the way to senior and winning the All-Ireland.  They beat the Dublin ladies, who have had great success in recent years.</p> <p>  We will engage in a frank and comprehensive way with the IRFU about the issues that have been raised by the players.  They have shown tremendous leadership not only as players representing the country, but also in trying to grow women's rugby over recent years.  I absolutely respect and take extremely seriously what they have set out to us.  We have sought to fully engage with the IRFU and reflect all the issues it has raised.  We have asked Sport Ireland to engage with the players about providing assistance and guidance.  We are willing to meet the players ourselves.  I was disappointed with some of the remarks made in the statement from the IRFU.  It could have been more conciliatory in its approach.  I will reflect that when I meet them.  We need to be solution-focused.  We need to have a constructive pathway that deals with the issues raised by the players.  That is what I am focused on doing now.  I have engaged with all parties.  We have involved Sport Ireland, which played an important role in providing a solution and has much expertise in resolving difficulties between and within sporting organisations.  It has an important role to play here.</p></speech>

The language used by the IRFU is quite hostile.  It stated that the responsible approach would be to allow the review process to conclude, but the ethos and the thrust of the demands in the statement from the players was that they had no confidence in the reviews to begin with.  We saw that governance change only happened in the FAI when money was withheld in the last term and it was starved of funding.  Will that be put on the table?  The IRFU and the women's game is part of that.  Will it be said to them that, if governance changes within this sport do not happen, the generous supports that it gets from the State will be withheld?</p></speech>

I think the statement should have been more conciliatory.  I do not think it was helpful in the context of trying to resolve the issues raised.  I will not pre-empt the discussions.  We will engage in a robust and frank way with the IRFU to reflect on the issues and to focus on resolving the matters raised by the players to their satisfaction.</p></speech>

The IRFU has full confidence in its own reviews but the players do not.  How will the Minister of State make sure that is achieved to the players' satisfaction?  If the IRFU stands firm against that transparency, what is the position of the Minister of State and Government in respect of that?</p></speech>

I thank him for all his work to date and for the funding announcement this week.  Regarding the &euro;22 million invested through the Women in Sport programme, the NGBs and the local sport partnerships, does the Minister of State feel that this is value for money based on the current trends of gender participation rates?  Can he outline what improvements he hopes to make over the term of this roll-out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.993" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#C01600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The &euro;4 million fund is extremely important.  It is research-focused and targeted at trying to bridge the participation gap.  That is one element of what we have sought to do regarding women in sport.  When it comes to high-performance sport, we have provided substantial funding streams.  From that perspective, it is easier to avail of the new sports capital and equipment programme.  We have provided specific reference in the assessment process to those targeting female participation.  There is a multiplicity of interventions.  The &euro;4 million fund focuses on participation.  The Dormant Accounts Fund focuses on all of the participation gaps.  Female participation is one.  Those with disabilities and minorities are other examples.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland has taken strong actions.  We have a lead for Women in Sport.  We have sought to strengthen the funding support for the programme and to ensure that, at a governance and leadership level, sporting organisations are reflective of their grassroots.  The Deputy knows from his sporting background that if one goes to any local club in any community, there is phenomenal growth of female participation at a grassroots level.  It is often 50:50.  There is attrition, which I know Sport Ireland is focused on, especially in teenage years, that can create a gender gap in participation.  Many of the initiatives we have in the Women in Sport programme are focused on areas where there is attrition or where there is not the same level of participation.  All of our policy and funding streams focus on supporting female participation in sport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.994" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#C01700"><p>I will focus on the most recent announcement of &euro;20 million being allocated to the GAA as part of a Covid supplementary fund.  What proportion of that is allocated to the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association, the Camogie Association or GAA Handball?  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this.  I feel that the one-club model should now become the blueprint for men and women's sports.  Has he had any discussion to date with the NGBs associated with these codes?  I know certain GAA clubs are adopting a one-club model at present but unless we have unification of men and women under one banner, where decision-making and handling is done at one central committee, there will still be an issue of equality for the women's game.</p><p>This is certainly an area on which the Department should focus.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.996" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#D00200"><p>I fully agree that the one-club model is the future when it comes to the Gaelic games family.  We saw certain incidents during the summer around certain teams not being able to use facilities or stadia.  That is at the inter-county level but certainly the one-club model is the future.  There should be no difference or distinction within any family.  There will be much greater participation and growth in the sport.  I support that.  Many people in the grassroots Gaelic games family also support that.  We are seeing positive conversations happening within Gaelic games at a grassroots level.  The three organisations - the GAA and the camogie and ladies' football associations - will need to collaborate on this concept at a leadership level.  I certainly support it and would like to see it progressed.  It will do an awful lot to end some of the difficulties and incidences we have seen.  Significant co-operation is happening at local level when it comes to Gaelic games.  In fairness, the sporting organisations are co-operating across a lot of participation areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#D00300"><p>I agree with Senator Cassells's critique of the response of the IRFU.  It was absolutely dismissive in tone and did not help the situation.  In his briefing document, the Minister of State outlined that 45 NGBs would receive funding as part of the investment in women's sport.  Is it possible to get a breakdown of this list to see where the money went and how much went to each NGB?  Does he think State-funded media like RT&Eacute; have an obligation to promote women's sport more?  Could he stipulate that in order to receive State funding, it must promote women's sports more?  He outlined that additional funding of &euro;1.7 million has been provided this year to increase the grant funding for female Gaelic games players.  Could he provide a breakdown of this funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.998" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#D00400"><p>I share Deputy Mythen's concerns.  It would have been better to have had a more conciliatory statement at the outset.  We will be engaging properly on the issue relating to women's rugby.  We have a list of the breakdown of allocations that we can send to the committee.  I have a full breakdown that we will submit to the committee so members will have all the detail on it.</p> <p>  The media has a hugely important role when it comes to women in sport.  In fairness, we have seen greater visibility in the past couple of years but there is an awful lot more to do.  I know one of the key areas in our women in sport policy is visibility being referenced around trying to ensure we have a women in sport communications plan and we promote the visibility of all women's sport throughout our media, both print and broadcast.  The Minister leads on the media side of the Department but she is anxious to make progress regarding all equality issues.  RT&Eacute; has stepped up by showing some of the Irish women's football games.  I know TG4 has played a really important role as well in promoting women's sport over the past number of years but there is more to do here and it is something we keep on the agenda.  I know that Sport Ireland's lead for women in sport is constantly engaged on that and on strengthening visibility.  </p> <p>  Regarding the question about Gaelic games players, the GPA has amalgamated in the past 12 months, which is really positive.  Male and female players working together in the interests of the Gaelic games family is a very positive development.  They are working with Sport Ireland on the dispersal of the grants for players.  I can give the Deputy more detail on that.  We have equality around the grant.  There is &euro;2.4 million for female players, which is the equivalent to the amount allocated to male players.  Once we made that decision, Sport Ireland engaged with the GPA, the LGFA and the Camogie Association around having an agreed dispersal model.  A report was produced that outlined some of the background to that area that Sport Ireland progressed.  It has a dispersal structure with the GPA and the other two sporting organisations and there is an agreed process regarding how that is dispersed that is progressing.</p></speech>

I welcome the initiatives the Minister of State has set out.  He has set out a two-year target to reach the 40% target.  Is he confident that every NGB will reach this target?  Will he proceed as indicated and will there be penalties for those NGBs that do not reach it?  I do not know if there are any specific governing bodies the Minister of State might like to praise in this context.  Would he like to talk about initiatives he has seen where governing bodies have been quite positive in terms of achieving those targets?</p> <p>  A major challenge that is regularly raised is around encouraging teenage girls to participate in sport.  The Minister of State knows that we are looking at leaving certificate reform.  Are there specific initiatives in terms of what we could do as part of leaving certificate reform and school curricular reform to encourage more young girls to take part in sport?  I was very conscious that Sarah Keane remarked recently how girls' uniforms can even be inhibitive factors in terms of girls' participation in sport.  </p> <p>  I will signal on the issue around women's rugby.  It has been noted that the Minister and the Minister of State intervened rather quickly in the area of women's rugby when very legitimate concerns were raised yet there was a caution about the Minister of State intervening with some of the problems in boxing and offering to ensure there was a mediator.  There have been a number of problems with the Irish Athletic Boxing Association.  Could the Minister of State comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1000" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#D00600"><p>Regarding our new proposals in the sport action plan, we are ambitious about hitting the 40% target.  It is a minimum now around progress when it comes to sporting organisations reflecting broader society but also reflecting their grassroots.  With Sport Ireland's women in sport lead and the excellent work of the Federation of Irish Sport, and I know the committee will speak to Mary O'Connor later on, there is significant momentum to provide that leadership support so we achieve that target.  As I have said before, there will be financial consequences and penalties for those organisations that do not meet the target.  A number of sporting organisations such as Badminton Ireland, Golf Ireland, Gymnastics Ireland, the National Community Games, Special Olympics Ireland, Student Sport Ireland, Swim Ireland, the Olympic Federation of Ireland, Hockey Ireland and the LGFA along with Sport Ireland itself have already hit the target.  I could go on.  There are organisations that have already made progress, there are some that have made progress to around 30% and there are some that are way off.  Soft targets without consequences will not stand anymore.</p><p>We want to support the grassroots and the performance system but it is important as organisations that they reflect the people they serve.  We will be proceeding with that.  We have had soft targets now for a number of years which has resulted in some progress but not enough so I am keen to progress that.</p><p> Around the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023 we have sought greater engagement with our education system and the Senator makes a fair point there.  There is a level of attrition that happens in teenage years which we need to minimise.  On 8 March, Sport Ireland released the Adolescent Girls Get Active research report which focused on that whole area and on how disengagement happens around sport and exercise.  That qualitative research is being used to try to bridge the participation and to address the attrition, particularly around the teenage years.  We are keen to engage structurally with the Department of Education on that whole area in how we can do much more between sport and education.  That is something that is in our sport action plan and on which we will be doing more in the new year.</p><p> On the issue of boxing, I know that the Senator may have commented on this in the Seanad yesterday.  I am aware of the ongoing issues and I am very concerned with the impact that they are having.  There is great concern across many of the clubs and provinces with the effect and impact that the dispute at the governing body is having on grassroots participation in boxing.  I engaged on this issue and wrote to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, on 3 December expressing my great concern and I have asked it to make every effort working within the wider boxing family to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.  It is also important to say, unlike where we are with women&rsquo;s rugby and the issue which has happened in the past number of days, that we have an independent governance review under way within the IABA, which is important, and was commissioned by Sport Ireland.  This is expected to report shortly.  There is a structure and process under way to resolve some of the issues and the IABA has been engaging with Sport Ireland on these issues.</p><p> As the Senator may be aware, there is a mediation and dispute resolution process under way among some of the members involved in this dispute in boxing and there are therefore two structured processes ongoing around boxing.</p><p> I was totally dissatisfied to be contacted by clubs and younger people who wanted to engage in grassroots ordinary competition and the impact of the governing body in displacing ordinary competition is unacceptable and should not happen.  I reflected that in my letter to the IABA on 3 December.  I wish to state that I have engaged on this issue prior to the Senator raising it himself.</p></speech>

We may get a second round in.  I call Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan and he has five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1006" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#E00600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  This is more a commentary than questions as most of the questions have already been asked.  I wish to make a comment on female participation and women sports in Ireland.  Despite the recent success of such athletes as Kellie Harrington in the Olympics and Emily Hegarty in west Cork, who secured a bronze medal in rowing, and despite the fact that female athletes in Ireland have generally excelled and are among our most revered athletes, such as Sonia O'Sullivan and Katie Taylor, it appears to me that the culture of participation by females in Irish sport is far lower than it should be and there is far less participation and encouragement.  It may be far more difficult for them than for many of our European counterparts where there is much more of a culture of females, and young females in particular, getting involved in sports.  One can see that through looking at athletics, and tennis would be a very good example, where both male and female athletes are treated on a par.  The same can also be said for winter sports which receive the same media coverage and audiences, whether it is skiing, cross-country skiing or biathlon.  The top female skiers are held in the same regard as the top male skiers, if that makes sense.  That is not happening in Ireland.</p> <p>  I appreciate that the Minister of State&rsquo;s focus so far has been very clear on inclusion, inclusivity and in particular in trying to make participation by female athletes easier.  That is the clear stamp that the Minister of State with responsibility for sport has put on his role.  I commend him for that.  Even in the ongoing capital sports grants projects it is important that in order for clubs to qualify, they must demonstrate that they are striving to get women involved.</p> <p>  Returning to the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, letter, my sister - if the Chairman may allow me to speak personally for a second - competed for Ireland in the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup in Canada.  That was prior to any of Ireland's Women's Six Nations success where they have become one of the top nations but she was there from the very start and it has been a struggle from the start.  Many of the signatories of the letter would have experienced where it has been a struggle and a battle for funding and proper resources and equilibrium in terms of the men&rsquo;s game right from the very start.  I completely understand the sentiment in their letter and it deserves a proper response, to be treated with the greatest of care and very seriously.  I know that the Minister of State has stated that a meeting will be arranged and it is very important that that meeting happens, that there is a fair outcome and that we listen in all of these things.  Players or ex-players just do not write these letters or make these points lightly and are doing so because they see fundamental issues.  One can see this for oneself.  The sister that I have spoken about came up through Clonakilty Rugby Football Club which had a great underage and senior girls rugby team feeding into Munster.  I have seen right across Ireland that there are clubs where the same emphasis is certainly not there and the IRFU has a responsibility to ensure that that is there.  I would ask that the Minister of State might comment further on that.</p> <p>  The point I wish to make in the second session later is where we talk about the barriers to teenage girls, in particular, participating for whatever reason, and even into the adult ages because of these issues.  How much do we know about childcare, the lack of same and the difficulty in childcare provision being a barrier to women continuing in sport?  That is my only direct question but the rest is just my commentary.  Again I say &ldquo;hats off&rdquo; for the Trojan efforts being made to try to address this imbalance and inequality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1007" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#E00700"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and I appreciate the comments and his questions as well.</p> <p>  On the whole area of participation, we have seen significant progress at grassroots level.  This is something that I have seen as someone who has grown up playing and participating in sports when I go down to all of the local clubs now versus when I was playing myself at a younger age.  We are seeing many clubs now where there is nearly equal numbers of boys and girls playing and participating and it is about sustaining that and limiting the attrition that happens right into adulthood when something of a gap occurs.  We have for example - I understand where the Deputy has mentioned adults - sought to address this through the Women in Sport programmes which look at participation and focus on the teenage years.   If one looks at the funding announced earlier this week, we have a focus on older adults as well and how we can get people active.  It may not only be participation in sport.</p><p>It could be basic exercise as well, or more general activity.  It is not only about formal sporting activity but how we can encourage people to get active.  We have good co-operation with Healthy Ireland and the Department of Health on that and on how to get people to encourage their own individual exercise, which is very important.</p><p> The Deputy referenced childcare.  It has to be a barrier, especially for people in particular cycles of their lives and if they have a number of kids of a young age, I am sure it is extremely difficult when they are working.  Sport Ireland has a new maternity policy for carded athletes, which ensures 12 months of funding for them when having a baby.  That is just one aspect at a performance level which has worked, but I know childcare is a barrier at a grassroots and community level.  I am sure Sport Ireland will be able to give further detail on the research related to that.</p><p> I take the Deputy's point on the women players and I know of his sister's involvement a number of years ago with the team.  They have shown great leadership around growing the game over many years.  That is why we take what they have said extremely seriously and why we will engage in a proper way.  One thing I would say is I have noticed from meeting many rugby clubs is that they are developing.  Many more girls are playing rugby now and many initiatives are happening on the ground.  I have had feedback from and engagement with many clubs that are trying to do that and many more girls are playing rugby.  However, where one has concerns articulated like this at a national level, that will have an inevitable impact on the perception of the game at a grassroots level as well.</p></speech>

I know he is a sportsperson and glad to see the Dublin ladies' team and other women participating in sport.  I have been involved in sport all my life and have trained and managed ladies' and men's football teams.  In the Minister of State's introduction, he mentioned all the elite athletes doing very well in horse riding, golf, boxing, athletics, soccer, rugby, GAA, gymnastics and others.</p> <p>  However, the biggest problem at present, especially at grassroots level, is facilities.  If one goes to any club, all the facilities are geared towards men.  Despite so many women participating in sport over the past number of years, none of these clubs have increased their facilities.  I know when one takes a ladies' team to play a game of football, basically, the men's team is getting the first advantage.  We need to put a foundation in place and get the facilities and equipment in place.</p> <p>  I know the ladies' GAA has been given &euro;2.4 million.  It is a considerable sum of money but if we want to increase and get the gap closed, it is important we start working with the grassroots clubs.  I have two daughters who are involved in sports.  The main complaint they have is that no matter where they go to play a game of football or go on a run, they always have to come back home to the house to change their clothes.  That could be a journey of 45 or 50 minutes.  It all depends on the weather and whether it is raining or snowing that day.  All the facilities seem to be geared towards men.</p> <p>  Years ago, when I was on the sports committee, I always mentioned New Zealand.  It has approximately the same population and is approximately the same size as Ireland, but New Zealand seems to excel in all international sports, both men and women.  Maybe we should have a look at and talk to New Zealand.  It always seems to do very well in the Olympics.</p> <p>  Do not get me wrong, it is fantastic to see all of our ladies doing very well.  However, that is glossing over the situation.  The Minister of State should talk to the main sporting organisations, if he can.  I hope that in the coming years, the ladies' and men's GAA clubs might come together.  The Minister of State got a fantastic result a couple of weeks ago in terms of what has done with soccer to make everything in parity between the women and men.  We have to make it interesting for women and men to come together.  What are the Minister of State, the Department and the major sporting organisations doing to help get the facilities ready to entice more women into our sports? </p></speech>

He made a very fair point.  The facilities are certainly a challenge to female participation.  I saw that from engaging with many clubs and those involved in women's sport.  To try to respond to that directly, in the assessment process for the sports capital and equipment programme this year, the allocations of which we hope to announce in mid-January, there is a direct reference to female participation and to a club's involvement in female participation in sport.  That will have a big impact on the dispersal of allocations that happens in January.  I am very conscious of the need to accelerate the improvement of facilities.</p> <p>  People will find that when we announce these sports capital grants, there will be a significant step change in the investment that the Government and the State makes in sporting infrastructure.  That will have a really positive benefit for sporting clubs, the grassroots.  Many clubs, in their current applications, are actually trying to do the things the Deputy referenced by expanding their changing rooms and facilities to try to deal with the issues he mentioned.  That has to be a big priority for clubs that want to be inclusive and to reflect their own communities.  We want to reward those who are doing that, which is why we have referenced it in the assessment process for the sports capital and equipment programme.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced New Zealand and he is correct in saying it has made great progress on this in recent years.  If the Deputy looks at the high performance strategy I launched in the summer, we referenced two countries as models we are trying to emulate, namely, New Zealand and Denmark.  Both their sporting systems and the investment they have made from an infrastructural perspective have brought them great progress in general and in overall participation but they have also seen the fruit of that success internationally.  There was considerable reference to New Zealand in the briefing I received and there is an acknowledgement that is an important comparator when it comes to our ambitions for sport and female participation.</p> <p>  As I noted earlier to Deputy Dillon, the one club model and greater co-operation are very important, especially in the Gaelic games family.  Clubs that have progressed that have seen the benefits of it when it comes to female participation.  People throughout GAA, ladies' football and camogie are trying to do that at a local level and I hope we will see more co-operation at a national level.  In fairness, there is better sharing of facilities but we need to avoid instances such as those we saw during the summer, which were not good for the overall participation and the availability of facilities.</p></speech>

I think back to the 2020 campaign which ran for a number of years.  That was a very successful model to highlight participation, not just in the game, but the attendances and to improve the amount of media exposure of it.  We should look at some sort of campaign like that again to make sure we close that gender gap completely, but also further increase the media exposure and attendances.</p><p>What is the Minister of State's view on that?  Could that campaign be reignited?  Doing so would be very positive as it was a high-profile campaign.  I fully agree with the one club model.  Coming from a GAA family, I think it is definitely the way to go.</p><p> Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the IABA.  That is something we need to look at.  When issues like this arise, what is the process for dealing with them?  A review of the IABA is taking place at present, which came from our committee, highlighting issues within it.  Following on from the issues with ladies' rugby, should we set up some sort of a reporting mechanism through the Federation of Irish Sport in order that groups can air their concerns?  A conciliation process could be set up as part of that.  Any review by any sporting organisation that is being funded by the Government should be made public or should be forwarded to the Federation of Irish Sport.  In the letter from the ladies' rugby players, one of the concerns they highlighted was that that report would not be made public.</p></speech>

The 20x20 campaign was successful and brought so many different groups, organisations and the media together.  It was a great success and we recently discussed it with the Federation of Irish Sport.  The campaign was run for a particular point in time but there may be scope for doing a new campaign, as the Senator suggested.  I am open to doing anything to improve and strengthen the visibility of women's sport.  A key focus of our women in sport policy is to strengthen that and I will support any measures in that regard.  Sport Ireland's leads are constantly focused on visibility as a key pillar of their overall strategy.  We are very much open to any campaign and will support any campaign around the area of visibility.  It is very important.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the issue of boxing.  As I said to Senator Malcolm Byrne, I wrote to the IABA on 3 December expressing my concern and asking it to resolve the issues as quickly as possible.  Separately, there is the independent governance review and a dispute resolution process is under way among the individuals involved.  That is the current update on that matter.</p> <p>  There is also a sport dispute solutions structure that offers mediation and arbitration within organisations to try to resolve issues within sport.  That is independent.  This is something in which Sport Ireland has expertise when it comes to issues that are raised within sporting organisations.  Many disputes have gone through that process.  The most important thing is ensuring matters are resolved to the satisfaction of everyone involved and that there is a constructive pathway forward.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned issues around what is made public.  As I said, Sport Ireland is always available when concerns are raised and it regularly deals with matters that are raised by people within sport.  There are dispute resolution processes there.  Sport Ireland will be able to give further detail on that.  If something specific is sensitive, it may not be published but that depends on each individual matter that might be brought to the attention of Sport Ireland. </p></speech>

Any review that is carried out by organisations and funded by taxpayers' money needs to be made publicly known.

It also asked that a task force be established to consider matters relating to women in sport.  Did he ever do that?  If not, what was the reason?</p></speech>

There is a women in sport lead within Sport Ireland, as well as a women in sport group that deals with these issues.  It is focused on four main areas, namely, leadership and governance; visibility; coaching and officiating; and active participation.  Many of the sporting organisations are also appointing directors of women in sport for their own sports as well.  There is a structure within Sport Ireland that is specifically focused on driving participation and addressing issues around leadership and governance.  My singular focus, whether for clubs or national sporting organisations, is on strengthening the area of women's sport and that is something with which we engage regularly.  We have taken decisions on Gaelic players, for example, which was another issue the committee raised.</p></speech>

The letter from the women rugby players that was issued this week suggests that the measures the committee called for are needed.  The system is so ineffective that a large group of prominent figures in women's rugby wrote a letter stating, quite strongly, that they have no confidence or trust in the IRFU and its leadership after historic failings.  One would imagine that if there was a system in place that was sufficient to deal with these issues, they would have been picked up on.  There was a reason we asked for a full review of funding for women in sport and the task force.  Given that letter from the women rugby players, does the Minister of State think there is now a need for him to revisit the committee's request?</p></speech>

Imagine the utter frustration about the lack of transparency and accountability and obstruction that caused them to actually send that letter.  They had several requests, one of which was that the Minister of State request oversight of the ongoing reviews to make sure the findings are transparent.  They also want the recommendations of the reviews to be made available to all players and put in the public domain.  Given the IRFU's response and what happened with women players in the FAI and so on, this must be taken seriously.  We need a stronger message from the Minister of State.  He said the engagement would be robust and comprehensive.</p><p>The Minister of State could put it out there that he expects to have oversight of the ongoing reviews and that he wants those reviews published and put in the public domain.  As the previous speaker said, how else are we to correct any wrongs or misdoings?  It is very important that we do that.</p><p> Given the level of dissatisfaction and the reluctance of the IRFU to listen to and address those concerns raised by the Minister of State, it is no harm for the message to go out that if proper governance is not adhered to, State funding will be withheld until it gets its ducks in a row and players, particularly female players, do not feel that they are cast to one side.  It is quite serious.  The serious message needs to come from the Minister of State that we will not pump State funding into the organisation until it cleans up its act.</p></speech>

As I said, I take these matters extremely seriously.  We have sent a very strong message around trying, first of all, to follow through in the first thing that was asked of us, which was to seek a meeting with the IRFU.  We will have that meeting to reflect fully what was said by the players and to reflect all the issues.  It is important that I have my engagement with the players and the IRFU in the first instance and I do not pre-empt the discussions that will take place.  In all of the actions I have taken across many areas of policy, the Deputy will see the seriousness with which we take our sport action plan, with the focus on the dedicated funding increase, and our overall women in sport policy.  She will see there is a focus on achieving progress in this area.  As I said, I am very clear in trying to make progress across many areas of policy.</p></speech>

That is why we have involved Sport Ireland: to have overall oversight of funding and to implement the policy that we set.

It comes to me now, if that is okay.  I will begin by congratulating Katie Taylor on her most recent achievement at the weekend when she had her 20th professional win, which is hugely important.  At the beginning, in the Minister of State's absence, I mentioned Rachael Blackmore's nomination for the BBC world sport star of the year award, another terrific achievement by our female athletes and sportswomen.</p> <p>  I will begin by congratulating the Minister of State.  In his short time in as Minister of State in this area, parity of esteem and women's participation in football and all field sports have been at the top of his list.  His stamp is seen all over in terms of trying to bring a balance to the imbalance that exists.  I acknowledge that &euro;2.4 million has been invested when it comes to female intercounty Gaelic games.  We have had many hearings over the past two years on this very topic.  It would have come as a great surprise to me to learn how women in sports struggle to receive the same supports that their male colleagues receive naturally in regard to physiotherapy, their own expenses and even having grounds for their training sessions.  I was shocked and disturbed over the past couple of years during the hearings we have had around those issues.  It is wonderful to see the Minister of State addressing that in terms of investment.  That is hugely important in terms of his commitment to female participation.  </p> <p>  In his opening statement, he said that as of the third quarter of 2021, male sports participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels at 48%, but women's participation had not at 38%, which was 7% behind the level measured in 2019.  He outlined the delivery of the women in sport dormant account to address that.  How that will manifest itself in practical measures for women in sports?</p></speech>

I echo what she has said around the huge achievements by Irish sportswomen over recent months.  She has outlined them all and I will not repeat them.</p> <p>  We are concerned about the report from the third quarter of the year and the gap that has emerged.  We will have a dormant accounts programme announced in the next two weeks.  There will be a central focus there around female participation.  There will be direct programmes through sporting organisations nationally, as part of the specific programmes that they run, and also through local sports partnerships, which will try to get collaboration at local level on specific targets where there is a participation gap.  They run many programmes in the Chairman's own county and across the country.  They are focusing on where there is a participation gap.  For example, one of the areas of focus will obviously be on female participation and narrowing that around the dormant accounts funded programme.  There will also be a focus on people with disabilities.  We are focused on participation among people with disabilities, which is around 30%.  There is a big focus on that area as well.  The dormant accounts funding will play an important role on strengthening that.</p> <p>  These figures were obviously collated around the third quarter of the year, when there was a huge amount of return to sport.  Many indoor sports were only returning at that point.  Obviously, there would have been displacement in certain areas.  Sometimes there would be higher levels of participation in certain indoor sports for women and girls and that would have affected the figures.  Obviously, we have seen them all return in the fourth quarter of the year.  I would be hopeful that we will see that gap narrow again in the figures for this quarter and the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>  As I have said, we are anxious to support female participation through our dormant accounts programme and also through our winter initiative.  The committee has probably seen the Let's Get Back campaign, which was progressed by Sport Ireland in the autumn.  We will build on that with specific winter initiatives in the period from January to March.  We will encourage as many people as we can to get active and get back involved in their local sporting organisations.  I am conscious of volunteer fatigue, which is there as well.  We are trying to support volunteers and local clubs.  The Covid package we announced this week will help with that too.  That is some of the outline on the dormant accounts funded programme.</p></speech>

The drop-off rate has been notable.  It usually comes around the ages of 15 or 16.  Will the Minister of State be looking at a targeted response in terms of age profile?</p></speech>

That research has been informative in how we shape future funding schemes through the Women in Sport fund and also how we fund local sports partnerships.  From a positive perspective, strengthening that link between our education system and our local clubs and sporting organisations is important.  We have seen better co-operation between schools and local clubs.  For example, in the sports capital and equipment programme, schools with clubs can now look for funding, which was not there before.  It was there in the last couple of rounds, but historically that was not the case.  We are anxious to strengthen that engagement with our education system.  Due to Covid, it has been difficult for schools to do this alone over the last 18 months.  We are anxious to do more and to involve sport more within schools.  We are anxious to try to narrow the attrition that happens, which can sometimes impact future participation through people's adult lives.</p><p>It is an important area to try to narrow the participation gap and we are anxious to make progress there.  There are targeted interventions, as I said, through the Women in Sport Fund and also through local sports partnerships which we fund centrally from Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

I too have to acknowledge the work of the sports partnerships on the group.  They are in touch with the sensitivities around this issue with sports people on the ground and also around disabilities and inclusion.  In Cavan and Monaghan, it is my own personal experience, they have done terrific work in terms of providing the supports to groups to do that, to bring in female participation and to bring inclusivity within whatever sports field or activity it might be.</p></speech>

When you look at it, even as I was reflecting on the previous occasion when the referees were in discussing the issues facing them, they were from three male-dominated sports, we did not have anybody from smaller sports which have more female participation and there was no female voice at that committee.  From the committee's point of view, it would be positive for us to do our bit and encourage more sports with more active participation by women when sports representatives come in to speak in the committee.</p> <p>  The vast majority of the State funding in Irish sports each year goes to three national governing bodies, NGB.  A majority of participants in those three sports are male and a majority of the NGBs themselves are male dominated.  Would the Minister of State look at weighting funding for sports more towards female participation because we all accept there is an issue?  If there was a greater weighting for female participation, that might help.  In hockey, for example, there is significant female participation but they never come in front of the committee to participate.  We need to hear from those sports that have more female participation.</p></speech>

Something we need to strengthen - we have a coaching lead within Sport Ireland - is coaching and officiating and broadening the coaching base to include more women from grassroots to high performance.  We are trying to increase the number of women officiating and refereeing as well.  There is targeted coach education programmes for governing bodies to try and improve that and get greater numbers of women involved in coaching and officiating.  It is a key part of the women in sport policy.</p> <p>  In the sports action plan, from a governance perspective, I have set out specific targets in terms of the female leadership of sporting organisations to hit 40% by 2023.  There are many sports where there is strong female participation but it is about trying to ensure all sports make progress in this area.  Some are better than others.  There is considerable focus on this.  In much of the core funding from Sport Ireland, the key focus is female participation for all sports.  At a grassroots level, we are seeing the impact of that.  Certainly, from when I started playing different sports at an age in single digits, there is a definite rebalancing happening on the ground.  Deputy Andrews is seeing that.  We are all seeing phenomenal participation from girls in clubs, in fact, across all sports.  It is about strengthening that.  Sport Ireland is focused on this.  The impact on indoor sport had a particular effect on female participation where there were greater levels of restriction during the year.  However, we are focused on providing that additional support.  Through the specific Women in Sport Fund and through local sports partnerships there is direct funding for many sporting organisations and grassroots to strengthen female participation.  That is something we are keen to progress in future years.</p></speech>

Indoor sports generally have a higher than average level of female participation yet the funding they get is low in comparison to the big three sports, which are probably the worst offenders when it comes to gender balance.</p></speech>

Witnesses' statements are to be limited to five minutes.</p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus today, they should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Such witnesses may believe it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to identify themselves when contributing to the debate for the sake of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  I ask contributors to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce the background noise and, if at all possible, to switch off their mobile phones.  I remind everyone, particularly witnesses, to use the raise-hand button if they want to make a comment or statement.</p> <p>  I now call on the witnesses to make their opening statements, beginning with Ms O'Connor on behalf of the Federation of Irish Sport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1039" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#L00100"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for inviting the Federation of Irish Sport to make a submission on the challenges facing women in sport.  The federation is a representative body for 110 sporting organisations across Ireland, including 81 national governing bodies, NGBs, and 29 local sports partnerships.</p> <p>  Some of the issues facing women in sport in Ireland were highlighted in the 2018 report, We are Sport, commissioned by Sport Ireland.  It stated that the six core barriers for women in sport were confidence, prioritisation, motivation, education, influencers and structures.  There are also significant challenges for women with disabilities being involved in sport in Ireland.  In Ireland, individuals with a disability are far less likely to participate in sport, walk for recreation, volunteer for sport, be a sports club member or attend a sporting event than those without a disability.  Barriers associated with low levels of participation for people with disabilities are lack of confidence, feeling vulnerable, social isolation, transport issues, inadequate facilities, cost of equipment and a lack of funding.</p> <p>  In March 2019, Sport Ireland launched a new women in sport policy.  Coaching and officiating, active participation, leadership and governance, and visibility are its four key target areas.  I will outline the main challenges facing women in sport under those four pillars.  In Ireland, 51% of women have never volunteered for sport.  Those who do volunteer are less likely than men to coach, referee or be a club official.  In 2020, 2,374 female coaches from 60 different sports responded to a survey by Sport Ireland.  The survey identified barriers to progression which can be grouped into five areas, namely, time constraints, sexism and gender-related issues, lack of confidence, lack of national governing body and club support, and parental factors.  The primary reason given by active female coaches who did not plan to continue coaching or were unsure were club issues, personal impact and parental impact.  The key objective under the active participation pillar is to significantly reduce the active sport participation gradient between men and women and reduce the drop-out from physical activity and sport in young girls.</p> <p>  The Sport Ireland report, Adolescent Girls Get Active, identified the following barriers relating to teenage girls and physical activity.  The most powerful barrier that prevents inactive girls from taking part in sport and physical activity is not feeling good enough to join in.  This stems from both their perceptions and experiences of competitive sport.  These girls have narrow and often negative experiences of a small number of traditional and dominant team sports in Ireland and think this is all that sport is and can be.  They feel too old to start a new sport in their teens.  Girls associate sportiness with team and contact sports, so girls who are interested in exercise do not feel targeted by sporting initiatives.  There is a feeling that there is no room for fun.  Inactive girls are more attracted to activities that focus on fun, enjoyment and well-being and take the pressure off having to be talented.  There is not enough provision catering to different abilities and levels of competitiveness, although this is improving. </p> <p>  On the leadership and governance pillar, some 71% of women perceived the administration and management of sport to be too male dominated.  A key objective of the women in sport policy is to progress towards greater gender balance in board membership of funded bodies.  The second objective is to provide a pathway for women aspiring to become leaders of funded bodies.  In March 2020, females made up an average of 29% of boards across funded national governing bodies.  This was an increase from 24% when the Sport Ireland policy on women in sport was published in 2019.  In 2021, women accounted for 32% of board members in funded sport bodies and 37% of board members in local sports partnerships, LSPs.  Barriers to women&rsquo;s leadership in sport can be defined as any construct, norm or practice within the structural or cultural domains of sport serving to bar passage to or restrict or limit the ability of women to lead, guide or have influence.  These barriers can be further categorised as structural barriers, cultural practices and capacity gaps.</p> <p>  The way board meetings have been run historically can make it challenging for women to commit.  An example is the timing of meetings in the evening when women tend to have most of the family responsibilities.  Time constraints remain a challenge for all volunteers.  As the level of commitment to a club committee and boards increases, fewer people are likely to want to give this time to volunteering.  The lack of term limits for board membership can mean no opportunities for changing the board membership which reduces the opportunities to vote a woman on to the board.  </p> <p>  On visibility, women make up 40% of all participants in sports worldwide, yet somehow receive only 4% of sports media coverage.  In Ireland, in 2018 just 3% of print and 4% online sport coverage was dedicated to women&rsquo;s sport.  A Sport Ireland report on Irish print media found that 4.2% of articles in 2019 represented female sport or athletes while 5.8% of images in 2019 represented female sport or athletes.  There was notable variation between newspapers.  One newspaper had 2% of articles representing female sport or athletes while another had 7.4% during the same period.  There was a 1.1% increase in print media coverage of women&rsquo;s sport over a four-year period.  Asked why coverage was so low in meetings with the print media, the responses included a lack of information and stories provided by the sports, having to provide the content that their readers want, which is not necessarily women in sport, and the lack of dedicated women in sport resources.  Media outlets - print, radio and television - do not have any key performance indicators on gender and are not held accountable if women&rsquo;s sport is not included in their coverage of sport.</p> <p>   Members should note that no direct reference was made to the challenges facing women in sport in high performance in this submission.  Although relevant, the federation does not believe we are best placed to present on those challenges.</p> <p>  Many challenges still face women in sport in Ireland.  However, considerable work and development have been undertaken since the launch of the women in sport policy in 2019 and significant outputs from that work should become apparent over the lifetime of the policy to ensure sustainable progression, along with the actions outlined in the recently launched Sports Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023. </p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Nora Stapleton, the women in sport lead with Sport Ireland.  I will present a summary of my prepared opening statement.  The committee will have heard much of its contents already.  Ms Stapleton and I will be available for questions afterwards.  Ms O'Connor, as a close collaborator of Sport Ireland, has presented much of the detail of the women in sport policy, which forms the basis of much of our combined efforts in tackling the challenges facing women in sport today.  </p> <p>  The Sport Ireland women in sport programme was first created in 2005 following research that identified a significant gap in the participation rates of females and males.  The programme was reviewed and relaunched in 2019 alongside Sport Ireland's policy on women in sport, which identifies four key areas that have emerged as current gaps and future opportunities for women in sport.  The committee has heard what these are but I will repeat them.  The four areas are leadership and governance, coaching and officiating, active participation, and visibility.   </p> <p>  Sport Ireland&rsquo;s vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential, while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  We also have a women in sport steering committee which meets four or five times per year.  Over the years of the women in sport policy, &euro;22 million has been invested through the programme in national governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  While participation levels in the population in general have increased in recent years, a slightly larger increase in participation among women has led to a narrowing of the gender gap from almost 16% in 2007 when data were first collected under the sports monitor to 3.4% in 2019.</p> <p>  The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 has had an impact on sports participation trends nationally.  Sport Ireland has continuously monitored these effects and unfortunately the research has identified growing gradients in sports participation for women.  Male sports participation has recovered faster than female participation resulting in a widening of the gender gap.  Notably, more women are walking for recreation so they are remaining active.</p> <p>  Previous waves of the sports monitor research have indicated the key barriers to sports participation among women, of which time is the most significant.  Other barriers to female participation include lack of awareness of physical activity guidelines, lack of confidence, poor health and injury, cost, access to facilities and, at certain stages in women's lives, pregnancy.</p> <p>  More recently, Sport Ireland has started to identify the particular needs of women at specific target subsections of female population because, as we know, one size does not fit all.</p><p>We have been targeting the teenage years, prenatal and postnatal times, menopause and older women for example.  Ms O'Connor mentioned the teenage girls and young women.  The Adolescent Girls Get Active research report focused on girls who are currently disengaged with sport.  This was a very enlightening report which gave us much information.  As Ms O'Connor mentioned, comments that they feel they are &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;not sporty&rdquo; seem to be rooted in their experience of traditional, more male-dominated team sports and the stereotypes reinforced in popular culture and experiences.</p><p> They feel there is a lack of social space for teenagers where they feel welcomed.  This includes what they consider to be uncool facilities, for example a community centre which is not as trendy as they would like.  They also referred to limited opportunities to try new things and learn new skills, leaving them with a lack of opportunity to feel good about themselves.</p><p> Girls who are active in their teenage years and develop a love of sport are much more likely to establish a life-long relationship with sport and exercise in adulthood.  That is why this is an important age group for us to target.  The type of sport engaged with also influences their future participation.  Sport Ireland has created an evidence-based coaching workshop for coaches of teenage girls with a view to developing more informed coaches who can help reduce the dropout of teenage girls from sport.  We hope that by February 2022 more than 1,000 coaches will have received that training.</p><p> On leadership and governance, we welcomed the recent Government announcement regarding a new target of 40% gender balance on the boards of sporting organisations.  We are pleased to reiterate what the Minister of State and Ms O'Connor mentioned about the increase in board membership and the increased percentage of females on boards in recent years.  We hope to see that continue to grow.  We realise this is a big challenge for some sports.</p><p> As part of our work on board membership, we have created a gender diversity on boards toolkit.  As part of the research for that project, we identified challenges that impact the recruitment and retention of women on boards.  These include the format and timings of meetings, the absence of leadership training, traditional recruitment methods and a lack of mentoring and support to new female board members.  These have all been addressed in our recently created gender diversity on boards toolkit which supports boards in developing and maintaining better gender balance.  Sport Ireland continues to create other programmes and resources to support women and men in leadership and governance equally.</p><p> Through its women in sport funding programme, Sport Ireland supports several women in sport leadership programmes which are ongoing in the LSPs and NGBs.  These programmes support current female leaders as well as those with potential to hold leadership and governance roles within their sport in the future.</p><p> Under the visibility pillar we see the importance of making females visible in all areas of sport, including leadership in sport, coaching, officiating and participation.  In 2019, Sport Ireland conducted a report on print media coverage of women&rsquo;s sport.  That is something we need to develop.  We have also identified that some sports do not have the necessary resources to ensure that female sporting news is available and shared with media.  In addition, there is a new challenge, which is also an opportunity, with the way in which people consume sports news.  It is not just through mainstream television and newspapers, which are being replaced by pay-per-view television, live streaming, social media and podcasts.  Sport Ireland is exploring these new ways to support the visibility of women in sport.  We have seen the opportunities that this provides and have developed the first media training programme for female pundits and analysts with over 120 females benefiting from various levels of support and training in this programme.</p><p> There are many examples of programmes and initiatives through which Sport Ireland is currently supporting the visibility of women, such as our Women on Wednesday sports series, our Women in Sport Week, which will take place again next year, and the Her Outdoors campaign.</p><p> We have a coaching working group within the women in sports steering group which is looking at challenges relating to coaching.  Ms O'Connor mentioned many of the barriers on women coaches, including time constraints and worryingly sexism and gender-related issues in sport, lack of confidence, lack of NGB and club support, and parental factors.  These are all areas we can tackle.</p><p> The first action coming from the research as part of that project has been the development of a women in coaching toolkit to support organisations to help them in their planning for the recruitment, development and retention of women in coaching.</p><p> The culture within sport organisations is also a factor that can affect female coaches.  If the culture has been traditionally male dominated then the environment can sometimes not be conducive to making female coaches feel valued and supported.  The women in coaching toolkit aims to educate sports on this topic and guide them on how to address these issues if they exist in their sport.</p><p> The number of women coaching in high-performance sport in Ireland is very low.  Over the coming months, Sport Ireland plans to establish a coaching network for elite-level female coaches.  Ms O'Connor also mentioned the gradients within volunteering.  We know that those gradients vary at different stages in people's lives.  Women are more likely to volunteer when they are younger than when they are older.</p><p> As mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, I recognise the phenomenal success of many of our female high-performance athletes in the past year who are reflecting an advanced Sport Ireland high-performance system in which our women athletes have achieved more than 50% of the major medals won by sportspeople in 2021.</p><p> I again thank the Cathaoirleach and the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I hope it can assist, advise and support us in our goal of ensuring that women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.</p></speech>

Dr. May just gave a comprehensive statement on women in sport.  Let us be honest, these are not minor issues.  Did Sport Ireland not have some level of oversight?  Would that not have come under its remit?</p></speech>

This is not specifically related to that.  The Minister has identified 2023 as the target for the gender quotas, if one wants to put it that way, for the governing bodies.  We will continue to push for those gender quotas to be met but I can identify that there are some minor sports that struggle because they have low rates of participation historically.  When I use the word "minor", I mean that those sports have minority status not that they are less important.  For example, Bol Chumann na h&Eacute;ireann, the Horseshoe Pitchers' Association and the Irish Tenpin Bowling Association are among the sports organisations that currently do not have the appropriate level of gender balance.  We will work closely with those organisations.  We know they have challenges in meeting those requirements.</p></speech>

Will she expand on that?  Is it the case that there are governing bodies with no term limits on board memberships?</p></speech>

Will Ms O'Connor be as brief as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1067" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#N01100"><p>I will be brief.  Term limits depend on the constitution of the organisation involved.  Part of the governance code, as Dr. May mentioned, recommends term limits for board members in order to ensure succession planning.  Another element of the governance code, which, as Dr. May alluded to, requires all organisations to comply by the end of this year, is succession planning.  Every national governing body and local sports partnership is to have a succession plan for their boards.  There is a hope that will change.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor and Dr. May both made comments about visibility and percentages.  Unfortunately, visibility was not an issue in the past 48 hours because the grievances and concerns that have been aired by the international rugby players made the back page of every single national newspaper and, indeed, some front pages as well.  I heard what Dr. May said about waiting for the review but the players have clearly stated they do not have confidence in the context of significant changes coming from the review, hence why they have asked for the intervention.  Is Sport Ireland prepared to intervene to the level that has been asked for by the players, who have stated they do not have confidence that significant changes will happen as a result of the review?</p></speech>

We will meet the players as soon as possible, prior to Christmas if that is appropriate and if it is what they would like.  However, it is appropriate from our point of view that we await the results of the process that is under way.  We will await the findings of those two reviews before we take substantial actions in any direction.</p></speech>

What is Sport Ireland's analysis of the impact of high-profile stars airing their grievances in significant detail?  What is the impact on young rugby players and those involved across codes?  Does it reinforce the negative connotations to which Ms O'Connor referred earlier?  Does it reinforce those barriers or is it a positive thing in trying to address the things that are wrong?</p></speech>

Sometimes we do not want to hear bad news but, at the same time, it does raise the profile of women's sport.  It is not the right kind of profile we would like to see and we are concerned about the level of profile that a negative issue such as this attracts.  However, we are doing a lot and we have achieved a great deal in raising the profile of regular women who are participating in sport and physical activity.  We are also conscious that we need to focus on what teenage girls are asking for, that is, role models from their own peer group.  We will continue to put effort and energy into initiatives that are identified as appropriate and successful in targeting young teenage girls from that point of view.  This is a high profile and negative issue but it is raising the profile of women in sport, that is for sure.</p></speech>

Some &euro;2.4 million has since been announced to create that equality.  I am sure Ms O'Connor welcomes that.  What is her analysis of that situation and what does she think will be required in the new year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#N01700"><p>The funding is welcome.  It has been a long time coming.  Future generations of players are going to benefit.  We have emerging talent now not just in ladies Gaelic games but also in other spheres.  There is now a talent pathway, and that is important.  Girls who are 17, 18 or 19 years of age and playing Gaelic games can see there is a support mechanism there for them during their college years to allow them to achieve the maximum from their talent as inter-county adult players.</p></speech>

We had a report from the FAI a few weeks ago, launched by Packie Bonner, which referred to the importance of football across different aspects of society.  One of the things mentioned, which was startling, was that in Louth, the game had in the past not even existed due to a lack of coaches.  That changed over the past decade or so and there has been a considerable increase in participation.  Have our guests found that to be prevalent across the country in their analysis?  Is there a problem in providing both male and female coaches to ensure that games, across codes, develop?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1075" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#N01900"><p>People need to understand that women's sport, for the most part, is in its infancy.  That is the case for every sport in Ireland.  Ladies Gaelic football will not be 50 years old for another year.  Its viability, visibility and popularity have grown.  We have seen an influx of what we call girl dads into ladies' sport, which is welcome.  As Dr. May has said, we need to increase the number of female coaches not just at foundational level, which is, for the most part, at grassroots level.  It is also important that we have a talent identification pathway for female coaches who want to reach a high-performance level and coach at Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1076" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#N02000"><p>I will turn to media coverage, from a positive point of view.  Ms O'Connor earlier gave us the startling statistic that in 2018, 3% of the coverage of sport in Ireland dealt with women's sport.  That is pathetic.  We are going to see a lot of positive coverage this weekend because six of the eight nominees for sports person of the year are women from multiple sports.  That will be covered.  Those athletes have broken down the barriers and got the coverage for themselves.  The media is not giving them that coverage.  Can Sport Ireland and the federation capitalise on that?  Do our guests have media plans in place to ensure proactivity, to keep pressing that forward and reinforcing that positive message not just for young girls but for young people in general across Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1077" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#N02100"><p>It is difficult to get a balance in visibility for women in sport.  We either have to over-excel and overachieve to get coverage or something else has to happen.  I am sure the sports that are being represented at that award ceremony will have plans in place.  There is a growing wealth of talent involved in national governing bodies around the promotion of women in sport.</p><p>We in the Federation of Irish Sport were the public presenter of the very successful 20x20 campaign.  That was a success because we had key stakeholders who are media partners involved in the campaign.  We had State broadcasters and independent media involved in the campaign who publicly committed to it.  That helped drive consistency and visibility.  What we want in women's sport in Ireland is just that consistency and visibility rather than women's sport being just here and there.  That is what girls need.  As Dr. May rightly said, we need that visibility not just in print and radio but also through the platforms on which women and girls of all ages engage, be it TikTok, Instagram or whatever else.  We need to be consistent.  There is a lot of work to be done there, but I know that under the women in sport lead, Ms Stapleton, there is a plan for the visibility and the promotion of women and girls in sport in Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1080" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#O00300"><p>This is a really important session.  We have just had a session with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and we have to acknowledge that he has put a significant focus on inclusivity in sport, particularly in encouraging and trying to facilitate more participation from females in sport.  That has to be welcomed, whether it is through participation on boards, funding mechanisms or encouraging organisations that apply for funding to increase their level of female participation.  That is a stamp the Minister of State has managed to put on his role so far, but there is, of course, a long way to go.  That is obvious.</p> <p>  Listening to Senator Cassells was almost like listening to an episode of Off the Ball, given his line of questioning.  The old journo in him was coming out again.</p> <p>  The Sportstar Awards were mentioned.  In the previous session I said something similar.  If you think of our biggest achievers in sports, you think of people such as Kellie Harrington or Emily Hegarty, an Olympic bronze medallist in rowing from my area of west Cork.  Traditionally, however, Sonia O'Sullivan was probably one of our biggest ever superstars, and there is Katie Taylor, obviously.  They are two names that roll off the tongue, but that is not then reflected in the media coverage.  The most startling aspect of what we are hearing here today is the disgraceful amount of media coverage whereby women accounted for 4.2% of articles and 5.8% of images in 2019.  Dr. May, Ms O'Connor and Ms Stapleton may not have this figure, but I would love to know how that compares with the UK or our European counterparts.</p> <p>  A point I continue to make, going back to the culture of sport here compared with that in Europe, is that there seems to be a greater emphasis on treating female sports stars in the exact same way, with the exact same amount of respect and coverage, as male sports stars in Europe - not just sports stars; I mean anyone participating in sports.  I keep using the same examples of athletics, tennis and winter sports such as skiing.  The reason I do so is that one thing that may or may not be a factor - the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong here - is that the major events in those sports are held on the same day.  With major tennis championships, you get the same crowds in the same stadiums for events held over the same two weeks.  It is the same with the athletics championships and world cups.  I mentioned Emily Hegarty in the context of rowing, where there is more of an equilibrium.  Those world cups are held on the same day.  It is the same with skiing, cross-coutry skiing and the biathlon.  I imagine - and I stand to be corrected - that female sports stars and female sports in general in Europe get far more coverage.  Is that leading to this inequity and lack of coverage?  Take rugby.  There are some household names in rugby such as Niamh Briggs and Ms Stapleton, who is on the call, and in GAA such as Rena Buckley, but there is nowhere near the same level of recognition.  Is it because in those sports I mentioned the major championships, finals and other events are, in general, held on different days?  Although the crowds and the popularity of these sports are exploding, is that an aspect we are getting wrong in that when we look at the success in Europe it is not translated here in respect of our main sports such as rugby, GAA and camogie because they are held on different days?  I would like a comment on that.  If the witnesses do not have those figures for the European media coverage, they might come back to me on the matter.</p> <p>  Finally, I asked this second question of the Minister of State as well, but the witnesses may have more detail.  To what extent is childcare an issue?  It should not be this way but, unfortunately, we live in a society in which the lack of provision of childcare impacts women more than men.  How much does the lack of childcare and the difficulty in accessing it contribute to women not staying in sport or participating in sport into adulthood, into their 30s, 40s, etc.?</p> <p>  The witnesses might come back to me on those questions, whoever feels it appropriate to answer them.</p></speech>

Dr. May is indicating, as is Ms O'Connor, I think.  I ask our guests to be as brief as possible.  Perhaps it is just Dr. May indicating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1084" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#O00700"><p>I will be brief.  As for the media coverage, we do not have an awful lot of the statistics.  We do know that in the UK the coverage in the print media is quite good in comparison with that in Ireland.  I point out that tomorrow there will be a women in sport supplement part-funded by Sport Ireland in <i>The Irish Times</i>in the lead-up to its Sportswoman of the Year Award.  The supplement will cover not just high-performance sport but a lot of other sports, including women with disabilities, targeting our Women on Wednesday series and so on.<br/><br/>As for childcare, parental responsibilities have come up on a number of occasions in our surveys but it has also been found in our research that children in families in which the mother is active are more likely to continue lifelong participation in sports, so the mother has a significant influence on the children's participation.  I would also draw attention to the maternity policy for high-performance athletes that has just recently been introduced by Sport Ireland.  The policy recognises that high-performance athletes may take some time out of their career and will continue to be supported during that time while they have their babies.<br/><br/>Those are just a few quick points.  Sorry - I know we are tight for time.</p></speech>

I acknowledge their continued important work for the sport sector in Ireland.  I emphasise my support for our women rugby players.  I believe that the issues they have raised need to be given full consideration by all the appropriate stakeholders.  I am quite concerned by what I have read and I believe that the matters raised need to be taken very seriously.  They deserve our support.</p> <p>  As for the role of schools, this is not directed at anyone in particular, but could more be done, do the witnesses think, at primary level and secondary level to try to help with our messaging and participation?  An area that does not get enough focus, maybe, outside of high performance is the transition into third level.  We often talk about the transition from primary to secondary in the teenage years, but the transition into third level probably warrants further scrutiny and action.  Could we discuss that and see if there is something we could do to improve the overall situation with a focus on how we can improve participation levels at third level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1087" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#O00900"><p>I will come in there if that is okay.</p><p>In the 20x20 campaign, 26 of the 29 third level institutions on the island of Ireland signed up to increase women's participation and the numbers of officials, etc.  That was telling and it demonstrated that an appetite existed.  Dr. May or Ms Stapleton may have the figures.  It is also important to ensure girls&rsquo; lifelong involvement in sport beyond third level.  To do that, it is necessary to start and intervene at the nursery and cr&egrave;che stage.  By that I mean that it is necessary to develop physical literacy, and this action is contained in the national sports policy.  Teenage dropout from sports does not happen only when that age is attained.  It begins at six, seven, eight and nine years old.  Obviously, if we want girls to participate in sport and physical activities in third level institutions, then we must ensure that we keep them involved in sports as teenagers.  It is also important that those sports offered at third level institutions are more holistic and not just competitive.  Opportunities should be provided for participation in recreational sports activities as well, as should the possibility of experiencing new sports.  I refer to those activities that there may have been no chance to participate in at secondary or primary level.</p></speech>

In sports such as volleyball and basketball, for example, the aim is to facilitate the social aspect of participation in sport at third level.  Student Sport Ireland also does much work in this area.  It has established a women's student coaching academy.  It is a new programme offered this year, and the first of its kind.  It examines how female coaches in universities can be supported during their coaching journeys, because the numbers can be low.  Those are some of the ongoing programmes in this area.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the ongoing work, which is important.  I remember discussing the 20x20 campaign with Ms O&rsquo;Connor about two years before it kicked off.  It has made a massive impact, and everyone involved can be proud.  It changes the whole dynamic of women&rsquo;s sports in Ireland.  It has been an extraordinarily successful campaign, and it is continuing.</p> <p>  Another area I would like to explore is how we can best leverage the success of our high-performance female athletes nationally and internationally.  We have some outstanding ambassadors for sport among our female athletes.  They do great work in their communities and in the media.  Much great work is happening already, but is there a need for better resourcing and financial support to get more even work done in this regard?  I ask because these ambassadors for sport, these proven successful athletes, are great people to inspire the next generation of athletes, as well as to encourage people not involved in any form of recreational activity to go back to sport.</p></speech>

The Olympic Federation of Ireland has taken responsibility.  We supported the pilot of a programme called Dare to Believe, which is for athletes who have retired.  They go back into schools, share their experiences and promote the concept of high-performance activity in everyone&rsquo;s life.  Their experiences are shared with young people, and in that way these retired athletes impart their knowledge of how to set goals and implement the skills they obtained during their high-performance careers in daily life.</p> <p>  As was mentioned, we have also done a great deal of work with the athletes.  We get considerable support from them with our campaigns, and we have some good athletes who are always willing and supportive when we seek role models to promote any kind of initiatives.  An example would be the Let's Get Back campaign or some of our Department of Health campaigns, in respect of which we have had good support from our athletes.  It has not just been in the sports sector, but in delivering the message beyond that realm as well.</p></speech>

In those letters, we encouraged any of them interested in getting involved in leadership opportunities, visibility coaching, participation initiatives or anything like that to be sure to let us know they wanted to be involved and to confirm that we could contact them if and when we had opportunities for them to support programmes and initiatives.  A high percentage have already responded, and said they would welcome the opportunity to get involved in these endeavours.  It would seem, therefore, that the door is open in the context of our high-performance female athletes.</p></speech>

Many of the questions have been asked already, but I would like to explore the toolkit concept that was referred to.  Who rolls this out?  How many sports have availed of it?  What is imperative for our witnesses and their organisations is the composition of the national governing boards.  Are additional measures such as gender quotas warranted in that regard?  I have sat on several boards, and it is often hard to get people to step down.  Power lies at that level and it is where things can be changed from the inside out.</p> <p>  Turning to the steering committee of Women in Sport, how does that interface with the sports themselves?  What kind of power does it have?  I reiterate as well what was said about media outlets.  It is scandalous that there is such a low percentage of coverage devoted to female sports.  Might the Minister have a role to play in ensuring that organisations in receipt of State funding, such as RT&Eacute;, provide equal coverage of women&rsquo;s sports?</p></speech>

Essentially, we have a database of potential male and female independent directors who are highly qualified in legal, finance and other areas of expertise.  We have seen a great increase in the number of national governing bodies accessing this service.  It is great, because that provides independent directors on boards as well.  That aspect is important for succession planning, as well as in helping to bring about balanced and informed decision-making at board level.  I leave it to Dr. May and Ms Stapleton to address the steering committee query.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#P01300"><p>The steering committee of Women in Sport is a sub-committee of the board of Sport Ireland.  As a result, it has quite a level of influence and power.  Its role is to monitor, advise and support the board and the executive in the implementation of the Women in Sport policy.  The steering committee is chaired by a board member, and consequently it has a significant role to play.  I reiterate what Ms O&rsquo;Connor said about gender quotas, term limits and the governance code.  We hope those aspects will go a long way in helping to achieve our goals.  The first step is governance code compliance, and the next step will be to specifically target gender quotas.</p> <p>  Ms Stapleton is best placed to share details of the toolkits we have available for coaching and for gender diversity on boards.  Sport Ireland, as a development agency, sees its role as providing the resources and supports needed to build capacity and to develop the agencies we work with.  Those include the national governing bodies, local sports partnerships and the other agencies we work with.  Ms Stapleton is closely involved in the roll out of those toolkits and is probably best placed to comment on the matter.</p></speech>

Again, probably approximately 160 people turned up to the launch and we followed up to ensure they had all the resources to go with that.  We also include that information in any other governance pieces we roll out with the sector, whether with local sports partnerships or national governing bodies.  In the Women in Sport week we hosted a women in leadership webinar and, again, there were about 600 people registered for that.  Just recently we had our annual governance seminar posted by Sport Ireland, where gender diversity on boards had one of the key spots.  Again, we brought up the toolkit to show national governing bodies and local sports partnerships that their board members and chief executives can use that toolkit.</p><p> Dr. May also mentioned the women in coaching toolkit, created off the back of the research we did on female coaches in Ireland.  The toolkit is designed for the organisations and we launched it in September this year, with approximately 160 people from the sector attending.  We followed that up with a symposium that was to bring people through the various content pieces of the coaching toolkit and how to use it effectively.  We had 60 representatives from the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships attending that half-day event, where they were treated to guest speakers and case studies from national governing bodies that had already implemented areas of the toolkit.</p><p> We realise this is something we will definitely have to bring out again probably twice per year.  We may also have to set up smaller networks of sports and we are looking to put certain actions in place from that toolkit so if people are interested in recruiting female coaches, for example, a smaller cohort of sports may be able to work with and support one another, sharing how they might try to recruit more female coaches to the sport.</p></speech>

It can also happen in leisure centres, etc., and it is very much a positive and proactive step that individual organisations and clubs are taking.  We certainly welcome it.  We just do not have anything like that in any of our major plans or future initiatives.  It is definitely something to consider.</p></speech>

We are seeing the fruits of that labour and we must now consider how to develop this further.  I was struck after reading some stuff by Ms Sarah Keane, the president of the Olympic Federation of Ireland, who spoke about the question of school uniforms involving teenage girls to a greater extent and the importance of doing that within the school environment.</p> <p>  We are currently engaging on the whole area of leaving certificate reform and looking at the school curriculum at second level.  If the witnesses were the Minister for Education and considered the support that could be given within an educational context to teenage girls' participation, what would they do?</p> <p>  My next question brings a slight conflict.  I noticed that Ms Lynne Cantwell was one of the signatories to the letter to the Irish Rugby Football Union on behalf of women's rugby.  She also chairs the women in sport committee as a member of the board with Sport Ireland.  The question is that a member of the board of Sport Ireland is raising specific concerns around what is happening within a member organisation.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  My main issue is the question of the educational system.  Ms O'Connor mentioned some statistics at the start indicating only approximately 7% of teenage girls are really actively taking part in sport.  What can we do in education to change that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#Q00600"><p>The Senator spoke about leaving certificate reform but at that stage it is too late.  Girls' perceptions and interest in sport and physical activity starts at the beginning of primary school or even Montessori.  Physical literacy must be achieved or started there.  As girls get older and during teenage years they become very aware of themselves going through a very key transition in their lives.  They become very self-conscious of body image and so on.  There physical literacy and ability to perform certain skills and be physically active is important.  We need girls to participate in sport not just on a competitive or talent level but with regard to holistic enjoyment or fun.  That evidence came from the report that Ms Stapleton led on.</p> <p>  As we are all aware, there are 17 sustainable development goals and the fifth is about achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.  I would love to see increased awareness around those sustainable development goals for teenage girls because they are the next generation.  There is an opportunity and I have often said sport, physical activity and the sustainable development goals can be a winning formula.  I know there is ongoing work from Sport Ireland's perspective under the national sports policy action plan in aligning the sustainable development goals to sport.  I welcome the outcome of that to see where we can lead and what we can do.</p> <p>  In short, this must start way before girls get to teenage years.  It must start when they are four, five, six and seven.  They need to get physical literacy right.</p></speech>

It would be nice to have that influence and be the Minister for Education but we have built some good relationships with the Department of Education recently.  We are just about to embark on our biannual research study on the participation of children and young people in sport and physical activity.  That research is carried out through the assistance of schools and we really appreciate their assistance in rolling out that research.</p> <p>  In addition to the research being carried out as part of that project, we have also engaged with the Department on the ongoing consultation around the junior cycle curriculum.  Dr. O'Connor previously mentioned the importance of physical literacy and this is something we raised in our consultation paper.  From our perspective it is also important to ensure we support not just the physical literacy side but the greater opportunities for children and young people in sport, particularly teenage girls who may value more variety in the opportunities they are offered.  The curriculum outlines significant opportunities but in order to ensure those opportunities are made available we must see the curriculum implemented to the full extent.</p></speech>

I do not know if Dr. May wishes to comment on the question I raised of a member of the board of Sport Ireland being a signatory to the letter to the IRFU.</p></speech>

I should reassure people that Lynne would absent herself from decisions on the board around the IRFU and any deliberations on this matter.  She is not involved with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#Q01000"><p>I totally appreciate that.  My point is that it is interesting that the chair of the women in sport committee has raised the matter.  I am conscious the IRFU is carrying out a review and on foot of that review, any response that is necessary and appropriate should be followed through.</p> <p>  On a local level and speaking about local clubs, I know Gorey Rugby Club has been particularly active in encouraging young women to get involved and it has a very active programme in that area.  We are seeing many examples of that in sports clubs and groups right around the country at juvenile level.  As Ms O'Connor and Dr. May have said, if it can be tied into the formal education system to provide those supports and that confidence to young women, many of the long-term objectives would be achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#Q01100"><p>I welcome all our guests today.  I will speak about the 20x20 campaign as mentioned by both Ms O'Connor and a former Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Griffin.</p><p>It was a fantastic campaign that highlighted the low levels of participation and the low level of media attention throughout women's sport.  As I said to the Minister of State earlier, we need a new campaign like that, although it would have a different title.  If we are going to reach those participation levels and close the gender gap, we need a campaign with the media attention that campaign got fully behind it.  It brought in a lot of high-profile international rugby players and players from all sports and we have seen the effect that had, particularly in the media.  According to the FIS's opening statement, in 2019 only 4.2% of articles referred to female sports and female athletes, which is astounding.  There has been an increase in representation, with games being covered on national radio and TV.  This is something that should be done and the Minister of State reacted positively to that suggestion.  I ask Sport Ireland and FIS to take that on board.  They can give it a different name but we should have a similar campaign over the next few years to make sure we reach that gender gap level by 2027 and increase not just participation in sport but attendance, media coverage and participation at an administrative level within the organisations.</p><p> I am a former member of the central council of the GAA.  The one club model is something I have always fully supported.  We should bring the LGFA, the Camogie Association and the GAA under one banner and promote all sports equally.  I look forward to seeing that happen and I believe it will happen fully in the not-too-distant future.</p><p> On the letter to the IRFU, Dr. May made a comment about when the report that the IRFU is conducting at present is published.  Yet, according to documentation and part of the letter, it is not going to be published.  Philip Browne said that the full review would not be made public and that the union would continue its long-standing policy of releasing only the key findings to the media.  Any review conducted by any organisation that is State-funded should be made public in order that everyone is aware of what the findings are and we can identify the issues and rectify them.  In this case there are a lot of issues within the rugby fraternity and they need to be rooted out and dealt with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#R00200"><p>The 20x20 campaign was presented by FIS.  It was not our concept but the key learning from that related to the target groups.  It resonated with different age cohorts of females, which was important, but it also resonated across genders.  It started difficult conversations and stimulated debate but it also motivated an awful lot of people to get involved in women's sport and motivated coverage of women's sport organically by organisations taking on their own livestreaming of events and so on.  That is all very welcome.  I know from talking to Ms Stapleton and Dr. May that work is ongoing around a visibility campaign in Sport Ireland and we welcome that.  The 20x20 campaign was independent and it was a great platform but moving forward we need to see how we can improve that.  We were delighted with the success of the two-year campaign and we will welcome any new campaign coming to the fore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nora Stapleton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#R00300"><p>I would add a point about the targeted approach to participants and who campaigns are targeting.  The 20x20 campaign was a fantastic visibility campaign.  We applauded it and it gave everybody a common message and common voice when it came to the visibility of women's sport.  We have spoken a lot about teenage girls today.  That is an area that we are keen to emphasise a lot more next year.  Our Adolescent Girls Get Active project is based on the research mentioned earlier, which we launched during the year.  We currently have four teenage girls programmes piloting across Ireland in our local sports partnership and they are modelled off the research that came out of that Adolescent Girls Get Active report.  Those pilot projects are being evaluated and will help us decide whether the way those projects were formed, including the physical activities within them, reflects the ethos of the key principles in the report, and if they have changed girls' attitudes towards physical activity and sport.  That is a key thing we are hoping to measure.  We have secured funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund, which will create a brand identity that will go with those projects.  Our aim is to build the number of teenage girls programmes running across the country as part of the local sports partnerships, but possibly with NGBs as well.  They should be inclusive and provide that welcoming environment for girls and have that national brand in order that girls can really see it and have it be visible to them so they are excited to be part of that physical activity programme.  That is the aim for that project next year as we look to create a brand identity that will make it visible for teenage girls.</p></speech>

Schools were mentioned.  That is the area to target for participation, and secondary schools in particular.  Do the witnesses have any statistics with regard to female participation across secondary schools throughout the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#R00600"><p>Participation in schools is the children's sport and physical activity research that we are about to embark on.  The data we have at the moment are a few years old.  That research collects data about the participation of children and young people.  Our Irish sports monitor covers data for people aged 16 and older but younger age groups' participation in school sports, after-school sports and what we refer to as community sports, that is, clubs and activities outside of school, will all be gathered in those data.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the publication of the reviews by the IRFU.  Obviously, we would prefer to see those reviews published.  It is important to note that Sport Ireland funds the sevens and from that point of view we would expect that report to be published and we would expect to have an influence on the decision whether to publish it.  However, the IRFU is the main funder of the women's 15s team so we would have less of a role to play.</p> <p>  We would be very interested in the possibility of a new campaign.  As is obvious from our presentations today, much of the work we have been doing is about building a structure and infrastructure in sport that supports women's participation.  We are coming closer to a situation where we can see the value in a further campaign.  We have run a number of specific campaigns, such as the teenage girls ones Ms Stapleton mentioned.  Next spring, we will start on the research for another new campaign, in partnership with the Department of Health, around physical activity for older women.  We also ran HER Outdoors campaign.  We identified from our research that women have enjoyed participating in the outdoors, as we were driven to do during the pandemic.  They enjoyed participation in the outdoors and we have promoted opportunities and options to be active in many different outdoor activities through that campaign.  I hope that answers some of those additional questions.</p></speech>

I have a comment and an observation.  A few weeks ago we had a very insightful discussion about referees and the treatment and lack of respect they face, such as the hostility they can meet in field games from spectators, players and parents.  I asked the three organisations that were before the committee about the gender balance of referees who officiate these games.  We did not get exact numbers but Ms O'Connor answered that question in her presentation when she stated: "In Ireland, 51% of women have never volunteered for sport.  Those who do volunteer are less likely than men to coach, referee or be a club official."  In that vein, have the witnesses conducted any research, interviews or surveys with those females who do participate as referees about how they feel?</p><p>Do they feel safe on a pitch when it comes to refereeing or have they experienced that lack of respect and hostility?  Is that a barrier in encouraging women to officiate over games?  As Ms O&rsquo;Connor has already answered this question somewhat in her presentation, I will go to her first for a response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#S00200"><p>The most popular thing you can do in any sport is to play and the next popular thing to do possibly is the coaching.  The least popular thing is always a throw-up between officiating or a chairpersonship because they can be difficult at times.  Not to be flippant about it but research in respect of female participation, in particular around refereeing and officiating, has been undertaken.  It is something about which more developed work needs to be completed.  I am aware that Ms Stapleton has started some work on that but I have mentioned previously that from a coaching point of view, we need to start the talent identification of individuals, be they administrators, referees or coaches, from a young age.  We have also mentioned third level sport and the governance that they may also have in that regard.  This talent identification will provide them with the opportunity to go along a pathway to ensure they will be upskilled and supported because, as I outlined at the very start of my statement, the reports tell us it is sometimes a question of confidence when it comes to women and girls in sport taking up any position, be it as a referee officiating and so on.  More work needs to be done in that regard but I am sure that Ms Stapleton will have more detail on this point.</p></speech>

Now that the Chair has raised the question, it is probably something that we could do.  I am sure that Ms Stapleton has started work in that regard.</p></speech>

Ms Stapleton may have some insight on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-15a.1125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nora Stapleton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021121500002#S00600"><p>I am not sure I have but I will try to answer.  It is important to note that until recently, there was no overarching body within Ireland to support referee development other than what the sports do themselves.  Sport Ireland coaching has recently taken on the role of helping sports to create the referee pathway.  Some of the larger sports have very good pathways in place but, as pointed out by the Chair, they have low numbers of female referees and it varies across each of the organisations.  We have not done in-depth research on this but there are fewer female referees than there are those coaching, if, for example, one is looking at ratios of male to female.  Through the Women in Sport funding programme of national governing bodies, NGBs, many of those bodies have included particular programmes and initiatives targeting females in umpiring, officiating and refereeing.  There are a number of these including everything from hockey through to such sports as table tennis, basketball etc.  Many of them offer young referee courses also such as young whistlers, which helps, as Ms O&rsquo;Connor pointed out, in trying to introduce people to refereeing from a much earlier age.  The LGFA, has established its referee academy and the IRFU has plans for that, also.  There is work in progress in this space.  I mentioned Sport Ireland coaching but it is also piloting a current referee workshop for some of those sports to help curate what a resource might look like to support sports in how they develop their referee pathway.</p></speech>

Have they experienced any hostility or lack of respect because that certainly has been the case for some men and it has to be the experience also of some of those women who take on this role?  Is there any research to identify that?</p></speech>

Many of the sports which have applied for funding towards referee initiatives in their sports have done their own research on that issue.  There is some such research there that we may be able to collate.</p> <p>  Our long-term aim is to replicate much of what we have done with coaching and to take a similar approach for refereeing.  In the same way as we did our Women in Sport Coaching Research report, we will repeat that exercise work for officiators.  We are waiting until Sport Ireland coaching establishes its referee or officiator support services and then we will link closely with that unit, with which I work, in order to establish what our plans will then be for refereeing.  The aim is to replicate much of what we have done for coaching because there may be similar attitudes, as may be the case and as has been pointed out by the Chair there, in how referees feel.</p></speech>

We are doing and developing some workshops and toolkits on establishing good practice in sport and it is our intention that this is something that will impact on the behaviours on and off the field, apart from actual sports participation issues that are arising, thereby tackling some of these issues, such as the refereeing problems we are having.</p></speech>

It is great to see Ms Nora Stapleton there because both of my daughters idolised her when she was working with Ballinteer St. Johns GAA.  Ms Stapleton is probably still greatly responsible for the fact that they still play football and camogie.  I know, at first hand, how lucky Sport Ireland is to have her in that role.</p> <p>  In the view of our guests, do they feel that the weighting of funding for female participation needs to be increased?</p></speech>

This is not something that I have given in-depth consideration to before today.  Women in sport funding has increased in the past number of years and that has to be welcomed.  I have spoken in the past about historical inequity in the investment in women in sport and I am very much a person who is solution-focused on the future.  As I said in my submission today in the last paragraph, there has been a significant impact made by the Women in Sport policy in having a dedicated resource and having someone who is as excellent as Ms Stapleton is in delivering on that.  At this stage we need to look ahead to see what the policy has and whether we can ensure that all the actions in that policy are financially resourced in order that they can be delivered upon.  Any policy is only ever going to be evaluated on what its outputs are and that is the most important thing for me.</p></speech>

However, the concept of weighting funding is a different matter and there are innovative ways in which we can incentivise, if I can put it like that, better practices within the NGBs without having to resort to cutting funding.  This is something that we can continue to monitor as options going forward.  It is very good that we see innovative opportunities and solutions like that.</p></speech>

It is good to see him again and I hope that his two girls are doing well.  They are very good camogie players.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that the Women in Sport funding that goes to NGBs is not the only funding that is ring-fenced for these bodies.  That is a particular programme which helps support additional programmes and initiatives as an add-on to what they are already currently doing in their sport.  It probably comes back, however, to the culture within the sports themselves to ensure how that funding together with the overall pot of funding is used.  This can be done either equitably or if there is an equal division there between the male and female sports participants the whole way up through whatever areas of the particular part of their game where it might be needed.  That may be in coaching, in leadership or in participation programmes.  It might be also worth adding in that sports sometimes lead and administer women&rsquo;s sport without having a full understanding of what is needed to get the best from that sport.</p><p>It is really important to have a female presence at senior management level so there will be knowledge and an understanding of women&rsquo;s sports in running sport in the national governing body or local sports partnerships.  There are different needs and levels of understanding, and there are requests that may simply be different because male and female athletes and coaches are different.  It is about respecting that difference, celebrating it where it should be celebrated and ensuring everybody in the sports community can be facilitated and supported in having life-long involvement in sport.</p></speech>
