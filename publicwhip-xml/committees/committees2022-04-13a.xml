Before we begin, I remind members, guests and persons in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  The purpose of this session is to examine afforestation and the forestry sector, while the second session will relate to an update on forestry sector targets.  In our first session, the committee will hear from representatives from the Save groups and the Social, Economic, Environmental Forestry Association, SEEFA.  Each group has been allocated one hour for its engagement with the committee.</p> <p>  On 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions removed the general requirement to maintain 2 m physical distancing, public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means witnesses will have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is within the parliamentary precincts.  There is no assurance in respect of participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of that when they make their contributions.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Francis Cassidy, Mr. Brian Smyth and Ms Teresa McVeigh from the Save groups.  I invite them to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#A00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as an gcuireadh teacht isteach ar son na bpobal timpeall na h&Eacute;ireann at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute; leis an bhforaoiseacht.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording us this opportunity to make a presentation and talk about the communities in which we live and the pressures we are under regarding forestry and forestry policy in Ireland.</p> <p>  Forestry, in many areas, has a bad name, especially so in the area where I come from, which is west Cavan.  It has resulted in the decline of farm families living in our area by falsely inflating the price of farmland, enabling investors to outbid local interests.  The subsequent reduction in population has further deprived our rural villages of services and users.  Our landscape has been irreparably blighted, not just by afforestation but also by clear-felling, which leaves vast tracts of our hillsides barren, in a manner similar to Armageddon.</p> <p>  Although some of the forestry is privately owned, a very small part is owned by people residing in the area.  To the families of west Cavan, Leitrim, Kerry or Wicklow, it is no different whether the Sitka is owned by Coillte, a pension fund or a farmer from Cork.  The daylight is blocked; the neighbour is gone.  Absentee landlords are no advantage to the local economy.  They pay no road tax or development levies on new builds or extensions.  They employ no workers.  It is lose-lose.  The families who remain are often the last families on laneways that were planted on both sides, creating a tunnel effect.  Isolation and light deprivation are well-known contributors to depression and social withdrawal.</p> <p>  We have provided the committee with a written submission in advance and we will be happy to talk at length about any issues members wish to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#A00400"><p>I thank Mr. Cassidy.  He stated very little of the land under afforestation is privately owned.  Does he have figures on what proportion is owned by people living in the locality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#A00500"><p>Yes.  I can talk about west Cavan in particular and my colleagues might talk about Leitrim and other areas.  In west Cavan, the total area, based on 2007 figures, is 30,000 ha.  Coillte owns almost 4,000 ha.  The figure that is privately owned is 1,821 ha, meaning approximately 20% of the land area in west Cavan is under afforestation.</p><p>In answer to the Chairman's question about private land, approximately 500 ha of a total of 30,000 ha are owned by local interests.  The average plantation owned by a farmer in the area would be 5 ha or 6 ha.  They are very small.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#B00200"><p>The figures we have for Leitrim are not absolutely clear, but approximately 50% of the forest estate is owned by Coillte.  Some 30,000 ha of forestry are planted.  The average size for farmers from our estimation is 6.2 ha and that for the companies or investors is 22 ha.  Of course, farmers only plant one plot and the investors have multiple plots and are proceeding to purchase more to build larger portfolios.  The pressure on farm families from the state aid exemption is problematic.  It is distorting the decisions farmers make, the entry of new farmers and the access to land both to lease and to purchase.  The afforestation scheme is distorting the access to land.  It is when the percentage of land reaches a certain limit acceptable to local people at least that the issues have arisen and the resistance to it has increased and is increasing all the time.</p> <p>  We identified all the issues here.  There are issues for farmers and farming.  There are very different types of forestry.  A farmer planting some space is very different from a corporate drive to produce timber because farmers need a regular income over a long period rather than investing, sitting back and waiting for it to mature and provide a return on the investment.  There is no real distinction in the afforestation programme between the goals of achieving quality net carbon sink or carbon sequestration as opposed to timber production.  There needs to be a distinction on that.  The system of support for farmers needs to be quite different from that for timber production because farmers are not necessarily timber producers.  They are farmers and they want to farm.  Young people want to get into farming, and they want to farm.  Forestry is certainly a mix for many on the farm, but it is not the be all and end all.  It should be possible for them to make decisions to plant that as part of providing a multi-source income.  Rather than focusing necessarily on timber, they should have the option of doing it for biodiversity reasons or for long-term carbon goals.</p> <p>  We know the state aid exemption is distorting the market for land in Leitrim and distorting the decisions young people are making on whether to get into farming and how they can access land.  It also generates other significant issues that are pointed out in the submission.  The issue of farming and forestry is one issue.  The licensing system is obviously problematic.  We continue to address that in our observations and appeals.  Regarding environmental impact statements and 30,000 acres planted in a drive to continue to plant, the advisory appeals committee has told us that there is no limit on any townland or parish.  People can continue to plant as much as they want until it is all planted if necessary.</p> <p>  There is no consideration of the goals of local communities.  If a parish wants to try to keep a school open, the goal is to limit the number of farms sold and planted so that people can actually live there.  That goal is not accepted or reviewed in the process of afforestation licensing, which is problematic for many communities.  There are many other goals such as keeping the village alive and keeping the shop open.  The shop will only remain open when people remain in the place.  The drive to plant in areas like ours in Leitrim, west Cavan, east Clare, north Kerry and Wicklow is driving people out and creating demographic decline beyond what would be expected in these rural areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#B00300"><p>In his opening statement Mr. Cassidy said afforestation has inflated the price of land.  Surely, that is a two-way street.  The person selling land is entitled to the best available price if afforestation has inflated the price of land in these areas.  I can understand his point about people staying in the community who want to stay farming and who want services.  However, someone selling land is entitled to the best available price.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#B00400"><p>However, the market is being distorted by state aid.  The market will pay whatever the market will bear; that is the economics in any field.  A young farmer can apply for a bank loan for an extension to his farm or whatever.  If he is going to plant the land, he will get a certain amount of credit whereas if he is going to try to farm, whether it is dairy, suckling or sheep production, he will get less credit because the figures do not add up and because of the sustainability of traditional farming methods as opposed to drawing down the loans over 15 years.  The banks will favour a person extending their holding for forestry or will favour the people, the corporates, who are buying land.  They can afford to give them more because they can sit back and wait whereas, as my colleague said, farm families need an income every year.  In our area a neighbouring farm that was refused under the licensing system was sold for &euro;2,200 an acre whereas if that had been approved for afforestation that would probably have been &euro;5,000 an acre.  That is the difference.  That is the crux of the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#B00500"><p>In addition, there is no real land-use plan as to what level of afforestation is acceptable to keep communities viable.  A number of years ago University College Cork looked at how the farming euro contributes to the local economy.  The farming euro in an economy is much stronger than the forestry euro because of the multiplier effect.  If that farm remains open, the farmer is going to the local store, hiring local contractors, and buying diesel and other fuel locally.  They are in and out spending money every day of the week, keeping the economy alive.  When farmers plant the land, it is a fenced.  The grant and some of the first- or second-year premium generally goes to the forestry company to plant and seal it up and nobody goes back near that again for ten years.  Many people who are now planting up these farms are not resident and not spending any money in the local economy.</p> <p>  As the drive to plant increases, it is distorting the economy as well as the land market.  It is good for everybody that land prices increase but it is when that creates other problems that it becomes a problem in itself.  That is what we are concerned about.  If ten farms are planted, that is ten families gone for two cycles - 80 years minimum.  We are seeing exponential decline because of the drive to plant and because of the State investment in that.  In the process of licensing, there is no consideration of trying to keep schools open, etc.</p> <p>  Our submission quoted our local authority in Leitrim.  It stated that it now has little impact on the process of planning what is planted or on licensing.  The forest roads used to be under the remit of the local authorities but this was removed in 2017.  In 2011, plantations became exempted developments.  The licensing for felling and replanting are outside the local authorities' remit.</p><p>There is no democratic input to the process unless you pay your &euro;20 or &euro;200 for the appeal.  The grounds of appeal are so narrow that the considerations that we are explaining today are not examined in that process.  This is all driven by public money, and a lot of it is focusing on these areas where there is a perception that the land is so poor that what else would you do with it anyway.  It is driving our communities into the ground and that is why we are here today to explain how that happens.  That is why we have started observing on these processes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#C00200"><p>Despite the backdrop, I am in the west so I apologise for that, but this is important and therefore I wanted to link in to this meeting remotely.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Smyth from Save.  I am very familiar with them.  I have travelled to Leitrim on many occasions and walked many of these farms and forests.  I have talked to the communities up there, and I continue to actively engage with them and their public representatives.  Three things come out of this for me.  I fully support the Save community organisation and the people on the ground up there whose key issue is sustainable communities, proper planning and sustainable development.  Given our remit, the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, must look at how we support them.  Most committee members represent rural constituencies and rural communities and it is important to emphasise that we must stand in solidarity with communities that wish to see their community develop in a sustainable manner.</p> <p>  The key ask here is if we are supportive of a plan.  We need a land-use plan and there must be a balance between forestry, agriculture, tourism and other sustainable development, but there must also be support for the communities in the area.  I hear loud and clear from Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Smyth and others that this is what they want to protect.  They want a balance in terms of development.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing some more evidence about the relationship with the organisations and Coillte itself in terms of ongoing consultation and negotiation and how it is receiving their concerns.  Coillte is a State agency.  There is also the private sector, which in many ways is a different animal.  State aid exemption was touched on here this morning.  Clearly, that is distorting the market.  I accept what you say, a Chathaoirligh, about people's property rights, but we have bigger rights also, such as community rights, sustainability and commitments to regional development.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses today to talk about their relationship with the county councils in Leitrim and Cavan in terms of the county development plan, whose objective is clearly to set out proper planning and sustainable development for their communities.  What is their relationship with the local authorities?  Have they endeavoured to make submissions to those development plans?  How have they progressed?  Have they been meaningful?  Have they been well received by the executive of those councils and the elected members?  I hear what the witnesses are saying.  I have been in Leitrim in particular and seen what has happened.  There is devastation.</p> <p>  Before I finish my questions I want to tell this story.  I spoke a few years ago to a man whose three sons decided they wanted to buy 15 acres up on the hill.  They went to the bank and the bank manager said, forget it lads, you are not going to get funding for this because I am already aware that some forestry company wants to purchase it and you will not compete with them.  He said, whatever you want to pay, they will outbid you for it.  That is devastating in itself.  They were people trying to expand their small agricultural holding by 15 acres and they were told they would be up against a private forestry company and competing with it.  That is the reality on the ground and that is not acceptable.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>  I have three questions.  Could the witnesses touch on their campaign in terms of seeking to have a land-use plan that gives balance to all conflicting demands or ambitions?  Could they expand on their relationship with Coillte?  Could they share with us how that has gone?  What is the difference between the relationship with Coillte as a State forestry company versus other forestry companies?  I say well done to the witnesses.  They should keep going.  I will give them one little bit of advice: they should keep the pressure on their elected representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for that matter, their Senators in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and sitting county councillors.  They are there to represent people and their concerns and the interests of the community and the organisations in it.  The witnesses are on the right road.  They are doing something that is important for their community and ultimately it is about proper planning and sustainable development for their area.  I commend them on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#C00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  I am trying to get my own head around it, to delve into it a little further and to get a little bit more information.  I am from the midlands, which is not too far away from Cavan or Leitrim.  While the land might be a little bit better, the holdings would not be that much bigger.  For one, I get where they are coming from and what they are talking about.  I want to get my head around the issue.  The witnesses are not anti-forestry.  They are in favour of the right tree in the right place at the right time.  Their major concern and main gripe is the corporate buy-outs.  How does it work?  Does a landowner apply for a licence and sell on his land when he has the licence or does he sell his land to a corporate entity pending the licence or does he plant and sell on afforested land?  What seems to be the trend?  How does it work?  When people sell out, do they move on or are they just selling the land and stay around and work in another job or keep a small plot of land?  Is the trend to just sell up and get out and is that the major issue in terms of keeping communities viable?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses know the current volume of licence applications in the Department from their respective areas?  If they have an idea of the volume, are the majority of them in the name of private individuals or landowners or are they corporate entities?  The main point for me to get my head around is how the corporate takeover works.  Is it a case of buying land which they then plant or is it buying land with a licence or buying up land that is already planted?  Where does the private individual get out of the circle?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#C00400"><p>I just have one question.  I too welcome the witnesses.  We hear the problems they are facing in their area.  Are they in contact with other areas around the country that are having the same problems, for example, with county councils in Tipperary or Cork?  Is it the same problem that is being encountered right across the country or, as Senator Paul Daly asked, is it unique to the smallholdings in the areas the witnesses represent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#C00500"><p>A number of issues arise there.  I will take them in rotation.  First, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas for the support.  We welcome the support from all elected representatives and all bodies.  We will talk about county councils and planning first.  That is a strange one in that we have lobbied in each county for the inclusion of a proper land-use policy and forestry policy in each county development plan, but central government overrides the county development plans on a regular basis.  It says this is Government policy and we are going to plant this land regardless of how many paragraphs there are in a county development plan.</p> <p>  It is a strange situation that Cavan County Council, Leitrim County Council and Kerry County Council can say a person cannot have 5 ft. windows in their bungalow, but if they are reduced to 3 ft. they will give planning permission while the person next door who is planting 49 ha does not need any approval.  He can get a licence to plant 49 ha with very little oversight.  There seems to be something intrinsically wrong in that situation.  The entire visual landscape of the side of a mountain, hill or plateau will be changed by the planting of 49 ha and only a licence from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is needed.  At the same time, the young couple next door who is building a bungalow cannot put 5 ft. wide windows in it.</p><p>They have to reduce them by 3 ft. or they have to change them, or they are only allowed one driveway into their house or whatever.  There is something wrong there.</p><p> In regard to Coillte, the private companies and consultation, we only wish there was consultation.  There is no consultation.  The consultation is a business card in the letter box of an elderly lady.  The consultation is ringing you up and saying we have bought the farm next door to you, we are going to plant it, we have the licence or we have applied for the licence and if you are not happy, we will plant three rows of beech on the outside as opposed to two.  There is no consultation.</p></speech>

One of our members took a case for judicial review and following that case, the forest service was obliged to instruct applicants to put notice on a property for afforestation, but that was not the case for felling.  Once the licence is granted for felling, the notice goes up but at that stage, the consultation process is over because the job is done.  What we have is foresters who are well-qualified and professional making decisions about the long-term use of our land and the huge industrial scale plantation that takes place on it.  As it is exempted development, our local authority in Leitrim has spent something more than 300 hours in a 12 month period making submissions that were largely ignored.  That was the case when I last spoke to the senior planner.  Only certain plots are referred to the local authority where they are close to SACs or the road will exit onto a council road.  Only certain projects are referred to the local authority.</p> <p>  The draft county development plan in Leitrim has reflected that.  The consultation is open at the moment and on 27 April we have a significant submission to make.  We engage with the local authority on a regular basis.  Two of our members in Save Leitrim are councillors and as was another one previously.  We engage with all the local councillors on an ongoing basis, and with the executive.  We know them well.  They more or less think in line with what we are seeing and doing in that regard.  The draft county plan states that in certain protected landscapes it would be the preference of this local authority if commercial planting was restricted or prohibited altogether as such commercial forestry is exempted development and there is frustration within the local authority that this express objective cannot be realised.  That is the executive of the local authority and the members saying they are frustrated by the lack of input that they can make into how the county develops and its future.</p> <p>  There is no land use plan.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop one on a national basis but they should be run out in each local authority.  That would define the type of land use in a particular area and whether that land is to be maintained for communities to live in, for agriculture or for biodiversity.  Our chairperson referenced the increase in the value of land.  We are talking about high nature value land in Leitrim.  These are small enclosed fields and they are very valuable for biodiversity.  If the same value was put on that by Government and by the EU and paid for, as is paid for the afforestation, then the value would be seen in the price of land as well.  It is valuable land.  It may not be valuable in terms of the number of cows and the milk solids you can get from it or whatever but it is very valuable land to us because it keeps our communities viable.  It has raised generations of people and, hopefully, will continue to do so.  When you get to the percentage plantation level driven by these incentives from Government and now by corporate investors.  The corporates are not just companies, they are farmers from other areas who are buying up land and planting it.  It is a misnomer to think that the corporates are just faceless companies or the Canadian teachers' pension fund, for instance, or a Danish investment company.  Many of them are based in Dublin and are buying large tracts of land.  There is a mix of people there.</p> <p>  In regard to Coillte, locally we have a good relationship with it in the broad sense because it has been in Leitrim, west Cavan and other places and has large land ownership for many years.  Certainly there are issues with Coillte in its wider sense, in terms of its pure profit statutory remit.  That is not necessarily applicable nowadays where we have climate issues.  The statute was developed in 1988 and certainly needs review to incorporate other agendas into the corporate remit of Coillte.  Certainly it is doing things, such as Coillte Nature, but that is competing with local communities, for instance, for recreational funding.  There is a wider concern with our group in terms of the drive for profit in Coillte.  It is investing in wind and is taking out forestry and that is creating its own issues in the communities.  We had the landslide, although not on Coillte property, but it was very close to an SAC, which has been overplanted, previous to the designation.  There is a wide range of issues.</p> <p>  On replanting on Coillte's property nationally, 53% is on peat and there is a net loss of carbon when you plant and replant peat.  The bogs in the midlands we have mentioned are now being protected and are being rewet and rewilded for biodiversity and climate issues.  The same should apply to the properties that were degraded by planting them with conifers which in many cases did not grow.  I saw some of them at the weekend.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses' counties very well.  There is a concern where there is a house and a forest on either side of it.  God forbid if a fire ever broke out, but there is a huge risk.  There is no point in saying there is not.</p> <p>  There is a situation in Leitrim where some people - and it is hard to blame them in some cases - were farming fairly marginal land in places.  We might not like it in Roscommon, Galway or Meath, but some of the farmers in Leitrim planted their own land and are renting land up the country.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

It has more than its share, and I would be the first to say that.</p> <p>  It is about how you resolve the issues or about how you strike a balance in each county.  We need a certain amount of forestry, and there is no point in saying we do not.  What was said about peaty ground was right.  Bad pine was put on it and an acre of some of the wood would not light a fire for a half hour because it never grew right.  It was a thing that was done at the time.  Government needs to take a decision on that and on what it is going to do down the road.</p> <p>  At one time - I would be in favour of this coming back - we had the Land Commission and it helped smaller farms to consolidate.  We have to clear about this.  If a farmer is selling his or her farm, or is going to do something with it, he or she is entitled to his or her price.  If Martin gives a better price, I have to accept it.  Access to money may be a problem for some.  We need to bring something in, such as a Government-backed scheme like the old Land Commission one.</p><p>The old Land Commission had a great system.  It had flaws, however.  Nobody is going to praise it to the last because it had flaws, but it consolidated many small farmers in areas and helped communities.  I want to hear the response from the witnesses on one thing.  We see the statistics the Department throws to us which state that if farmers have forestry on their land, it will keep them in the community and they are kept busy at X, Y and Z.  What is their experience over the years regarding jobs in the area?</p></speech>

He will go through them and the employment myths around forestry.</p></speech>

The farmer is continually spending money.  Farmers get the annual payments for their schemes and they sell cattle, sheep or whatever.  That money circulates, and the IFA report showed that it multiplies by four within the community.  The same forestry euro multiplies by approximately 40 cent above the euro, so there is a big difference.  The economies in Leitrim and other places are built on small farms.  They may not necessarily be viable in themselves if one looks at it from a purely financial perspective, but they are maintaining viable rural communities.  What is happening is that, while every farmer is entitled to the best price they can get, many of these people have died or have gone into nursing homes and their places have been sold.  That is where much of the land is coming into play.  The family is away and they are selling it or the farmer is no longer able and somebody else is applying for the licence on behalf of the farmer so it can push the value up and use the money to look after the farmer in the nursing home or wherever.  It is very unfortunate that this is the case.</p> <p>  In terms of employment, the number of farms is referred to at the back of the submission we sent, if the Deputy has seen it.  The 2019 study that was done in Leitrim by University College Dublin shows, although the draft county development plan shows a different number, that there are 309.3 full-time jobs associated with forestry and wood processing in Leitrim.  Masonite Ireland is there.  However, only 41% are related to Leitrim residents working, so that is people who come into the county to work there, like many of the contractors.  I believe there are two contractors harvesting.  They operate nationally, and it is a large-scale, industrial operation.  It is highly intensive machinery-wise, so the numbers are small.  A large portion of that work would be haulage, and that has its own issues as well.  There are 127 full-time jobs relating to residents working in Leitrim on plantation and so forth.</p> <p>  We see job displacement with planting land.  In the agricultural census of 2010, the average size of a farm was 25.1 ha.  There were 3,673 farms in Leitrim.  The average labour unit was 1.5 based on the annual work unit of seven hours, five days per week.  Looking at that, we see a displacement in the land planted in that period of time of approximately 1,297 jobs out of agriculture, compared with what was created in the equivalent forestry.  If one has forest farms, one is reducing the input of labour across the board.  It is also downstream because that farmer is not spending money in the local co-operative buying wrap, getting a contractor in or going to the mart.  One is reducing the economic impact by planting land.  It is clear.</p></speech>

When one looks at objections to felling licences in Leitrim and other places, although a lot of them came from that neck of the woods, the harm is done at that stage given that the trees are grown.  Why do the witnesses think there were so many objections to the felling of the timber?  The timber was grown.  If it is grown, it is end timber.  That is the first matter.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is appearing before the committee later.  What is the witnesses' view of Ireland's targets?  At present, they are looking to farmers even sowing an acre down the back or wherever under the eco-scheme.  There is a big push for that, although what has gone on over the past few years in the Department has turned farmers against planting.  What is the witnesses' view on that when they look at the figures in the carbon budgets that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is obsessed with and in the climate action plan?</p></speech>

Like many things in life, if one were setting a model, one would not start from here.  However, we are at this point.  Unfortunately, in the current forestry programme and what seems to be talked about under Project Woodland and what has leaked out from the different agencies, it appears that the <i>status quo</i>is going to continue, except under a different name.  The trees are only the by-product in the forestry policy in Ireland.  The product is the premiums and the tax breaks.  It is immaterial what people are planting.  They could be planting wind bushes, but it is immaterial.  It is all about the tax breaks, the premiums and the pension funds.  It has nothing to do with sustainable communities.<br/><br/>The new forestry programme has to have the buy-in of local communities.  It must have Kerry, Wicklow, west Cavan, Leitrim and east Clare.  Otherwise somebody else will be sitting in a committee room like this five or ten years hence talking about Project Woodland and why it failed.  That is the reality.  We are not anti-trees.  I can bring the members to my home farm and show trees that were planted in 1922 by my grandfather.  We love trees, but we hate the Sitka nonsense that is going on.  It is isolating the neighbour and cutting out the daylight.  That is our problem.  We want sustainable communities.  We believe passionately in where we come from and in the people in our areas.  We are representing them as best we can.<br/><br/>We want to see a better vision for rural Ireland.  Forestry has a role in that, but it is not the saviour of Ireland, no more than it is the saviour of the carbon budgets.  It is only a small part of it.  People and communities are the future.  That is where the problem of afforestation can be solved.  The Minister of State can talk all she likes about different aspects of the afforestation programme, buy-in and the like, but unless one meets and talks to the communities and there are reasonable policies, one will not have the communities.  One will only alienate them.</p></speech>

The weight of the commitment that Leitrim has given is the land that has been taken out and planted and continues to be taken out every week.  Somebody asked about the numbers.  We watch the licensing every day.  There is not a single day that there is no licence application and we observe as many of them as we can, and now as many as we can afford to as opposed to anything else.  Obviously, that licensing system is still very flawed, but we will continue to use that to make the point.  That is what we have done to date.  With afforestation felling, the only way to fix the replanting issues is by observing the terms of the felling licences.  Unless one does that, one will not fix the issue.  It is incumbent on us to look at and observe them and appeal in cases where we believe it is necessary.  That is the only thing that has worked to change the system for us so far.</p> <p>  Carbon budgeting is a national issue for which there should be a national plan.  For land use, that should be county by county and everybody should have a commitment to planting trees of some sort in their areas, on their farms and in other places where land is owned.  The burden of tree planting should not fall to vulnerable rural communities where everybody thinks the land is crap and that we should just plant it and clear the people out.  That should not be a just transition to a carbon climate solution.  The problem we have is that this is being dumped on us in places such as Leitrim, west Cavan, north Kerry, east Clare and Wicklow.</p></speech>

It is an important voice that needs to be heard in the wider debate on afforestation.  This committee agrees that forestry can play an important role in the future of agriculture and meeting our climate emissions targets.  Sometimes, the third cog of that is missed, namely, that forestry should also be playing a part in good community development.  As has been said, this means that communities need to be part of the process.  It has been mentioned a number of times that there needs to be better community buy-in and ownership of the process in terms of what is happening in local areas.  Do the witnesses have any proposals on how that can be delivered?  What legislative changes would need to be made that would ensure that community voices are heard in the context of forestry plans for the future?</p></speech>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is poacher and gamekeeper because it is setting the policy and licensing the system.  The commitment is to advance and push the planting of more and more trees.  It is priming the pump to do that, and pushing forestry into our area.  We see that there are issues.  The issues we see on the ground when that happens are not being addressed sufficiently in monitoring and enforcement, or when we raise concerns.  The local authority is addressing them up to a point, particularly where there are water pollution and other issues, but it should not all be located within the one authority.  We believe that licensing being solely the responsibility of the Department is an issue.  We see the fact that it is exempt in development as an issue.  We believe that should change in some way.  The local democratic input is made through the local county development plan.  The frustration is that the local authority does not have a say and cannot make its views on the county development plan known on the basis of what people want within the county.  We want sustainable-----</p></speech>

In my area, a lot of elderly farmers have passed away.  It might be the case that a niece or nephew in a different country sells the land, and it goes straight to the forestry because they outbid any of the local farmers.  The whole place is now sick of spruce.  There is a massive cumulative effect of spruce everywhere.  All the households are affected.  There is no point in people putting up solar panels on houses because there is no solar energy.</p></speech>

They are trading the land, even within the county, between companies.  Certainly, they are issues.  All the groups would suggest that Coillte's remit be looked at.  It engages with communities to an extent, but it could be far more based on community input.</p> <p>  On the issue of felling, if there was a community remit, then they would be much more aware of what is happening.  I was at a house on Sunday where people lost power for four days.  Felling went ahead.  One of the recent storms brought trees down on the line and cut the power to the house for four days.  That was purely because ESB was watching the network.  It did not have a proper licence and did not manage the felling to trim back along the lines before it started opening it up.  It opened it up and two storms came in and took massive amounts of trees and power out.  The inconvenience there is that the trees grow up and people lose their Internet and TV connections.  There are all sorts of issues.  Those are two of them.</p> <p>  There should be a statutory requirement to develop a land-use policy with proper consultation and input from the local authority which states that the area will not be planted or not planted any more.  There are townlands now where the percentage of areas planted is in the 90s.  When we were attending the forestry appeals in person, we were seeing on the screen the percentage of the areas planted.  It is frightening in some areas, with 90% of the townland planted.  When you get to that, who is ever going to go back to live there?  Then the next townland goes, and so on.  It is cumulative, as Ms McVeigh has said.  That is the killer.  In County Leitrim, we have the highest percentage planted.  It is similar in west Cavan, parts of east Clare and north Kerry.  It gets to a point where the canary in the coalmine indicates that there is a big problem here.  Until the canary dies, people will say that it is grand and we can work away.  What we are saying here today is that we want the members to listen.  We want change.  The state aid decision is driving plantation.  If that same state aid was being used to deliver biodiversity and tackle climate change by funding farmers to plant for 25 for 30 years for purely carbon emissions, they would not have to fell the trees necessarily.  They would not have to be looking for felling licences.  Part of their land could be planted for those reasons alone.  That would help support the price of land as much as it would for afforestation.  Real thought in those things is needed.  It will encourage people who have more valuable land in terms of finance to perhaps also consider planting that poor land.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely that there are some areas where there has been a proliferation.  That needs to be accounted for in terms of how we plan for the future.  We need to undo damage that has been done by very poor forestry and planning policy in the communities that the witnesses have spoken about predominantly.  We also need to recognise that as well as forestry playing a role, wood is going to be required for lots of other things that we want to do, particularly in sustainable building development and all the rest going forward.  The big quandary that I have is how we get that balance right and how we put in place the planning and legislative protections to ensure that communities' voices are heard and that communities are not overrun, while at the same time ensuring that the country is not without afforestation or a timber sector.  I know it is not the witnesses' job - they are here to represent their communities and they have already mentioned a few matters that the committee can explore a bit further - but do they have any sense of how we can get the balance right in order that we can try to be all things to everyone in terms of the wider targets of any good strategy?</p></speech>

There are lots of things that we could look at.  The country is playing catch-up to where we are.  We have 25% to 30% afforestation in some DEDs.  Over the average of west Cavan, we are looking at 25% of the available land.  Where does the sustainability come into it?  Is the package of measures that we are talking about aiming to increase the afforestation?  Do we need to pay an enhanced premium on what we call the better type land in order to bring those levels of afforestation from the 3% and 4% up to the 11% national average?  Do we put a moratorium on areas such as west Cavan, Leitrim, east Clare and Kerry, and say that we are going to have no more afforestation there until we get the levels up nationally?  We are going to have to be innovative.  In my area, there is 30,000 ha in DEDs.  I live beside two forestry plantations.  I am in the middle of two of them really, with one on each side of me.  Perhaps we could look at whether me and my neighbours should be entitled to any carbon credits in relation to excess on our vehicles.  It is about looking at where we can go with this.  Where is the buy-in and the dividend for the communities that have lived beside a Coillte plantation for the past 40 years?  Where is the dividend for the farm families beside the plantations that have been shaded out?</p> <p>  Perhaps we can look at the excise on vehicles and reduce the carbon tax in relation to petrol or diesel.  Can we be innovative?  Can we come back and support those communities that are doing something for the climate, have 25% to 30% afforestation, are doing this nationally and are doing their bit?  Can be put community centres there?  Can we make sure that there is a Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, school and a DEIS grant for every school in those areas?  We have to think outside of the box.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibilities that we come up with solutions.  There are solutions there if we look for them.  What we need is the will to incorporate them into the new forestry model.</p><p>There has to be a win for communities.  Otherwise, there will be objections.  It does not matter whether the licensing laws are amended because if communities are activated against a proposal and a solution is not found, they will try to do something about it.</p></speech>

I remind everyone that mobile phones should be turned off for the duration of the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to bring to everyone's attention that witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  This means that witnesses will have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The witnesses wish to split their opening statement in two.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Teige Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#G00500"><p>Before I begin, I thank the committee for inviting SEEFA to speak about the issues facing the forestry sector.  The committee will be well aware of the issues, given that this matter was before the committee an unprecedented six times in 2021.  Unfortunately, many of the issues remain despite the committee's best efforts.</p> <p>  The climate action plan states "Afforestation is the single largest land-based climate change mitigation measure available to Ireland."  Of a climate action afforestation target of 8,000 ha in 2021, only 2,000 ha were planted.  The forest service's inability to meet programme for Government afforestation targets over for the past six years has resulted in a failure to plant 21,500 ha, which could have removed 8 million tonnes of CO2 from our atmosphere.</p> <p>  Today, we hope to discuss the approach from the forest service, which is further suppressing afforestation levels and seriously undermining confidence among landowners.  In January, the Department outlined its plan to issue 5,250 licences for 2022, which it described as "highly ambitious".  Shame on the Department.  It was informed by the industry in 2021 that a minimum of 7,000 licences would be required in 2022 for the sector to function and retain current employment levels.  We were therefore dismayed when the forest service ignored that advice and published a licensing plan that did not meet the needs of the sector.  What an ambition.  Seven hundred and fifty-nine afforestation licences remain in the system, with an average of only 12 being issued weekly.  Some 60% of these licences have now been with the forest service for more than 13 months, and of all licences issued for 2021, only 12% were for afforestation.  Forestry companies and businesses are seriously impacted by the Department's inability to issue enough licences for the industry to trade.  The Department will claim that it has hired more ecologists and expects to see improvements in licensing output over the coming weeks, but how many times has the committee been told that?  The reality is that nothing is changing.  Is it not ironic that, with a Green Party Senator as our Minister of State, the industry is considering a planned protest outside this building for our right to plant trees, produce wood and maintain rural jobs?</p> <p>  Forestry nurseries have only survived because increased afforestation levels in Scotland of over 12,000 ha per annum presented a lifeline and an opportunity to export millions of saplings that would otherwise have been destroyed.  This would have resulted in the closure of the nurseries and an end to a forestry nursery culture in Ireland, rendering all Government afforestation targets impossible for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  The success in Scotland can be attributed to political will at ministerial level in respect of tree planting and full implementation of Mackinnon's recommendations on its licensing system.  Political will and any implementation of Mackinnon's recommendations are something that we in Ireland apparently cannot achieve.  The recent review of the regulatory system presents an opportunity for change and a chance to reverse arbitrary policy decisions that have the industry in its current state.  However, the possibility of regulatory reform will again test political will at ministerial level.</p> <p>  Policy decisions, a dysfunctional licensing system and mismanagement at senior level have resulted in our once thriving private forestry sector going from planting 15,000 ha per annum 20 years ago to 8,000 ha ten years ago, and reduced to just 2,000 ha in 2021, the lowest level since 1946.  This is completely against Government policy.  The Department will claim a lack of interest among farmers for this reduction.</p><p>However, if these issues are to be addressed correctly, the Department must first accept the reasons for the decline, which are excessive delays in its licensing system, the shameful way landowners have been treated in relation to ash dieback and the obvious incompatibility between afforestation and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has seen farmer planting decline by over 80% during the term of the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Input from forestry stakeholders could prevent a repeat of this in the next CAP.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s assistant secretary who has the forestry mandate also has responsibility for GLAS.  However, our sector was not notified or invited onto the CAP consultative committee at the outset.  When the industry requested membership later, we were refused by our own Minister.</p><p> Do members believe significant changes are needed to regain confidence among landowners?  Do they believe that significant changes are required to achieve our climate action commitments?  Do they want to see new rural jobs such as seed collectors, nursery operatives, agricultural contractors, machine drivers, fencers, planters or maintenance crews - I could go on - created in their areas?  None of these opportunities will be realised if we do not recognise the elephant in the room and deal with it quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#H00200"><p>Some 23,000 farmers have committed their most valuable asset, their land, to forestry, based on Government policy and incentives since the late 1980s.  These are mainly first-generation forest owners.  Many of these pioneers would now strongly discourage any farmer from engaging in forestry, due to the licensing scandal.</p> <p>  Our taxpayers have invested almost &euro;3 billion in private forestry over the past 30 years.  The Department, through hyper-regulation, poor policy and even poorer management are squandering this taxpayer investment and wasting the opportunity created by members' political predecessors.  The opportunity is crystal clear in the most recent all-Ireland roundwood production forecast from the National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, covering the period 2021 to 2040.  The report shows the volume available from the private sector, mainly farmers in many parishes all over rural Ireland, increasing from 1.7 million cu. m this year to 3.5 million cu. m in 2030, ultimately peaking at 4.4 million cu. m per annum in 2035.  This opportunity should be resulting in more jobs, increased economic activity and environmental benefit all over rural Ireland.  The opportunity is being squandered because the Department has proven to be inept and remains incapable of issuing the licences that are legally required to permit the management and harvesting of this timber.  I am certain the taxpayers of Ireland, members' political predecessors and the owners of these forests never foresaw a situation whereby their vision would be wasted by the Department in the scandalous manner we have witnessed over the past three years and continue to witness.</p> <p>  The same Department published a licensing plan earlier this year.  Based on the dashboard at the end of quarter 1, we can measure how the Department has performed.  Coillte, the semi-State forestry company with a balance sheet of &euro;1.36 billion has been issued with 457 felling licences, which is 97 more than the projections issued by the Department in its plan.  The private sector, mainly farmers, have been issued with 357 felling licences, which is 102 fewer than Coillte and 65 fewer than the projections issued by the Department in its plan.  We in SEEFA have no confidence in the Department recovering this deficit throughout the remainder of 2022.  To add insult to injury, in week one of April 2022, the Department issued 58 felling licences to Coillte and just 18 to the private sector.  The rot continues and the inequity is apparent to everyone.  The Department licensing plan in the case of felling licences to the private sector has not even survived the first quarter of this year.  I ask members to not accept any answers that the differences I have outlined are due to weekly fluctuations, because the facts are obvious in the weekly dashboard.</p> <p>  We have forest owners with licences submitted to the Department for more than two years and need to harvest their crops to put children through college, to meet bills, to pay debts and to help with home construction for children.  The obvious question needs to be asked as to why the Department, an organ of the State, is ahead of target in processing licences for another organ of the State, Coillte, while leaving private forest owners all over this country on the sideline and largely ignored.  It may answer it is related to the quality of applications received from the private sector.  As representatives of the private sector, we refute this completely.  We have serious questions as to whether the felling licence applications from Coillte are put through the exact same process, procedure and interrogation as those which the private sector licences are subjected to by the Department.  Specifically in terms of private timber, which I am addressing, can no longer be about what the Department can deliver; it has to be about what the private sector needs and the Department must deliver.  Nothing else is acceptable.  We know we need a minimum of 2,500 felling licences and a minimum of 700 road licences each year for the foreseeable future to mobilise the private timber. </p> <p>  There was a windblow event in Scotland in November last year followed by a run of smaller storms since then.  In accepting Scotland is no longer in the EU, its regulators must still abide by regulations.  Felling licences are also required in Scotland.  The regulators received felling licence applications for 7,252 ha of woodland.  Around 90% of all the felling permissions have been approved, with each felling permission taking an average time of 16 days to approve.  This is a real case of the regulators responding to the needs of the sector.</p> <p>  The non-performance and failure of our Department has resulted in real damaged confidence in the forest sector, from growers to end users.  Do members think a significant change needs to happen to try to regain that lost confidence?  Do they want to see the new rural-based jobs this increased timber availability can create in their local areas?  These direct and indirect jobs can be drivers, mechanics, carpenters, accountants, foresters or ecologists and I could go on.</p> <p>  This is all here and ready to go.  Unfortunately, I am confident that we will not take this opportunity with the current management and situation. We will not harvest the almost 25 million cu. m available in the private sector between now and 2030 if we do not face up, recognise the elephant in the room and deal with it.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have devoted much time as a committee to the forestry sector and I am disappointed that the representatives of the private sector in forestry feel they have to come in again to highlight issues within the sector.</p> <p>  There are a couple of points that I take out of their statements.  Some 2,000 ha in 2021 was the lowest amount since 1946, at a time when Government policy is clear that we have to increase the level of afforestation.  That demands serious explanation as to how we dropped to such a level.  Some 25% of what is in the programme for Government is a huge issue that needs addressing.</p> <p>  The other issue is something that I focused on a lot is the farmers with ash dieback.  This has damaged the confidence in the sector.  I have been involved in farmer politics before I got into parliamentary politics.  I have never seen a situation where farmers had a disease that was outside their control that they did not receive financial compensation for, whether it was tuberculosis, brucellosis or the dioxin we had in the pig sector.  We had it in horticulture as well where there were different outbreaks of disease.  This is the first time in my experience that I have seen farmers who have suffered huge financial loss, 20 to 25 years of growth gone down the Swanee with a disease, and not see financial compensation.</p> <p>  The other point that is galling concerns the thinning licences.  Thinning is a mechanism to get a crop to fully mature correctly.  I just cannot understand the fact that one needs to get a licence for that which is a management tool.  The representatives from SEEFA made many strong points and I am sure many members will have questions to get elaborated on.  We might take one or two together so we get everyone in.</p></speech>

The representatives from SEEFA talked about the problems that are going on and the elephant in the room.  They want significant change.  In a few words, what do they call the likes of the elephant in the room or the problems?  What is the change that they want?  I would like to get an answer and just do quick-fire with them for a few minutes.</p></speech>

From the opening statements, the elephant in the room, as the Deputy and we all know, is two doors down.  It is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the forest service management.  As the Chair mentioned, it is at its lowest since 1946, which is down to the forest service management.  They have been before the committee five or six times, saying they are doing this, that and the other.  They are blaming environmental conditions.</p><p>They blame everyone but, in fairness, they have to be given their chance following on from the new European Court of Justice ruling, which is all to do with the habitats directive.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy.  The point I am making is the forest management service is down to two senior inspectors and the head of environment and assistant secretary.  They are the people who make the decisions.  As the Deputy will know, Ministers come and go.  The Minister has no power over these areas so they have led us to where we are.  That is the elephant in the room.  We need that to change.  The decision-makers have to be changed.  They have proven over recent years to this committee and to everyone here who has asked them questions that they are not able to adapt.  I mentioned the habitats directive because they are not able to adapt to the rules.</p></speech>

That total of 5,250 licences is less than the Department issued in 2019.  That is the level of ambition in the plan.  Total licence output in 2021 was less than in 2017, 2018 and 2019 but ahead of 2020, which was a complete disaster.  The Department pointing out that 2021 was 56% ahead of 2020 is laughable because 2020 was a disaster.</p> <p>  The plan expects to have 3,000 files in the system at the end of 2022.  One has to question the metrics and the assumptions that are behind that number, particularly on applications and approvals.  They expect to get significantly fewer applications in 2022 than in any of the years 2017 to 2019 and 2021, despite that the volume of timber has increased dramatically.  On planned licensing delivery output, they expect to issue 1,040 afforestation licences.  They are already failing on that after quarter 1, 2022.  On private felling licences, they expect to issue more felling licences in 2022 than in any of the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 or 2021.  There are already failing in that regard after the end of the quarter 1, 2022.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned ash dieback.  There are no metrics in the plan on applications to be received or approved during 2022.  On native woodland conservation, the plan contains no metrics on applications to be received or approved.  There is nothing in it about area fertiliser licences or native woodland improvement approvals.  Are all of these assumptions in the plan very convenient to painting a rosy picture as to a reduction in files at year end?</p> <p>  The Department has recently claimed it is 99% on target in terms of the plan.  It is nowhere near that in regard to the private sector.  Our question is twofold: how could anyone have faith in this plan and how could anyone see any merit in it?  We need the targets and metrics in this plan to be reset now to cover the total requirement of the industry for 2022 so that can be delivered on and form a real basis for a licensing plan in 2023.</p></speech>

Where stands the nurseries if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, introduces an eco scheme next year for the planting of different varieties?  I had some discussions with the farming organisations earlier in the week, which I presume the organisations did as well, on the draft document in regard to the manner in which we are going to be planting trees.  It would appear from that draft document, which is to be published in a month's time, that we have gained nothing in the line of thinnings and low-hanging fruit.  Have the witnesses seen that document and, if so, is that correct?</p></speech>

It is very simple.  The nurseries produce plants three years in advance of each planting season.  We pitch our production on the programme for Government afforestation targets.  The reality is the nurseries would be wiped out by now because of the fall in afforestation numbers.  We would have made it very clear to the Department over recent years that, as in the case of the industry, if the level of planting dipped below 6,000 ha, we would be in serious trouble.  The reality is we should be finished and gone now.</p></speech>

When Scotland's afforestation increased, ours dropped.  We are exporting millions of saplings to Scotland, which otherwise would be destroyed.  In Ireland, there was a Mackinnon review, which was provided to the Minister in 2019, but nothing has been done since.  The objective of Project Woodland is to implement the Mackinnon review.  That has not happened.  The afforestation levels are still decreasing.  In terms of where the nurseries are today, we are putting a lot of trust and faith in politicians.  We sow our seed in late April-early May for the forestry programme three years down the line.  The nursery makes that leap of faith on its own.  There is no interaction with the Department on what species will be required or what level of planting will be done because the Department does not know that detail.  If anyone doubts me on that, they can raise the issue with the Department.  It has no idea of what is being planted next week let alone in three years' time.  That is the position of the nurseries.  It is a solo run.  As it happens, we are-----</p></speech>

Leaving that aside, I will try to respond along the same lines as Mr. Ryan did in regard to the plans in the nursery sector.  As in the case of everything else that comes out of the Department, there was no consultation on that document.  The Department references consultation but it does not consult.  The Department's two senior inspectors and the head of environment and assistant secretary will push that out in whatever way they want, as they did in regard to the mid-term review and the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, RUS, all of which failed.  The Department brought out a project plan and many other things, but it never consulted and they all failed.</p><p>I am fairly confident when the legislation Deputy Fitzmaurice is talking about is brought in, it will not deliver what we need and what we are saying today is required because the Department does not understand what it wants itself.</p></speech>

There are 21 recommendations in the report.  It was issued in November 2019.  To date, there are probably two or three of the recommendations I could point to that have been implemented.

That needs to be heeded.  Our guests have spoken about the elephant in the room, and I get a sense they believe the solution is essentially to get rid of the entire forestry section in the Department and start again.  They will appreciate that is not within our gift, despite the fact some members might agree with them 100% on it.  Our remit is to bring forward policy changes and suggestions.  On the particular issues raised with the licensing backlog, what are the policy changes our guests need implemented to address that?</p> <p>  I am almost sure the Minister of State will later reference, and the Department references all the time, the fact there is such a high proportion of afforestation licences that are not utilised.  What needs to be put in place to bring somebody who has gone through the experience of trying to get an afforestation licence, to receiving one to actually using it?  That is the greatest flag this is a dysfunctional system, namely, people have gone through this process and then do not use the licences when they have them.  I ask our guests for suggestions for how we can turn that around.</p></speech>

The Chairman referenced ash dieback at the outset but I would like to hear about this from the lads because we are inundated with representations about the effects of ash dieback and the ineffectiveness of the RUS.  Our guests might give us a little insight into that from their point of view on the ground.  The SEEFA opening statement mentions the incompatibility of CAP with afforestation and forestry.  I would like SEEFA to elaborate on that a bit more.  Mr. Ryan said SEEFA was from the CAP consultative forum.  Will our guests go a little further in explaining how CAP and forestry might come a little closer together and become a little more compatible?  Based on the figures SEEFA has given us on what is being planted, carbon aside, what effect will that have on our timber supplies in 30 years' time when what is planted today should be mature?  Forget about carbon for a second.  I am looking at it just from a timber supply point of view.</p></speech>

I would say we represent the feeling across the entire industry about the Department.  We would not expect the committee to remove the whole forestry division within the Department.  There are some very good people in the forestry division but they are not in management positions.  The industry's sole problem is with the management, which, as my colleague said, probably boils down to two or three individuals who have been there for ten years.</p></speech>

Deputy Carthy's concerns around afforestation are valid.  On the policy changes that need to be done, you can come up with all the policy changes in the world but one thing that would make all the difference, which I think members are already aware of, is that no matter what we do, what regulations change or systems change, we are absolutely nothing if there are not statutory timelines built in for decision-making on applications.  When an afforestation application is submitted, there should be a set time of 90 days or 120 days and the applicant knows how long it is going to take.  At the moment an application is going into the system and getting kicked around from Billy to Jack into a black hole.  Foresters are phoning up asking the Department for an update.  We know from our members that in many cases they do not get the update.  Emails are not replied to.  Here is a statistic.  Just 18% of licences for afforestation are approved within the 18 weeks set out in the farmer's charter.  This is what leads to the reduction in the conversion rate.  Farmers and landowners are forced out of the system through frustration.  To answer the Deputy's question, timelines for decisions form the policy change that is needed and must be done.</p></speech>

I am going to answer the Senator's questions but I might very briefly respond to the Deputy.  I know I have to be careful, Chairman, about the three positions we were speaking about.  There is nothing personal in it.  We are out running businesses.  We do not have time to be in here.  We want to be out on the ground doing what we are supposed to do.  We are in here because the Department is just not able to deliver.  As Mr. Ryan said, all we want is a workable system.  We would be happy if we got approvals within four or six months.  Say the Deputy is a farmer who asks me to plant his land for him.  I will meet him and we will go through all the application process and I will tell him everything that is good about forestry.  However, I will want to get out his door before he asks me the question how long this is going to take.  That is because I do not have a clue, and I do not have a clue because we do not have a workable system, a planning process or any right policies.  Why is that?  It is because of the people we just spoke about.  It is nothing personal.  Our businesses have been run into the ground by the same three or four who have been in charge of this industry for the past ten years.  I wanted to make that point.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked about ash.  It is a serious concern.  As we all know, ash is our favourite tree.  We all love hurling as well and it is what we make our hurls from, but a lot of people planted ash here in the past 20 or 30 years.  If you planted ash and you now have this ash disease, first of all, you have to ask where it came from.  We are an island nation.  Ten, 15 or 20 years ago a professor came to this country - I cannot remember exactly but we can look it up - and explained to the people that, down the road, ash dieback was coming across Europe from Latvia.  We are an island nation.  The prevailing winds go a particular way.  We had a chance to keep Ireland free.  The people in charge of biosecurity, that is, of monitoring diseases of trees and plants being brought in, are the same three or four people we were talking about in the forest service.  They did nothing.  They brought it in from England and they brought it in from everywhere.  That is where the disease came from.  They could say, or members could, that we are blaming them for everything but those are the facts of it.  A professor came here 15 or 20 years ago and told them this.  They took no heed of it because they take no heed of anything they are told.</p> <p>  Moving to the landowners the Senator talked about and from whom he is inundated with representations, let us say a landowner in Westmeath, where the Senator comes from, has planted ash and it is 20 years old and gets ash dieback.  There is now a scheme called the RUS.  The forest service again did not consult us or any other stakeholder and just pushed that out there.  It is not fit for purpose because, as the Chairman said, it will pay for taking out and replanting the trees, but if you had 20-year-old forestry and you put a new sapling in the ground, you are back to day one.</p><p>There would be no income for the next 20 years under the RUS.  It is not fit for purpose and it was just thrown out there.</p><p> I can quickly give a figure on that.  Up to March 2022 or thereabouts, there were 608 applications for the ash dieback scheme covering 2,500 ha, which is nearly 6,000 acres.  To date, only 186 approvals have been issued covering 600 ha.  There are 422 applications still stuck down the road.  It is typical that they are not being processed.</p></speech>

Senator Paul Daly's comments raise another point about the RUS.  If the ash must be taken out, there are not many alternatives to plant.  The best alternative may be conifer and trying to get something for 20 years or 25 years.  If somebody is going for conifer, as well as making a RUS application, planning permission is required.  We all know what the planning permission process is like.  The Secretary General of the Department came before the committee approximately six months ago and gave a commitment that he would take that matter up with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Dare I say it, and I will stand to be corrected, but I imagine that once he went out that door he has not thought of the matter since.  The committee might ask him today.</p></speech>

I will move to CAP.  CAP and forestry are like two different things.  A CAP consultation committee, CCC, was set up when the new CAP was being discussed.  Every farming and land-based organisation in the country, along with people outside farming, was put on it but there was not one representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's forestry service.  The people at the head of the forestry service, which we have mentioned, did not see it as worth their while to put somebody on the CCC to represent forestry.  We requested to go on the committee through different organisations but we were told we did not need to be on it.  The assistant secretary in charge of forestry in this country was also in charge of the previous green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and would understand the need to have somebody on the CCC.  Nobody was put on it.  At the last meeting here, Deputy Fitzmaurice asked why this was not done.  The Secretary General did not allow a reply on the day.</p> <p>  The environmental scheme in the previous CAP was GLAS and it will be called something else in the next one.  It will be the same procedure anyway.  The forestry service will say GLAS is compatible with forestry and trees can be planted but that is not possible.  We have gone through it and know that.  In the four or five years before GLAS started, on average, 895 farmers per year were planting forestry on their land.  GLAS was introduced in 2014 or thereabouts, and we have numbers from 2014 to 2020.  In 2020, 100 farmers planted trees.  That was a direct result of GLAS.  I know that from being on the ground and some of the members will know that from being on the ground.  I do not know how many times I went to farmers who wanted to plant when they were in GLAS.  The truth is they could not plant.  GLAS was competing with forestry.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice touched on this a while ago.  We were not allowed on the new CCC but the same thing will happen with the new scheme.  That is what we see coming.  The officials will tell us trees can be planted in forestry but it will not be possible.</p></speech>

I have already outlined that the forecast indicates an increase in volume to 4.4 million cu. m by 2035.  By 2040, that will reduce to almost 4 million cu. m.  The reduction in afforestation we have seen for the past 15 years just means the available volume decreases into the future because we are not planting enough land to bring up the volume again.  That is just the bottom line.  The irony of ironies in all of this is there is a Green Party Minister of State with responsibility for forestry who will preside over the lowest afforestation programme in 75 years.  The same Green Party policies want to replace concrete and steel in home construction with timber.  If we do not plant the trees, it is elementary that we will not have the timber.</p> <p>  I will make a small point on the CAP and GLAS, which Mr. Egan has covered very well.  Nobody can argue with the fact that there were 48,000 participants in GLAS but the total number of those participants that planted land during the GLAS term was 682.  That is 1.42% of the participants in GLAS that planted land during the scheme's term.  How can anybody with a shred of integrity claim GLAS and afforestation are compatible?</p></speech>

Did GLAS apply to one part of a holding and the planting was on another?</p></speech>

GLAS is not a whole-of-farm scheme.  Generally, however, when a farmer gets into a plan, he or she is in it for the five years.  This is not a criticism of GLAS at all but rather a criticism of the compatibility between GLAS, which is an environmental scheme, and forestry, which at its heart is an environmental scheme.  Yet, with a single person in charge of both, there were 682 participants from a total of 48,000 in GLAS who planted land.  That does not represent compatibility.</p></speech>

This is disturbing because we have heard about it time and again here.  The Minister of State's opening statement is before me and she speaks about woodland working groups and how most of the issues identified are being addressed.  There is talk that it will take time to train and bed in recruits but how much time and training is needed to bed in somebody to an industry that is falling apart at the seams?</p> <p>  Today we are again hearing that there has been no consultation but every Minister coming before us will try to persuade us, left, right and centre that there is consultation taking place with groups.  There is another group before us today telling us there has been no consultation.  The entire system must change and in the resolving of any problems, all stakeholders must be involved.</p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions.  The opening statements referred to Coillte and felling licences issued to it rather than private operators.  Most recently, it was noted that in one week of April this year, 58 felling licences were issued to Coillte and just 18 were issued to the private sector.  I have raised this difference between Coillte and private operators since the matter started being discussed at this committee.  I have been given various responses, including one last May when I was told the Department did not want to get into a debate about Coillte versus the private sector.  That debate needs to be heard.</p> <p>  In January, the Minister of State told me that in 2021, 1,345 private felling licences were issued and 1,500 were issued to Coillte, highlighting that overall there was no great disparity between Coillte and private operators.  The figures were 47% and 53% for private operators and Coillte, respectively.  Coillte received a greater number nonetheless.  In January this year, when 3,348 felling licences were on hand, only 1,300 were for Coillte but 2,000 were for private operators.  There is no doubt that Coillte licences seem to be shoved up to the front of the queue, as I said before.  The Minister of State keeps denying that.  Will the witnesses give us their view?</p></speech>

It is really powerful and frightening.</p><p>What are the biosecurity implications of importing timber to Ireland?  The witnesses mentioned ash dieback and a beetle being brought in that affected the ash tree.  Are the witnesses fearful that the biosecurity currently in the ports, with the imported timber, will have an implication regarding beetles that could affect the spruce?  Could this impact on the ash industry and effectively wipe it out in the next decade or two if the biosecurity measures are not appropriate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#M00200"><p>In response to Deputy Martin Browne, we would like to make the following points on the consultation.  New interim standards for felling and reforestation were circulated by the Department in October 2019.  They immediately replaced existing guidelines at that point.  When released, comments were sought for stakeholders.  The intention was that the comments and consultation would be taken on board and that a revised and updated standard would be issued in December 2019.  That still has not happened in 2022.  We have serious questions about consultation, particularly this consultation.  Did the Department follow the consultation principles and guidelines published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016?  The likely answer to that is that Project Woodland is dealing with it, because that is the answer to everything.  We would like that question to be answered.  We have tried to get answers before.</p> <p>  Deputy Browne asked about felling licences.  I fully agree with his statistics.  To provide some support, in January, at the launch of the licensing plan, there were 2,023 private felling licences and only 1,317 Coillte felling licences with the Department.  On 25 March last, there were still 1,883 private felling licences with the Department, of which 1,481 had been there for longer than 120 days.  In that period, the number of private felling licences reduced by just 140.  In the same period, the number of Coillte felling licences with the Department decreased from 1,317 to 868.  That is a reduction of 449 felling licences, compared with 140 for the private sector.  Does that prioritisation of Coillte felling licences happen by accident?  It is not due to weekly fluctuations.  It is the sidelining and ignoring of private owners all over the country to the benefit of Coillte.  That is not a criticism of Coillte but of the procedures and practices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p> <p>  There is much more I could say about licensing, but I will move on to biosecurity.  We are fearful and have every right to be.  We have seen the damage that the beetle has done in central Europe over recent years.  The imports to Ireland are generally from the pest-free area of Scotland.  The Department has claimed that due to the issues with licences last year, it stabilised the sector in Ireland with regard to the availability of roundwood.  If that is the case, why were imports from Scotland at peak levels in 2021?  We can have the best biosecurity measures possible, but there is always a real risk, which we are fearful of.  The irony is that the Department's reports prove that we have the timber in the country.  We do not need to import it, but we are importing it because the Department is not issuing licences to harvest timber that we have in our own country.  You could not make it up.</p></speech>

To give a simple example, in 2021, we planted 2,000 ha of forestry in the country, which is a quarter of the target.  Maybe 1,000 ha of that will end up as roundwood in commercial sawmills around the country in 25 years.  That 1,000 ha would be only 10% of what the sawmills require this year.  In 20 or 30 years, as the Minister of State has said, we should be thinking timber and building timber.  We will not have timber because we are not planting enough.  The Minister of State launched an organic forum yesterday.  Every land use stakeholder in the country was involved, including Teagasc and all the different companies involved in farming.  There are 23 or 24 of them.  No one from forestry was involved.  The Minister would say that it is organic, not forestry.  That is not true because organic farming and forestry are linked.  The Minister of State is an organic farmer and she has forestry.  There is a direct link.  No one understands it better than her.  My point is that in everything she does, she does not think about forestry.  Forestry is not top of the table.  That is another example, which happened just yesterday.</p></speech>

Now we are seeing rising costs of diesel and so on.  What impact does that have on the ability of foresters to deal with incidents of ash dieback when the contribution of the scheme is already so inadequate?  What impact does the cost being faced by the contractors who help with this work in forests and woodlands have?  What interventions would the witnesses like to see to assist with offsetting the costs?  We have heard about the exclusion of contractors in the agri-sector from various supports.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses ever heard any reason, when they asked for membership of the GLAS or Common Agricultural Policy consultative committee, for not being included?</p></speech>

The simple answer is that the Department's products, including the grant schemes, the forestry and the RUS, are not fit for purpose, because they are not meeting our costs.  The costs are rising.  The RUS was produced without any proper consultation.  That needs to be revisited.  First, we have to stop the licensing crisis and the next step is looking at this.</p> <p>  We never got an answer about the consultative committee.

I am sure the committee has heard and will hear that many problems stem from the EU habitats directive and that is why we are in this mess.  Most of the issues that SEEFA has raised today, including timelines, issues for farmers, CAP and ash dieback, have nothing to do with EU influence.  They are all policy decisions.</p> <p>  A member of this committee once said at a previous forestry meeting, "It takes a special type of incompetence of the highest order to have a policy that pleases absolutely nobody."</p><p>We agree with that, and will leave members with the following questions.  Is the management of the forest service capable of ending this omnishambles, which has gone on for a decade?  Will it do what is required to prevent further job losses in the sector?  Can it reverse the damage done to the confidence of landowners, particularly those suffering from ash dieback?  Will it ever be capable of planting 8,000 ha and reaching climate action targets?  Does it have the foresight to oversee the development required to mobilise the timber levels that have been forecast?  Is it capable of delivering on a new forestry programme from 2023 to 2027, with incentives that will work for practitioners and schemes that will integrate with and work for landowners?</p><p> SEEFA knows the answers to those questions, and we are confident the members of this committee do as well.  As elected representatives, they have the power and influence to ensure the necessary changes will be made without delay.  We ask that they continue in their excellent work, monitor the health of our industry monthly and request an intervention at the top level if required.  We thank the committee and leave it with the old saying: "What gets measured gets done".</p></speech>

It is good to be here this morning.  I am joined by Mr. Barry Delany, director of forestry, and Mr. Kevin Collins from the environment section.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  I acknowledge the committee's continuing interest in forestry.  I certainly welcome the opportunity to update members on progress in implementing the Department's forestry licensing plan for 2022.  I also want to use the opportunity to raise other related issues that I believe are of interest to the committee.  </p> <p>Before we discuss licensing, I want to touch briefly on the implementation of the Mackinnon report.  I know this is something close to the hearts of many committee members.  Project Woodland was set up to implement the Mackinnon report.  Through the good work of the working groups, most of the issues identified by Mackinnon are being addressed and are at different stages of implementation.  Some of the recommendations have been implemented.  I will refer to this work later in my statement.  </p> <p>  On the question of licensing, I am pleased to report real and substantial progress in improving the Department's output.  The request by the committee and Chair during previous engagements was that the Department should aim to issue approximately 100 new licences every week.  I am delighted to report that this is being achieved.  In total, we issued more than 4,000 licences last year, which was a 56% increase on 2020.  This included 2,877 felling licences, with a volume of nearly 8.5 million m3.  This is the highest volume issued in a single year.  Last year was also a much improved year for forest road licences, with 264 kilometres of roads approved in 2021.  These increasing trends are welcome.  However, I am aware of the need to continue at pace this year, and in particular, to increase further the number of afforestation licences issued. At the beginning of this year, we published the forestry licensing plan for 2022.  This contains a target of 5,250 new licences to issue in 2022, which is a year-on-year increase of 30%.  We are delivering on this.  As of last Friday, we had issued 1,426 licences so far this year, which is marginally ahead of our target of 1,414.</p> <p>  Our plan is to achieve a 100% increase in output for planting licences in 2022.  With this in mind, the Department recently recruited a number of external ecologists who will, for the present, focus exclusively on afforestation.  Once these ecologists are trained and bedded in, I am confident that the output of afforestation licences will increase significantly to meet the annual target set out in the licensing plan.  With regard to felling, we have reassigned some staff to focus on private felling licence files.  This change and the recruitment of ecologists focusing solely on afforestation are intended to ensure that we meet our annual targets for both categories.  We will keep the deployment of resources under review, as we have for the past two years, and as the year progresses we will make further changes that may be necessary to ensure that we can respond in an agile way to any issue that arises.</p> <p>  I am aware there has been a focus in some public commentary on the number of licences issued in individual weeks.  While this is understandable in all of the circumstances, my focus is on meeting the annual licensing targets.  It is inevitable, given the nature of the licensing process and the specificities of each application, that there will be some variability in numbers from week to week.  We are certainly working on having more consistency in the pace at which licences are issued, and to a large extent we have achieved this.  We are also making significant progress on addressing the backlog in licences.  So far this year, we have issued 1,426 licences and received 563 new applications.  We are processing licences at approximately three times the rate we receive new applications.</p> <p>  All of this means that there are 3,860 licences in total on hand with the Department, a significant reduction from this time last year, when the figure was around 6,500.  This is evidence that the improvements in our systems and the additional resources that have been put in place are having a positive impact and will bring us to the stage where licences are issued in a timely fashion.  The Department, members of the Project Woodland working groups and the project board continue to work towards this goal, building steadily on the gains already achieved.  I acknowledge the commitment of all involved in the process.  At this point, my Department is on course to have no outstanding felling licences predating 2021 by end of the second quarter of this year.  To achieve our aim to increase licensing this year we will also need the help of the sector.  I understand the Department has more than 700 further information requests still outstanding for afforestation, roads and felling.  I encourage applicants to respond as quickly as they can to these information requests.</p> <p>  The committee has taken a keen interest in the ash dieback reconstitution and underplanting scheme.  We have 593 applications on hand for a total of 2,402 ha.  A total of 189 approvals have issued for the scheme for a total of 620 ha.  However, the Planning and Development Act and associated regulations provide that the replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifer species, which is screened in for appropriate assessment, requires planning permission from the relevant local authority in addition to the requirement for a felling licence.  The Department is engaged in discussions with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this issue.  I am advised that there may be a route to amending the legislation to allow replacement of broadleaf with conifers for sites under 10 ha without the requirement for planning.  We will update the committee on this matter in due course.</p> <p>  I am also very pleased that with the passage through the Oireachtas last month of the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, the Forestry Act 2014 has been amended to facilitate the planting of native trees in areas up to 1 ha in size without the requirement for a licence.  This will be part of a scheme established for this purpose.  The scheme will also facilitate tree planting along watercourses.  The terms and conditions of the scheme will ensure that all planting will be in accordance with all environmental requirements.  We are developing the scheme and will engage with relevant stakeholders.  This will complement existing efforts to increase afforestation and will encourage the establishment of small areas of native trees that are important for biodiversity, landscape and water quality.</p> <p>  I said at the beginning of my statement that I would refer to some of the outputs under Project Woodland.  The end-to-end review of the licensing process has been completed and recommendations arising from that review have moved to the implementation phase.  The draft external regulatory review is being examined by the working groups and the project board.  The picture it paints is one of a complex web of EU regulation and case law.  Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets.  There may, however, be some solutions that can help to improve processes and make them more efficient but none are simple.  The Project Woodland project board has asked the working groups and the Department for their views on the draft report and will work with both to develop an action plan.</p> <p>  Work is continuing on the development of a new shared vision and strategy for trees and forests in Ireland.  Through the Project Woodland process we are engaging with the public, local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways.  We recently launched a public consultation survey on the future of forests in Ireland.  It is open to all and can be accessed on the Department's website until 27 April.</p><p>We have already received more than 1,000 responses.  I encourage members of the committee to share the details of the consultation with their constituents who may wish to make submissions.  This is a critical time for forestry, and I look forward to seeing the results of this consultation.  Irish Rural Link has also undertaken some consultation on our behalf and has submitted a draft of its Assessment of Attitudes by Communities and Interested Parties on Forestry and Woodlands, which is currently being considered by the members of the forestry policy group.</p><p> In addition, quotes are currently being sought for a training needs analysis specifically to address the needs of the licensing process, while a tendering process will commence shortly to engage an external consultant to carry out an external organisational review of the Department's forestry division.</p><p> Furthermore, a communications strategy is being developed and is due to be finalised shortly.  I have also signed off on an additional payment to contribute to the cost of environmental reports required to accompany licence applications.  This is currently awaiting sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> We are also exploring the option for developing better communications between the Department's foresters and applicants, by implementing a pilot for pre-application discussions.  Ultimately, this is designed to improve the quality of applications and smooth the passage of applications through the system once submitted.</p><p> We have made significant progress through the increased resources and efficiencies that have been introduced in our forestry division, and I am confident that we will reach the targets set for licensing this year.  I know how important it is to the whole sector that we maintain momentum and continue to build on the progress made to date.  I am confident that while we still have much do, we are taking the steps necessary to address the delays in licensing and to eliminate the backlogs.</p><p> It is also clear that, for a variety of reasons, we need to encourage farmers and landowners to plant more trees.  Forestry has a critical role to play in contributing positively to climate change mitigation, and to the improvement of biodiversity and water quality.  It also has a central role to play in improving farm incomes as part of the agricultural enterprise, and in the development of the rural economy and job creation.  The work currently under way to develop a new forestry strategy will be vital to our success in increasing afforestation.  We understand how important it is to ensure that our licensing system is fit for purpose but if we are serious about forestry, we have a collective responsibility to ensure that we get better at communicating its many benefits not only to farmers but to citizens and to industry.  With this in mind, we will be working with stakeholders, through Project Woodland, on the development of a communications strategy to help build a culture of forestry among farmers and landowners.  Consistent negative messaging around forestry, while perhaps understandable at times in the past, is undermining a sector that has so much to offer rural Ireland.  We need to work together to change this narrative if we are to be successful in creating a strong culture of forestry in Ireland.  I am particularly interested in hearing the views of the committee on the issue.  I thank members for their attention, and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#P00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State very much for her opening statement.  As she says, this committee has devoted a lot of time to forestry since I became Chairman.  It is the topic that has got most attention from this committee, which shows how worried we are about the sector and its future.</p> <p>  I will make a couple of points before I open up the meeting to members for questions.  We have had two engagements with stakeholders this morning, coming from two different perspectives on the forestry sector and issues relating to forestry.  We planted 2,000 ha in 2021, the lowest since 1946.  The programme for Government is clearly set as four times that target.  Future generations will question what went wrong in Ireland around 2020 that we had such a failure with the planting of trees.  The Minister of State and I might have differences as to how we achieve our targets to reduce emissions in our fight against climate change, but we both agree that forestry has a significant part to play in that regard.  As a farmer, I am deeply concerned that forestry is not playing the role it can in our battle to reduce emissions and in carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  Ash dieback disturbs me.  There is a lot of it in my county and in surrounding counties.  I have been involved in representing farmers for many years and it is the first time that I can ever remember that farmers have not got compensation for a disease completely outside their control.  The list, which includes brucellosis, tuberculosis, TB, bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, foot and mouth and dioxin in pigs, is endless.  There was always a compensation package for those affected.  A grant has been put in place for clearing, which has been poorly subscribed to, as there are difficulties with what can be replanted.  As a matter of urgency, the Minister of State must consider giving a financial package to the affected farmers.  A recommendation has been made by this committee that the very least that can be done for those people who have been affected by ash dieback is that they will have access to premiums going forward for 15 years if they replant their land.  They have suffered significant financial hardship.  They have lost 20 to 25 years of timber growth, which was going to be a pension pot for many of the growers.  In a lot of cases, ash was put on reasonably arable land that would not normally be used for forestry.  It was done by people who wanted to provide a pension for themselves and the fact is they have suffered a great loss.  I urge the Minister of State to look again at the recommendation the committee made on a premium for those affected by ash dieback.  I would like her to give it serious consideration.</p> <p>  The Minister of State focused on licences.  There is still a backlog in that regard.  Another issue I wish her to address is the fact that it is clear from stakeholders that there is a bias in favour of Coillte in the issuing of licences.  The figures clearly show that.  The dashboard is extremely informative.  Committee members are very appreciative of the dashboard, which keeps us up to date every week.  Last week, the licences were three to one in favour of Coillte over private operators.  That is creating significant concern and we would like to see it addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue that really bugs me is the fact that you have to get a licence to thin your crop.  Thinning a crop is a management tool to allow a crop to reach its full potential.  When you get permission to plant, a management tool to allow your crop to reach its full potential should not have to go through the licence process again.  We must do whatever we have to do, legislatively, to get that anomaly removed as a matter of urgency.  That would play a pivotal role in reducing the delays because we would have fewer licences in the system if thinning was removed from the process.  It baffles me how something that is a management tool to allow a crop to reach its potential has to get licence approval.  I just cannot get my head around it.  They are the points I wanted to make.  I know members are very anxious to put questions to the Minister of State.  I will take two members at a time, starting with Senator Paul Daly and Senator Lombard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#P00300"><p>I have a couple of notes and you have ably covered some of the points I want to raise, Chairman, in particular regarding facts that were given to us this morning.  One point is that in 2022 we planted only 2,000 ha, which is the lowest plantation since 1946.  How can we explain to future generations what we were at in the early 2020s?  The programme for Government clearly states that we will plant 8,000 ha.  We get caught up here a lot of the time talking about licences and the number of licences, but it is hectares of saplings planted on the ground that will determine the outcome and that is what we will all be judged on at the end of the day.  We are talking about a mere 2,000 ha.  At the end of April, the nurseries will plant seeds to provide the saplings for 2025.  Can the Department tell them how many seeds they need to plant and how many trees will be planted?  How can they predict?  When they read the programme for Government, it states 8,000 ha, but the fact is that we only planted 2,000 ha last year.  It is very damning.  I am taken aback by the fact that it is almost considered a success story in the presentation that there will be no felling licences pre-2021 in the system by the end of the second quarter of 2022.</p><p>That is saying openly that there will be licences that are 18 months in.  I do not see that as a win in any way.</p><p> As the Chairman mentioned, I would also like the Minister of State to comment again on the ratio of licences that are being issued between Coillte and the private sector.  The silver bullet came when I was on the previous agriculture committee when the Minister of State's predecessor introduced the Mackinnon report.  There are 21 recommendations in the Mackinnon report.  A similar Mackinnon report was done in Scotland.  They implemented all the recommendations of Mackinnon.  As we were told this morning, Scotland's forestry sector is flying at the moment and if it were not, the seeds that were sown here by our nurseries would have had to have been dumped.  They were exported to Scotland, however, as there is such a demand because they implemented the Mackinnon report in a three-year period.</p><p> We commissioned Mackinnon then to do a report here based on that and now we are doing umpteen more reports and analysis.  Project Woodland groups are meeting.  We heard of one group that has already met 25 times.  We were told that three of the recommendations of Mackinnon have been implemented.  Where are the other 18?  When will they be implemented?  When, if ever, will we reach the target of 8,000 ha per annum, which is actually only 50% of what we were on 20 years ago?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#Q00200"><p>Regarding the 8,000 ha, which is in the programme for Government, and Senator Paul Daly also mentioned this topic, can the Minister of State give me her view and timeline for when she believes we will reach the 8,000 ha?  It is a principle of the programme for Government, which is nearly two years old at this stage.  Taking into consideration that the Taoiseach will probably change in the next few months and we are literally going into the second phase of the programme for Government, does the Minister of State believe we will reach that actual target of 8,000 ha planted in the next three years?  If so, will she be giving that indication to the nurseries this morning that this is what she believes will happen in the next 30 to 35 months?</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State give us information on the importation of roundwood?  I appreciate she may not have the information; I do not want it this morning.  Could she inform the committee in her own time of the amount of roundwood being imported into Ireland at the moment?  Is she happy with the buyer security that is happening at the ports taking into consideration previous issues regarding biosecurity and what happened with the ash?  What does she believe is the long-term plan and timeline for when we will not need to import roundwood?  It is in many ways a bizarre scenario that we are importing wood into Ireland with sufficient wood growing that we just cannot harvest.  What are the Minister of State's timelines for when there will be no need for roundwood to be imported?</p> <p>  Timelines have continually been mentioned in applications.  Is there any process whereby we will have timelines tied into the Department?  If a person goes for planning in a local authority, the local authority is tied into a timeline for when it will report.  Even when the local authority gives that person further information, there is a timeline again for when the Department responds to him or her.  That timeline is in law when it comes to a planning process.  It is definitive.  One cannot move outside the eight-week process or 28-day process when it comes to further information.  When does the Minister of State believe that kind of process will be brought forward in order that we can bring confidence into the sector?</p></speech>

I appreciate and accept how worried the committee is about the future of forestry.  It is not only the future of the sector but certainly the future of us meeting targets and dealing with our climate ambitions.   Everyone is concerned about it and certainly, the recent comments of Ms Marie Donnelly in terms of how we are reaching our targets show that the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, is also very concerned about this.  Everyone ultimately wants to get to a position where we are not concerned anymore.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill and Senator Paul Daly both commented on what went wrong, and how people will look back to 2021 and ask what went wrong.  We were, unfortunately, in breach of environmental regulations and it set us back.  It has taken us this amount of time to try to build back up from grinding to a halt, essentially, to putting in systems and processes that work and that deliver the licences we need.  We are not there yet but we are certainly delivering licences within the very tough environmental requirements that exist.  There is really no getting around that.  We cannot short-cut environmental regulations.  We cannot just say to the EU that we are going to ignore those few directives and fire out licences.  That is the brunt of why we are where we are.</p> <p>  The officials in my Department are working incredibly hard to move towards systems that function and that not only deliver licences as quickly as possible and on time but also meet the environmental requirements.  That is the crux of the issue.  That is what we will have to say to our future generations about what happened in the early 2020s.  That is what happened.  Hopefully, by the time we move on a number of years, we will be out of that.  We will look back 20 or 30 years and see this blip and we will have moved on.  We will be able to issue licences in an absolutely timely manner in order that people, farmers and landowners will actually use the licences to plant.</p> <p>  I will come back to ash dieback in a moment and deal with the other bits.  I appreciate Deputy Cahill's welcoming comments with regard to the dashboard, which I think is useful.  We have added other key performance indicators, KPI, to that this year.  The balance between Coillte licences versus private licences keeps coming up as an issue.  It comes up in parliamentary questions all the time.  The simple fact of the matter is that Coillte supplies 75% of the timber to the sawmill sector so on the whole, it is going to deliver more timber.  It is not that it is favoured as such but that the licences that come in through Coillte do so in a batch.  We do not get them weekly; they come in one big batch so they can be processed in a more straightforward manner.  They go through the exact same process as any licence, however.  It has to go through the same processes regardless of whether it is a Coillte licence or private licence.  I accept that the figures are a little bit down in the first quarter thus far in terms of delivery for private licences.  The projections for the year for private licences are actually in excess of 1,800.  The overall licence projections for this year are 1,830 private felling licences and 1,530 Coillte felling licences.  As the year progresses, therefore, we will certainly see a turnaround in terms of private licences being issued.</p> <p>  One thing to comment on with regard to private licences is that Coillte licences are all for certified timber.  Sawmills are required to take in quite a high proportion - approximately two thirds or 75% - of certified timber.  They cannot sell it on to their customers.  Some larger private owners have certified forests and their timber will be certified.  A large proportion of private forest owners do not have certified timber.  If, for the sake of argument, we were to only do private licences and no Coillte licences, that timber would not be able to be sold on to the market because it is not certified.  In one sense, we need the buffer of the certified timber plus the uncertified private timber to feed into the market.  This is going to be an issue we need to look into.  We certainly need to engage with the private sector.  That is something we need to undertake as a Department to help private growers in the future become certified.  We are going to see it flipping over in terms of the volumes coming from the private sector over the next five or ten years.  That is an important thing to say.</p> <p>  I know thinning licences are an issue about which people get frustrated but thinning is still an activity.  Trees could have been in position for quite a number of years - maybe a decade and a half or thereabouts.</p><p>While it might be a plantation management issue, it is not recognised as that.  It is still quite an invasive piece of work on a piece of land and that is why, unfortunately, it still has to go through the licensing process.  This is one of the issues examined in the regulatory review and we are teasing out if there is anything we can do on it, but we probably cannot do much.</p><p> Senator Lombard raised the timelines.  I am aware that timelines exist for other planning processes.  We simply cannot issue a licence without having gone through the appropriate environmental requirements.  At best, what we could do is issue a timeline and then say we cannot give the licence.  We could not say the person is getting it just because we have spent eight months on it.  That would not wash; we would not be able to do that.  We would be back in the High Court as quickly as someone could say "licence".  The system review we are looking at is to try to make the system more effective.  We have to be much more efficient.  We cannot have people waiting for months and months.  We are working on that.  While it might not be something to jump up and down about, the fact that we will get rid of all pre-2021 licences by the second quarter, or that is the plan, is significant.  It is incredibly frustrating for people who are sitting on a licence for two to three years, albeit it is a small number.</p><p> We are working on getting that timeline reduced all the time.  If we can get to the middle of this year and say the longest licence we have in the system is now 18 months, that would be an improvement.  We are constantly working on removing those durations because it is unacceptable that people have to wait ridiculous lengths of time.  I do not know the figure for how many touch points there are when one adds up all the bits in how long it takes to get a licence.  There could be ten or 15 different touch points and each one of those takes a certain time.  Some are quicker than others depending  on, perhaps, the quality of the licence and some depend on the area the licence is coming from.  There is no one brushstroke that can fix all the different touch points, but we are working on making each touch point as short as possible.  That is ultimately where we want to get to, without undermining the requirements under environmental law.</p><p> There were one or two other points.  Senator Lombard raised the importation of roundwood.  We only import roundwood from one particular area of Scotland, which is biosecure.  It is the only place from which we are allowed to import.  In terms of biosecurity, we like to think that we are as sound as we can be on that.  We have always imported timber albeit we imported more than we ever did last year.  That dropped off around Christmas and we have kept it quite low.  To date in 2022, we have imported the lowest volume for the first quarter.  We will probably always need to import some.  It is fair to say that we are net exporters of wood.  We export approximately 80% of what we grow or it is manufactured into something and exported, but for certain types of structural pieces we cannot grow the species here.  We probably have to import some to export more, if the Senator knows what I mean.</p></speech>

That is the biggest thing.  Even the area  for which licences came in last year, and I do not have those figures, falls short.  The licences to plant that came in last year were well short of the 8,000 ha.  Even if we issued every afforestation licence last year, we are still not-----</p></speech>

They have a bank of files they are working through.  That is the output for approved files.  As the Deputy knows, there are 500 afforestation files at present.  They have to go through further information requests that take time.  They may have to go to a site and do an investigation themselves to take the burden off the foresters with regard to supplying habitat maps or other additional ecology information.</p></speech>

On its website in 2012 the forestry service stated it was fully compliant with the habitats directive.  The legislation on the habitats directive has not changed since.  I have watched it more than anyone.  I know the blockages.  It is the bane of our lives but many people were for it.  I know there have been court cases.  If it was being implemented correctly in 2012, as was on the website, how is it different?</p></speech>

The Minister of State spoke earlier about the regulatory review carried out by Philip Lee and Associates.  It was presented to the forest policy group of Project Woodland last week.  The author is looking at the screening process, the time limits mentioned earlier, scale differentiation, single consent and how pinning can be dealt with separately.  We are working through this at present.  There may be possibilities to help us streamline the process.  If we streamline the process-----</p></speech>

People have seen a draft; I have not.  My understanding, and the Minister of State has alluded to it with regard to the habitats directive and various environmental regulations, is that there will not be a lot of change in getting opinions or a fast-track system because of the blockage in environmental law.  Is this fair to say?  We will be back to how it is being done at present.  There is no simple solution to resolve the issue.  No new silver bullet is coming.  The Department will have to go through the same as what we have been seeking for the past year.  There is nothing new that will magically get through this.</p></speech>

What has us in the situation we are is that we have to screen in 80% of the files.  There are two options.  One is to try to screen out, which is very difficult given what is coming back through the regulatory review.  The other is to have an efficient process-----</p></speech>

In many cases they are the best people to make the call on the information they have been given and their experience as professional foresters, which always includes an element of ecology, environmental appreciation and expertise.  They are backed up.  There is also ongoing contact with ecologists.  There is training for district inspectors.  It is being expanded further and there will be training for registered foresters.

In addition, a number of files are tied up in the dual consent issue in regard to the planning permission piece where we are moving from broadleaf to conifers.

It is sad to say that farmers who were interested in planting have gone away from it because of a failure in the Department for seven or eight years, and that is the reality.  Unfortunately, from what Mr. Delany said about environmental law and the different situations, and he tried to take the positive view, I fear, and farmers will hear this, that they will not opt for this.  They will go for the acre or hectare Mr. Delany is talking about and that will solve a certain issue and will tick a box for Ireland that we planted so much, but it will not fix the shortfall that will come in 2040 to 2045 for the sawmills and that will actually cause loss of employment.  I worry that the same people have been guiding the same Department for the past six or seven years while that has been looked at and this lacuna or hole is going to happen in 2045, for which the people of Ireland will suffer because the trees will not be there.  It is a sad thing to have to say but that is my reflection on it.</p></speech>

As she knows, we have had numerous committee meetings on the forestry issue and it affects quite a large part of our country and our economy.  We have devoted a great deal of time and it looks like we are not getting the figures or the targets we had planned.  There are working groups meeting but we have been told today they are not working.  Is it not embarrassing for the Minister of State, as a Green Party representative, to hear that protests are being planned outside Leinster House by the forestry stakeholders due to inadequacies within her Department in the area of forestry, which see us now not being in any way able to meet targets and which will have a knock-on effect on our carbon targets?  The Minister of State said a while ago that we will look back at this as a blip.  To the people who want to sow or fell forestry, this is a tsunami that is not being resolved.  I would like her to answer that question.  Does she feel it is embarrassing that is what we are facing in this country at present?</p></speech>

They are working incredibly hard.  They are made up of a broad spectrum of stakeholders from across the forestry, environment, farmer groups and community groups.  It is difficult work because this is a very complex, difficult situation.  To be honest I want to say hats off to them because they have worked incredibly hard this past year.  Project Woodlands was set up last February so it is up and running a little over a year.  They are still working together.  I will take a bit of offence at it being said they are not working because they certainly are.</p> <p>  On the question of whether I feel embarrassed, we are all here working very hard, including everyone in this room, to get a solution to forestry.  If it was as easy as some of the Deputies and members here maybe think it is, we would not have it solved.  We would actually be in a worse position.  We would be back to where we were in 2020 and worse, so we are making progress.  I accept it is slow and frustrating.  I totally accept that, but we have ultimately to get to a position where we are working with the farmers, the communities, the industry and the wider population.  To focus solely, as many in this committee room do, on just commercial forestry is wrong because that has got us into much of the difficulty we are in and is perhaps where we have made mistakes in the past.  We developed a model that has been built around planting and clear felling and that does not blend well with our environment or with communities.  We have to think a bit beyond and outside the box.  I am saying we absolutely have to have a vibrant commercial sector in the next 30, 40, 50 or 100 years.  I say that with no qualms at all, but maybe we have to start looking differently at how we do that.  There are proposals around continuous cover.  That is continuous cover commercial forestry.  That takes a long while to get on board and get running.  We have to thin it in different ways and manage it in different ways.  We have to look at different ways of doing it.  Continuing to promote the same model we have been doing for past ten, 15 or 20 years is not going to work.  We need people like the members in this room to think outside the box in terms of how we get the sector on a road to future sustainability.</p></speech>

Would she consider taking her officials to the department in Scotland to see how it is done correctly in order that we can copy its model in Ireland?</p></speech>

Our average plantation size here is something like 7 ha.  In Scotland it is 40 ha.  The scale is totally different.  One licence potentially for 40 ha there would take six or seven licences here.  Those are marked differences.  The ownership of land in Scotland is different as well.  There are huge plantations, large farm sizes of thousands of hectares whereas here as we know the average farm size is approximately 39 ha.</p></speech>

My Department has had bilaterals with nearly every stakeholder who wants to engage with that process.  We have engaged with Irish Rural Link which has communicated with communities.  Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes conducted a survey on public attitudes to forestry.  We are in the process of having a public consultation, which is open until the end of April.  We also have a type of mini citizens' assembly on forestry in May, where we will have a deliberative dialogue over it.  We are doing everything we can to bring as many people on board, to help us as a State to decide what we as a nation want from forestry.  We absolutely need a commercial forestry sector.  It is essential, particularly when you look at why it was set up initially.  It was for remote rural areas that needed jobs.  It has served that end.  We need to make sure that continues.

We came back in today to hear about the Mackinnon report and about how only three out of 21 actions have been implemented after nearly two years.  Nothing.  As the Minister of State said, none of us can click our fingers and get the Mackinnon recommendations implemented.  However, after two years, we would expect more than three sections of it to be implemented.  If it keeps going at this rate, there will be two more Governments replacing the Minister of State and the rest of us before it is fully implemented.</p> <p>  In the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening statement, she talked about consistent negative messaging.  That is why there is frustration in the sector.  As the Chair and everyone else said, we have come in here since we were formed, time and again, to be told that it is improving.  The Minister of State and her officials seem to be the only ones who think this improving.  The stakeholders and farmers that we are meeting will say it is not working.</p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions.  On the present Planning and Development Act that is associated with regulations in respect of the broadleaf, the Minister of State said her Department is engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue and there might be a route to amending legislation to allow that kind of replacement of sites under 10 ha.  Can the Minister of State tell us what level of progress has been made on that?</p></speech>

Their legal people are looking at that and are drafting a statutory instrument.  As soon as that comes back, we will inform the committee straight away.  It should move reasonably quickly.  It depends on the legislative burden of that Department and how they can get it through.  They are very positively disposed to it at all levels and want to get it through.  They see the issues that are there for us and the backlog that is occurring because of that.</p></speech>

I have a list of here and I will just give one example.  They have had issues with the ash dieback for four years.  They first reported it on 14 March 2018.  As the initial reconstituting and underplanting scheme, RUS, was disbanded, they tried to address the problem through the woodland improvement scheme.  That was approved by the forestry service, but the accompanying felling licence was never approved by the forestry service.  We hear claims that there is no application at hand that predates 2020.  Is that really the case or instead, are the applications on hand that were delayed because of the abandonment of the initial RUS scheme now categorised as being post 2020?</p></speech>

However, whenever we look at the cohort of files with a view to removing ones that appear to be defunct, we go through the process of contacting the applicants to see if they actually want to proceed with the file or not.  I do not think we would be left with those types of applications in the system still standing there and being counted when, in fact, it is actually a file that is kind of gone or where the application is no longer going to advance.</p></speech>

While we have the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications telling us that we cannot sell some of the sod peat used to heat homes, at the same time, we hear of the failure over the past six years to plant 21,500 ha, meaning that we have failed to take 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Do the Department officials not see how there is a feeling now that this Government and its Departments take action that affect ordinary people, yet come down with excuses for their own failures in being proactive in making the most out of forestry?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, on one hand, we have targets.  Ultimately, if it is all wrapped up under climate action, we need a bit of balance in terms of what we do with peat and trees.  We obviously need to plant more trees and extract less peat.  Both of those deliver.  At this particular time, it is incredibly frustrating for people on the ground.</p> <p>  To get back to the trees, the point the Deputy made at the start about communication was important.  If farmers are submitting their licence applications and then finding they are not even getting the feedback, that is just not acceptable.  If it is an issue, it is something we certainly need to address in terms of keeping farmers and landowners in the loop on their own licence.  Others will say that they do get the information but I accept that might not be the case for everyone.  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the frustration.  The Deputy, everyone and I all get it.  I have some forestry myself.  I am thankful that I am actually not at the stage of requiring a licence.</p></speech>

One is the broader communications plan, through Project Woodland, and that includes the stakeholders.  That has been more or less finalised.  There is actually a very positive meeting today happening down the country.  In terms of that next step, of course, we obviously have to deal with the legislative issues.  We have to try to incentivise farmers as well in terms of a change in their land use to plant trees.</p> <p>  The other piece is the communication of that to make sure that there is positive messaging around that and that people can see it as a broad farm approach.  It is an entire farm approach; it is not just a singular issue.  They can see it as part of the overall farm management and farm sustainability plans and so on.  That is coming now.  The Deputy will see it in the coming in the coming weeks.  It is tied in with the increased output that is coming now with the addition of up to 36 full-time equivalents of ecologists and the output will be improving.  In tandem with that, it will be a case of trying to encourage farmers to consider that option.  Obviously, we are coming to the end of this current programme and there will be a new programme starting on 1 January 2023.  Again, on the communication plan around that, hopefully people will see this as part of a whole-farm approach as landowners and a positive approach on farmers.  That is probably one of the most important things we have to do once we have the licensing output sorted.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State not see the negative messages that are going out?  She did not even answer me about the 21,500 ha taking 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide out, while at the same time, there is the peat end of it.  Some 21,500 ha being planted is down to a Department of this Government.  It has been the problem.  However, at the same time, this same Government is bringing in taxes on ordinary families and small people.</p></speech>

Currently, we have changed how we plant at the moment.

There is a setback now.  There is a greater requirement for spaces for biodiversity.</p></speech>

While we did not hit the target last year, we simply do not know what will be the case this year because there are no guarantees, but based on our projections on the afforestation licences we intend to issue, we could hit 9,000 ha if the trees are planted.

I think we all agree on that.  It must be acknowledged that this committee is giving a significant priority to forestry issues in a way that I have never witnessed in my time here.</p> <p>  I have a specific case that I wish to raise.  I have referred it to the Minister of State by email.  It has been the subject of parliamentary questions.  It is TFL00177018.  To me, this case is the kernel of the issue as it relates to applications for felling licences.  The woman in question who made the application made it on 28 June 2018 and she contacted the forestry service on 7 April this year after bringing in a consultant and much toing and froing.  At this stage, a conservative estimate is that there are up to 100 pieces of correspondence between her, as the applicant, and the Department.  She was told on 7 April that they could not tell her when an ecologist would be appointed to deal with her file.  This is a woman, a farmer, with a modest income who wanted to play her part and to raise her family.  She wants to contribute to climate action and to ensure that she earns a modest income or return from that application.  The return on this will be very modest.  She is not a big farmer.  She is not rich.</p><p>We are hitting four years with this application, and I cannot tell this person, despite all the engagement I have had with the Minister of State's Department, when she can reasonably expect to receive her felling licence.  This crystallises the issue.</p><p> We may get into the weeds in this committee concerning who represents the commercial foresters and who represents others.  The fact remains, however, that there is a perception, whether we like it or not, that preference and priority is given to Coillte applications and that the screening, and the rules for screening, do not seem to apply as rigorously to Coillte applications as they do to applications coming from private forestry owners.  I just want to be able to go back to my constituent - who is a decent and hard-working person who has raised a family on a modest holding - and be able to tell her that she will have her licence this year.  Preferably, l would like to be able to tell her she will have her licence in the next two or three months.  I say that because harvest plans have been produced and this person was told before that the ecology report was being worked on.  As public representatives, we are not getting clear sight of what is happening internally in the Department.  Therefore, the Minister of State can surely understand why frustration arises when there are named people in the Department who have responsibility for implementing the policy.  They are seen as the go-to people.  It is a small country where everybody knows everybody, so people get frustrated and people get named.  The Minister of State will understand why that happens.  </p><p> People perceive that blockages are being put in place.  In this case it is almost Kafkaesque, based on the correspondence I have seen between this applicant and the Department.  This person's consultant, a person who adheres to the most rigorous professional standards, made the application and did the harvest plan for her.  After years interacting with the forestry service, and this consultant is a forester himself, he is now scratching his head and saying he cannot understand why this applicant is not getting her licence.  This sums up the situation.  Can the Minister of State understand the frustration of organisations like SEEFA, when their representatives are telling her they are selling saplings to Scotland, but they cannot put saplings in the ground here?</p><p> I am trying to take the heat out of this matter, but I am deeply frustrated because I see the massive potential forestry has in the context of dealing with climate change.  If there is a target of 8,000 ha, why is that not being reached?  There is massive potential here, and we all instinctively know what it is.  I understand what the Minister of State is saying about the housing sector and the potential for forestry to deliver in that regard, and we need a commercial forestry sector for that aspect.  There are also private foresters, however, who want to contribute to taking action on climate change, who want to grow native species as well and who want to make their contribution to achieving the target to which the Minister of State referred, but they cannot see how they are going to do that now.</p><p> I will go back to this woman of whom I have spoken to tell her I have raised this topic today.  Hopefully, she will get her licence as soon as possible because of the Minister of State's intervention.  When I ask her, though, whether she will plant trees after this experience, I guarantee that her answer will be: "No, I will never go near forestry again".  These are the people we are taking out of the equation because of the system that exists.  I refer to the honest-to-goodness farmers who planted a bit of ground.  As SEEFA has said, those bits of ground are those farmers' wealth.  If confidence among these people is dampened, then it will be very difficult to regenerate it.  I would love to be able to tell my constituent about the systems that have been put in place, the regulatory review, the Mackinnon report, the stakeholders all coming together and there being many more policy interventions now to create more incentives.  I guarantee, though, that she will never go near planting forestry again, and I am sure we are speaking about thousands of people like her now.</p><p> In the context of the Minister of State digging out this file, I served as a Minister of State for five years and I used to get into the nitty-gritty of details.  If I was the Minister of State with special responsibility for forestry now and if a member of this committee raised a matter concerning a particular file, then I would say that I wanted that file on my desk in the Department in the afternoon.  I would read that file, and then I would ask questions regarding why this system is not working.  I would be getting down into the weeds of every file I could, and I would be asking why things were not happening.  That is what I would do, and I say that modestly.  I thank the Chair for granting me latitude.</p></speech>

Coillte sold those woods and the residents there are saying there was no prior consultation.  This comes back again to the issue of consultation.

Regarding what was said about a 10 ha mix of hardwood and softwood species, is something in the pipeline that will make it possible to do this without a licence?  Under the new results-based environmental agri pilot, REAP, scheme, will it be possible for people to go into forestry and not be penalised for using a piece of land?</p></speech>

I spoke to a senior planner from a local authority some time ago and I went through what actually happens in that context.  The local authorities' files are broken into eight parts.  They do environmental impact studies and environmental impact assessments, and they are all tied in together.  They have timelines in place for the provision of further information and they are legislatively required to stick to them.  The system puts exceptional pressure on the local authorities, but they must respond.  Does the Minister of State believe we need to have similar legislation to put exceptional pressure on the Department to respond?  I refer to ensuring that a case like that mentioned so eloquently by Deputy Sherlock could never happen again.</p></speech>

It is a matter for Coillte.  It is fine to ask questions of Coillte about this matter, but I do not expect the Minister of State to pass comment on this issue.  I ask her to address the other questions briefly, as we are over our time.</p></speech>

Working with Project Woodland previously, I was trying to implement the Mackinnon report.  An environmental grant was sought in that context.  A proposal has been worked through and we are still trying to get that over the line.  In the interim, we have agreed to pay an additional amount for environmental services at the form 2 stage.  We are also trying to reduce the environmental cost burden on applicants.  In other words, for those files in the backlog now, we are going to do the habitats map for them with our additional ecology resources.  That will take a financial burden off the applicants, until we can get to the final phase of the 2022 programme in respect of the new forestry programme and incorporating this environmental grant.  Therefore, as the Minister of State said, we will be paying an environmental grant at the form 2 stage.</p></speech>

In fairness, we all highlighted that at committee for the new environmental schemes and, indeed, the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  What is the story on that?

It is fair to say that even since trees were planted, and I do not even know the date from which this happened, farms are still in receipt of their basic payment scheme, BPS, payment under that area whereas previously, that was removed from the direct payments.  It is something on which we are following up.  When we have information we will share it with the Deputy.</p> <p>  I will say to Deputy Sherlock that it is totally unacceptable that his constituent had that experience.

We cannot put a timeline on when a person gets his or her licence if we have not pulled our socks up.  That just cannot be done.  We will just be dragged in front of the courts.  We should be examining the length of time for decisions, however.  It is even just to be honest with people and say either there is not a hope or their licence is too far away from where we need it and will take another six months to process.

We have had a very robust exchange for the last hour and a half.  We have only one aim at this committee.  We want to see an efficient forestry sector with more afforestation and the timely issuing of licences.  We all want to get to one place.  There are a few issues that we as a committee will not let go, one of which is ash dieback.  The legislation on thinning is another.  As I said, the timely issuing of licences and the timeline for that is important.I saw it working extremely well in premia in the past where we had an <i>ad hoc</i>system for the payment of premia.  We got a farmer's charter in place and 97% to 98% of the premia are paid on a specific date.  I know it is a lot of work to get there but if we are going to have an efficient industry going forward, we must strive to get to that.  I thank the Minister of State and her officials.

The focus of this afternoon's meeting is the examination of challenges facing the pig industry and fixed-price milk contracts.</p> <p>  On 28 February, legal requirement for mask-wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  Before we begin, I want to bring to everyone's attention that witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> In this session, we will hear from representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and Meat Industry Ireland, MII.  The representatives from the IFA are Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, Mr. William Murphy, pigs committee vice chair, and Mr. Tadhg Buckley, director of policy.  The representatives from MII are Mr. Philip Carroll, chairman, Mr. Cormac Healy, senior director, and Mr. Joe Ryan, director.</p><p> There were developments in the crisis in the pig sector this morning, with the Minister putting a package on the table.  Mr. Cullinan wishes to comment on that.  We will allow him to add a supplementary to his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting the IFA to address it on the issues facing the pig sector.  The Irish pig sector is in the midst of a crisis the likes of which it has never experienced before.  As losses mount, which Teagasc estimates will be as much as &euro;160 million, many pig farmers are facing an uncertain future.  Without State intervention and support, many farmers will exit the sector, leading to job losses and a substantial impact on the rural economies that these farmers heavily support.</p> <p>  The challenges that the pig sector is experiencing are numerous but centre around a massive increase in the overall cost of production, along with a decline in farm gate pig price.  Feed and energy bills are overwhelming for farm families that are trying to run their businesses.  A combination of factors, all of which are outside the control of pig farmers, have resulted in all pig farmers incurring heavy losses.</p> <p>  I will list some of the factors that have caused the current crisis.  Brexit has had a significant negative impact on pig prices.  Since the start of 2021, the volume and value of pig output exported to the UK has fallen by 50%.  This output was sold onto other markets that were of lower value and incurred had higher transport costs to access.  The Covid-19 outbreak caused substantial market disruption, leading to downward price pressure.  Processing capacity, in particular in Northern Ireland, was curtailed, leading to a backlog of pigs on Irish pig units, which continues to be the case today.  The African swine fever, ASF, also had a negative impact on the pig market.  Thankfully, Ireland has avoided direct contact with ASF, but the outbreak in mainland Europe has led to a collapse in European prices and has had a direct impact on Irish prices.  In addition, the increase in feed prices since mid-2021 has aggravated the crisis.  This has been made all the more serious by the recent geopolitical events in Ukraine.  The pig sector is one of the most exposed to feed price increases, as it constitutes the majority of the cost base of a pig farm.</p> <p>  Farmers are being squeezed from all sides and are also facing the added actions of retailers in the domestic market, which are relentlessly pushing down the retail price of their products and embarking on unsustainable discounting to encourage store footfall.  The pig sector, while generating significant export value of close to &euro;1 billion annually, is reliant on the home market, predominantly the retail trade, for 50% of all sales.</p> <p>  Our pig industry is one of the most significant sectors of Ireland's agricultural economy, ranking third in size after the dairy and beef sectors.  The sector supports more than 8,000 jobs domestically, generating &euro;1.7 billion in output when the primary and value added sectors are accounted for.  Based on the most recent national pig census, there are 1.7 million pigs in Ireland, predominantly on fully integrated pig units.  The sector has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, with Bord Bia estimating that there are 270 farmers participating in its quality assurance scheme.</p> <p>  The pig sector, unlike the other large livestock sectors, is based on a constant year-round production model.  It is a major consumer of Irish-produced compound feed and is a significant contributor to the rural economy, particularly in the four largest pig producing counties of Cavan, Cork, Tipperary and Waterford.  It is also one of the few sectors within Irish agriculture that does not receive any direct funding from the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.</p> <p>  Teagasc estimates that pig farmers are losing an average of &euro;56,000 per month and rising, and that 7% of pig farmers have already been forced into a decision to exit, with a further 20% to 30% at serious risk of failure due to the unprecedented and rapid escalation of feed costs since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Producers have already incurred exceptional losses and it is expected that, in total, these will exceed &euro;160 million from late 2021 to early 2023.</p> <p>  To prevent the demise of the sector, the IFA, MII and the Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA, are jointly proposing the immediate establishment of a pig stability fund.  I will outline the key aspects of the proposal, the first of which is to establish, without delay, a State-administered fund to provide an immediate cash injection to pig farmers to avoid the demise of the sector at primary and processing level.  This fund would be jointly funded by a State contribution along with a long-term fund sourced by way of a new statutory levy.  We should introduce a statutory levy of 90 cent per pig - equivalent to 1 cent per kilogram - on all pigs slaughtered in the Republic of Ireland or exported to Northern Ireland.  Based on the 2021 output of 4 million pigs per annum, this would generate a revenue stream of &euro;3.6 million per annum.  Over a 14-year payback period, this would constitute a direct farmer contribution of &euro;50 million.  The State should commit to fund the farmer contribution of &euro;50 million initially, along with an additional upfront fund from the State of &euro;50 million.  The former would be repaid by the revenue from the newly established statutory levy.  The levy would be compulsory on all farmers producing finished pigs in the sector.  While we acknowledge that this fund would require sizeable State support, the importance and economic value of the sector merits this intervention because, without it, the sector's long-term future and its contribution to the economy are in jeopardy.</p> <p>  Volatility is a constant challenge for pig farmers across the world.  The hog cycle, first coined by US economists in the 1920s, outlined the challenges that volatility presented to pig farmers in particular.  Due to a shorter production cycle compared with beef, price volatility, while evident in all sectors, tends to be more pronounced in pig farming.  However, the current pig crisis is unprecedented in the scale of losses.  Teagasc estimates that the industry will incur losses of &euro;160 million at farm level over the 18-month period from September 2021 to March 2023 and that an average 600-sow pig unit will incur losses of &euro;663,000 during this period.  This is unsustainable, and without significant State intervention, the sector faces possible collapse.</p> <p>  Since Harvest 2020, cereal prices have more than doubled.  Wheat has risen from &euro;185 per tonne to in excess of &euro;430 per tonne, an increase of 132%.  Similarly, maize has risen from &euro;175 per tonne to &euro;390 per tonne, an increase of 122%.  Initial increases were based on lower world closing stocks and increases in freight prices, but more recently the war in Ukraine has caused significant additional price hikes.  Teagasc estimates that feed credit per average pig farm for quarter 1 of 2022 will amount to &euro;497,000.  For quarter 2, this is estimated to increase to &euro;594,000.  In 2020, this figure averaged at &euro;388,875 for the average-sized pig farm.  Therefore, feed credit has increased by 52% over the past two years.</p> <p>  To date, State intervention has amounted to a &euro;7 million support package for the sector.</p><p>While welcome, this is in no way sufficient to address the &euro;160 million losses that the sector has identified.</p><p> The pig sector is one of the most important sectors in the Irish agricultural economy, supporting 8,000 jobs and making a substantial contribution to the rural Irish economy.  The challenge facing the Irish pig sector is unprecedented in scale with Teagasc estimating that 30% of Irish pig farmers are at risk of closure.  Closures of anywhere close to this level will have major implications for the sector, both at primary and processing levels.  In addition, destocking at this scale could prove difficult to manage from a logistical perspective because it cannot be implemented in a rapid manner.  Teagasc estimates that farms with a total of 10,135 sows are now in the process of destocking.  The estimated economic impact of this is that: 69 people will lose direct employment; 550 people will lose indirect employment; and 619 people will totally lose their employment.  There will be an annual loss of payroll to the tune of &euro;22.3 million.  The loss of weekly pig throughput will be more than 5,000 pigs and there will be an export loss of &euro;67 million.  The proposed stability fund sets out to address both the short-term and long-term challenges the sector faces.  The fund will be part-financed by a substantial contribution from pig farmers and offers a volatility management mechanism to support the long-term sustainability of the sector.  Most importantly, this intervention is needed to secure the survival of the sector; without it Irish pig farmers face an uncertain future.</p><p> As I said at the start and as the Chairman mentioned, there is speculation this morning that a proposal is coming from the Minister that is nothing near the proposal we put on the table to the Government.  I want to state clearly again in these Houses that the pig farmers of Ireland are concerned and want to work with the industry to put &euro;50 million of their money on the table to ensure the viability of the sector going forward, albeit I appreciate that funding has to be provided upfront by the Government.  A clear commitment with a statutory levy to pay that back is being proposed.  We are hearing speculation that a direct fund of &euro;13 million is being proposed for pig farmers.  I welcome the funding and I acknowledge in my statement the &euro;7 million that was put forward by the Minister recently, even though &euro;5 million of that will be paid to farmers and there &euro;2 million will be left.  What is more worrying for me is the speculation that there is a proposal that for a farmer to be able to access the &euro;13 million or &euro;70,000 per farmer, he or she would have to reduce stock on his or her farm by 10%.  This is totally unsustainable, particularly because a farmer might have a chance of surviving by maintaining the stock he or she has.  We are at a point where the market is starting to improve.  If a farmer made that decision today, those pigs would not be available on the market for another ten months.  That is the point at which we believe the market will have stabilised and when there will be a margin in the system for farmers again.  We have seen schemes in the past such as the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme in 2018 and 2019, which ended up as a mess that the Department is still dealing with.  The last thing I want to see happening in the pig sector is something similar to that scheme.  It is totally unjustified and I want to clearly put it on record that we will not support any reduction in the sector.</p></speech>

I also welcome its statement and proposal.  It is a unique proposal to impose a levy on the industry.  The IFA is not reinventing the wheel.  This has happened in other industries, particularly in the insurance industry.  Over a period, we have seen different levies put on the insurance industry to help it get over issues and, in time, the industry financed itself.</p> <p>  We are talking in a vacuum here, and it is awkward to do so.  There is media speculation this afternoon that there is potential for a 10% cut in the pig herd but we are unsure if that is true or untrue.  We are hampered in our negotiations by being in that vacuum.  It is 2 p.m. and we were hoping to have that information but we do not and that is unfortunate.  Within that vacuum, I want to mention the idea of destocking.  We have a scenario where stock is unfortunately being slaughtered.  In my part of the world sows are being slaughtered on a continuous basis, particularly in the past ten days, because there is a fear that is the only way pig farmers can deal with the issue.  If there was to be a destocking would that not dramatically suppress the price going forward anyway?  Would it be counterproductive in how the industry can try to sustain itself going forward?</p> <p>  I mention the scale of losses and Mr. Cullinan mentioned in excess of &euro;150 million in losses.  We are proposing to put &euro;13 million plus &euro;7 million onto that.  It is a drop in the ocean in the context of where this industry is.  The one thing I have learned about this debate is that not alone will the pig industry be under exceptional pressure, the milling industry will also be under pressure.  One could argue the point that more millers than farmers were at the protests in recent weeks because of the potential liability that will be out there among several milling platforms, including those owned by co-operatives and the privately owned mills.  There is significant pressure on their books regarding how much money is out there.  I am very fearful of how the milling industry could survive this crisis, how the pig industry will survive it and how the production industry from that side of the world could survive a crisis in that issue.</p> <p>  I appreciate that I am talking in a vacuum without the information being brought forward.  Hopefully the Chairman will have the information from the Minister before the end of the meeting on the proposals and he might be able to clarify what those proposals are.  If they are to involve what we are talking about, namely, a &euro;13 million package and a BEAM-style proposal to take 10% off the herd then I would be very fearful of what that will do to the industry.  It must be taken into consideration that a completely different funding stream is not being proposed and that the insurance industry has done this before.  How bad does Mr. Cullinan think the proposal that is out there at the moment would be?  Does he honestly think we will have 300 pig farmers left?  What will we be left with after this?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#EE00400"><p>I welcome our guests back to the committee.  The mechanism the Department and the Minister in particular have been using is becoming increasingly frustrating.  It is a long-standing practice but it has become particularly prevalent where news of a headline scheme is leaked and we are all reading through different newspapers and columns to try to get the pertinent information.  Generally speaking, the details of the scheme are then published when all the staff at the agriculture newspapers have gone to bed and there is little scope for questions to be put.  In many cases, it is several weeks before the full details emerge, which is not good enough, especially when we are dealing with sectors in crisis, as we are with respect to the pig sector.</p> <p>  I would like to get as much information as the IFA has on how the new package will work from its understanding.  One of the key planks of the alternative package that the IFA has put forward was &euro;50 million in loan funding, which I would have thought would be the easiest element for Government to deliver.  Yet, it appears there is no reference to that in the Government announcement.  Perhaps Mr. Cullinan could report on his engagements with the Minister and Department officials on why there is resistance to that mechanism whereby Government has access to relatively cheap funding.  The scheme that was outlined ensure that would be repaid to the taxpayer.  As a result, it is hard to see why there would be resistance.  Maybe there are practical or technical issues that have been brought to Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s attention that would ensure that is the case.</p> <p>  The pig sector is probably the agricultural sector that is most clearly and evidently affected by Brexit.</p><p>To date, there has been no move on the Brexit adjustment reserve being used to provide a package.  None of the &euro;1 billion Brexit adjustment reserve that we all fought for and welcomed has yet reached farmers, which is scandalous.  This is the easiest route to address that.  In their negotiations with the Department, have the witnesses seen a mechanism or willingness to use the Brexit adjustment reserve?</p><p> We learned about 5% of pig farmers going out of business.  Mr. Cullinan referred to 7%, which suggests that more are leaving the sector daily.  Will the witnesses outline the real impact on the domestic economy if that trend continues?</p><p> The Minister published heads of a paper about a new office for transparency.  It is the new name for the food ombudsman, which is the name used instead of the term "meat regulator".  Do the witnesses believe that office will be able to assist sectors such as this in the event of future crises?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#FF00200"><p>In response to Senator Lombard, we are clear about where the industry is heading.  Between 7% and 10% of farmers have exited it.  The Senator made his point clearly.  I quoted figures from Teagasc, a State body, that up to 30% of farmers could exit the sector.  Our original proposal is from farmers and industry coming together, which is unique, that we are willing to pay a statutory levy for the next 15 years to ensure the viability of the sector.  It is not just about farmers.  As the Senator said, there are milling and processing sectors too.  The cumulative value of the sector is &euro;1.7 billion in output and 8,000 people employed.  It is larger than Intel.  If the Minister was able to announce next week that another international company similar to Intel was entering the country, it would be the top headline on the 9 o'clock news.  We have a sector which supports 8,000 jobs in rural communities, which we are trying to protect.  There will be losses of approximately &euro;160 million, which is serious for farmers.  There is an issue with credit on pig farms.  They cannot continue to pay for the extraordinary price increases, with the cost of ingredients rising by 130%.  We are concerned about this proposal.  Like the committee, I sincerely hope that we have a clear decision about it before leaving this evening.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Carthy, regarding the alternative package, it was frustrating that our farmers had to come to Dublin.  We had a protest outside Agriculture House two weeks ago, seeking negotiations about this.  There did not seem to be any urgency or concern in the Department, but a belief that the original package of &euro;7 million would resolve a serious problem, which was not the case.  Farmers had to come to Dublin and were willing to stay on the street 24-7 until we got a solution.  We negotiated with the Minister.  Mr. Buckley will speak on the proposal he was involved in negotiating with the Minister's officials.  It is important to have clarity on that.  The Deputy rightly pointed out the impact of Brexit on the Irish pig sector's exports, with a decrease in the value and volume of pig meat entering the UK market.  That had an impact on the sector early on.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, there is a Brexit adjustment reserve fund of more than &euro;1 billion.  We have not heard anything from the Minister or Government about where that funding will go.  We have an opportunity to use the fund to offset the losses that we incurred in the UK market.  There was a serious issue with the export of live pigs to Northern Ireland in the summer of 2021, which created serious issues for farmers in the South.  They lost revenue and were not able to get pigs off their farms for a period.  Thankfully, a resolution has been found and the pigs have moved off the farms, which is important, but it was costly.</p> <p>  On the office of transparency, I sincerely hope we will not end up with a quango again.  I refer to the beef task force.  Grant Thornton was commissioned by the Government to examine the margins in the food supply chain.  It failed to do so and the Minister committed to introduce primary legislation for a food regulator to ensure this would never happen again.  I sincerely hope it will happen.  We have to go much further.  I was in Brussels on Monday and am delighted to report that Spain has introduced legislation on below-cost selling.  There is no reason that we cannot do so.  We recently saw a report from Jim Power that was done on our behalf about compression by discounters and the untold damage they do to the retail sector, the pig sector and other sectors in this country that rely on the retailer.  Mr. Buckley might provide an update on funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#FF00300"><p>Our proposal was cross-sectoral, involving both the feed and processing industries, which, as the president said, is quite unique.  It was built on a dual-funding proposal, with a portion of funding coming from the State and the remainder coming from a loan system, to be paid back by statutory levy.  The challenge with the statutory levy is with introducing legislation.  We acknowledge that there will be a challenge and maybe a small delay.  We will work with authorities to introduce this as much as we can.  If we know that a levy process is being put in place and we have an idea of what funding can come from it, that gives the milling industry a lot of comfort about the capacity of farmers, who owe hundreds of thousands of euro, to stay with them and about the provision of credit.  It helps financial institutions to ensure that farmers can continue to get support.  The real short-term challenge is liquidity, which can only be maintained in the sector through mills providing credit.  That is not their core job, which is to provide feed, but they are now providing a substantial amount of credit, as do financial institutions.</p><p>If farmers run out of liquidity, it is inevitable they are going to exit.</p><p> On the numbers, Teagasc estimates that 10,135 have gone.  The impact from an export point of view alone is just under &euro;70 million.  Multiply that out and you have a serious problem.  As well as that, where you start losing potentially 20% to 30%, which is what Teagasc is saying is the number in jeopardy, then that affects the core competitiveness of the sector in the medium term.  If you take that chunk out then obviously your capacity to utilise processing facilities and all that side of it is impacted in terms of the economic capacity as well.  It would potentially have a huge, long-term negative competitiveness impact on the sector.  At the moment, we have 250 to 300 farmers.  Many people say it is a small sector in terms of numbers, but it is the third largest in the context of output.  People tend to forget that.</p></speech>

Much of what I was going to say has already been covered.</p> <p>  I would like a little more information on the association's proposed stability fund.  If it were to happen and the IFA had that &euro;100 million, how would that be distributed to keep liquidity going?  Would it be per pig or per farm?  Has the IFA gone that far into how the fund would be distributed if it were to get the money?  If it were to happen, or whatever needs to happen to get pig farmers over this hump occurred, how confident is the association that farmers can trade their way out of this going forward?  Where are the markets?  Is there work being done on replacing the UK market?  What confidence is in the sector?  We all know about the perfect storm of Brexit, the war in Ukraine, feed and fuel prices, etc.  We have no idea when the war will finish or when prices will stabilise again.  With that in mind, and assuming pig farmers got over this hump, can the IFA confidently say pig farmers will trade out of the situation they are in?  What needs to happen with markets and so on to facilitate such a scenario?</p></speech>

Mr. Cullinan knows exactly where we are coming from, namely, that the pig farmer is an integral part of agriculture down in Tipperary.  I had questions on the IFA's suggested package but I will leave them for the time being, save to ask how long would it provide adequate assistance for pig farmers.  Will the association outline what pig farmers are encountering when they look for credit?  In its view, will the increased Government commitment to the sector improve the reception farmers get when looking for credit?  Is the IFA experiencing increased pressure from the retail sector to offset the price increases it is experiencing in transport and so on by continuing to depress the prices it is willing to pay farmers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.381" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#GG01000"><p>I will begin with the Senator's questions.  On getting over the hump, the reason we brought these proposals forward was we saw where the sector was at.  It is at a very critical juncture and there is a risk of the sector going under.  The Senator is right we were in a very difficult situation prior to the war in Ukraine but that has put at least &euro;100 per tonne onto the cost of feed.  That has created serious consequences for not just the pig sector but all of agriculture because of fuel and fertiliser costs and we are trying to manage our way through them at the moment.  The other question was on how the money would be distributed.  The plan here was about getting liquidity back into the system because what we have at the moment is the fact that the money farmers are acquiring when they sell their pigs to the factory is not even covering the cost of feed.  The money was going to be used to pay down the debt that had been building up in farms by buying feed.  That is where the money would be distributed to.  The proposal was we would look at the losses for the first quarter of the year, remunerate farmers for those losses and then look at the situation as the year developed, maybe for the months of May and June.  We have seen already a chink of light that the price of pigs to farmers has increased by 20 cent per kilo but already that has been eroded by another price increase in the cost of feed.  It is a very difficult situation but a twofold solution is needed here.  One part is direct aid and the other is the stability fund that, as I said already, farmers are willing to contribute to themselves.  That is where we would see it going.  The funding would definitely be used to alleviate the pressure from a cash point of view on farms and ensure farmers can continue to buy feed to feed their pigs.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how long for the assistance.  It is similar.  What we wanted to do is assess the losses and get to a point where farmers would get back into a profitable situation.  We are all realists here.  We do not expect that the State prop up the industry on a long-term basis.  One thing about the pig sector is we do not get basic payments or single farm payments.  This is the first time the sector has come to the Government looking for direct aid or funding to ensure, as I said, its viability.  The Deputy knows that in our county many people are employed in the processing sector of the pig industry as well, along with farming and a lot of grain-growers in Tipperary would be contributing also.  The other point he raised was pressure from retailers.  There is always pressure from retailers to pay back an increase.  We are all hearing about food inflation at the moment and it is very topical but nobody is sustaining the inflation farmers are at the moment, especially pig farmers.  It is inflation of 130% or 150%.  We need to be clear the price of food must go up to compensate for the massive losses farmers are incurring at the moment.  How are we going to get back into a profitable situation?  There are a couple of areas there.  We have to get more back from the retail sector as 50% of what we produce is sold to it.  Again, we have to look at new markets.  We have to look at Mexico.  There is a substantial demand for pig meat in Mexico at the moment.  That is an important market to offset the pig meat that was going into the UK.  California is another market where there is an increasing demand for pig meat.  Bord Bia and the Minister must continue seeking out new markets because we are an exporting nation, not just in pig meat but in dairy and dairy produce as well.</p></speech>

We are all uncertain about the package being leaked in the media at the minute.  How much consultation had the IFA with the Department on this package?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#GG01200"><p>The consultation we had with the Department was on the proposal we came here with today, that is, the &euro;50 million in direct aid and &euro;50 million stability fund where farmers were going to contribute to the levy.  It was really a loan we were asking the Government for.  It was not direct aid on 50% of the package.  They were the negotiations we had with the Department.  Like the Deputy says, this is leaked or whatever.  We are all reading this in the media this morning but we were not negotiating that package with the Department.</p></speech>

Mr. Cullinan talked about 7% of pig producers basically going broke.  Why is the figure of 7% being picked as against the 93%?  I have talked to the two producers in County Roscommon.  Any of them I have talked to so far have said that they are losing phenomenal money.  Even pig producers in Tipperary, Cork and other places will tell you that.  I ask Mr. Cullinan to explain how he has come up with the figure of 7%?</p></speech>

The most vulnerable ones will be those who fall off the wagon first.  It may be that they have already extended credit for the feed they are buying from merchants.  They will be the ones that will be under the most severe pressure at first.  This is real; we are seeing it.  I have spoken to people at midnight who have had to make the decision to give up.  We all know about it here because we are all involved with agriculture in one way or another.  Many of the people in this sector have been involved for many years.  To have to make that decision, and for the person running the farm to have to come back home to a family and tell them that they have to give it up when they have been doing it for years, is heartbreaking.  Most of the people involved in this sector built their businesses from the ground up - from very small units - over the years.  It is heartbreaking for us to be here representing those core groups.  The worry is that it started at around 7%, and we are now up at around 10%.  The figures I referenced are Teagasc figures; they are not mine.  If there is not proper intervention, the worry is that we are going to end up losing 30% of the sector.  What happens then is that the entire sector becomes very vulnerable and unviable.  What we will see then is that we will end up just supplying the domestic market.  The whole system will become inefficient and we may lose a processing plant as well.  That is the real concern.  These are the key reasons why farmers and industry came together and are willing to put their own money on the table to protect the sector into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#HH00300"><p>Would I be correct in saying that there is no point talking about a Brexit fund for the simple reason that for the next six, eight, and perhaps ten months, the pig sector is going to go through a wobbly enough time.  After that, the projections are looking fairly good.  Teagasc predicted that will happen in February of next year.  Whether it is the Brexit fund or a bank, applicants have to be able to show that they will make some money that year.  It is governed by Central Bank rules, even though the Government will be backing it up, in fairness.  Applicants have to have a business plan or they will not get the money.  We have to go with the stability fund.  Basically, there is no other choice, or else the sector will be in serious trouble.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullinan spoke about Bord Bia.  What new markets have we got?  We know that Brexit has been going on for a good few years and we know the dangers involved.  What new markets have we got over the past few years?  There is another side to the pig sector.  There are merchants that supply a lot of meal, to put it simply.  Obviously, the credit that some of them give to the pig producers will be getting tighter for the simple reason that they cannot withstand everything with the way the price of meal has gone.  Where is the IFA seeing the problems there?</p> <p>  As has been pointed out, no more than the BEAM scheme, farmers' hands are nearly tied behind their backs with all these requirements that when they are given a few pounds, they have to reduce by X amount.  Some of the pig producers to whom I have spoken have basically put the sows back in banbh again, to put it simply.  According to the IFA's calculations, or maybe those calculations are not available, is there much of that going on?  Are the representatives of the IFA meeting the Department again?  If we can agree to do so, I recommend that send something today to the Minister to ask him to urgently address this issue.  In fairness, the pig producers that I have talked to are pretty desperate at the moment.  They need support.</p></speech>

I have one question.  The IFA has figures and Teagasc has figures, and Teagasc feeds information back to the Government.  I cannot understand why a paltry package of &euro;7 million in funding was provided a month or two ago, given that there is such a crisis in the pig industry.  It seems that there could be another &euro;13 million in funding - that is not anywhere near what is needed - with a 10% cut-off for a herd, which is an astonishing situation for pig farmers to find themselves in.  Some of them are paying up to 70% more for their feed.  I have been talking to those working in the pig industry in west Cork, even as late as last night.  Some of them are have gone out of business or are going out of business.  It is a very serious situation.  The Government is slightly out of touch and the Minister is very out of touch on this issue.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Cullinan to explain why the pig and poultry industry are outside of CAP payments for their food products which are 100% quality assured, welfare compliant and nitrate compliant?  They are also land-based enterprises, due to the fact that all products consumed by the animals are land-based, and all products excreted by the animals are excreted back onto the land.</p></speech>

I did mention Bord Bia.  Trade missions will be under way before the end of April.  Bord Bia is going on a trade mission to the US and to Mexico, which is welcome.  As I said already, there is a demand for pig meat in Mexico.  That is important.  We always need to be striving for new markets.  We were the sector that paved the way in China for many years.  How this crisis came about was that the events in China in 2018 and 2019, with ASF, created a massive demand for pig meat all over the world.  Thus, the price increased.  What happened was that obviously, there was expansion all over the world as well.  The Chinese are back producing a lot of pig meat themselves, and that market is more difficult at the moment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#HH00700"><p>Yes.  Last year, more than 60% of our exports went into the Chinese market, which is a substantial amount of pig meat.  There was a lot of work done with the processing sector in Ireland to develop that market over the years, to give credit from that point of view.  A great deal of work was done there.  Now, there is a concern around China.  Again, the Deputy is right.  We need to keep evolving.  We need to be seeking out newer markets continuously.  That is the nature of the business.  It is the same as any other sector in agriculture.  The Deputy made the point about credit.  He is right.  It is very worrying at the moment.  It is about farmers having the cash to pay for feed.  It is as simple as that.  The price that farmers are obtaining for their pigs at the moment will not even cover the cost of feed.  Then there are all the other incidental costs after that.  Therein lies the problem.  The Deputy made the point that many farmers are giving up on going back and rebreeding sows.  As I have said, according to the figures we have, 10% of those in the sector are leaving at the moment.  If we cannot find a solution to this, we are being clearly told by Teagasc that we could see 30% of the farmers making that decision in the months ahead.  That is how serious it is.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Collins' comments on the funding package, he is right; we always acknowledge any funding that we get from the State.  We understand that it is taxpayers' money.  However, it just was not enough.  We are talking about the enormous amount of credit that is involved in the sector.  The number of farmers in the sector is very small.  We acknowledge all of that.  On the &euro;13 million, if that funding is provided, we will always acknowledge that we are receiving taxpayers' money.  However, it is not near the proposal that we have on the table.  It is a huge concern for us.  The reason that pig farmers have not been receiving CAP payments is because pig farming in Ireland is mainly based on a small number of hectares.</p><p>Prior to decoupling, farmers would not have had pigs in fields.  Pigs were never included in the commonage farm plan payments anyway.  That is not the issue we have.  We want to continue running the businesses as we have been doing in the past but we are at a critical juncture and we need to get support from our Government to get the system up and running again.</p></speech>

It is good to hear from the IFA president and his team.  This is a very serious matter in the county I am from.  It is a reasonable estimate that approximately one third of the production in Ireland is based in County Cavan.  The witnesses might confirm that.  There may be a relatively small number of farmers involved, but this takes in a large number of jobs.  These are indigenous and local jobs, with entire communities built around the pig industry and pig farming sector.  Schools and shops depend on spin-off effects in small villages and towns.  Small farms are sustained because a person with a small farm can work in the pig sector and make a bit of money to supplement that farm and keep it going.  The estimated job numbers nationally are 8,000 but there is a much greater economic impact in this.</p> <p>  The IFA president compared this with the likes of Intel.  That comparison is absolutely true.  Moreover, in the areas we have these jobs, we could not attract other industries and, normally, we could not attract other jobs.  We would be dislocating entire communities.  The pig farming communities in our county are involved in GAA clubs and myriad other ways of supporting local communities.  The implications of this sector failing in a county like Cavan are enormous.</p> <p>  The IFA president indicated is that 50% of the market in the UK has gone but where is the other 50%?  Where is that country sourcing product to replace that from the Irish sector?  Could we double back on it at all?  The milling sector is under enormous pressure.  If that sector collapsed partially or fully, even when better days arise, there would be a major structural problem in getting the industry up and going again.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p> <p>  Will Mr. Cullinan or his colleagues explain the position of the Brexit adjustment fund?  From their professional work and involvement with Brussels they might know about the fund and who will benefit from it?  Surely a county like Cavan, on the border with Northern Ireland and hit by Brexit in myriad ways, with the possibility of losing its indigenous pig industry, is a classic case to benefit from the fund?</p> <p>  It is not popularly understood that &euro;50 million was being offered from the farming sector.  It is missed by many people in the news and that must be said again.  It was a patriotic and very reasonably structured offer.  What is the difficulty there?  Where precisely is the difficulty in implementing that loan scheme?  It seems to me that such an opportunity should be grasped immediately.  As my colleague, Senator Lombard, said, this has been done in the insurance industry and it appears a very reasonable proposition.  Where is the difficulty and why can we not do it?  Will the witnesses comment on the position of the Brexit adjustment fund?  It is right that there would be direct aid and there are stories that there shall be announcements after today's Cabinet meeting.  We support sectors in difficulty in this country.</p> <p>  Will the IFA president and his colleagues explain their comment that the markets may pick up next year?  Perhaps that could be properly understood by the Government and the people.  Surely if there is a prospect for the market improving, it would an absolute scandal and verging on criminality to allow the sector to collapse?  I was speaking with a pig farmer the other night; I regularly chat to such people as they are all my neighbours or based around me.  This pig farmer named four or five other pig farmers in the area who were in the process of going out of business.  That will affect jobs, local shops and schools etc.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  This is a crisis, and it is not being taken sufficiently seriously in the context of the parts of the country it is hitting.</p></speech>

His first point is relevant.  This is not just about 250 farmers but also the communities around them.  The Senator is correct and approximately 30% of the pigs are in his own county of Cavan. Cavan, Cork and Tipperary are the three counties that would be affected, predominantly.  There are pigs dispersed right around the country as well, however, and we should always be cognisant of jobs in rural communities.</p> <p>  The Senator asked who is displacing Irish pig meat in the UK market.  The Dutch and Danes would clearly do this.  There is price pressure across Europe.  There was a major outbreak of ASF in Germany last year.  It put pressure on the European price and they were displacing us in that market.  The Senator also asked what would happen if the milling sector collapsed.  We are here trying to ensure no industry collapses here.  We are a united sector, involving farmers, millers and processors, and we want to ensure everybody can survive.  It is why we are concerned about the funding.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the Brexit adjustment reserve and that fund must be distributed by the end of 2023.  The clock is ticking on that.  My understanding is that the only funding to which the Minister is committing now is around fishermen and where boats will be tied up.  There is a substantial amount of money.  The Senator is correct in saying we cannot get as much of our product into the UK market.  This is about diversification and we could definitely diversify some of our produce to another market.  Bord Bia and everybody else must come on board and have initiatives around that.  It is very important.</p> <p>  The Senator also made a point about the &euro;50 million stability fund.  We have been very clear and Teagasc has done the calculations.  The quantum of money we are speaking about is required.  We have a State body indicating that this is the way to do it.  I have always said that where there is a will, there is a way.  If the Government wants to find a way of doing this, it can be done.  We have been very clear coming in here.  I was part of the negotiations for a statutory levy in the past.  I have heard from the Department that this would require primary legislation but none of the Members in the Oireachtas would object to such primary legislation that would keep a sector alive in Ireland?  It is one of the reasons we have heard and these are the obstacles we are currently trying to overcome.</p> <p>  The Senator's final point concerned the potential turn in the market and I am very confident the market will improve.  We can look at what has happened globally.  There was an increase in the amount of pig meat produced across the world and there was an outbreak of ASF in Europe, particularly Germany and Poland, and there has been a massive reduction in pig production right across Europe.  That had an effect of anything up to 3% or 4%, and it might even reach 5%.  Traditionally, if we see a reduction across Europe of 1% to 2%, we can see rebalancing in the market.  We are now at the point where the industry is ready to turn and it is about getting funding to get us through the cycle.  We are coming near to the end of the cycle, which is critical.</p><p>The vice chair of the national pigs committee is here and he might want to give his perspective from the farmer's point of view.</p></speech>

It is important to note that, as drastic as it is, this is a short-term situation.  To bring it back down to farmer level, the average-sized farm in Ireland is predicted to haemorrhage &euro;500,000 this year.  For any individual farmer to be haemorrhaging this amount of money is unsustainable.  If a farmer goes under we would be looking at the loss of seven jobs on the farm and another 53 indirect jobs.  This would also lead to a loss of &euro;6.5 million in exports.  It is important to realise that farms of this size are generally sustainable.  We have all been through and come out of a hog cycle.  These are unprecedented times.  We are 30% behind where we need to be to survive in the coming months given the price of pigs.  Hopefully this will close in time.  Teagasc has predicted it will happen next year but we hope it will come a bit sooner.  To give an idea of the level of support today, we have heard about the &euro;20,000 and the &euro;70,000 packages coming to farmers.  They will just cover the losses for April and May.  We went to the Government looking for an aid package to support us for a year.  We are a long way off the mark.</p> <p>  There has been speculation about a reduction in the herd.  The farmers who phoned me earlier said that this is a non-runner.  Something that has been successful for pig farmers over the years, and a reason we have weathered many storms, is that we have been extremely efficient.  This proposal would take away one of our tools as it would leave 10% of our facilities lying idle.  These are facilities that cost &euro;1 million.  It is not sustainable.</p> <p>  I am slightly disappointed with the lack of understanding the Government has shown in respect of the whole situation.  We have failed to address the situation with the level of money that has been offered.  Trying to tie in stipulations on a reduction in production on farms is a real misunderstanding of how Irish pig farming works.</p></speech>

This is very much an evolving situation.  I am sure we will have further discussions on the packages we are hearing about in the media that will be put on the table.  No one can deny that the sector is in dire crisis.  The level of loss is unprecedented in any sector in my time.  There is a perfect storm with a price that fell due to oversupply followed by the costs of input spiralling out of control.  The sector is in severe difficulty.  It is a very important sector for the economy.  As everyone has said, it is the third most important agrifood sector.  We will examine in detail the package that was put forward by the Minister that went to Cabinet this morning.  We have media reports but we do not know exactly what is in it or what has been proposed.  This is something we will return to in the very near future.  I again thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and giving us their views on what needs to be done to save the sector.</p></speech>

This means witnesses will have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is within the parliamentary precincts.</p> <p>  We have had an outline from the IFA about the seriousness of the situation.  We have been lobbied very strongly by the pig sector for a number of weeks.  It is under serious financial hardship.  We have media speculation and statements about the package announced today and agreed at Cabinet.</p><p>The witnesses represent the industry.  What I want from them is their perspective on where they see the market going into the future.  Do you see prices recovering?  What caused the price to collapse in the first place?  How long do they think the price recovery will take?  Is a correction in supply required to bring about that price recovery?  The witnesses have serious insight into those matters.  Is there a need to secure markets as a result of Brexit?  There was reference to how much market share we have lost in the UK as a result of Brexit.  Where can we regain that ground and where are the best markets to try to regain that ground and try to get on a level footing?  That is the type of background we would like to get from Mr. Carroll, Mr. Healy and Mr. Ryan, if that is possible.</p></speech>

First, I thank the committee for inviting us to the meeting.  We are very happy to be here.  MII welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the current severe crisis facing the Irish pig meat sector.  We have strongly advocated for a Government support package in response to the sector&rsquo;s submission to the Government in recent weeks.  While acknowledging that the Government has sought to support the sector, the package brought to the Cabinet today, insofar as we are aware of the details, falls well short of current losses being incurred.  In our view, the Government will have to be open to reviewing supports as circumstances in the markets evolve.</p> <p>  MII is a trade association within IBEC.  We represent primary meat processors; we do not represent the secondary meat processing sector.  Our members&rsquo; processing facilities are located throughout rural Ireland.  The primary pig meat processors employ more than 2,000 people directly and many thousands more through linked employment.</p> <p>  The pig sector is facing an unprecedented challenge, with unsustainable losses being experienced due to a major escalation of feed costs.  Fuel price inflation is also driving on-farm costs, as well as at processing level, in terms of energy, packaging, transport and deep-sea shipping rates.  Over recent years, the sector has faced a series of challenges, including Brexit, ASF, outbreaks in the EU, the Covid-19 pandemic and a turbulent Chinese market.  In the fourth quarter of 2021 producers were already contending with rising feed costs pushing them into a loss-making position.  However, since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we have witnessed an unprecedented and rapid escalation in grain and protein prices, which has crippled the sector.  Additional shipping costs further increase feed prices in Ireland compared with those on the Continent.  These losses were well documented in the joint IFA, MII and Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA, submission to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  Based on independent Teagasc analysis, the pig production sector is currently losing &euro;15 million per month.  It is estimated that in the period of October 2021 to March 2022, pig producers will have incurred losses totalling &euro;160 million.  While this sector has always endured cyclical economic fortunes, the sector cannot withstand the level of losses it is now encountering.  Significant stabilisation and liquidity support is urgently required from the Government.</p> <p>  The sector, although concentrated in structure, is a major employer supporting some 8,000 jobs throughout rural Ireland.  It is the third largest agrifood sector after dairy and beef and contributes &euro;1.7 billion in annual output value and almost &euro;1 billion in export earnings to the economy.  It is a sector that does not benefit from CAP supports, but if it is to survive, assistance is urgently needed to get producers through this period and to maintain critical mass of the sector so it can recover and continue to contribute positively to the economy in the future, as it has done for decades.</p> <p>  From a market perspective, pig prices have been at a low cyclical level for 18 months now, due principally to the impact of ASF arriving in Germany and significant volatility in the Chinese market, which is a major global importer of pig meat.  Despite the challenging market environment, the processing industry has delivered prices to Irish producers that are well ahead of the EU average and the prices in the main EU pig producing member states over the last year.  Depressed prices were exacerbated by rising feed costs over last autumn.  Since September, the Irish pig price has been 10% above the EU average price and, overall, has been 15% ahead of the price across the seven member states that account for 80% of total EU pig meat production.  Processors have done everything possible to support their producer suppliers over this period, something which I believe is recognised by all in the sector.  This was acknowledged by Mr. Cullinan earlier.</p> <p>  The pig price in recent weeks has increased by approximately 20 cent per kilogram to 170 cent per kilogram.  Unfortunately, this does not bridge the gap between feed costs and market price.  More support is needed to help bridge this gap through an unprecedented price cost squeeze.  We believe that further improvement in market returns will come, but markets take time to adjust, especially across our export markets globally.  Processors have worked to secure price increases here on the home market with secondary processors and with retailers.  Some progress has been made, but more is needed.  However, the home market only accounts for approximately one third of overall output so we are also reliant on export markets to improve, albeit our influence there is obviously lower than on the domestic market.  While we believe that the gap between production costs and pig price, largely driven by feed costs, will close over the coming months, the scale of current losses needs urgent external support from the Government to get producers through this period.  Producers have already incurred significant losses and face more in the months ahead.  They are being forced to exit the sector because of the unprecedented hike in feed costs.  Irreparable damage will be done to a sector that is a key element of the Irish agrifood economy.</p> <p>  A comprehensive submission to the Government seeking a stabilisation fund was made in March.  This proposed a combination of direct aid from the Government or the EU and an additional element that would be repaid through a producer levy over time.  We believe that this is a progressive approach.  It needs to be acted upon now.</p> <p>  Again, I thank members of the committee for the opportunity to present here today and call for their support for the pig meat sector.</p></speech>

Will they elaborate on where they believe the market stands?  The Chairperson mentioned that.  Where do they believe the market will go in the next six or eight months?  I realise that this is a crystal-ball matter to some degree.  They might also elaborate on how efficient the pig industry is and how competent and capable it is in how it produces its product when one takes the world market into consideration and also when one takes into consideration how much it plays into the European market and how big or small an operator it is in that regard.  If one were to believe the media in the last few hours about the proposed 10% cut in our pig herd, what impact could that have on the marketplace in the future from the Irish perspective?  Will it have a significant impact on Ireland and what will it do to the impact of the oversupply in the European market, if any?</p></speech>

In terms of the role of the industry in the current crisis, is it Mr. Carroll's position that the sector cannot pay more than it is currently paying and that there is no further scope for that?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#MM00200"><p>I will go over some of the situation with the markets, and then I will ask my colleague to fill in more of the detail concerning where this aspect is impacting on the current scenario.  The first point to address is the scale of our operation relative to the European market.  The scale of operations in Ireland represents approximately 1.5% of the total value and volume of the European market.  Therefore, we are a relatively small player.  We are exporting product into markets such as the UK, about 30,000 tonnes annually, the EU, approximately 45,000 tonnes annually, and Southeast Asia, about 170,000 tonnes annually.  This means that significant volumes of exports are going outside the EU and more local markets, such as the UK.  Each of those markets, in one way or the other, has shrunk considerably over time and this has led to a substantial amount of market distortion across all these sectors.</p> <p>  Regarding the economy and efficiency of production in Ireland, when we consider the scale of prices delivered by primary meat processors in the market over the past year or thereabouts, we can see that the Irish price has been considerably ahead of the prices paid by other EU producers.  We can go into some of the details of those numbers.  The context of the scale of the operation here and the necessity of moving our product off this island and into all those markets shows there is a significant differential between the price we are paying and that of others.  Our price is ahead of what is paid by our competitors and has been for a significant period.</p> <p>  As far as the European market is concerned, the situation concerning ASF was one of the driving forces for the downturn that has occurred in recent times.  The legacy of that situation is still having a hangover effect across the European market.  Equally, the Chinese market, which, as I indicated, takes the largest proportion of the total volume of product exported from Ireland - and serving a market so far away has considerable cost implications - has essentially collapsed in respect of price.  That has been the case for European suppliers as much as it has been for Irish suppliers.  Despite all these prevailing circumstances, we are still in a position where we are leading on price.  We are a small player in a global market.  We are delivering considerable returns in the Irish market, notwithstanding the pressures which exist and the resources required to allow us to export into those markets.</p> <p>  Turning to the 10% cut mentioned by the Deputy, we must still see whether that materialises in the decisions made by the Government.  It does not make any sense to us at all in the context I mentioned, namely, that we have 1.5% of a global market.  If we reduce production in Ireland, we will simply allow pig meat to be produced elsewhere.  Ours is such a tiny proportion of that bigger market that it is easy to visualise how that much additional production would then emanate from elsewhere.  On the role of the industry in this context, I mentioned that the prices have led considerably.  We are currently 10% ahead of the EU average price and 15% ahead of the price being paid by processors in the seven or eight countries that produce or process 80% of pig meat in the EU.  That has been the response of the pig meat processing sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.412" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#MM00400"><p>We will check the current average price for the Deputy.  To clarify one point, Irish pig prices in the past 12 months have been 10% ahead of the EU average and, as Mr. Carroll said, 15% ahead of the prices paid in the eight countries that account for most pig meat production.  Our prices have been ahead in that context.  Even in the last three to four weeks, prices have jumped.  We saw a dramatic jump in the German price, which had been at &euro;1.20 per kilogram for many months.  I can tell Deputy Carthy now that the average EU price is between &euro;1.85 per kilogram to &euro;1.87 per kilogram.  Today, we are at &euro;1.70 per kilogram.  During the past 12 months, and especially since September, when feed prices were already beginning to rise, the reality has been that pig producers have been going into a loss-making situation.  Throughout that period, our price has been stronger than prices in all of Europe.  There has been a jump in the price in the past three to four weeks, and our price has gone up as well.  The Deputy asked if we see more happening in this regard.  The expectation is that all markets will have to respond to this situation and reflect the level of input cost increases, but this is not happening at the rate we would like it to.  Even in those member states where the price has jumped in recent weeks, I do not know if that is sustainable.  There has been a response, however.</p> <p>  Returning to the Chair&rsquo;s initial question concerning the markets, and perhaps we do not need to rehearse everything that has been said already, it was mentioned earlier during the discussion with the representatives of the IFA that prices were at a high globally in 2019 and into 2020.  Since then, they have been in a downward spiral globally, across the rest of the EU and here.  Two major factors have been driving this trend.  The first was the outbreak of ASF in Germany.  That had a cascade effect because the country was banned from exporting to many international markets.  Consequently, German-produced pig meat was largely confined to the European market.  This occurred at a time when production had also increased in response to the higher price being paid in the previous 12 to 18 months.  The second major factor was China becoming a disturbed and volatile market in the past two years.  Prices paid in China in March were 50% of the level they were at a year ago.  There has been a great deal of disruption in that country and that has largely led to the global fall in prices in the past 12 to 18 months.</p> <p>  Moving on to diversification, we are examining this aspect.  There was a loss of market in the UK, which was connected to Brexit, as well as to ASF, because cheaper continental product was going into the UK market.  We have probably maintained or even slightly increased our position in the EU market, while there has been significant diversification in exporting product into international markets, particularly Asian markets.  China is the main market there, but we also export product to Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines and the US.  Those are the large international markets we target.</p> <p>  The new markets we are working on and seeking access to include Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar, even though that is probably very challenging now.  Other new markets we have been working on include Mexico, which is one of the biggest pig-producing and pig-importing countries in the world.  Its market is largely dominated by imports of US pork products, but we have got access to the Mexican market.  The first consignments of our product only went there in recent months.  It is a new market, but one we hope we will see expanding.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time.  We were discussing earlier with representatives from the IFA the potential for what would essentially be a loan scheme, with funds allocated to that scheme being paid back through a levy.  Would the witnesses see the meat industry as having the capacity to put money towards such a scheme?</p></speech>

The proposal that was put to the Government, and which we are still firmly behind, was a 50:50 split between State assistance and a repayable levy.  The proposal is based on a producer levy and it is producers who would get the money from it.  Neither millers nor processors would be involved in the contribution to that.</p></speech>

Slaughter capacity was the starting point of us being made aware of the potential crisis in the pig sector.  I first became aware of the crisis when factories in the North indicated that they could not take southern stock due to labour shortages.  Has the issue of capacity been addressed in the intervening period?  I also noted commentary about the availability of departmental veterinary staff at plants affecting capacity.  Has this issue been resolved?  Can Mr. Healy say with confidence that MII's members are in a position to ensure that we have a free-flowing market that addresses these elements of the crisis?</p></speech>

Last year, there was approximately a 5% increase in processing throughput in the Republic.  The situation has been managed as best as possible.  There have been times of tightness due to labour issues, including availability.  The industry is continuing to work through those issues.  There is a constant pipeline, with pigs coming off farms every week, so the industry has to work closely with suppliers.  It is doing so.  The pig sector has increased in size over the past decade and the industry has constantly invested to ensure it is ahead of that increase.</p> <p>  I am unaware of any veterinary shortages or issues at this point in time.</p> <p>  There is capacity.  Short-term changes often pose problems.  A processor needs to invest, build up and ensure there is a market outlet.  There may have been some element of this over the past 12 months with pigs that used to go to Northern Ireland suddenly being unable to.  In an overall sense, though, we processed 5% more pigs last year, which was a considerable achievement, given the tightness in terms of labour.</p></speech>

What might the impact of that office be on the meat industry and has Mr. Healy concerns that it could lead to greater regulation of his sector?</p></speech>

We will work with the office.  We are aware of the general scheme of the Bill that has been produced.  The reality is that, for the past 12 months, Irish pig meat processors have been paying well ahead of their European counterparts.  Delivering the strongest price possible is what the industry needs to be about, and the figures show that it has been delivering ahead of the major competitors.  Regardless of whether there is another Bill, market conditions will determine that.  Our continuing development of new markets is the most important thing for the price that is delivered and the sector's viability.</p></speech>

In 2018, that figure was just short of 3.4 million, so there has not been a significant increase in recent years.  Over the past decade, there has been a good increase in productivity levels in the pig processing sector.  Much of that has been down to the work of farmers in terms of genetics and the development of their breeding and management processes.  This has given rise to a situation where they have increased the number of pigs per sow per year, which has driven the increase in productivity.  According to Teagasc's figures, there are approximately 145,000 sows.  That number has remained largely constant or even contracted a little over the past decade.  The real gain has been through breeding, management and pigs per sow per year.</p></speech>

The cost of feed is a major aspect and has placed pressure on production levels.  We would need to look into a crystal ball to know how feed price will evolve.  We hope that, through developments in this year's harvest and so on, we will see a stabilisation in feed prices and some of the volatility and uncertainty dissipating.  Due to the disruption and volatility caused by the war, feed prices are probably at a premium.  We hope to see prices standardising.  Nevertheless, Teagasc's figures suggest that, due to the cost of feed, the break-even price needs to move towards &euro;1.90 to &euro;2.  We still have a way to go in terms of the market price.  We hope to see an easing of feed prices.  The market price would have to respond.</p></speech>

It will probably come down to supply and demand.  I remember Mr. Healy being in here before when cattle prices were depressed and cattle aged over 30 months could not be taken or there had to be three movements or whatever.  We see a totally different sector now and nearly anything that stands will be taken.  Does the worldwide pig sector need to balance itself out or are there big extra numbers throughout Europe?  Mr. Carroll talked about Denmark and other places.  Is that a factor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#OO00200"><p>The chairman pointed out that annual pig meat production in Europe is over 23 million tonnes.  We produce about 300,000 tonnes in Ireland annually so we are less than 1.5% and anything we do will not influence it.  There are a number of dominant markets around the world that will dictate what happens.  China is the major importer of product and the EU is a significant global player that exported in the region of 6 million tonnes last year, which gives it a big influence.  Then there are North and South America.  We expect to see some easing in production across the EU in response to what has been a difficult price and cost situation.  There will be some response in easing production.  Production is back considerably in Germany as well and they are operating well below their normal throughput levels, which should help to stabilise matters.</p> <p>  I mentioned China and you hear talk about Japan and South Korea as well and they are still struggling with Covid and the pandemic.  Members have all heard about the new lockdowns in China in recent times and it is still causing disruption in the food service and in demand there.  It has to be expected that prices and imports in China will increase as the year progresses.  I stand to be corrected on this but I think that domestic production in China is operating below the cost of production.  Their retail pig price is 50% of where it was one year ago, as is the piglet price.  Import prices are about 30% below where they were one year ago so there has to be a level of price recovery.  They cannot continue to produce below the cost of production and hopefully the rising tide will lift all boats.  The US remains strong in its domestic demand and their price has been strong.  Some of those farmers are far less impacted by the feed cost issue we have in Europe.  The reality is we have an additional feed cost again in Ireland because we have to get the material, including the grains and protein, across.  That is an added cost in the context where we all know that transport costs are increasing dramatically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#OO00300"><p>I will make three quick points.  First, Mr. Healy mentioned prices and said we have been ahead of the European average for the past year but at the moment we are &euro;1.70 per kilogram and the European average is &euro;1.87.  Why can we not keep with the European average?  What is influencing that?</p> <p>  Second, farmers are vulnerable once the input costs go up because they are price takers.  For example, if I am feeding pigs and the pig is fat then the pig has to go but I am told the price on the day.  If I am making coffee cups and my input costs go up I will sit down and assess my input costs and put my margin on it.  I will not sell the cup unless I am given what I need to cover my costs.  With that in mind, the day has to come when the end user, the consumer, will have to carry some of the flak.  It cannot be the farmer at all times.  What kind of downward pressure are the retailers and MII's customers putting on it to maintain the current price?  What kind of contracts is MII tied into with the people it is supplying that it cannot pass on some of this to the next layer?  I know it is hard enough with inflation but the farmers should not be carrying the can for the end user and consumer.  The CAP was a cheap food policy but that day is long gone.  How come the market cannot be regulated to try to get part of what is being lost onto the product and to get the price up to where it needs to be?  Is there serious downward pressure being put on MII by the big multinational retailers?  Is MII tied into price contracts?  Why is the situation like this?  If it is a coffee cup or any product other than a farm product, the producer adds the additional costs to the end price and the customer takes it or leaves it.  I hope I explained the question I am asking correctly.  I know we are price takers and that has always been the kernel of farmer problems.  The day will have to come when someone else will have to start carrying the can.  Can MII, in its position between the two sides, influence that?  If not, why not?</p> <p>  Third, I have spoken to the IFA and they have already told us that 7% of the farmers are gone already with the potential for 20% or 30% to leave.  That is all sows that are going out of circulation and out of the system.  Can MII see a day coming when it will not be able to meet its contracts if this continues much longer?  Will the pig meat be available to fulfil the contracts MII has if the worst case scenario of 20% to 30% of the pig farmers going out of the business came about?  That would be a serious amount of sows out of production.  Could it come to a point where, irrespective of getting new markets, MII will struggle to meet the contracts it has?</p></speech>

First, Mr. Healy is saying the EU average is &euro;1.85 to &euro;1.87 per kilogram and MII is paying &euro;1.70 per kilogram.  That is my assumption and that was only &euro;1.50 up to two weeks ago.  How is it MII has been able to pay that extra 20 cent over the past couple of weeks?  Why was this not paid to pig farmers earlier when they were struggling severely at that time?  Second, as touched on by Deputy Carthy earlier, how can MII, one of the largest players in the industry, not financially contribute in any shape or form towards a bailout plan?  It is a no-brainer that it would be involved in some way.  Third, why has MII not used its position to collect a levy from the retailer to contribute towards the bailout plan?  That could be similar to the levy that is there for the IFA and it could be brought in instead of this levy being put on pig farmers.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses could answer those questions.</p></speech>

One of the things that made pig farmers fit to cope and deal with volatility was economies of scale.  If we reduce the herd by 10% would they lose those economies of scale?  On the capacity question, my understanding from some primary producers is that they were finding it hard to get their pigs processed for a good part of this year.  Did MII have problems in capacity with its staffing or whatever at different points?  If not, why am I hearing that?  I am interested in the point about the markets.  When does MII see an expansion of the markets happening and where?  Could MII put a timeframe on that?  It would seem to me to make no sense that we would not support the sector if MII and the IFA are fit to tell us that there are pending improvements and new markets.  Surely it is important to tide the sector over to reach that point.  It is important that it go out into the news that this potential is there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#OO00800"><p>I will address some of those points and my colleagues might follow on.  Senator Paul Daly talked about the average EU price and the gap with the price in Ireland and Senator Joe O'Reilly has referenced it as well.  It is just a point of timing as much as anything.  We have come through a period, as I said earlier, when the processing sector here was paying well above what any competitors were paying.</p><p>There was a support level to producers.  As I said, we have gone through the last 12 months were the Irish price paid to Irish producers was above what was being paid by our competitors.  It was above them.  Only in the past three or four weeks have prices started to rise in the EU in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.  Only in those last few weeks have they started to increase the price to producers.  That will, hopefully, drive on the European market and we will avail of that.  I am not party to all aspects of the business but the price increase in recent times was largely driven by work with the Irish market and the domestic scene with retailers domestically and secondary processors.  Much of our product goes to secondary processing.  It was, therefore, engagement and a push to increase prices through the chain that allowed for an increase.  There will be follow-on but as we said, we are not influencers of the market either in terms of our scale of production being less than 1.5% of the EU.  There is significant resistance everywhere to trying to get prices increased.  If we look at the consumer price index, CPI, figures, as I did yesterday in this context, the 12-month figures to March are still just showing a 3% increase in meat overall.  We know there have been significant increases across other sectors be it beef, lamb etc.  There have been significant price increases in terms of raw material but overall meat inflation thus far up to March of this year was only at 3%.  If I look at those figures, the pork element was even a reduction on the 12-month period.</p><p> Therefore, yes, there is much resistance to price increases.  Obviously, if we were to try to extract all of the price that is needed here now to go back to producers from the domestic market, we would see some serious inflation in the Irish markets.  We must, therefore, look at export markets and international markets.  It takes a bit more time for that rising tide to come through and deliver it.  The view is that with the inflation that has taken place in the cost of production across the board in Europe, Ireland and elsewhere, it is going to have to drive prices everywhere and then we get to benefit from an increased return from the market.</p><p> In terms of volume, various questions were asked around whether we have issues with the supply of contracts etc.  Senator Joe O'Reilly also talked about the impact of a 10% reduction in output here.  At the moment, what that 10% reduction would do is to undermine the efficiency of individual pig farms and pig units.  If somebody is trying to stay in this business, the last thing he or she wants to be doing is putting 90% less product through and adding to his or her overhead.  I think it will have an efficiency impact and it would not be something of which we are at all supportive.  As we also said at the beginning, it is completely meaningless in terms of the impact, or thinking that it will have any impact, on European or global markets.  It makes no sense.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Carroll to address Deputy Michael Collins's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-13a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#PP00200"><p>I might comment on some of the things Mr. Healy said.  Deputy Michael Collins raised the issue of the processing sector perhaps in some way contributing to paying into a levy.  In terms of the scheme that was put forward by the IFA, ourselves and the millers, first of all, that was not one of the objectives of that scheme.  What the producers wanted to do through the IFA was establish a levy that would trigger an investment by the State comparable to the value of the levy, which would be repaid over a period of 14 years and the total value of that fund, which is &euro;100 million, would be set out upfront by the Government initially with a view to having 50% of that repaid.</p> <p>  Now, given that the value of that levy would be returned to the primary producer, the core responsibility of processors in the chain right across this, and Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned this issue as well, is delivering the best possible market price.  Deputy Michael Collins referred to that in the context of the 20 cent increase that was introduced quite recently.  The same applies to that.  If we look back over the last period, say, to February 2021, given that we have 1.5% of the output at EU level, Ireland has consistently  delivered the best price over that period week after week, month after month.  Only in a very short period and narrow window in the last few weeks has that price been exceeded at European level.  What we have actually done is narrowed that gap as well.</p> <p>  Given all the complexities of trade, the additional costs we face and the fact that we do not have an internal market that has scale, and bearing in mind that for 1.5% of the EU market, 30% of that goes on the Irish market, we have very little influence on the market.  The influence we have, however, is to pressurise as much as we can to get a better return from the secondary sector and retail sector etc.  That in itself will only deliver a portion of that gap in between, however.</p> <p>  There has been a little bit of a focus in some of the discussion around that price and the price that has been paid whereas the reality, which evolved out of the discussion, is that paying a price at &euro;1.70 was a substantial price to be paid in the pig meat market until we arrived at the situation where we had a massive increase in the input cost at farm level.  That response then needs to come from the market but it will only come from the European market.  It is not going to come in a decisive way from what is delivered on the Irish market by higher value contracts from secondary processors and retailers.  It will only come from the European market.  That is beginning to be delivered but we have to see where that lands.  Mr. Healy has given the committee an indication of where that might need to land in order to meet those additional costs that primary producers are facing.</p> <p>  On the other issue around the 10% reduction, which Deputy Michael Collins may have mentioned and which Senator Joe O'Reilly certainly did, the key issues we spoke about are where it makes sense on any scale to introduce that type of reduction given the scale of operation we have at the moment with 300,000 tonnes against 23 million tonnes.  If we are not careful, we will get our industry swallowed up by the might of the European industry.  Picking up 300,000 tonnes is not significant if one is already producing 23 million tonnes.  We have to be careful that we do not reduce our competitiveness space further than the way in which it has currently been eroded by the high input prices.  Bear in mind that we cannot capture the value of that erosion in input costs from our domestic market.  That is a massive challenge.  If there is a provision in the conditionality around the fund that is now about to be announced, it cannot include that provision.  It simply makes no sense at any level at all.  All it simply does is deprive those who are producing efficiently and makes them produce inefficiently.  I do not know if there were any other questions.</p></speech>

As I said, the industry here has invested and built up its capacity as the sector and farmers have invested and increased output.  What can happen at times is that there is a short kind of almost unannounced or unexpected change in flow.  Certainly, last year and perhaps into this year, maybe not all of the pigs going to Northern Ireland were getting up there.  Largely, I think it is down to the fact there were perhaps processing issues in Northern Ireland, but their domestic production has increased and that was given priority.  As I said, the industry here had a 5% increase in slaughterings last year and will probably have 1.5% or 2% this year so it is getting through them.</p><p>There are simple things.  For example, you could have an additional bank holiday and that is a day out of production, probably involving 14,000 pigs.  Suddenly, the list of producers are back for another week.  Things like that can happen.  Short-term changes in supply can be an issue, whereas the longer-term development and growth certainly will be met by the capacity and the investment.</p></speech>

This means witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. T. J. Flanagan, the CEO of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and Mr. John O'Gorman, its dairy committee chairman.</p><p>Before I ask Mr. Flanagan to make his opening statement, I note Senator Lombard and I have been lobbied on this by individuals.  We find ourselves in a very unusual scenario where financial institutions were pressing fixed-price contracts on people, especially people who had a significant amount of liabilities with them.  The contract has serious shortcomings in that it was purely based on milk price prediction and had no prediction regarding costs.  When these contracts were first formulated there was a trigger there that would have input costs included.  That was taken out.  We can blame whoever we want but some people felt their contracts were too complicated.  I suppose they would not mind how complicated they were now if that trigger had been included in them.  From where I and others who have been lobbied on this equation standard stand, we now have a scenario where the primary producer seems to be the only one who is going bear this huge escalation of costs no-one saw coming.  The milk price is rapidly heading for 50 cent per litre and is going to go significantly the other side of it, which is going to help the dairy farmer to offset the huge increase in costs that is there in the industry currently.  However, ICOS has a significant amount of producers and I ask the representatives give us some background on this.  We are by no means here to have a bash at the society.  We are glad of the representatives coming in to give us information on it that might enable us to lobby various people to see can we get some compromise solution to the situation we are in.  How many suppliers are affected?  There are a number of co-operatives that have and some others that have not.  What is the percentage breakdown?  How many people have over a third of their milk in it?  How many have over 50% of their milk in it?  I suppose if you are under 10% or 15%, while it will be painful, the pain will probably sustainable enough but if you have a high percentage of your milk and are stuck at 32 cent per litre with costs probably going north of 40 cent it is an untenable situation.</p><p> We are appreciative of ICOS coming in to give us the background to the situation.  As I said, there are a number of people in the chain.  There is the primary producer, the processor, the person who is purchasing off the processor and then the retailer.  There are four links in the chain and unless some mechanism is found for sharing that financial pain or dividing it then it is going to be very difficult for the man who has a significant amount of his milk on a fixed-price contract to survive.  That is where we are coming from.  As I said, we have been lobbied and we felt it was better to give it an airing here and discuss it.  I hope we can then go the Minister or to the Department and see can they knock heads together to see if we can get some compromise that allows dairy farmers to get through the unenviable situation they find themselves in.</p></speech>

I reiterate co-operatives are member-owned organisations controlled by members and are in place to support them at every twist and turn.  As co-operatives we fully understand and empathise with the members who have a high percentage of their annual milk supply in fixed milk price contracts.  I wanted to reiterate that.</p> <p>  We are in an unprecedented situation with the significant input price inflation that has taken place.  The Chairman has gone through the background so I will not belabour it too much but members were looking for a volatility management tool and the only option really open to milk processing co-operatives was to have back-to-back contracts with our customers.  It was very much hanging on our ability because the co-operative itself could not take on the risk of a fixed milk price contract, so we back to back that with our customers.  As the Chairman correctly said, the early iterations of the milk price contracts had a ratchet in them linked to the major input costs at farm level, namely, fertiliser, feed and so forth, but they were removed.  Farmers did not like them as they felt they were tied to doing business with the co-operative by having them in there.  That could have been a valid argument but the co-operative did not have the wherewithal to lock down a third party from a supply point of view so we were unable to continue to facilitate them.</p> <p>  We again reiterate and reaffirm our understanding and empathy of those milk suppliers and restate that the commitment of the co-operatives and the principle of the co-operative movement is to work with and support members of the co-operative, especially those in financial hardship.  We must acknowledge the events of recent months have been unprecedented.  They were caused initially by Covid and supply-chain disruption and so forth and exacerbated by the unfortunate war in Ukraine.  Previous milk price volatility had prices at standard constituents ranging from the mid-20 cent per litre mark to the mid-30 cent per litre mark.  As the Chairman correctly said, they are now reported to be approaching the mid-40 cent mark and probably higher.  Prior to this it was not ICOS's understanding that milk suppliers would have significantly more than 20% to 30% of their milk supply tied into contracts.  Indeed, we have some member co-operatives that have milk suppliers far in excess of that range and some approaching maybe 90%.  There are not many but some milk suppliers have approaching 90% of their milk tied into milk supply contracts.  In this regard, the banks must bear significant responsibility as they are in part accountable for encouraging certain suppliers to go down this route of tying in large volumes of milk into fixed-price contracts to minimise or de-risk the farm investment.  On the basis of what we know now, it was unwise to become so heavily exposed by fixing a milk price while not having some security around inputs.</p> <p>  I am afraid the options to remedy the situation are limited.  They involve appealing to the buyers, in other words, our customers, as fixed milk price contract holders are back-to-back contracts whereby a volume of milk is matched to a volume of product.  We understand these conversations have taken place with only very limited success.  From our position the integrity of the contract is very important in principle and we have to protect our reputation as a reputable trading partner.  The only other option is for the wider milk pool to carry the cost.  It should be pointed out that the co-operatives are also losing significantly in this regard as the cost of processing milk has increased massively and the processing margin has also been eroded due to the high inflationary costs around energy and so forth.  However, co-operatives have been as creative as possible to help farmers and will continue to be, especially in the cash flow element, through their current difficulties.</p> <p>  We need to build new options into the fixed milk price scheme to deal with the risk of inflation, such as a financial transaction through the futures markets for feed, fertiliser and energy.  However, these are very complex financial instruments and are not without risk.  This is something we need to look at in future from a fixed milk price contract point of view.  This would allow farmers to lock in their input costs as well as their output prices, thereby securing a margin.  We have a very good example of this in the US.</p><p>It is something we need to examine.  The farmers lock in a fixed margin so irrespective of whether milk is 50 cent a litre or 20 cent a litre, they have their margin which moves in time with it.  It is probably a little easier in the American situation because their major inputs are bought in.  From an Irish perspective, we are fortunate and have a very strong competitive advantage in being a grass-growing region of the world.  Most of the costs of producing milk from an Irish dairy perspective are in the growing of grass, such as fertiliser.  Feed is a cost as well.  The initial scheme provided some options in this regard, but there was very limited farmer enthusiasm for it, unfortunately.</p><p> In closing, we appeal to the Oireachtas committee to prioritise the establishment of an income deferral scheme to manage volatility, along the lines of the ICOS 555 proposal.  This has been a request of ICOS and farm organisations for up to seven years.  We believe it is within the gift of the Oireachtas and the Government to deliver on this.  If we had more options on volatility, farmers could deploy a range of measures to reduce volatility rather than rely on a single measure, which was the fixed milk price scheme.  That was all that was available to them.  It was introduced by co-operatives in good faith and it has served the industry well until recent unprecedented events.</p><p> I am happy to take questions or comments on this.</p></speech>

We believe that 5% to 6% of the national milk pool is in a fixed milk price contract.  That varies from co-operative to co-operative.  Some co-operatives had caps where they only allowed a maximum of 10% take-up on each scheme of the individual's annual milk supply.  As I said, ICOS was unaware until very recently that there were member co-operatives allowing individual suppliers to go beyond that point, which was a very risky undertaking.  The closest figure we can get, and we do not have access to individual contracts between member co-operatives and suppliers, is somewhere between 5% and 6% of the national milk pool.</p></speech>

There could be 2,000 that have all sorts of volumes tied up, but in terms of those who have problem volumes, it is certainly less than 1,000.  Those are the problem volume ones.  The total volume of milk in fixed-price contracts is certainly well under 1 billion l.  Our understanding from talking to people is that it is somewhere between 450 million l and 600 million l.

In talking about that, and to get a handle on what kind of figure we are talking about, we have to know the exact volume of milk.  The volume of milk is more important than the number of suppliers because we are talking about the volume of milk.  If one could know the volume of milk that was held by suppliers who have more than 10% of their milk in a fixed price scheme, that would be helpful.  In general, people who have less than 10% might not like it but they will grin and bear it, whereas once the volumes go up it is a different scenario.</p> <p>  I am sorry for interrupting you, Senator.</p></speech>

The Chair is more than welcome to interrupt me at times.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses might explain the system all the way through.  How this works is that Ornua would forward sell a product to a supplier.  It would then purchase that from a co-operative movement or a limited company milk supplier, and it would have its fixed margin in between.  The co-operative movement or the milk supplier would then forward sell it to Ornua and get it from the milk supplier, so its fixed contract is sorted out in between.  In other words, the fixed costs are sorted out between both.  The farmer then sells it to the co-operative movement, but does not have the fixed price of inputs tied in.  The farmer's lack of fixed price is the only break in the link.  Am I correct that this is where the issue is?</p></speech>

I will describe how it works in practice.  Initially, there was a desire by members, milk suppliers of co-operatives, to have some type of volatility management tool.  The Senator will recall, and we are still in that market, that milk pricing is a very volatile business and can fluctuate hugely within a year, not to mind from year to year.  Members who were in a post-quota era found themselves going to banks and the like to finance expansion at farm level.  We are finding that these are the people who are most exposed.  They came to the co-operatives and said they needed a price volatility mechanism or tool that could help them to work on this.  The co-operatives went to their customers, be it Ornua or others, to see what price they could get from the market.  Whatever volume of product we were able to get from our customers, either second or third party, was what we were able to bring back to our members.</p> <p>  We could offer a milk pool of X to our members, which is linked into an end product price, at price Y for a three-year period, a 12-month period or whatever.  Most of them were three-year periods.  That could come back at a price where members would say, "Absolutely not; that is not a price I would engage with", or they might say, "That is a price I would be happy with".  Bear in mind that it is a variable price.  The value of the constituents goes on that, so it is a base price and then one gets one's bonuses, constituents and so forth on top of that.  Once the individual co-operative knows what volume it has to offer its members, it is then in a position to offer it.</p><p>Generally, what had happened was that the individual co-operative would indicate that there would be a maximum of 10% per supplier.  Even if there was unused amounts left over, that would not be exceeded.  However, some co-operatives may have facilitated members, as they would have seen it at the time, in exceeding that level.  They are the people most heavily exposed now.  It is a problem for-----</p></speech>

As Mr. O'Gorman was describing, at the instigation of these fixed-price contracts 11 years ago, when everybody was learning about these contracts, there was probably more demand than there was tonnage to be allowed.  These are dynamic matching exercises and it takes in a customer who wants to take out volatility and a farmer who wants to do the same.  The customer wants to pay as low a price as possible, meanwhile, and the farmer wants to get as high a price a possible.  Over a period we might come to a sweet spot and we might think our customers or our farmers would be interested and they are matched.  For a good number of years, people would have been taking up 10% on any particular scheme but some of them were three-year schemes.  There could be 10% in one scheme, 10% in another and 10% in another.  The run for the people who were in fixed-price schemes was probably in the order of a maximum of 30%.</p> <p>  Since quotas ended in 2015, we have had fairly substantial increases in milk supply and, critically, fairly substantial investment at individual farm levels.  We have probably seen farmers who are more highly leveraged than would have been traditional in the dairy sector.  We understand that substantial pressure was applied by the financial institutions on these farmers to maximise the amount of milk in fixed-price contracts.

Mr. Flanagan has said the society has no remit when it comes to regulating the industry.  There could be a scenario where a farmer might offer 100% of milk, technically.  Is there something we could do as a committee in that regard, such as putting a cap on it or dealing directly with the co-operative movement?  What do the witnesses see as the appropriate leveraging of quotas over a three-year period?</p></speech>

This is a business agreement between two partners; they are a farmer with particular priorities and interests, depending on how much money he or she has borrowed and the repayments to be made and, perhaps, another farmer who is not very heavily leveraged and is happy to ride the markets.  That is the traditional way of taking the milk cheque.  Some farmers may have wanted to de-risk, and the best offering was X price and with the support and encouragement of their banks, they jumped in as heavily as they could.</p></speech>

This is a very important tool but the integrity of this tool for selling milk will be the biggest issue for the industry in the future.  Where will these contracts go?  Is there any confidence in the industry with these contracts?  As we all know this could be an important tool if it is worked appropriately, what changes could be made?  What is the future for these fixed-price milk contracts?</p></speech>

Fixed milk price contracts in their current form are not a good idea from what we have learned, certainly over the past six months or so.  The Senator has correctly highlighted that if a farmer fixes in above a certain percentage of income, that is, the milk price, a corresponding element of costs must be locked in as well.  That is if they have a future and farmers demand them.  We should remember it has not been co-operatives forcing them on farmers but the farmers who came to co-operatives seeking an income volatility tool.  This is what we were able to provide.</p><p>If they are to have a future, a margin protection system needs to be built into it.  I am not a financial expert.</p></speech>

Over the past 11 years, until this sequence of extraordinary events happened, the sector performed well.  The prices that people achieved in fixed-price contracts over the 11 years were attractive and were worthwhile for farmers.  That is why farmers piled in on it, then issues arose that nobody could have predicted.  I would not overstate the value of a generic letter to every milk supplier.  It is much more valuable, if there are boots on the ground in every yard, for the business manager, who is dealing with the individual and who understands the problems, to try to find a solution.</p></speech>

That is a contract from a person who produces a large amount of milk.  One would imagine the co-operatives would be more responsible.  The witnesses said that 8% to 10% is tied up.  I presume the customers that do the forward buying buy more than that from the co-operatives.  How is the price of milk decided?  It was at 40 cent then went to 41 cent and so on up to 48 cent.  If they are able to move on that, what is the big deal in a time of war?  If there was no war or fertiliser crisis, with an increase of 300%, or maybe 400% for urea, what would happen?  In a war situation, governments have done things they would never have dreamed of doing before.  I am not blaming the co-operatives in all this, because there are other suppliers and Ornua and crowds like that have done deals with the co-operatives.  I hear that some of these companies make plenty of profit.  It is not always the co-operative that is the stumbling block in solving this problem.  The Chairman invited others besides the witnesses today, including Ornua.  I would like to see why they are not here and I will ask the Chairman about it later.</p> <p>  A solution needs to be found.  A limping farmer is no good for the co-operatives, for himself or herself, or whoever the co-operatives sell the products on to.  There will be a decrease of 605 million l of milk in the UK this year.  A few half-arsed attempts were made by some co-operatives, saying they would give farmers some money now and they could pay it back later.  I do not know of all of them.  The industry needs to get to grips with this.  Some of these contracts were for 31 cent or 32 cent.  Milk costs 46 cent or 47 cent and rising.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  What is the total milk production in Ireland?</p></speech>

The co-operatives have not come together in the spirit of farmers in this country at a time of war and manned up.  There are no winners here.  What will the Government do about a contract?  I am not a solicitor or barrister but it shocked me that the contract I mentioned earlier was so casual, in that it simply asked people to write down their number and their name, with a price that they would get for three years.  This issue will not just lie down.  If there was no war but fertiliser prices had increased by &euro;100 per tonne and meal prices had increased by &euro;50 per tonne, we would not be here talking with the witnesses.  We would say to take it on the chin and to take the good with the bad.  Everything goes out the door, however, when there is a war.  There should be a spirit of partnership at co-operatives and among the people that the co-operatives supply.  I understand one was invited here.  It would be nice to talk to all of them and give them a fair hearing.  This needs to be resolved.  It is a small amount of money for all the co-operatives, but it is a large amount for individual farmers that could be the making or breaking of them.  The co-operatives need to move on this.</p></speech>

This set-up is unprecedented.  In any contract, there should be an option for people who did a deal with the co-operatives to show a spirit suitable for the current situation and the war.  By mutual consent, both parties of a contract could change it.  It would be a similar scenario to me renting land for a five or six-year period and approaching someone on a lease and telling them that I was not able to fulfil my end only for that person to say that was sound and there would be no repercussions.

To be fair, the co-operatives that have the most people in this position and that have the most exposure in this position have been proactive and have announced measures.  As the Deputy says, some of them are pre-payments against next year, the year after and the year after that but so be it.  There is also some pain taken by the general population of farmers and we can only take that so far.  We cannot socialise this among all the suppliers to a large extent.  It would be unfair and unreasonable that people who did not lock in big volumes would carry this.</p></speech>

I am saying that ICOS's biggest buyer which has X amount locked in should be looking at the situation.  It would be happy days if there was no war and it would probably be buying milk at 40 cent per litre but as the goalposts move every week you have to go according to plan.  It is like cattle, sheep or anything; you have to move up if they are getting scarce or if there is big demand.  If you are able to go with the right hand to keep going up and to adjust to it then that is fine.  The witnesses are saying that only 900 of the 1,800 suppliers are locked in at higher rates.  It is putting them in danger of going out of farming to be frank about it.  That is where we need to focus.  Would Mr. Flanagan agree?</p></speech>

I want to elaborate on the point he has made because ICOS's opening statement states: &quot;It is important to clearly state, that these are agreed contracts, which unfortunately cannot be renegotiated.&quot;  That is not how contracts work.  A contract means it cannot be amended unilaterally.  Contracts are changed all the time and they are negotiated as a result of changes in positions.  If all parties to a contract agree to change it then it can be changed, whatever the case may be.  I have an article from <i>Agriland</i>from a week or two ago and this is probably an extreme case because it is a farmer who has 85% of his milk pool in fixed-price contracts.  He has 900,000 l in a milk contract and that represents 85% of his milk.  That is 33 cent per litre and the other 15% of his milk is on the open price, which is 43 cent per litre.  The difference across those prices for this gentleman is &euro;108,000.  Can the witnesses clarify who is getting that &euro;108,000?  That is what the market has valued his product at, yet it is being lost, so someone along the chain is getting it.  Who is effectively pocketing that &euro;108,000?</p></speech>

I am not sure which co-operative he is with but it is not benefiting out of it.  The co-operative would have a back-to-back contract with a customer and that customer likely has a back-to-back customer with another customer that may be using the product and the buyer of that customer, assuming it is the end user of the product, is probably on a good bonus because he or she has managed to eliminate the volatility for the company he or she is working for.  He or she is probably benefiting and his or her company is benefiting from the misfortune of that poor farmer.  It is not his milk processor and I believe, although I do not know for certain, that it is not the person or entity the co-operative would have the back-to-back contract with who is benefiting.  There are probably three or four people in that chain who are probably not making money out of that transaction at this point.</p></speech>

The first interaction I ever had with ICOS was when I was in Brussels in 2014 and the problem then was price depression and a lot of these measures became much more popular as a result of trying to protect against volatility.  The entire European milk strategy is based on the expectation that there will be periods of extreme volatility.  The one area that has been spoken about ever since then is some mechanism of a rainy day fund so that the dairy sector does not end up in a situation like the one we were talking about in the pig sector earlier.</p><p>I know that ICOS has been an advocate of that type of fund.  How do the witnesses see that working, considering that every time an emergency measure is utilised, it is always a dollar short and a day late?  How do we ensure that such measures can be utilised quickly to address anomalies?  This is an anomaly.   Someone described it as like being in a fixed-term mortgage for a number of years and then interest rates collapsing and the homeowner being caught.  Of course, the homeowner can get out of that mortgage and pay some sort of a penalty.  They can get out of it.  That option is not available for these people in this particular circumstance.  </p></speech>

That is the problem we have.  I also wish to make the point that we export 90% of our milk.  It leaves the island.  The ultimate customer or beneficiary of this, and the person who is making a product - whether it is a piece of confectionary or whatever - that is being sold around the world, is not an Irish customer.  It is an international customer.  It is being sold by Irish co-operatives through another co-operative but an international customer is the beneficiary of this.  They are somewhere in the supply chain.  We do not know whether they pocket the &euro;100,000 that the Deputy mentioned or whether they pass it on to the retailer.  To be honest, we should not over-expect the result we can get here with an international customer.  That is the problem.  While individual co-operatives and our federal co-operative have had lots of tough conversations with them, the movement thus far has been limited.  The Deputy stated that a contract can be renegotiated.  A new contract could probably be issued at a different rate but that just has not happened.  However, there is the capacity, within the Oireachtas and the Government, to put in place revenue tools that would allow farmers to equalise their milk income average out over a number of years.  We have been talking about one for the last number of years.  However, the Government, the Department of Finance and Revenue have chosen not to do that.  At every budget, we have failed to see it over the line.   It is not too late.  We could still do it, but it will not solve this problem.</p> <p>  From what we are being told by our co-operative representatives and our board, a relatively small number of people have the really critical problem.  They are being dealt with one by one.  One co-operative has amended the terms of the milk supply agreement in terms of the fixed-price scheme and has managed to increase the price on offer but most of that is coming out of the general pot.  It is coming out of the other farmers' milk cheque.  That is the reality.  The problem has been socialised.  There is no extra money to fund this.</p></speech>

If stabilisation measures for those dairy farmers were taken, would there have to be a level of parity for the dairy farmers who are not locked into these contracts, but who are also facing higher input costs?</p></speech>

I was referring to measures being brought in to stabilise it for the dairy farmers who are being discussed here and who are locked into those contracts.  Are there measures that can be brought in to level it out for farmers who are not in these contracts, but who are also facing the same higher input costs?</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  However, we are probably in a more fortunate position than the pig and poultry industries.  I am aware that the committee discussed them earlier today.  We have been very fortunate that the milk price thus far has managed to keep step with the inflation that is coming in in the production costs for those who are not in the fixed milk price contracts.  I must stress that I am referring to those who are in the variable price contracts.  The variable price has gone up somewhere in the region of 8 cent to 9 cent per litre.  The costs of producing that milk are front-loaded, and the farmer will not receive the benefit for it for a period of time.  According to a Teagasc survey released today, the costs in producing that milk have gone up by about 8 cent per litre.  While the farmer on the variable milk price contract is receiving a much enhanced milk cheque at the end of every month, equally, he has a much higher cost of production to meet at the other end.  As I have said, fortunately from a dairy industry point of view, the variable milk price guy, please God, will not be any worse off at the end of this very volatile period because milk markets have been so strong.  We are fortunate that milk markets have been so strong in that regard.  Some co-operatives have put together stability funds over a period of time.  Indeed, there was an announcement yesterday that another co-operative is going to start putting together a stability fund here.  That stability fund comes out of the milk price.  For the vast majority of co-operatives, there is only one income stream, namely, the milk processing side of the business and the margin they make from whatever trade they do with their members, from an input point of view, on the feed, the fertiliser and so forth.  I certainly would not have the mandate from my milk suppliers to bail out those who find themselves in trouble individually.  It is something that I can bring back to my board and there can be discussion on it, but I certainly could not say that I have a mandate to do that at the moment.</p></speech>

Certainly, that is the case from the anecdotes that we have heard.  The farmers that have been talking to us and those we have met through farmer organisations are people who have expanded fairly substantially.  They were quite heavily leveraged and were put under fairly significant pressure by the banks to de-risk the lending.  I think it is probably unfair that the banks are not in here to be part of the solution as well, given that they drove the adoption of these schemes.  My understanding is that the biggest concern for the farmers who are unfortunately caught in this cost price squeeze at the moment is bank repayments.  Certainly, the banks can be part of the solution as well.</p></speech>

ICOS also supported a rainy day fund or stabilisation measures to address the problems that farmers have in this situation.  It has also said that successive governments have failed to act, which is disappointing.  Does the ICOS have any proposals on how the rainy day fund would work?</p></speech>

Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022041300002#WW01000"><p>We put our name to a scheme six or seven years ago that was called 555.  The idea was that a farmer, in agreement with his co-operative, could effectively defer up to 5% of his milk income in any particular year in a five-year rotating cycle.  At the end of the five years, the money would have to be drawn down and tax paid in full across that period.  We felt that that would allow farmers to leave a little bit of the money behind and build up some sort of a fund in good years that could then be used in leaner years.  Certainly, given the cycles that were coming at the time, we felt five years was a reasonable period.  In any case, the money would have to be drawn down and the tax paid on it.  Again, it will not solve this problem today, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.  If the scheme had been in place for the last number of years, there would have been less dependence on fixed milk price schemes, certainly to the extent that the people who jumped on them did so.  It is not too late.  Something of this nature - and all the farm organisations have been looking for them - should still be supported in the budget process.  It would reduce our dependence on fixed-price schemes.</p></speech>

There should be some sort of a tax system to work with that that could help the farmer.</p><p>To put it simply, you will go through hills and hollows in order to get to a level playing field.  I agree with that 100%.  I do not agree with has been said about the banks for one simple reason.  Above all men, I am no fan of them, given some of the stuff I saw happening, but the reason I say this is because a business plan had to be done if somebody was getting into milk.  It was based on 28 cent a litre for someone borrowing fairly heavily.  When the banks saw that 31 cent or 32 cent was guaranteed, they knew this person was fairly sound.  To be frank about it, they had to do it to get the money but, as Mr. O'Gorman has pointed out, the cost of producing the milk has gone up by at least 8 cent and it is probably 10 cent or 12 cent more than what it was then, especially with the price of meal and everything else.  If it is okay with the Vice Chairman, I am going to write to the committee to propose that at the next private meeting, we bring in the people who are buying the biggest volume of milk from the co-operatives.  That is still a part of the whole system in Ireland.  We must find a solution to this for the farmers.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.</p></speech>
