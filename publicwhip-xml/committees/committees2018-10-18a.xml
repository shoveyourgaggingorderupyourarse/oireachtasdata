He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We will hold over the minutes until the next meeting and matters arising.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category, category A, deals with the opening statements and briefing documents from today's meeting.  No. 1648 A and No. 1660 comprise correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 15 October and 17 October 2018, providing briefing information and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1655 A is correspondence received from Dr. Graham Love, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, dated 16 October, providing an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that and deal with it in the afternoon.  No. 1656 A is correspondence received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 16 October 2018, providing an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that and deal with it in the afternoon.</p></speech>

A couple of people who are looking for a copy of that.  Are we now free to give that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#A00500"><p>Yes.  We have agreed to publish it.  We have not come to it but we will in a moment.  It is in the correspondence list.  I do not think that was the one list.  We will deal with it in a moment.</p> <p>  The next category is B - correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  A number of items were held over from last week's meeting.  We will continue to hold them over until we get an opportunity to read them.  When we have read them all in detail, we will be able to move through them very quickly when the time comes.  I am holding over all the items of correspondence previously held over.  I read it out on a second occasion the last time so I will move on to the newer items of correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1620 B is correspondence received from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 8 October 2018, providing the following information requested by the committee: additional information relating to cash holdings in NAMA, the impact of negative interest rates, and an update relating to the case before the courts regarding the IBRC liquidation.  In respect of the special liquidation of IBRC, the Department is defending the proceedings and confirms that a comprehensive defence to these proceedings will be filed within two weeks.  We want to verify that this happens when the time comes.  The other item concerned negative interest rates.  The Department did not specifically deal with it.  It spoke about early access to dividends but the point is covered.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 1622 B is correspondence received from Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 9 October 2018, providing information requested by the committee regarding Thalidomide litigation and the number of outstanding cases.  We can note and publish this.  We should also note that at the meeting of 12 July 2018, correspondence from the Irish Thalidomide Association was considered and there may have been a suggestion that Mr Breen's evidence was not accurate.  In his letter, Mr. Breen states that his evidence was accurate.  If further clarification is required, we will be able to deal with it when we engage with the State Claims Agency at our meeting on 8 November.  I note that in the letter he sent to us, he did not receive a copy of the letter we received from the Irish Thalidomide Association and, essentially, was replying in the dark, so we want to send it on to the agency.</p><p>I am informed that due to the wonderful data protection legislation and so on because that correspondence was marked &quot;Private and Confidential&quot;, we need to get permission from the Irish Thalidomide Association to forward it to the State Claims Agency.  I presume that was their assumption when they sent it to us but it seems we must verify that consent.  That letter was dated 12 July.  We need to get it to the State Claims Agency as urgently as possible if they give consent and if they do not, we can do no more about it.  I expect that they will but I make the point that we must follow the process.<br/><br/>The next correspondence is No. 1630 from Ms Mary Lawlor, NAMA, dated 10 October 2018, providing the information requested by the committee at a previous meeting.  One was a breakdown of the 8,000 units directly funded by NAMA categorised according to occupancy status, social-affordable and private housing developments.  That relates to 8,113 houses.  We asked for a note on the sale of houses to Cerberus that were then sold back to the Housing Agency.  They have given a comprehensive reply saying that it was done on market valuations; there is a note on the meeting between NAMA and officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government held in May 2018 in relation to the development of a new housing project, which we note; and a note on the 7,000 units offered to local authorities including a breakdown by local authority and the reasons given for taking up the units available.  That is a matter that has been ventilated on many occasions.  <br/><br/>Two items in the letter are of particular interest.  The most important question we asked related to note 5.  We asked for the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying asset with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located, namely what country they are from.  They said they were not in a position to answer and would reply in due course.  We must mark that as &quot;Urgent&quot; and follow it up.  The next item we must follow up is one of the primary items for which we wrote to NAMA, namely Project Nantes.  Was it an off-market loan sale?  NAMA says: </p><blockquote>The loan sale was one constituent part of the board-approved higher refinancing target which was set for the debtor connection.<br /><br />Having set the target, NAMA did not specify how it was to be achieved.  Therefore, provided Avestus met or exceeded the board approved target, it was free to adopt a variety of monetisation strategies, including the sale of the secured properties and/or a refinancing of the loans.</blockquote><p>We asked why was there no publicity following the loan sale, from either Avestus or Clairvue-Nantes.</p><blockquote>The refinancing target and exit strategy agreed with Avestus was a confidential arrangement between the debtor and NAMA.</blockquote><p>We asked whether NAMA could confirm the portfolio was sold for &euro;26.6 million, with a par value of &euro;352 million.  This was one of the fundamental questions asked at that meeting.  The response is: </p><blockquote>NAMA confirms that the residual portfolio was sold for &euro;26.6 million, with a par value of &euro;352 million.  The cash realised by the loan sale was only one constituent part of the overall cash amount received from the acquired Avestus loan and security realisations.  The total amount of cash received by NAMA from the overall debtors&rsquo; acquired loans was a multiple of the residual loan sale.</blockquote><p>NAMA has not given the answer to the question we asked, full stop.  We must go back.  The main issue is that we asked about that specifically and are none the wiser about the par value of the &euro;352 million and the total realisation that was achieved on that.  More worrying, we asked for a note on review of section 172 declaration, which relates to there being no conflict of interest between the people involved, in respect of Project Nantes.  The letter states: &quot;NAMA is undertaking a legal review and will revert to the Committee in due course.&quot;  We found it extraordinary that it had never done a detailed examination on that.  It is something that the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted in the past.  All those items must be sent back to NAMA.  There may be further correspondence on this but we want all those items to be followed up.  The last ones to which we did not get a reply are very significant.  Some are on their way but we need comprehensive replies.  NAMA is nearly approaching the end of its work and we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, want to do our job by ensuring all those questions as answered and followed up.  <br/><br/>No. 1631 B is from Mr. Michael Nolan, CEO, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, dated 10 October 2018 providing information requested by the committee in respect of excess toll payments.  We will note and publish this.  <br/><br/>No. 1633 B is from Mr. Mick Long, director of corporate services, Office of Public Works, dated 11 October 2018 providing information requested by the committee for our meeting last week.  We discussed this at the meeting of 11 October and we are formally noting it today.  <br/><br/>No. 1634 is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 October 2018 providing the note requested by the committee regarding implementation of change in the Irish Prison Service, which we will note and publish this.  Much of that might be relevant to the justice committee.  <br/><br/>No. 1635 B is also from Mr Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 October 2018 in relation to the site acquisition for three new Garda stations in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Sligo and Cork, which we note and publish.<br/><br/>No.1636 B is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 11 October 2018 providing the review requested by the Committee on the resourcing of the Tax Appeals Commission.  There has been some progress on that and the Minister referred to it in his budget speech.  It is out there and there has been an agreement in relation to resourcing of that organisation.  We note and publish that. <br/><br/>No.1637 B from Ms Ann-Marie Walsh, Office of Public Works, dated 11 October 2018 providing the managing valuer's report on five historic cases on foot of a preceding submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We discussed this at the meeting of 10 October and we are formally noting it today.  We are only noting it and have not agreed to publish this yet.  We may well do so but cannot give parliamentary privilege to something which we have not taken a few minutes to look at.  I have no objection in principle but there is quite a lot in it and we can agree to publish it the next day, if members wish.  However, as Chairman, I must glance through it and other members have not read it in case there is an issue about which we should be concerned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#B00300"><p>We will hold it over for discussion at the next meeting.  We have noted it, we did have some discussion on it, but the question we must deal with next week is whether we give parliamentary privilege to publishing the full document.</p> <p>  No. 1638 B from Mr. Martin Bourke, assistant secretary, Office of Public Works, comprising a property services agreement regarding accommodation for the Department of Health at Miesian Plaza in Baggot Street, Dublin.  We discussed this at the meeting last week and we are formally noting it today.  </p> <p>  No. 1640 B is from Mr. Timothy Owens, chief executive, Cork ETB, who is replying to our further request for information regarding their employment policies and whether they have a policy preventing people with whom they have reached a legal settlement.  Mr. Owens says that there is no general policy and that the matter being referred to was discussed at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2015.  I will ask the clerk to the committee to circulate this to members, indicating the relevant pages.  We can give the committee a report on what was said at the previous meeting.  We do not want to rehash the same matter.</p></speech>

It is not a policy, yet it is a policy in exceptional circumstances.  He has offered that he would outline those exceptional circumstances and I, for one, would like to know what they are.</p></speech>

It is the usual attitude of when it suits us, we will do it, and when it does not, we will not.  That is a bad precedent.</p></speech>

It is on the record, and we will circulate it to members during the week and return to it.  If we are unhappy with his response, we will take it from there.  Let us just read the detailed response that he gave to the previous committee.  Some of it might answer some of the questions, or some might not, but we need to go through it.  We will hold this correspondence over and deal completely with it next week.</p><p> The next item is No. 1641B from Ms Martina Bulman, private secretary to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing an update requested by the committee on the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the University of Limerick, UL, and Institute of Technology Sligo .  It is expected to be published in the coming weeks.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p></speech>

Also, what are those reports are about, roughly?  That would be helpful for us for today's meeting so that we do not deal with issues to which we are going to come back?  Are there two separate reports, one for Sligo IT and one for UL, or is it a joint report?</p></speech>

The letter is essentially saying that it will be next year before the review is completed.  I will put the letter up on the screen in order that we can see what it says.  He stated there are a number of legal issues that are almost completed and the Department hopes to have this work completed by the first quarter of 2019, so he is saying the end of March.  He also says that he is still waiting for an update on the audit of empty beds in public hospitals and he will revert again when he receives that information.  We need to mark down that this is only a holding reply.  We will note and publish that holding reply.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1643B from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe from the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 12 October 2018 responding to information requested by the committee on bringing the 78 appeals mentioned in previous correspondence to conclusion.

There were three cases listed in a document that we got the last time with the Tax Appeals Commission with amounts totalling &euro;361 million that were in dispute and we asked for a note on each of the three cases.  The first case has an amount of &euro;138 million under appeal.  The commission says that it is on hold for the next few months as parties are currently in discussions with a view to settling that issue.  There is another case involving &euro;119 million and the commission is saying that it is ready to be scheduled for a hearing shortly.  There is a third case with a value of over &euro;100 million which the commission says is proceeding through the appeals system.  There are three cases adding up to &euro;361 million.  Before we come to our periodic report we will need an update on those three cases.  We cannot have a situation of &euro;361 million from three organisations hanging out there without the Committee of Public Accounts taking action.  We deal with expenditure but we also want to make sure that taxes are collected properly and we want to make sure that is done as expeditiously as possible.</p> <p>  Then we asked for figures for the cases where the amount is between &euro;10 million and &euro;100 million and there are 14 of those.  One case is proceeding with a value of &euro;68 million.  Four more are on hold as the parties are in discussions and they have a combined value of &euro;100 million.  There are six other cases scheduled for hearings with a collective value of &euro;140 million.  There is a case on hold pending a linked appeal worth &euro;20 million, another case with determination expected to be completed by the end of this year worth &euro;12 million and a case that has been settled for &euro;11 million.  I do not know the outcome of that as the commission just says that it was settled.</p> <p>  It was horrific for me to see that there are 17 cases there involving well over &euro;700 million, only one of them has been settled since we raised it and one of them is expected to be completed this year.  The letter is actually telling us that 15 of the 17, which approximately amount to the total of &euro;700 million, will run into next year at least without even giving a suggestion of a closing date.  There are 61 other cases with a value of an average of &euro;2.5 million apiece still in the system and only a handful of those have been settled.  We will want a timeline on these every second month because we will not sit here with &euro;876 million hanging there without a date even being proffered for when it might be dealt with.</p></speech>

That is the responsibility of Revenue as much as the Tax Appeals Commission because it is a sizable amount and anyone who has worked in accounts will know that if tax is not presented, then there is an ongoing dialogue with Revenue.  That astonishes me but we may be losing sight of some of the cases that in the overall context seem fairly small but in most of our experiences they amount to quite large amounts of money also.  Anything that is in the region of &euro;1 million for example is quite a large bill to be outstanding.  I have not gone through this in the kind of detail I want to and I know that money was allocated in the budget in response to the inadequacy in the commission's staffing and IT systems etc. and some time will be needed for that to settle in.  The timing in terms of the value we get in having the commission back in again will be important.  We must allow it to get its systems in place.  It will probably be the beginning of next year before we are likely to have the commission here in any kind of fruitful way but we should have the Revenue Commissioners in at the same time.</p></speech>

We have a duty to ensure we do that, especially now that resources have been allocated to do the job.  We only highlighted the top 67 in our meeting and there are thousands more smaller cases behind in the system, but the 67 cases are where the big money is.  I stress that these are estimates, not final determinations, but they are the best estimates we have at this point in time.</p></speech>

Having said that, there are still 17 cases under appeal to the value of &euro;711 million.  I hear what the Chair is saying about getting a bimonthly update on whether the cases have been settled because it is essentially a dispute on the amount but I want to get under the bonnet of this to see what is the substance of it and what is the nature of these disputes.  One side is obviously saying it does not believe it is liable for the amount of tax in question and Revenue is saying it is but it is a question of what type of issues lead to this scenario.  The reality is, especially when this amount of money is at stake, that these are individuals who have the ability to employ tax specialists and other people who can get the type of write-downs that most individuals could not get.  While it might all be legal and carried out in terms of tax avoidance there could still be consequences for the taxpayer in it and if there are loopholes there that we need to be aware of, that would also be important.  I appreciate the point on staffing because it is important for the commission to do its work but I am more concerned about the number of individuals in question and the amount of money under dispute and whether this is an example of very wealthy individuals simply looking for every possibility to avoid paying their taxes.  I am not saying that is the case but I am concerned about that.</p></speech>

We will ask for a recasting of the schedules because they have the information.  It would be very useful for us.  It would simplify the matter and it make it easier for the public to understand if they got it in that way.  We will write seeking a recasting of the schedule in the manner we have just requested.

When the representatives of the Tax Appeals Commission were before the committee, we had never heard a set of witnesses willing to offer the woes of their office as much as they did.  I suppose that is why the Minister for Finance determined that the matter would be subject to a whole paragraph in the budget speech.  When one sees the amounts of moneys subject to appeals and the resources available, one realises this definitely needs further examination.  I am glad it is being raised today.  Beyond getting an appraisal and a spreadsheet of what we have today and beyond what Deputy Cullinane referred to, we are talking about a sum under appeal in the region of &euro;750 million.  How far is the Chairman going to press this?  He talked about asking for deadlines.  Can we ask for deadlines in terms of how the settlements are arrived at?</p></speech>

The &euro;750 million is in the context of approximately &euro;60 billion collected by the Revenue Commissioners every year.  Out of the &euro;60 billion, we are talking about less than &euro;1 billion, which is probably much less than 2%.  I am not making light of it but putting it in the context of what the Revenue Commissioners do.  I am putting the figure in the context of the overall figure but the organisation should have a target timeline for it.  It might not meet the target but if it has no targets for dealing with it, I would be very worried.</p></speech>

This should be pursued.</p></speech>

It will be followed up.  We will return to it specifically when we recast the schedule.  We will ask for target dates for having the matter concluded.  That may not happen because every one of the people affected can go to court at the end of the process, if they like.  That is not within anyone's control.</p> <p>  We found a lacuna in the information between the Tax Appeals Commissioner and the Revenue Commissioners.  We asked the Revenue Commissioners, when its representatives were in, about cases that went to the Tax Appeals Commission and the collection rate in that regard.  Neither of them completed what was sought.  The Revenue Commissioners say they just get told by the Tax Appeals Commission what the figure is, and there is no match-up regarding the original Revenue Commissioners estimate.  We have found another lacuna.  Am I right that there was a gap?</p></speech>

The Council has made provision for payments of &euro;196,000 due in relation to grants awarded in 2017 under an arts programme.  The Council had provided funding for these grants to an outside agency, now in liquidation, but the agency had not paid over the grants to the intended beneficiaries.</blockquote></speech>

I wonder if it is weaknesses or failures.  I am sure there are basic requirements or controls that any organisation should have in place.  I do not accept that the term "weaknesses" suggests that the controls are not there.  In many ways, the controls are there but they were not adhered to.  If I am reading this report right, it is quite extraordinary that the Arts Council gave to a third party &euro;196,000 that was intended for beneficiaries in grants that they never received because the company in question went bust.  It is quite extraordinary to say the least.  I am aware that the overall budget for the Arts Council is &euro;67 million but we all know that there is not a huge amount of money available in any event for the beneficiaries of these grants, or the organisations that need the money and which run on very tight budgets.  Is it the case that these organisations just did not get the money?  Was replacement money given to them or are they left high and dry?</p></speech>

Surely that is why the Arts Council is there in the first instance.  I do not understand why one would give &euro;196,000 to a third party to distribute money to grant recipients.  If it is a private organisation, it would make money off the back of it.  That strikes me as somewhat bizarre.</p></speech>

I do not have the details but I can read the section from the statement on internal financial control, which is on page 60 of the Arts Council Annual Report 2017:</p><blockquote>The Arts Council paid one of the organisations recurrent grant funding of &euro;225,000, funding for exhibition support of &euro;25,000 and &euro;170,000 to fund an arts programme administered on behalf of the Arts Council.<br /><br />In March 2018, the Arts Council became aware that the organisation had not in fact paid the 2017 grants to the intended beneficiaries.  The organisation went into liquidation shortly afterwards.<br /><br />Following legal advice, the Arts Council has undertaken to honour all payments due.  The Arts Council has estimated that a total of &euro;196,000 is due to intended beneficiaries including some amounts in relation to previous years.  The 2017 financial statements recognise a provision for the full amount due.  The Arts Council has no realistic prospect of recovering these amounts from the grant funded entity, now in liquidation.<br /><br />In general, the Arts Council prefunds organisations in advance of expenditure being incurred, and has the sanction of the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do so.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s control processes include advancing of funding to organisations in tranches and verification processes to obtain assurance that conditions have been met before the next tranche is advanced.  However, the full amount of funding for the arts programme was advanced to this organisation in one tranche in January 2017, and before the 2016 financial statements were received.  The Arts Council plans to review its controls over funding to outside organisations in particular where funding is provided in one tranche.  It also plans to review its processes for assessing the financial viability of grant funded organisations.</blockquote></speech>

Are there other situations where the Arts Council repeats this kind of exercise?  I can see the weakness between 2016 and 2017 where the funds were paid before they had received the accounts so they would not have known they were in trouble.  That is a very obvious weakness but does the Arts Council also do this with other organisations or other exhibitions and so on?</p></speech>

This situation was a little unusual in that it was a very niche area of the arts - I believe it was film-making - and, obviously, there was some discretion.  A scheme was put in place and it was felt that these individuals were best placed to process the applications within the framework set for the scheme.</p></speech>

When we get the name, we will take it from there.  We want to deal specifically with this issue.  The statement that has been read out indicates that the Arts Council is putting procedures in place, but I consider that somewhat woolly.  I would like to know what it has done in terms of checking the audits of every other organisation.  Given that Mr. McCarthy referred to that in the context of the council's financial statement, we will ask for evidence that it has carried through on its commitment.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular stating that the exception was to be advance funding, and that exception could only be where there were adequate controls in place.  Effectively, many organisations do not have working capital.  They are completely dependent on grant funding and, therefore, they cannot act without being funded in advance.  That is why the Arts Council has sanction to fund most of those organisations in advance.  What one then needs to be doing is funding as one goes, rather than funding in a single tranche.  That is a learning point.</p></speech>

It is not unusual for a Department to advance funding to organisations to get them up and running.  For example, we are all familiar with community employment schemes.  They run for a year.  They get funding for the first few months and then they get a payment every month and coming to the end of the scheme they must be audited and then they can be rolled over once that is done.  They get funding to get them up and running but the funding for the full year is not given upfront.  Funding for a month or two is given and then monthly payments are made thereafter.</p></speech>

We note that as well.</p> <p>  We will proceed quickly.  The next item is the work programme.  Today's programme is in front of us.  Next week, we will be dealing with matters relating to housing.  On 8 November, we will be dealing with the State Claims Agency in the context of cervical cancer and thalidomide.  I want to raise with the State Claims Agency the issue of medical negligence, which is significant.  We will write to the agency in advance seeking a breakdown.  It will surprise members to learn that the biggest bill facing the State is &euro;2 billion in connection with medical negligence.  Not enough attention has been paid to prevention.  If we had a fraction of that money for the health service, we would not be in our current position.  It is outrageous that there is so much medical negligence.  I want to get a report in advance, as soon as is practicable, and we will return back to the issue on every case it has listed with a potential claim for &euro;1 million.  I will start at that amount and I will not go below it.</p> <p>  I want to get a breakdown similar to that which we obtained from the Tax Appeals Commission in respect of cases that are in different bands, for example, between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million and how many are between &euro;5 million and &euro;10 million.  In particular, I want to know the number of cases where the same professional is involved.  We need to know if a medical professional has eight or ten medical negligence cases in the system and if he or she he is still carrying out medical procedures.  The public needs to know.  We cannot have people making mistakes on a regular basis, particularly with cases piling up.  I do not suggest that is happening, but I do not know.  I need a breakdown of the sum of the &euro;2 billion relating to medical negligence.  We will start to examine it.  We will get the first schedule of figures and see where it takes us.  We have a duty to put better measures in place to prevent a recurrence of cases of medical negligence.  I know there are systems in place for the notification of each event but the amount is going up by &euro;300 million every year, in addition to what has already been paid out in the past.  It would be fantastic if the health service had even half of that money.  This is an issue we have discussed in a global sense but we could do a useful service by getting some specific information.</p></speech>

Certain hospitals are frequently mentioned.  It is not just about the very large amount of money that would be available to the health service.  We rarely hear people coming out of the Four Courts stating that the money was any kind of compensation for what happened.  There is a human cost as well and the money gives us a tracker for that.</p> <p>  On a different point concerning the work programme, could we put broadband on the programme?  I think it is at the bottom of the list but I do not think it is slotted in.  Perhaps I missed that.</p></speech>

Essentially, there was provision within the contract to do that.  The information was in one of the Sunday newspapers.  Another entity that was interested in tendering for that contract was BT Ireland.  The contract was rolled over and, eventually, it was purchased by the State under the infrastructure fund.  It would have been more valuable by virtue of the fact that it was rolled over so we probably paid substantially more.  We are likely to have paid substantially more relatively recently and we need to understand why the contract was rolled over.</p></speech>

The cost now stands at &euro;421 million.  In one year, it doubled to &euro;300 million and the allocation in the budget is &euro;121 million so this payment alone is practically &euro;500 million.  This is one thing we want adequate time to discuss.</p> <p>  I welcome the Chairman's approach to teasing out the position regarding medical negligence.  Open disclosure is not operating.  We cannot look at one without examining the other.  I do not know how many independent reviews and assessments have been carried prior to any medical negligence case.  I have intimate details of one review.</p></speech>

That was just one review.  We can see the cost of those independent reviews before matters ever get to court.  If one leaves aside the internal reviews, one then looks at the different type of external reviews.  There are reviews whereby people can be cross-examined or questioned and the reviews - with which, unfortunately, I am now familiar - whereby there is no examination but there is an independent examination involving outside consultants and nurses.  There are all sorts of questions regarding whether those reviews are actually independent, not to mention the cost and value for money, before we ever get there.  I am just highlighting that because I will return to this matter.  I am in the process of asking questions about the actual cost.  At no point do I see any of the institutions learning.  I see that we are snowed under with governance and with various items of documentation but the actual learning is missing.  That is how we end up with medical negligence cases and barristers making money.  I see why fees are so high because at no stage in that process do I see learning happening.  I see us being snowed under with all sorts of documentation but no learning taking place.  This even ties into Charleton tribunal going back to individuals learning-----</p></speech>

It would be timely for us to look at that matter.  I would also be interested in hearing the Comptroller and Auditor General's view of the wisdom behind renewing the contract, selling it and then buying it back.  I think that is an issue.  I am also interested in whether we would have a role in respect of the entire procurement section of the Department dealing with the contracts and tendering.  It might be a useful exchange if people felt the time was there.</p> <p>  In respect of medical negligence, at previous meetings I have raised the fact that when we pay out with or without admission of liability.  There is no mandatory follow-up training or monitoring, it is just a case of "On we go".  This is not to impugn the members of the medical profession involved.  As a matter of form and practice, there should be a mandatory process regardless of whether the person is squeaky clean and in the best possible position under the sun or is negligent.  That would happen in any other walk of life.  It is something we have mentioned here previously for which we should push.</p></speech>

We will also be dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2017 report, specifically chapter 2, collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer; chapter 3, control of funding for voted public services; and chapter 5, vote accounting and budget management.  We will also be dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report, specifically chapter 6, on budget management, and his special reports 95, 99 and 100 on financial reporting in the public service for the years 2014 to 2016.  We have been dealing with these reports on an ongoing basis and there is nothing particularly new in them but we have not formally discussed them with the Department.  On that point, the Committee of Public Accounts, as a result of those earlier reports, decided towards the end of last year to write individually to each of the 300 or so organisations that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ask them to meet their timelines.  We have brought representatives of the education sector before the committee at length.  Of the 17 ETBs, only one was meeting reasonable timelines for producing financial statements, whereas on this occasion every single one of the 17 has done so, so there has been a significant improvement in the preparation of accounts by public bodies over the past year or two with the help of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Comptroller and Auditor General and ourselves.  Perhaps we will ask Mr. Watt to give a short overview at the end of his comments on the issue that while it is fine getting the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and getting them audited, there is then regularly what would appear to be another delay before they are laid before the Oireachtas.  I think they have to go to Ministers and so on.  The next thing we will want is a mechanism to see whether that end of the process can be speeded up.  It is the next chapter, but Mr. Watt understands the question I am raising.</p><p>As today's schedule is very busy, dealing with all these accounts, and there is so much to be covered, the opening statement will understandably be that little bit longer than normal.  We are joined by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General and Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. David Feeney, chief operations officer, Mr. John Pender of the pubic service pay and pensions division and Ms Helen Codd of the corporate support unit.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and all those in the Public Gallery to turn all mobile phones to airplane mode as merely putting them on silent is not adequate and can interfere with the recording system.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of Standing Order 186, which provides that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of a Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  We expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour.  Witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will now take the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#H00200"><p>The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 11, Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, records gross expenditure of almost &euro;53 million.  This was an increase of &euro;9.8 million, or 23%, on the prior year, due in large part to additional spending of &euro;7.4 million by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  At the end of 2017, the Department had underspent by &euro;2 million relative to its budget.  Unspent capital funding of &euro;685,000 was carried forward to 2018.  The remaining &euro;1.3 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  The surrender at the end of 2016 was &euro;2.5 million.  I issued clear audit opinions on both the 2017 and 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 11.</p> <p>  Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, is used to pay pensions to civil servants and prison officers.</p><p>Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other Votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2017 amounted to &euro;535.5 million.  This represented an increase of 7% from 2016.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;202.5 million in 2017, which was up 28% from 2016.  The increase was mainly due to increased employee contributions in respect of the single public service pension scheme.  The net result was a surrender at the year end of &euro;33.5 million in respect of 2017, and of &euro;50.8 million in respect of 2016.  I issued clear audit opinions in relation to the 2017 and 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 12.</p><p> Chapter 2 of my annual report deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular in December 2016 requiring certain State bodies to make employer pension contributions to the Exchequer in respect of public sector employees pensionable under the single public service pension scheme, which commenced on 1 January 2013.  As of 14 September 2018, only 14 bodies had made employer contributions, totalling &euro;4.35 million.  The Department had not yet completed the work required to identify all the bodies that will be required to make contributions.  Because the contributions are payable with effect from 1 January 2013, at least five years&rsquo; contributions will become payable.  This may impact on the cash flow of each entity concerned and on charges for the services they provide.</p><p> Members will be aware that the Constitution and legislation set out the framework underpinning the manner in which funds are appropriated for voted public services.  The appropriation system in Ireland differs from that in other jurisdictions in that the passing of appropriation legislation is generally taken very late in the year, usually in December.  As a result, an unexpected dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later in the year could have two serious outcomes, unless agreement can be reached on the emergency passing of an Appropriation Bill.  First, appropriations in the financial year would not legally be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  Second, spending on supply services in the following year could not proceed, creating a risk to the continuity of voted services.  In my function as controller of issues of funding from the Central Fund, I want formally to draw the attention of the Oireachtas to this risk.</p><p> Vote accounting and budget management is a standard report that consolidates and summarises expenditure across all of the Votes.  It highlights key variances relative to estimates and demonstrates medium to long-term trends in key Vote issues.  The 2017 chapter also outlines the limited guidance provided by the current financial reporting framework regarding the accounting for capital assets in the appropriation accounts.  These weaknesses are expected to be addressed in the comprehensive review of the accounting framework being undertaken in the context of developing the financial shared services model for Departments and offices.</p><p> I refer to the special reports on financial reporting in the public sector.  As members are aware, timely preparation and presentation of audited financial statements is a key element of public accountability and in providing effective oversight.  The three special reports before the committee today reflect a strategic focus by my office to drive greater timeliness of public sector financial reporting.  I will focus my opening remarks on the most recent report, special report No. 100, which deals primarily with financial statements for periods ending in 2016.  For that year of account, I had responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of 287 bodies and funds with an aggregate turnover of &euro;218 billion.</p><p> Most public bodies should be able to prepare financial statements for audit within two to three months of the end of the relevant accounting period.  All Government Departments and offices produce their appropriation accounts by the end of March, as required by law.  Half of the other public bodies produced their 2016 financial statements within three months of the year end.  This represents a progressive improvement since the 2014 year of account.  Significant progress has been made in completing audits early.  My office gives priority to higher value accounts and this is reflected in the graphic provided, which shows that 97% of the turnover subject to audit had been completed by the end of September 2017.  This represents two thirds of the number of 2016 financial statements.  Government Departments are generally required to present the audited financial statements of the public sector bodies for which they are responsible to the Oireachtas within three months of audit certification.  Of the 2016 financial statements that had been certified and were due for presentation as of April 2018, some 80% had been presented on time.  Arising from a recommendation in special report No. 95, Government Departments are now required to report in their appropriation accounts on the presentation to the Oireachtas of audited financial statements of the bodies and funds for which they are responsible.  An example of this can be seen at the back of Vote 11 for 2017.  This should increase the monitoring by Government Departments of the production of audited financial statements by the bodies under their aegis.</p><p> At the end of 2017, there were 13 sets of financial statements that had not yet been certified, representing a significant improvement since the end of 2015 when there were 25 sets of financial statements in arrears.  All but two of the 13 arrears at the end of 2017 have now been certified.  The university sector, which previously had a high incidence of arrears, has shown significant improvements in timeliness of financial reporting.  The significant organisational change that the education and training board, ETB, sector underwent from July 2013 was a contributory factor to delays in the presentation of audited financial statements.  However, as the Chairman has mentioned, much progress has been made in relation to the timely presentation of ETB accounts for audit, and achieving earlier completion of audits of ETBs.</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, the agenda covers a number of chapters from various reports for 2016 and 2017; the appropriation accounts 2016 and 2017 for Votes 11 and 12; and special reports Nos. 95, 99 and 100.  In the interests of time I will take the opening part of my statement as read because it basically says how brilliant the Department is and I know the committee shares that view anyway.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#J01900"><p>I will skip ahead to the section that specifically deals with reports which is from page 6 of the written statement.</p> <p>  I will give a brief overview of some items on the agenda and the first relates to chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and chapter 5 of the 2017 report on Vote accounting and budget management.  In respect of 2016, gross voted current expenditure amounted to &euro;51.8 billion.  This was &euro;100 million, or 0.2%, under profile and &euro;900 million, or 1.8%, up on the 2015 figure.  Gross voted capital expenditure was &euro;4.2 billion and this was &euro;200 million, or 6.2%, ahead of profile and &euro;500 million, or 12.9%, up on the 2015 figure.  The higher level of capital expenditure - the outturn figure for that year - was signalled in the mid-year expenditure report and related mainly to road repairs in response to the 2016 floods which members will remember and faster than expected progress on the schools building programme, so those related to conscious Government decisions to increase spending during the year.</p> <p>  In respect of 2017, gross voted expenditure was &euro;58.5 billion.  This was &euro;480 million, or 0.8%, higher than the gross expenditure allocation set out in the 2017 revised estimates volume.  This increase was expected as it was accommodated within the further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates agreed by the Oireachtas in December.</p><p>The additional expenditure arose mainly from policy decisions relating to the provision of domestic water services.</p><p> The Revised Estimates for 2018 provided for total gross voted expenditure of &euro;61.8 billion, a further increase of 5.5% on the 2017 outturn.  On budget day last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, announced additional allocations for 2018 mainly relating to health, housing, education and justice.  If we take these adjustments into account, along with the provision of a 100% Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients, the revised allocation for 2018 amounts to &euro;62.8 billion.  Of this, some &euro;56.9 billion relates to current expenditure and the balance of &euro;5.9 billion relates to capital expenditure.</p><p> We can see the progress this year.  Total gross voted expenditure at end-September is &euro;44.9 billion.  Of this, &euro;41.6 billion relates to current expenditure.  This is ahead of profile by &euro;265 million and is up &euro;2.5 billion or 6.3% on the same period in 2017.  Capital expenditure to the end of the third quarter amounts to &euro;3.3 billion, which is &euro;253 million or 7.2% below profile and &euro;756 million or 30% above the same period in 2017.  This reflects the significant increase in the allocations for capital spending in 2018, a trend we have seen since 2015.</p><p> The second item on the agenda concerns Vote 11 relating to the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016.  I will address the Department's 2017 Vote as well.  The Estimate for 2016 was &euro;43.7 million, a 7.7% increase on 2015.  As has been mentioned already, this was driven mainly by the need for additional resources for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Structural Funds technical support and assistance for regional assemblies and the Special EU Programmes Body.  The increase was also due to the creation of new subheads for the funding of pensions of bodies under the aegis of the Department, Civil Service learning and development and support for the implementation of the Protected Disclosures Act.  There has been an increase in spending above average under Vote 11 reflecting the consolidation of functions that were previously undertaken by other Departments and that are now undertaken centrally.  This reflects Civil Service renewal and public sector reform in the area of information technology.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned the significant resources that are going to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  One of those projects is SharePoint, which involves the implementation of a suite of electronic systems, including electronic parliamentary questions, e-submissions and e-records.  This will apply by the end of next year to 36,000 civil servants across all the Departments and bodies.  In effect it is being delivered centrally by the office.  It involves considerable developmental software work that previously would have been undertaken by Departments but has now been consolidated centrally.  It reflects our view that it is better to have the expertise and capacity centrally based.  It is more effective, in particular in respect of smaller offices and Departments that would not have well-developed information technology systems.  One theme in the Vote over the years has been this consolidation.  The same argument applies to learning and development.  More and more learning and development is being done centrally though shared services because of the belief that we get better value for money and better quality services if we do it centrally.  The audited surplus to surrender for 2016 was &euro;2.5 million and arose for a number of reasons, as set out in the briefing supplied.</p><p> The Estimate for 2017 was &euro;53.1 million.  This increase was driven mainly by the need for additional resources for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and administrative pay.  The increase was also due to the creation of new subheads for the Public Service Pay Commission, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  The work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service involves the recruitment of economists at different levels who come to the service but who spend an initial period with our Department and are subject to a specific training programme.  The paybill and training costs during the earlier period of their careers is drawn from the Vote of our Department.  Then, people within the service are sent out to other Departments to do their work across the system.  Again, that explains a large element of the increase in spending.  The audited surplus to surrender in respect of 2017 was &euro;1.3 million and arose for a number of reasons, as set out in the briefing supplied.</p><p> Vote 12 relates to superannuation and retired allowances.  The net outturn for 2016 was &euro;341.1 million, compared to an estimate of &euro;391.9 million.  This gives a surplus to surrender of &euro;50.8 million.  This arose mainly because of underspending on established lump sums and greater-than-expected receipts from the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  As we have debated at this committee previously, estimating the lump sums for any given year is difficult and problematic.  It fluctuates significantly and thus is a challenge for us to estimate.  The large variability in the Vote relates to the lump sum element.  Hopefully, we will have a better handle in respect of the receipts in future.</p><p> In 2017, the net outturn was &euro;332.9 million, compared to an estimate of &euro;366.4 million.  This gives a surplus to surrender to the Exchequer of &euro;33 .5 million, which arose for similar reasons to those I outlined for 2016.</p><p> Chapter 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2017 report deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer.  The 2012 legislation underpinning the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme provides that certain self-financing public bodies may be required to make employer contributions for their staff members who are in the single scheme.  A review and engagement with the bodies to which this is likely to apply is ongoing in my Department and will be completed by the end of this year.  On foot of the review I expect that 25 to 30 mainly self-financing bodies will be deemed eligible for employer contributions.  Since the Comptroller and Auditor General completed the analysis set out in this chapter, two additional bodies have remitted employer contributions.  The current position is that 16 bodies are submitting employer contributions, with &euro;5. 7 million remitted to date.  Any back-money or money that is owing will be remitted to the Exchequer in due course when we establish the exact position.  Any bodies that did not make the full remittance in time will make good to the Exchequer in due course.</p><p> Chapter 3 of the 2017 report deals with the control of funding for voted public services.  Given that the legal appropriation of funds for supply services generally occurs late in the year, the chapter highlights the potential risks to the approval of the estimates arising from a failure to enact the appropriations legislation by year end.  In considering this matter, it is important to note the constitutional requirement that legislation to give effect to the financial resolutions of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must be enacted within the same year.  The Constitution also requires that the Appropriation Bill schedule is based on the timing of approval by the D&aacute;il of Supplementary Estimates for the year, thus ensuring that all Estimates voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are reflected in the relevant Appropriation Bill.  Mindful of the risk, as identified, relating to the enactment of Appropriation Bill at the end of the year, officials in my Department ensure that there is clear and constant communication with the Whip's Office on the timeline for publication of the Bill.  They provide all relevant briefing in a timely manner, including for the Business Committee.  This is a risk we are very much aware of.  It has never happened that we did not enact the Appropriation Bill, and for good reason because we would not then be in a position to spend any money from 1 January, including the salaries and so on of everyone who has to vote on the Bill.  We know that when it comes to it, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann always finds the time.  In effect, the State would fail to function because we would not be able to invoke the 80% rule.</p></speech>

It happened in 2010.  Committee members may recall that period when an election was pending.  The budget was introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan.  A majority in the D&aacute;il decided to support the enactment of the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill quickly to clear the decks so that the budget could be implemented in advance of the election.  During that time the Appropriation Bill was taken quickly in the Houses and enacted.  Supplementary Estimates were taken and the Bill was voted upon and enacted quickly.  Again, there was a situation whereby if the D&aacute;il had been dissolved before the Bill was enacted, we would not have been in a position to invoke the 80% rule for 2011.</p></speech>

I hope we will pass it in the next four to six weeks.  That means, before the individual Votes for 2019 are voted upon by the committee, we can invoke the 80% rule.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can sanction the Minister for Finance giving credit to the Central Bank to issue, through the supply accounts, the requisite accounts to keep the Votes funded and to keep the State in business.</p></speech>

I refer to special reports 95, 99 and 100 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on financial statements for the years ending 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The reports review the timeliness of public sector financial reporting for those years, identify bodies where delays occurred and summarise the issues brought to attention in the audit reports.  The general trend in the timeliness of the financial reports for audit has been positive, as has been stated.  For 2016, all appropriation accounts were produced by the required deadline of three months.  For other accounts, 50% of bodies submitted their 2016 financial statements for audit within three months of the end of their accounting period, compared with 40% of bodies in 2015 and only one third of public sector bodies in 2014.  There has been a significant improvement in the timeliness of presentation of audited financial statements to the Oireachtas.  Over 80% of 2016 financial statements were presented on time, compared with 70% for 2015 and less than 60% for 2014.  As Mr. McCarthy mentioned, we hope there will be an improvement this year.  Furthermore, the number of accounts in arrears, which are accounts not certified by the end of the year following the year of account, at the end of 2017 was almost halved compared with the end of 2015.</p> <p>  Special Report 95 recommends that my Department consider requiring Departments to include an annexe in their appropriation accounts reporting on the presentation of audited financial statements to the Oireachtas by bodies under their aegis.  I informed the committee last year that I accepted this recommendation, and it was included as a requirement for the 2017 appropriation accounts.  That requirement, along with the issue being highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the committee and the Department following on from the recommendations has led to some improvement.  However, as always with this type of issue, we must remain vigilant.  It does not apply to Departments, which produce their accounts after quarter 1 and are audited appropriately and so forth.  Rather, it relates to bodies outside of central government and that is where the issues have arisen in the past.  We must be vigilant to ensure that Accounting Officers understand their responsibilities and continue to deliver.  The key issue for us is to keep the pressure on and keep reminding those responsible that they have obligations relating to accounts being prepared, audited and presented in a timely fashion.</p> <p>  Certain issues relating to the presentation of accounts should be considered.  Some accounts have to be approved by a Minister or go to the Government and we should consider whether that is necessary.  That is something at which we must look because sometimes it is not an issue for the Government, which just notes the annual report and the accounts, but there may be a backlog in terms of Government business.  We should seek to streamline that to ensure that the percentage gets above the 80% for which we are aiming.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight some key recent outputs that testify to the impact and breadth of the Department's activities some of which I have mentioned.  Since we established the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which is a key part of the work of the Department, we have published over 200 papers in order to better inform Government decision making on how public money is spent.  Since its launch in September 2017 the new learning and development centre, OneLearning, has had over 10,500 attendances at training courses across 44 Civil Service organisations and 23 counties.  Over 500 candidates have completed the graduate development programme since 2015 and an additional 200 candidates recently commenced the current programme.  Since March 2017, almost 13,000 Civil Service managers have attended the managing people and performance training programmes.  Over 2.75 million elements of data were collected from 21,000 civil servants during the 2017 employee engagement survey, the results of which were published by the Department last March.  The high-speed government cloud network has been rolled out to almost 500 locations nationwide.  Seventeen Departments and seven agencies are now connected to OGCIO's build to share applications platform which I mentioned and 35,000 staff have access to the platform.  Over 8,200 high-quality data sets are now available via Ireland's open data portal.  We are among the top administrations in Europe in terms of the availability of open data.  I set out these highlights to try to put in context the amount of money spent within the Vote because sometimes we do not focus enough on the outputs.  Ultimately, we provide services across the large Civil Service system , encompassing many Departments and offices.</p> <p>  I wish to pay tribute to the staff of the Department for their hard work and the contribution they have made to what we have achieved.  Delivering on the wide remit of our mission requires our employees to have a broad range of skills and perspectives.  I am personally invested in ensuring that our people are equipped with the necessary aptitude and expertise to meet the Department's objectives and to fulfil their own career potential.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that earlier this year the Department won best learning and development organisation in the medium category at the Irish Institute of Training and Development's 2018 awards.  I thank the Chairman and members for their time.</p></speech>

Exchanges at the committee are often robust and adversarial, particularly when I am involved, but I wish to say that Mr. Watt and his team do a very good job.  That is probably not stated often enough by me or the committee.</p> <p>  On the accounts generally, Mr. Watt alluded to the fact that it looks good that the Department returns money every year.  For the benefit of those watching, is the Department budgeting incorrectly or is it particularly efficient and producing surpluses which it is able to return?  The amounts of money in question are not huge, namely, &euro;4 million, &euro;2.5 million and approximately &euro;1 million over the past three years.</p></speech>

In our case, we had planned to expand a number of programmes but were not able to do so as quickly as hoped.  As the Deputy is aware because we have discussed this many times, there are difficulties in recruiting the right staff and trying to meet deadlines, particularly relating to new projects, especially on the IT side.  Many of the underspends relate to IT.  We have ramped up the spend and that involves the recruitment of people and the use of expertise in order to deliver on the build to share programme.  However, we were not able to get people on board as quickly as we had hoped, particularly in regard to the OGCIO and the learning and development shared services project which I mentioned.  We may have been overly optimistic in regard to delivery of these programmes.  It is a budgeting challenge rather than an indicator of particular efficiency on our part.</p></speech>

It concerns ICT and the provision of the technical expertise we require to modernise the office.</p></speech>

More and more services are in the cloud which Mr. Lowry and his team support.  They provide the service on behalf of the entire public service.  The one development that always springs to mind is the "build to share" application, the application of the common e-platforms across the Civil Service.  These are massive IT transformation projects.  In the past - colleagues on this side of the table will certainly recall this - we could have had 50,000 to 60,000 parliamentary questions in a year.  People used to run around carrying pink folders and changes to replies to parliamentary questions would have been made on the hard copy.  For instance, the administrative officer would have written a draft reply which would have been changed by the assistant principal officer and then the principal officer.  It would eventually have reached the Minister.  It is now all done in an e-system, where changes can be tracked.  It is done efficiently and quickly.  Replies are emailed to the Minister's office and copied to me.  That is one example where we use e-submissions and e-records systems.  In effect, the amount of paper kept within Departments is collapsing as more and more things are being filed electronically, apart from legal documents, deeds and so forth.  It will lead to significant improvement in retrieval costs.  When there is an inquiry, an investigation or a review, when the retrieval of documents is always an issue and a challenge, particularly where there are manual systems, the process will be greatly facilitated when, by the end of next year, the vast majority of Departments have this e-records system.  Mr. Lowry's team is involved in the roll-out of these big software and development changes.</p></speech>

If someone is working as an officer in Department "X" and using these systems and moves to a new Department, he or she will have familiarity with all of these ICT suites.  From day one he or she will be effective and able to deal with them.</p></speech>

It was a significant reform.  Previously, those on sick leave were on full pay for six months and half pay for six months.  That has been changed to three months and three months.  There is also a critical illness protocol, whereby those suffering from various critical illnesses are treated in a different category.  On behalf of garda&iacute;, the GRA challenged this reform.  It went through various iterations of the courts' system.  We ultimately won the case, but there were issues about the way in which it had been handled and so forth.  We were not awarded costs and were disappointed with that outcome.  I do not believe we have yet received the final adjudication on costs yet.  The matter it is still outstanding.</p></speech>

We were not happy with the outcome, but that is the nature of it.  We were happy that we had won the case as it was a very important principle that we were establishing on the nature of the sick leave scheme, but it looks as if we will have to pay our own costs.  It is worth mentioning to the Deputy that the level of absenteeism within the Civil Service was a significant issue and that this change has brought about significant savings, of multiples of the cost of the legal case.</p></speech>

There are people with repeat absences on a Monday.  If we see a pattern, it is investigated by HR.  There is always a balance to be struck with persons who are genuinely ill.  Like all good employers, we want to be compassionate.  Where someone is genuinely ill, he or she receives all of the support possible to help him or her to get back on his or her feet and return to work.  When it come to persons, for whom there is a pattern of repeat absences because they just do not fancy working on a particular day, it is something we do not tolerate.  There were times when a blind eye would have been turned to this, when HR was not sufficiently well developed to work with managers, but now we are pressing ahead with a much more interventionist and activist approach when it comes to repeat absences.  It is an issue.</p></speech>

I certainly read transcripts about a conversation.  We have done a review.  The legislation was enacted a few years ago and we have done a review.  The Government has asked a group to look at the implementation of it.  We are not suggesting, at this stage, any legislative changes, but we are looking at the guidelines because there is a question about whether they are being implemented uniformly.  Do people understand what their obligations are?  Do we have enough trained people?  A lot of it has to do with having trained people.  Through the Office of Government Procurement, we have a programme where we are actually investing to make sure people have it.  When it comes to allegations that are made, it is complex and there are different stories.  People have to be trained, have to be professional and diligent about it, and go through it in a professional and thorough way.  When it comes to disclosures, it is that question about whether Departments or offices know exactly what their responsibilities are and if they have the people with the capacity to follow the legislation.</p></speech>

I will leave that one now.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt mentioned the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  In recent weeks we have examined the OPW over a mistake that was made in the calculation of measurement versus the agreed amount on Miesian Plaza and it is costing the State effectively &euro;344,000 a year for 25 years.  The Secretary General, or commissioner as we would more commonly refer to him, felt that was absolutely not a matter for disciplinary action or any disciplinary process within the Department.  He said the OPW would feel partly responsible but not completely responsible.  The absence of tangible sanction is something that has come up in the two years I have been a member of this committee.  Last week I made the comparison with such a mistake being made in the private sector.  I used Jones Lang LaSalle, picking a name out of the sky.  I think Mr. Watt would agree that someone might last the rest of the day but would be unlikely to last the rest the week.

Mr. Watt can certainly answer that.</p><p>On property-related matters, I am interested in hearing Mr. Watt's view on the sale and acquisition of the former Harold's Cross greyhound stadium, which was the subject of a Committee of Public Accounts meeting in May last.  At that time, my crude valuation was probably within a couple of million of the valuation done by Savills, the existence of which we were informed of at that meeting, yet the State paid &euro;23 million for the site.  I described that at the time as "kiting", which is paying one overdraft off with another.  If it was a bailout of a State agency so be it, but we need to tell the people this rather than try to dress up as value for money the purchase of a property for &euro;23 million which was worth only &euro;12 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#O00200"><p>On the professionalisation of the Civil Service, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was established in 2011.  Since 2012, when we commenced the development of the Civil Service renewal programme, a significant focus has been on professionalisation of the Civil Service.  It is a fair critique of the service that over the previous 15 or 20 years it has moved from a professional service to a generalist service.  We need generalist civil servants because they have a professional capacity as administrators but alongside this we need professionals in the area of accountancy, economics, auditing, tax and actuaries.  There are many staff in the Department with specialised capacity but we need to continue to build up this expertise.  </p> <p>  On human resources, professional HR is critical.  I find astounding the notion that one could run an organisation of scale that involves people without people with professional qualifications in human resources.  The same applies in regard to audit, accountancy and financial and economic services.  If one wants to build a bridge one employs an engineer to do it because an engineer would do the best job.  This philosophy needs to be within our system.  We are professionalising very significantly.  Increasingly, the recruitment we do is for specific tasks and activities.  Any agency, particularly agencies that are involved in delivering for citizens, for example, IT projects or buildings, must have the expertise because it is a specific function.</p> <p>  On the Harold's Cross site - I am aware that the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills will be before the committee this afternoon - it would not be acceptable for any transaction to be organised in a way to bail out another body.  The valuation should be the valuation.  What the Department of Education and Skills pays has to be based on a valuation that is provided by the relevant body or authority.  It cannot be that one part of the State - I am sure the Secretary General will confirm this - decides to buy a site, the implication of which is to reduce the debts of another.</p></speech>

The valuation of a piece of land depends on its current use and prospective use based on the rezoning of the land.  It is never clear-cut.  If one has a field that is worth &euro;10,000 per acre but if one has it rezoned, it becomes worth a lot more.  There is a broader issue in regard to land which is arising given what we do in terms of the Land Development Agency, namely, the State buying land at development prices which are artificially inflated by the fact that we have an approach to servicing rezoning land, which artificially increases the price.  There is a wider issue here which we are grappling with in the context of the Land Development Agency.</p></speech>

On page 9 of his opening statement there are three paragraphs on the single public service pension scheme.  As I said, the legislation came into force in 2013 and a circular was issued in 2016, yet we are only being told today that the number of bodies is 16 rather than the 14 mentioned in the chapter.

When we looked at this issue, it jumped out that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had to give permission for the lease.  It seems it was a formality, but there are guidelines, or even stronger language, in circular about the making of a robust business case that looks at all of the options.  It seems to the members of the committee that all of the options were not looked at, including purchase or others.  Perhaps the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should look at how it gave the thumbs up to a lease that involved incurring extra expenditure without the making of a robust business case.</p></speech>

On achieving value for money and tendering, it is very often the case that our energy is focused on non-compliance in procurement.  An issue in the education and training boards has been drawn to my attention.  I still call them vocational education committees.  The framework from the Office of Government Procurement includes the rules that apply in seeking tenders from trainers to provide courses for the various VECs.  How does Mr. Watt judge the value for money achieved in that instance?  How was it assessed?</p></speech>

Without knowing the details, I presume that if one is procuring a trainer to provide a particular course or module, experience and previous references, including about capacity and so on, are investigated, and that the cost per day is considered.</p></speech>

I am looking specifically at procuring trainers to provide various courses in a situation where there is a framework in place.  I am being told that it is costing much more and that people on the ground with experience have seen costs go up by 100% in some cases as a result of the new framework.  There is less competition and fewer courses, but prices have gone up.  How does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform assess value for money when such a framework is introduced and people on the ground are saying it is now much more expensive.</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement would also be interested in receiving them because they operate procurement contracts to achieve the best possible value for the taxpayer.  If it looks as if the framework is not delivering, we will be happy to look at the matter.  As I do not know the details, I cannot comment on it.</p></speech>

For some services, there is a very clear matrix.  Other services are more heterogenous and it is very hard to have comparators across different areas or between different time periods.  The Office of Government Procure tries to establish benchmarks and a matrix.  It then considers whether we are getting value for money.  It was established to consolidate and professionalise the procurement process because of concerns raised repeatedly by successive Comptrollers and Auditors General.</p></speech>

My final question relates back to this lovely document, which is very helpful in the context of the information it provides regarding value for money and renting buildings as opposed to purchasing or constructing them.  The document in question is one of the Department's 200 papers.  It states that there are a number of areas worthy of further research and refers to "an assessment of the balance between capital and current expenditure (long term value for money of construction/acquisition ... versus leased options)".  This is crucial in the context of the astronomical rents people are paying and the fact that the Government is i l&aacute;r an aonaigh.  It is in the middle of the fair, actively increasing the prices in conjunction with the policy.  I do not expect Mr. Watt to comment on policy - that is my comment on it.  Is there not an urgency to look at getting value for money in terms of leasing, purchasing or building?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the business case for Foras na Gaeilge recommended not leasing.  The business case in respect of the Miesian Plaza was not sufficiently robust.  When will the Department conduct the further research?  Has such research been commissioned?  Given the expenditure involved, is it value for money to continue renting at astronomical prices?

I will try and keep them short and I would appreciate short replies.</p> <p>  On financial reporting for audit, the Department gave different figures for different years in terms of time compliance.  It has been improving but there is no reason it should not be 100%.  How did the Department bring about the improvements?  Are there sanctions?  Is a carrot-and-stick approach being employed?  What approach is the Department taking to those that fall outside the time limits with which they should comply?  Is it the same organisations that are repeat offenders or is there a mixture?  What is the profile in that regard?</p></speech>

A variety of issues in this regard are listed in various reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There was a change of structure, from VECs to ETBs.  The Deputy will be aware of all that history.  That impacted upon their ability to prepare their accounts on time.  As for how convinced one is of those arguments, I will leave it there.</p> <p>  The issue is that compliance has improved because it has been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee, and we followed it up through various actions and circulars.  We published Circular 25/2017: Requirements for Appropriation Accounts 2017, which puts an onus on Departments to set out why particular bodies may not have complied with timeframes.

Let me give an example from the Office of Public Works, which came before the committee last week to discuss its Vote.  The OPW has four different bases of accounting for land and buildings.  There is valuation, there is a question of revaluation, there is carrying them at historic cost and so on.  Wherever an organisation has capital assets, in particular buildings, on its statement of financial position, it is left to each Accounting Officer to determine how the building will be valued.  There is no single view by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  It probably reflects historical developments and the very considerable diversity in the nature of the assets, such as courthouses, schools, prisons, office buildings, heritage properties and so on.  It is complicated and it will take a piece of work to get an acceptable and consistent framework.</p></speech>

If we move to a fully integrated balance sheet, that is, a full accrual system, it would be particularly important that we would have very clear rules in terms of valuations of assets and the depreciation of those assets because the depreciation item will become a significant issue.  This comes back to the question that Deputy Connolly asked about capital versus leases.  The cost of a lease is very clear and transparent on our accounts because the cash goes out, but the capital asset, the value and treatment of the asset and who pays for the asset is treated differently because it is cash.  That is the reason there is a challenge within public accounting, which has not moved fully to accrual accounting, when it comes to how we manage assets.</p></speech>

There was a sizeable public landbank, but I do not know whether this land was located in suitable locations.  Location would have an impact in that building on it would probably be cheaper than buying it, given that the price of land would have had an impact on the cost.  Has the Department given consideration in detail to that issue?  It seems that we are spending an absolute fortune on leases.  Last week we discussed the lease of a building for the Department of Health, which was a case in point.</p></speech>

If it is accounted for, it is all general Government spending in year one as opposed to being spread over 20 years.  The suggestion I was making is that this does not apply in all cases.

I will now deal with the open data portal.  We are into a new regime with freedom of information, FOI, requests and such things that will be heavily used.  I use it myself.  If one gets a whole throughput of things on a particular data set, does that influence what is put on the open data portal?</p></speech>

In fact, the number of FOI requests has increased since we amended the Act.  It has led to an increase of more than 40% in the number of FOI requests and last year we had 37,000 FOI requests, so it has not reduced the number.  Part of the motivation for us is to be more out there when it comes to the availability of data and putting them on websites.</p><p>We put nearly everything up on our website.  We just put it up there.  We hoped that would reduce the volume of freedom of information requests but it has not.  The philosophy since 2012 is to be much more open and transparent around publication.  We now publish pretty much everything.  There are a whole variety of administrative data which are available for the first time and we have an enormous level of activity on the site with people downloading the data sets.  It is an important innovation.  It was guided by the wish to reduce the volume of FOI requests, which are administratively time-consuming, and for people to go to the website to access the data themselves.</p></speech>

An issue has arisen as we move from a purely paper-based system to one which is paper-based and electronic and then on to a system which will ultimately be almost entirely electronic.  We are between the latter two stages now.  More and more records are electronic rather than on paper.  The position in the past was that if one got an electronic record, one printed it off and put it on a file which would go to the archives.  In future, everything will be recorded electronically.  Any physical copy will be scanned to become an electronic record and the physical copy will be destroyed, unless it is a legal document such as a deed.  We are working with the archivist on this and we have a very significant project linked to the build-to-share matter I spoke about earlier where all record-keeping will be electronic record-keeping.  We will no longer have paper records in Government Departments.  However, there is a danger.  We are very conscious in moving from paper records now of the need to ensure the electronic records are kept for future generations.  There is a danger there, which other countries are also facing.  As such, we are working with the National Archives on this.</p></speech>

In effect, it is an electronic filing system whereas in the past one would have had a paper file.  One now has an electronic filing system so that rather than being printed off, photocopied and put in a file, electronic files are dragged across.  If the Deputy and I were corresponding about a leasing issue, for example, there would previously have been a folder containing that correspondence whereas it is now an electronic record and all emails and letters are dragged across into the file which is kept.  If people look at the issue in future, the archivist will provide them with a memory stick rather than having us hand over volumes of paper.  That is how it will work.  The savings are enormous and it will be a good deal easier for future historians looking at our deliberations to search files and track what went on in however many years' time.</p></speech>

If there is any repetition, Mr. Watt might say so.</p> <p>  My first point is a bit repetitious but I wanted to make an observation as well as to put a question.  In his summary in the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General said two thirds of bodies produced their audited accounts and that those accounts covered 97% of the value of the turnover audited.  Obviously, 97% is high on the face of it and is very good.  The difficulty is when one looks at the amount of money.  My calculation is that 100% would be &euro;218 billion.  If 3% is not audited, that is &euro;6 billion which is not audited as it should be.  Does Mr. Watt accept that it is a great deal of money?  While he said 97% may be as good as we are going to get it, I do not think he intended it in that way.</p></speech>

To clarify, the number I referred to was 99.6% by the end of 2017.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says that 99.6% of the total turnover was audited within 12 months of the end of the year.  It is a lot of numbers.</p></speech>

What I was saying was that 99.6% of the amount was audited by the end of the year, which is not a bad result.  However, 100% of it should be done within the next few months.  My point was that it is very hard to get 100% within 12 months given the vastness of the system.  However, the Deputy is right to say that every cent should be audited.</p></speech>

I accept that and am not being churlish about it.  I accept that it is very good.  Looking at some of the sectors, the HSE, for example, is an area the committee has put a spotlight on in the past.

I know Mr. Watt has discussed the third level education bodies and education and training boards.  We have focused on that area ourselves and the HEA and the Department will be here today.  Why are they slower or simply slow to present accounts?  Does Mr. Watt have a view as to why that is the case?</p></speech>

Their performance was not acceptable and it has improved considerably, in fairness to them, since the position was first outlined in the 2014 report.

Whether it is valid, it is history now.  The point is that the situation has improved.</p></speech>

There was, obviously, a problem in the past.  I think the problem arises, and we see this in other areas, from the fact that third level institutions are not entirely funded from the Exchequer.  They have, obviously, scholarship money, or they have got research funding, or they have got students' fees, so they are not as dependent on the Exchequer.  Some of the bodies would have 40% or 50% of their funding coming from the Exchequer.  It is very different from a public body like ours that is 100% funded from the Exchequer.</p> <p>  I do not know if the Deputy was here when I was asked about this, but it would be inconceivable that a Department would not have its accounts prepared for the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of March, going into Easter.  I could not imagine a situation where that would arise.  I guess a different culture arose or different practices arose which are not acceptable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts were spot on to identify it, and we supported it.  We have been pushing it as well and we have been saying to people-----</p></speech>

When we discover issues and when we see improvements, we must acknowledge the improvements that have been made, and we have acknowledged those.  There has been a huge improvement in the health area, which is good.  While we have seen improvements in the education sector, it has not been what we want, perhaps, which is in the presentation of accounts.</p> <p>  An area where we still see recurring problems, and it is in almost in half of the audit on subsets of health, HSE and education spending, is in adherence to procurement rules and non-compliance in terms of procurement.  We spoke about a carrot and stick approach in terms of the presentation of accounts.  There does not seem to be much stick, as far as I can see, in cases of non-compliance with procurement rules by any public bodies.  Does Mr. Watt think that it is acceptable for us, almost year in and year out, when we get the audited opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General, to get a lack of adherence to and non-compliance with procurement rules?  The matter is raised repeatedly and the Comptroller and Auditor General raises it, yet there has been no real improvement of any substance, as far as I can see.  Perhaps there has been an improvement in some areas but the problem continues to arise.  Does Mr. Watt see that as acceptable behaviour?  If not, given that the matter is under his remit, what focus has he put on this area?</p></speech>

Departments have to comply with the Circular 40/02 requirement, where if the process is not gone through, it must be explained.  Since 2012, we have established the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, whose job it is to professionalise this function and ensure greater compliance.  In areas for which the OGP has responsibility, and it works with Departments and offices, there is 100% compliance with the rules.</p> <p>  If services are routinely procured without a competitive process, that is unacceptable.  If a service is provided by company X to a public body for ten years and it has not gone through a competitive process, that is not acceptable.  There needs to be a competitive process.  We have been arguing consistently about the need for people to co-operate with the OGP and to work with it.</p></speech>

That is one element.  I do not want to go through any of the individual instances because the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General furnished this committee with a full list of every single organisation that is audited and a list of the areas where there was non-compliance, which is quite substantial.  Some of it is due to insufficient competition, which is a problem.  Some of it is due to insufficient planning and not enough time being set aside, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's computer or IT system.  Those in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not give themselves enough time and the contracts had to be rolled over.  That happens as well.  It is the culture and planning.</p> <p>  As Mr. Watt will know, we had instances where conflicts of interest in procurement were not managed.  Some of those cases now involve criminal proceedings so we cannot talk about them.  There are a multitude of reasons.  There might be a valid reason for non-compliance but we can adjudicate on that.  The reasons are not always valid.</p></speech>

There are very specific provisions which allow for exclusion from the procurement rules, but they are very specific.  In general, non-compliance outside of those exclusion provisions is not acceptable.</p> <p>  I saw it with the Comptroller and Auditor General a number of years ago and we debated at this committee, but the last report, which I am not quite sure whether it was for Civil Service bodies or what part of the public service, showed a very, very high compliance with procurement.  I am trying to remember but it was a number of years ago, and I think it was &euro;124 million of procurement was non-compliant, which was about 0.2% or 0.3% of the total subset that the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at.  I do not know whether he can remember the details.  We had a discussion about it at this stage in terms of materiality and whether that material was lost.  The conclusion of that report was, ultimately, that it was material and it was very clear in terms of compliance.</p> <p>  What Deputy Cullinane is saying is that, since then, he has encountered, and I kind of disagree with him-----</p></speech>

My point, which we have discussed at this committee several times, is that this comes up repeatedly.  There are a multitude of reasons for it happening.  We ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about it and he tells us this is the reason.  Some of it is due to practical reasons.  It is not right but it can be said that there is a practical reason.  Some of it is not, however, and is either a disregard for the rules, a lack of planning or the board did not have sufficient controls in place.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General give us a flavour of what I see as a problem by outlining where it happens the most and in what areas does it repeatedly happen?</p></speech>

There is a systemic problem in the HSE around procurement.  We have reported on that.  Every year the HSE accepts that it has a problem.  There are very specific reasons for it and it is not making as much progress as either it or we would like to see.</p> <p>  In other organisations, we report where we identify procurement in excess of &euro;500,000 that is not compliant with the relevant procurement rules.  Certainly, there is a way of looking at it and saying that it is not particularly material in the overall scale of an organisation of, let us say, the size of a university, an institute of technology or whatever.  That is the level that we are reporting at because there is no other way of drawing the line on materiality.  If non-compliant procurement was more than 2%, let us say, that could be a huge sum of money that could have huge implications-----</p></speech>

We have approached it from an absolute value perspective.</p> <p>  There are many reasons there may be non-competitive procurement.  The Secretary General has outlined some of those.  Some of them make sense but there are still strategies that need to be applied.  For instance, if one is tied into a particular supplier, one needs to ensure when doing a business case for procuring that kind of service that one takes a whole-of-life view.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would certainly agree with that kind of approach.  We need to see the evidence of that to be satisfied that it is a proper approach.  There are other reasons and they may be individual reasons that arise from time to time.  It may even be personnel problems in an organisation.  We would need to look at getting a statistic for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I will give the numbers in terms of non-compliance under Circular 40/2002.  This relates to non-competitive procurement.  I have figures from the OGP.  For 2016, excluding the HSE, the total amount of non-compliance was &euro;94 million.  Several of these relate to defence.  I do not have the full details but one case involved the purchase of a ship and the extension of a contract.  Another related to an armoured cars upgrade and was probably because there was only one supplier in a position to do the upgrade.  It amounted to &euro;55 million.  Another involved the replacement of an aircraft, which I presume was replaced by the same kind of aircraft.  There was then an issue in relation to RT&Eacute; providing a service to do with the commemorations in 2016.  The most significant cases are clear.</p> <p>  I accept that it is an issue in the HSE.  I would love to see more evidence.  Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General could update the work his office has done previously.  I am not discounting any concerns about any individual case for one moment, but I do not think that there is a general non-compliance problem, with the caveat I just gave.  That is my sense.  The last review that the Comptroller and Auditor General did was not material, in my view.  When one examines the reasons for non-competitive procurement and strips out the genuine reasons, there was a very small number of cases where there was a problem.  I do not disagree with what the Deputy said in relation to the HSE.</p></speech>

I met Mr. Watt on this issue in a previous role.  What is the current position regarding pay equalisation for public servants recruited since 2011?  Where will they be at the end of the time period for resolving this issue?</p> <p>  A number of pay restoration increases have been made to public servants as a consequence of pay agreements.  They range depending on income.  Does Mr. Watt have to hand a breakdown of these increases, for example, for someone on a salary of &euro;150,000 compared with someone on a salary of &euro;50,000?  What would someone have received who was earning &euro;150,000 at the beginning of pay restoration compared to someone on an average income of &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000?  It would be great if Mr. Watt had those figures and if he could walk us through the plan to deal with those affected by the additional reduction in public service pay in 2011.</p></speech>

All those paid up to &euro;70,000 will have their pay restored to above what they were paid.

If there is a fund threshold of &euro;2 million and if the Revenue calculates that, on retirement, one's notional pension pot is above that threshold, one's personal fund threshold is above the standard fund threshold, then, according to the legislation, one pays back the excess charge over 20 years.  It is not income tax.  I presume it relates to the excess charge on pension pots.  It is related to the standard fund threshold.</p></speech>

In effect, the gross pension is then reduced further by the excess charge.  It relates to the fact that the person would have received notional tax relief on the pension contributions.

I do not need to know who the people are or anything like that.  The 20-year repayment period is what caught my eye this morning and it needs to be explained to the public.

The Act was enormous because the pension system is incredibly complex.  We consolidated and rationalised and we now have 65,000 people who are part of the pension scheme.

On chapter 3, I ask Mr. Watt to refer to table 3.7.  The Budget Statement is announced before 15 October every year in accordance with EU rules but it takes six months for the Estimates to be dealt with.  The Estimates are considered by the relevant committees in March or close thereto and voted upon by the D&aacute;il in April.  As Accounting Officer and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I wish to state that that is no way to do business.  Most draft Estimates for next year have been published.  Six months are being lost.  The budget used to be in December but was brought forward to October under EU guidelines.  That gave the Oireachtas the opportunity to pass the Estimates for 2019 before the end of 2018.  I do not know of any organisation worth its salt that approves its budget four or five months into the year.  Such a company would go bust.  No business should be run in that way.  The fact that this concerns Departments is not a reason to say the State guarantees everything and it does not matter anyway.  It is bad practice.  As budget day has been brought forward by two months, the approval of the Estimates should be brought forward by at least the same period.  At one stage, Estimates were coming through just before the summer recess.  During committee discussion of an Estimate, members were told that two thirds of the allocation had been spent.  Four twelfths of the Estimates will have been spent by April in any event.  Mr. Watt, as the Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which oversees this side of the budgetary process, should be making an effort to get those Estimates through the Oireachtas by Christmas.  That would be the correct time for it to be done.  It would be better to have them completed in January than maintain the current situation but it would still be too late.  It should be done by Christmas.</p></speech>

Whoever is responsible should be better at counting.  It is a fairly straightforward issue which does not involve tens of thousands of people.</p> <p>  On the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Mr. Watt will tell me that the Supplementary Estimate is to provide for Garda overtime.  However, there will be overtime next year and that should be budgeted for in the Estimates rather than there being a shock announcement by the Commissioner stating that there will be no Garda overtime for three months.  There does not seem to be an effort to get the Estimates right at step one.  Mr. Watt knows them inside out and is probably sick of looking at them.  Neither he nor the Minister should be seeking Supplementary Estimates year in, year out.  It is systemic.  The only answer is to try to do it right in the future.</p></speech>

Two years ago we were told that there would be no more Supplementary Estimates as they would not be allowed under the rules.  What about the multiple statements by various Ministers a few years ago that it was going to be the last year of the Supplementary Estimates and there would be expenditure ceilings under the fiscal rules?  Is the imposition of those rules movable from year to year like everything else?</p></speech>

Every year we must comply with structural balance in line with the overall medium-term objective, MTO, and keep increases in gross spending below the estimated trend in potential output in the economy.  The MTO targets a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  There is discretion for this Parliament or that of any other member state to increase spending if it is compliant with the rules.  There was a view that unexpected revenues would not necessarily be spent, which is true if such spending would not be consistent with the rules.  However, if consistent with the rules, unexpected revenues can be used to fund unexpected spending.  Our preference is to stick within the rules such that revenues are used to improve the balance if those revenues are a function of an improved economy and improving cyclical position.  Ultimately, the fiscal rules are a matter of interpretation.</p></speech>

When revenues fall, a decision will have to be made on whether that fall is due to a cyclical issue or to an underestimate of growth in the economy.  That assessment will determine whether the Government of the day will take corrective action or whether we allow the deficit or the surplus to disimprove.</p></speech>

Out of interest, paragraph 5.2 in the appropriation accounts for 2017 refers to pensioners and paragraph 8.3 refers to ex gratia pensions for widows and children.  Will Mr. Watt clarify the nature of the ex gratia payments to widows and children of civil servants, members of the Judiciary and court officers?  Was there no cover there?</p></speech>

It depends on the financial management and shared services scheme, which we hope to introduce at the beginning of next year.  It is a question of the capacity of our system to modernise the accounting system so we can move to full accrual of balance sheet accounts.  As the Deputy can see with the account, the current system presents the accounts on a cash basis and then there is a part-accrual.  The review we are talking about relates to the reviews being undertaken by the OECD.  We hope to have a report by the end of this year.</p></speech>

Lovely.  Okay.  I have two more questions.  I have asked about value for money in the provision of services.  Mr. Watt kindly said that if this is brought to his attention, he will look at it.  I would like to go back.  How does the Department pick this up?  I forget what Mr. Watt said when he answered that question.  I am talking specifically about the framework that was brought in for the provision of services.  How does the Department judge whether it is more effective in value for money terms?  What analysis does it do?</p></speech>

It depends on the nature of what we are procuring.  Some services are more amenable to easier matrix.  Other services are more heterogenous, so it is very hard to make comparisons between different service providers or between different periods of time.</p></speech>

This paper clearly recommends a follow-up analysis of value for money as between renting and purchasing or whatever else.  Tied with this is the Miesian Plaza, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on that outlined in very clear terms at paragraph 6.10:</p><blockquote>It was noted that- There was no evidence of detailed consideration of other options - Miesian Plaza was identified as &lsquo;virtually the only option&rsquo;.<br /><br />- No cost-effectiveness analysis or other economic appraisal was carried out - in particular, there was no consideration of lease, buy or build options.<br /><br />- There was no evidence that the full costs of leasing Miesian Plaza were identified</blockquote><p>It goes on.  The witnesses come into this as that lease was approved.  I put it to them at the beginning when I came in that they approved that lease.</p></speech>

That is one example.  There is apparently another example in Galway with a building for the Revenue Commissioners and an example involving Foras na Gaeilge, which we have raised many times here.  In that example, the business case identified a different solution and Foras na Gaeilge is renting a building.  There is also the National Treasury Management Agency, where the witness is on the board, and the National Asset Management Agency.  There is a huge amount of money going out in rent.  If this is an example of the options appraisal, are we not in serious trouble in a sense?  There does not seem to be any proper options appraisal being done with alternatives.</p></speech>

I did not want to ask questions that were probably asked already.  Mr. Watt spoke of the new single public service pension scheme established in 2012 under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012.  The Comptroller and Auditor General report indicates that, as a result of the work completed to date, 14 bodies were making employer contributions and at 14 September 2018 these bodies had made contributions totalling &euro;4.35 million.  However, the report later states that, as of September 2018, "the Department has yet to finalise the list of all State bodies that will be required to make employer pension contributions in respect of Single Scheme employees."  Will Mr. Watt explain that statement?  I know the Chairman touched on it.</p></speech>

There was uncertainty about how this is applied and we issued a circular in 2016 setting out what we believe is the interpretation of the Act.

Receipts of the State cover this, whether they are appropriations-in-aid or taxation.  It is a valid point that was outlined by the Chairman.  I agree that we must look at the accounting treatment of this and the extent to which we will, over time, allocate receipts into funds that will part-fund future pensions.</p></speech>

It is something we did before, although it is not exactly analogous, with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, when we used money from the sale of Eircom and contributions each year to build a fund.  A third of this was to fund public service pensions and two thirds of it was for social welfare.  We had pre-funding in the past and we would certainly like to move to a more funded scheme for public pensions.  It would not be entirely funded but it could be partly funded.</p></speech>

Before concluding I thank witnesses from the Department of Public Expenditure for their attendance and the material they will send to us shortly.</p> <p>  Witnesses will be aware that the committee will examine procurement across the board and the topic will be before us all the time.  We have said we will consider public private partnerships as part of our work programme for this year.  We have been getting some information but we have not yet considered how good it is.  It is an ongoing topic on our agenda.  Recently, we were sent the official minutes of the response to our earlier periodic report.  We have not yet had the opportunity to examine those.  Depending on the content of those reports, we may have to respond on some matters.  We will deal with those matters as they arise.  I am alerting the witnesses that some matters cutting across their Department will be discussed in the time ahead.  I thank all the witnesses for their attendance.  In the afternoon we will meet representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.</p></speech>

We are meeting representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to discuss the Higher Education Authority's financial statements for 2017 and governance arrangements in the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA for the third level sector.  The committee has been giving much consideration to matters in the third level sector in the past two years and in July last year published its report on the examination of financial statements in the sector.  A key recommendation made in the report was that the committee was of the view that the balance between the Department and the HEA in the financial and governance oversight of the third level sector might need to be reviewed and updated.  The committee is of the opinion that the HEA has a key role to play in ensuring the important issues raised in the report will be addressed by each institution.</p><p>The committee is also of the opinion that the HEA needs to be empowered and resourced to carry out a greater oversight role effectively.  <br/><br/>Dr. Graham Love has been chief executive of the HEA for the past two years and is due to leave the organisation this month.  The committee felt it was important to engage with him and the Department prior to his stepping down from the role.  While there have been newspapers reports on his resignation and the committee did receive a copy of his resignation letter, our engagement today is not about the personal circumstances of his resignation but, rather, about ascertaining, as per the committee's recommendations on its work, the level of progress made towards the empowerment and resourcing of the HEA to ensure it will have greater oversight of the third level sector.  Accordingly, I ask members to keep the focus on the changes to the HEA and the Department's oversight of third level institutions.  <br/><br/>We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary; Mr. Tom Gaynor, principal officer, and Ms Stephanie Good, assistant principal officer; and from the Higher Education Authority by Mr. Michael Horgan, chairman; Dr. Graham Love, chief executive; Mr. Neil McDermott, assistant principal officer; Ms Sheena Duffy, assistant principal officer; and Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant.<br/><br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones or switch them to airplane mode.  Switching them to silent mode is not sufficient because they can still interfere with the broadcasting and recording systems.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  <br/><br/>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  <br/><br/>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is the primary funding authority for the universities, institutes of technology, teacher training colleges and a number of other designated education bodies.  Over 90% of its income comes directly from Vote 26 - Education and Skills, with the balance consisting largely of research funding from Vote 32 - Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It had gross expenditure of &euro;1.17 billion in 2017.  As shown in the graph, the bulk of that expenditure was in the form of grants to education bodies for specified purposes, either current spending, including fee recoupment to colleges, or capital project funding and research funding.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the HEA's 2017 financial statements.</p></speech>

They were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the end of June.  I am pleased to note that once again they have been certified, with no issues arising.  </p> <p>  In 2017 the HEA allocated over &euro;1 billion in funding to the higher education sector.  The funding covers the traditional core grant to institutions but also targeted initiatives such as Springboard which provides free places on courses for the unemployed and people returning to education and the Irish Research Council that acts as the key national funder of basic research across all disciplines.  This allocation of funding is a significant responsibility for the HEA but one that it performs effectively. </p> <p>  I would like to update the committee on other developments since we last appeared before it in May.  In May I briefed it on the status of the report arising from the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology and the reasons it had not been published.  I assure the committee that the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills are working together to progress the matter as soon as possible and I am happy to brief it in further detail today. </p> <p>  In November 2017 the HEA published Dr. Richard Thorn&rsquo;s report on the University of Limerick.  The report made 36 findings and ten recommendations to be implemented by the university.  The HEA continues its monitoring of the university's implementation of the recommendations arising from the report.  Eight of the ten recommendations have been implemented and the remaining two are on course for completion by the end of the year.</p> <p>  At the meeting in May I also briefed the committee on the HEA's rolling governance reviews.  Our first such review dealt with procurement and our second, intellectual property policies.  This year's rolling review will focus on employee remuneration and other benefits.  Like previous reviews, the rolling review is based on a sample range of universities, institutes of technology and other colleges.  The institutions to be examined as part of the review have been notified and fieldwork will commence shortly.</p> <p>  Procurement, rightly, remains an area of focus for the committee.  Our first rolling review in 2016 focused on procurement and led in part to the HEA's annual higher education procurement summit.  This year's summit, held in April, saw the launch of a corporate procurement plan template to help higher education institutions to better plan their procurement requirements and ensure better compliance with national procurement guidelines.  The plan has generated a lot of interest and there is a commitment by institutions to adopt the templates and complete the work to ensure and improve compliance in this area. </p> <p>  Earlier this year the Comptroller and Auditor General published his annual report on public sector financial reporting.  I am pleased to note that there continues to be improvement in the timeliness of the production of financial statements for higher education institutions, particularly universities.</p> <p>  This year has seen not only the passing of the technological universities legislation but also our first technological university designation.  In July the Government announced that the application for such status from the TU4Dublin consortium would be granted and it is on course to officially become a university next January.  Other technological university consortia continue to make progress with their respective applications. </p> <p>  Next week the HEA will commence its annual round of strategic dialogue meetings with higher education institutions.  At the meetings institutions will receive feedback from the HEA and a panel of external advisers on their mission-based performance compacts.  The compacts set out each institution&rsquo;s strategic priorities and contribution to overall system objectives. </p> <p>  As I finish up my role as chief executive, I acknowledge the work of HEA staff and their contribution in supporting and overseeing the development and growth of the higher education sector.  I wish my successor, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, the very best in taking up the role of interim chief executive.  I am confident that he will bring a valuable insight and experience from his time in SOLAS. </p> <p>  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer queries from the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.905" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101800002#GG00800"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  To assist me in the discussion, I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. William Beausang and Mr Tony Gaynor.</p> <p>  The HEA&rsquo;s 2017 financial statements were certified by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 29 June 2018 with a clear audit opinion.  The HEA is the statutory funding body for the higher education sector.  One of its core functions is the allocation of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for universities, institutes of technology and other designated institutions.  In 2017 the HEA allocated over &euro;1 billion of Exchequer funding to the higher education sector in the form of recurrent grants, access grants, capital grants and research grants.  </p> <p>  The importance of good governance is a theme which can be clearly identified within the HEA's financial statements.  In addition to the high standards of corporate governance within the authority, as evidenced by the financial statements, the HEA has also introduced a number of measures in recent years to further enhance its role in the governance and accountability of the higher education institutions within its remit.  Measures that have been taken include the following: the introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015, the purpose of which is to provide assurance of compliance with legislative and other requirements and more timely and responsive interventions to address issues arising.</p><p>The new governance framework also makes clear the central oversight role of the HEA in monitoring governance practice across the system.</p><p> A further measure that has been introduced is the reduced timelines for the submission of draft accounts for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the submission of annual governance statements to the HEA.  The HEA also meets quarterly with the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss the status of his audits of the financial statements of higher education institutions and the identification of issues or difficulties arising.</p><p> In 2016 the HEA commenced the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews of governance matters.  The first rolling review focused on procurement, which was followed by a review of intellectual property in higher education institutions.  A further rolling review has commenced in 2018, focusing on staff remuneration and benefits in higher education institutions.</p><p> Another measure undertaken was the review of the allocation model for funding higher education institutions, undertaken by the HEA, which was published in January 2018.  The review proposes a reformed funding model that would provide for greater transparency in how State investment in higher education is allocated.  It would also provide for stronger and clearer links between national strategic priorities and the types of programme delivered in higher education institutions.  In addition, the HEA ensures codes of practice are in place in respect of the institutes of technology and the universities.  The updated code of governance for institutes of technology was published by the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, in January 2018 and it is anticipated that the universities' code of practice will be completed shortly.</p><p> The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the HEA to strengthen governance arrangements and ensure a robust system of accountability in the sector.  The HEA, as a body that acts under the aegis of the Department, is required to comply with the 2016 code of practice for governance of State bodies.  The annual allocation letters from the Department to the HEA highlight the code&rsquo;s requirements.  Compliance with the code is one of the terms and conditions under which the Department funds the HEA.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2016 code of practice for governance of State bodies, the Department has a performance delivery agreement with the HEA.  It sets out the purpose and scope of the agreement and defines the roles of both organisations.  The core activities and key services to be provided by the HEA are agreed and set out, together with how each service commitment is to be measured.  The current agreement covers the period 1 January to 31 December 2018.  The 2018 performance delivery agreement supports specific high level goals and objectives of the Department and the HEA and sets targets in line with the HEA's statement of strategy and work plan for 2018.  It also defines the output and outcome indicators, on which the performance of the HEA will be measured.  A number of review meetings are set out within the agreement to allow the Department to formally review the HEA&rsquo;s progress towards the agreed key deliverables.</p><p> In addition to these meetings, the Department and the HEA meet more regularly than is provided for in the performance delivery agreement.  There are regular meetings on specific issues and general themes such as funding or governance across the sector.  As well as ensuring open channels of communication are maintained, these regular dialogues between the Department and the HEA facilitate a collaborative approach to managing issues presenting across the sector.</p><p> Another important element of the relationship between the HEA and the Department is the annual system performance report which sets out progress across the higher education sector against the agreed national policy objectives identified by the Minister.  In addition, the financial accountability framework is an agreement to provide for proper and effective use of public funding, effective control audit and accountability measures and cost effective and efficient delivery of services.  A corporate governance risk register and an early warning reporting system are also in place to enable the HEA to identify to the Department potential risks and allow for early intervention to address them.</p><p> During his time as chief executive of the HEA the Department has worked very closely and effectively with Dr. Love on a range of issues that include very significant reforms to the funding model for higher education, the institutional landscape and the governance framework between the HEA and the Department and between the HEA and higher education institutions.  I publicly acknowledge the contribution Dr. Love and his colleagues in the HEA have made in the past 18 months in delivering these important reforms.  I also wish him every success for the future.</p><p> I am conscious that the Department has been in correspondence in recent times with the Committee of Public Accounts on a number of issues particular to higher education.  I assure the committee that the issues raised in the sector are taken very seriously by the Department.  We are working with the institutions, through the HEA, to seek to have the issues dealt with appropriately and as efficiently as possible.  I will be happy to provide an update for the committee on any of the issues raised.</p><p> Before concluding, I would like to highlight one issue, in particular.  I understand the committee has inquired about the current position on the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group at Waterford Institute of Technology.  As members are aware, I am precluded from involvement in the matter and will defer to my departmental colleagues present to answer questions members may have in this regard.  I will be happy to answer any other question for the committee.</p></speech>

Because it is his last appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank Dr. Love for his service with the HEA and engagement with the committee.  He has been a very helpful witness on the number of occasions he has appeared before us.  He has also been a staunch defender of the higher education sector.  I commend him for the work he has done in that regard.  I have some questions about his statement of resignation, to which I will come shortly.</p> <p>  I have some questions about the independent review of the spin-out companies at Waterford Institute of Technology.  I hope Dr. Love shares or at least understands the frustration other members and I feel about this issue, given that we were due to receive a report last September or October.  I met a lot of people who had engaged with Mr. Michael McLoone as part of the process.  I also met him at his request and know that a lot of people came forward.  I believe in due process and know that we cannot draw conclusions and must wait until the report is published.  The committee has received a letter from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, which was debated at our last hearing and in which it expressed concerns on behalf of its members who, in good faith, had engaged in the process.  They feel aggrieved that one year on there is still no report, be it good, bad or indifferent.</p> <p>  Dr. Love briefed the committee in private session on some of the challenges.  I do not want to put him in a position where it might be more difficult to publish the report, but does he understand the frustration of members and WIT staff?  Perhaps he might outline for the committee - if he has the numbers - how many staff at WIT engaged with Mr. McLoone as part of the process.  Was it dozens?  When are we likely to see the report?  One way or another, we need a resolution of the issue today.  If Dr. Love is not in a position to answer the question, the Department needs to answer it.  I am very anxious to ensure absolute clarity for everybody  involved, including the management and staff at WIT.  Everybody would benefit from having the report published as soon as possible.  If Dr. Love is not in a position to answer the question, I will put it to the departmental officials.</p></speech>

I will take the three questions questions.  </p> <p>  I share the frustration felt.  There has been a lot of time spent on this issue.  I make it clear that there has been a spotlight on it and the frustration is palpable on our side of the table also.  It is our intention that a report will be published.  This is a statement of principle and objective.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many people had engaged in the review process with Mr. McLoone.  More than 50 came forward, more than we had expected at the time.  We were surprised at the number.</p> <p>  The third question - probably the more important - was about the status of the report.  It is almost one year on, which is intolerable and deeply frustrating for us.  As I said in my earlier update, I must be careful in what I say, but I must give enough information to satisfy the committee.  We have run into very significant legal challenges or problems with the report, including a very considered statement that, effectively, I would be exposing the HEA to a significant risk of litigation and damages.</p><p>We went further than that where we produced a modified version where major risks were considered to be present.  We got a senior counsel opinion on this, who went as far as to say that we were not necessarily empowered to be doing this.  We engaged extensively with the Department and understand it is with the Department and has gone all of the way to the Attorney General and we are waiting for that to come back.  This is quite significant but it is important, given the nature of this to be upfront about that.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary that we have arrived at that situation where for those 50 people who came forward and were part of this process - if I am reading Dr. Love correctly - the senior counsel is saying not to publish this report.  It is with the Department and it is trying to figure out what to do and is getting advice from the Attorney General.  How did we end up in that situation?  I can only read from that that the process over-reached itself, the terms of reference were not clear or the person who did the review overstepped the mark or whatever.  I want to be very careful in what I say because I do not want to prejudice whatever report does come out.  I want to see a report.</p> <p>  I must however put a deep frustration on the record.  I have been personally attacked by an Accounting Officer, in respect of which Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; also has accountability.  I do my work in here without fear or favour.  It is a matter of fact-----</p></speech>

It is a matter of fact that 50 people engaged with this process.  It is a matter of fact that they expressed concerns.  If there is a draft report that there is a fear of litigation, then that speaks for itself, in terms of some of what was in the report.  I am aghast that it has gone to the Attorney General's office.  This is just bizarre.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Beausang enlighten me as to what the Department can do now  to salvage this report?</p></speech>

The Deputy was briefed by the CEO of the HEA at the committee's May meeting in private session on where things stood.  Subsequent to that briefing we met with the HEA, the CEO  and his team, to discuss the draft review and the legal advice that they had got on the submissions that they had received, of the CEO that Dr. Love had outlined.  We responded to the CEO with our view of that legal assessment, back in June.  The meeting was on 5 June and we met with the CEO and his team on 11 June.  This was not a legal response but one from the officials in the Department to the legal advice that the HEA advised the committee of at their May private session.  That letter was considered by a subcommittee of the board of the HEA and culminated in the HEA requesting senior counsel's advice.</p> <p>  The senior counsel's advice is a much broader piece of work relating, as Dr. Love has already said, to the powers that the HEA has to carry out reviews and investigations.  It was a very significant and substantive legal analysis that arrived in to us at the end of July, if I am correct.  Subsequent to that,  we worked through with our own in-house legal adviser, a seconded official of the Office of the Attorney General, in order to develop our understanding and to formulate a question.  A scenario in which the HEA's legal advice is wide-ranging-----</p></speech>

I am very alarmed with what I have heard so far.  This has been a right mess.  It is ridiculous how this has worked out but I will come back to it.</p> <p>  If I can come to Dr. Love's resignation email, a letter that he sent to Mr. Horgan who is the chair of his organisation.  I do not want to put him in a difficult position in any way because I believe that it would be unfair of any member of this committee to do that.  It is fair for us, however, to ventilate the issues that he has put in writing in his resignation email.  It is important from our perspective in how it interacts with our work.  He said in his email that he formed the view that his role has not matched his expectations.  Can he expand on that for me, firstly, please?</p></speech>

For the four reasons I have outlined below there, I found it difficult to deliver on strategic development to the sector.</p></speech>

I am interested in what he means by all of that.  I understand what he is saying but it is important for him to expand and to put on the record what he means.  He said that the actual nature of his job militates against any realistic opportunity to deliver much-needed strategic development in the sector.  This is what we were interested in and, in fact, we were working with him and, I would hope, the Department in making that happen.  What does Dr. Love mean by the actual nature of his job militating against being able to deliver the reforms which are necessary?</p></speech>

As alluded to in the previous conversation - which is worth developing here because it explains a lot of the lack of role clarity question that is raised - there is a significant issue with the HEA legislation.  Let me be very clear on that.  This legislation dates from 1971.  The HEA is good at allocating funding; it is good at policy advice and the gathering statistics and data analytics etc on policy advice; it is good, to a degree, at advocacy for the system; but it struggles significantly with the fourth function - the one that was conferred on the HEA after the Hunt report and the national strategy published in 2013 - which is the oversight and regulatory piece.</p></speech>

We have found that in the conduct of a number of pieces of work, such as the one we have discussed previously in the WIT report, but also in relation to some of the matters relating to the University of Limerick, and others, we simply do not have the powers to do what is expected of a regulatory body.  When push comes to shove we are not in a strong position at all.  That has resulted in myself and the team trying to work almost on a voluntary and acceptance basis for things that are very often pushing people right up to the edge.  As far as that side of the equation goes, we are not well set up.</p><p>What Dr. Love is saying is that while he has responsibility for governance and oversight of institutes of technology and universities he does not have the powers to truly be able to do it.</p></speech>

When it comes to trying to decide on the appointment of an investigator some of the functions lie in the domain of the Minister in legislation and the HEA does not have them but there is an expectation in policy that the HEA does them.  Who does them is a question that has arisen over the past 18 months and it has been quite difficult at times to be clear.</p></speech>

If I were in the shoes of the Secretary General and I read an email from the head of the HEA that stated his role had not matched his expectations and the actual nature of the job militated against any realistic opportunity to deliver much needed strategic development in the sector I would be concerned because I would want to see that strategic development happen quickly.</p></speech>

I highlighted some of it in my opening statement.  The developments on the funding model and the technological universities are two very good examples of this.  We are working through change.  I recognise that the role of the chief executive of the HEA must balance various interests between strategy and governance, as do all senior public servants.  We are all working on these challenges.  I am concerned when he raises them with me but I believe we have been advancing a significant strategic agenda for change in higher education.</p></speech>

I commend Dr. Love on going to this trouble and taking a very personal risk.  I would have preferred if he had stayed in his role, to be honest, because I thought he was doing a very good job and was a very good witness before the committee.  He made a decision and that is for him.  It was very difficult for him to walk away from a job such as this, put in writing that he has serious concerns and essentially state that he is not able to do his job because the lines of demarcation between the HEA and the Department are unclear and he is not able to deliver the necessary strategic reforms.  It is very troubling that Dr. Love has this view while the view of the Secretary General seems to be completely at odds with it.  That is fine if that is his view-----</p></speech>

I recognise it is a very challenging role, as are all senior public servant roles, but I do not believe the job is undoable.  The HEA is on a journey of change to move into the area of regulation, oversight and policy advice.  If we look at the nature of the job specification for the role that was advertised we see the emphasis put on this.  We are listening to his concerns and we are trying to work through them.</p></speech>

We have dealt with a number of institutes of technology and universities where very serious issues have emerged.  These include the University of Limerick, Cork Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of technology, and institutions in Galway and Sligo.  A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will come out in respect of Limerick and Sligo with a separate report on Waterford.  Some of these are issues that we raised.  I remember when I first raised the issue of the spin out companies and research and development and we were told there was nothing to see and there was no issue.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; was not in a position to answer the questions then but we were told to wait and see.  We pushed and pushed and the more we pushed and looked into it the more we saw there were issues.  Now we have two reports, one of which went to the Attorney General and I will come back to that later.  The two reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, into Waterford, Limerick and Sligo, will deal with a range of issues.  We know that whistleblowers came forward in those organisations and raised very serious concerns.  Our view collectively, and we have all raised issues individually, is we did not think the issues were taken as seriously as they should have been.  That is my experience.</p> <p>  Dr. Love spoke about a lack of lines of demarcation between the HEA and the Department but then we have the Accounting Officers of some of the institutes and universities not believing they are accountable, as far as I can see. The attitude of some of those who have come before the committee left a lot to be desired.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to respond to this.</p> <p>  Dr. Love spoke about a difficulty in the relationship between his board and the executive.  What did he mean by this?  I ask Mr. Horgan to respond to this question also.</p></speech>

At times, I found myself in the middle of this trying to referee.  Mr. Horgan will attest shortly to the fact the authority felt very frustrated at times.  I was trying to mediate this on the basis of the powers we have and, in most cases, do not have, particularly when it comes to governance and oversight.</p></speech>

He knows, I have written to him about it.  One would expect some tension between the board and the chairman, and the chief executive and the executive.  That kind of tension is in the board and within the HEA.  It is a good thing to have a bit of healthy tension.  Dr. Love is right that the combination of issues that are within our power to address, not within our power to address and over which there is a question mark made him the meat in the sandwich between the Department looking for something and us asking for something that was probably slightly different.  This caused a lot of stress and pressure for him.  It is the kind of thing that happens all the time between the board and chief executive in organisations.  In Dr. Love's view, it was one of the issues he felt added to all the other things that led him to make his personal decision to leave.</p></speech>

Consider the level of co-operation this committee feels it gets or does not get from accountable persons when they appear before it.

Absolutely, they are accountable to the committee.  We have a very strong governance framework, between the HEA and institutions and between the Department and HEA.  I set out many of the elements in my opening statement.  The extent of governance checks and so on is significant.  The institutions themselves have primary responsibility to respond, and they should be speaking for themselves where there are breakdowns in governance.  They should, of course, report here as appropriate.</p></speech>

I have personal experience of working with the man.</p> <p>  Dr. Love's openness on the issues is very welcome.  It will serve us well.  I welcome the fact that he is being so upfront on the issues today.  It is quite obvious to all members of the committee, who have experience of the issues concerning the HEA, that there is a serious breakdown when it comes to roles and responsibilities between the Department and HEA.  We have had a number of reports and interim reports on third level issues.  If there is a significant, difficult issue, what is the position on the various roles?  I refer to the Accounting Officers in the individual institutions, HEA and Department.  The questions of who is responsible and who takes responsibility for dealing with issues are all over the place.  It is not fully known internally within the three tiers, and it is certainly not fully known to people who work in them or to us, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We know the heads of the institutions are the accountable officers but it is almost as if there is a pipeline of responsibility, through the HEA, through the Department, etc.  Where one takes responsibility in its own right is not very clear.  That is a real issue.  Following on from the questions of the last speaker, I would like Dr. Love to give us specific examples, if he can, of where he feels, from a governance point of view, responsibly is falling between the cracks.</p></speech>

It has driven a lot over the past year.</p> <p>  We found it very difficult in the case of Limerick previously in terms of our capacity to go in and look at the situation that had arisen there for a number of years.  Members will know about the whistleblowers, etc.  The issue is quite significant there as well.  It is in this regard that one finds who has the power or the role to go in, or the legislative basis to do so.  There is a perception that it should be the HEA, but we found we are not able to do so in many cases as we are prevented by legislation, whether it is the Universities Act or our own Act, that of 1971.</p> <p>  May I make a general point that might be of assistance in generally colouring this palette?  The HEA's role is changing significantly.  The allocation of funding role is staying the same.  The organisation has been doing this for 30 years very well.  The gathering of statistics and producing of intelligence about the system for policy advice are being done very well, in the main, but, since the Colin Hunt report of 2011, which turned into the national strategy for higher education, a significant regulatory oversight role has been given to the HEA.  The policy has developed quite a bit over the past few years but the legislation underpinning it has not matched that.  That is where we have run into trouble.  A classic role change is taking place in an agency that is driving some of this greyness.  That is an opinion but-----</p></speech>

That is a fairly accurate and useful comment.  Mr. Paul O'Toole is entering the role.  Will he be as constrained as Dr. Love was?  Are we in a vacuum whereby, from a regulatory point of view, nobody who is ever in Dr. Love's role will be able to deal with the issues in the way this committee expects or the public would require until this legislation is dealt with?</p></speech>

There is a consultation and, if the role described is the one envisaged, it needs to turn into hard legislation that empowers.  Some of the powers do vest in the Minister.

In fairness, the consultative process is going on so we know there is a requirement to do as proposed.  Until it is actually dealt with, and because of the Hunt report, the obvious changing role of the HEA and the fact that the legislation does not match up to it, we will not be able to meet the standards required from a regulatory point of view.

Deputy Cullinane referred to this.  There are 24-plus institutions and it is critical they get it right so there will not always be reliance on a central body such as the HEA or the Department.

I support Dr. Love's comments.  We must be very careful that the primary responsibility is with the accountable person within each institution and the governance role with the governing body of each institution.  The most important frameworks are the codes of practice for the two sets of institutions and the HEA's oversight of those.  What Dr. Love is referring to is the partial legislative lacuna relating to the universities when a very serious intervention is needed.  We have some powers of investigation, and stronger powers of investigation with regard to institutes of technology.  In the case of the University of Limerick, we worked very closely with the HEA.  Together, we engaged with the University of Limerick and with its agreement, the HEA led on an independent review.  It was possible but we had to get its agreement to do it.  Furthermore, with the HEA, we have come up with a concept of rolling reviews, which has also worked well.  As Deputy Cullinane mentioned, spin-out and procurement were two examples.  They were very helpful in terms of advancing policy.</p></speech>

In respect of the case referred to by Dr. Love - and, obviously, we will not go into any details - does he believe it was dealt with appropriately through the Department?  Was there any part that should have been dealt with differently?  For example, where a disclosure is made to an individual in the institution and that person is part of that disclosure, should he or she actually be involved in dealing with the disclosure in the first instance?</p></speech>

If it involves person X, we try to go to the X-plus-one level in the organisation.  That is a typical way around this.  I think the Deputy asked whether I thought it had been done properly in this case.  I do not yet know because we only got a new protected disclosure last year as part of our investigation into that, which is not yet complete but which will be soon.  We want to get a response from the institution.</p></speech>

However, the redress parts of the 2014 legislation are retrospective so that a person who feels that he or she was not appropriately treated and made a disclosure previously does have access to that.  That is something unique about that legislation.</p></speech>

The minutes show, in the context of what Deputy Kelly said about what would have happened before the Bill was passed, that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; stated that even as late as the previous week the HEA had written to the institutes of technology about whistleblowing, asking them to ensure that they put arrangements in place to deal with any issues that may arise prior to the completion of the legislation being enacted.

The matter dates back to June.  I will refer to the transcript of that day.  On three occasions, December 2015, on which date I would not have been here, June 2017 and June 2018, the Committee of Public Accounts was informed by the president and vice president of CIT that they never received a disclosure before the Act.  Dr. Love was alluding to this with Deputy Kelly but I want to go into a bit more detail.  On three occasions, they said that.  There was reference to an unnamed whistleblower in the context of a letter that came to the vice president.  That was eventually admitted.</p><p>We know this is nonsense because I have an email from the vice president which was referred to in a Topical Issue debate on this issue by Deputy Kelly, Deputy Cullinane and me.  I will read it into the record: &quot;Just to confirm that I have a copy of the letter you gave to [X, who was a head of faculty in the college] dated the 9<sup>th</sup>of October [This email is dated 12 October 2012] and that I will deal with it.&quot;  This is from the vice president, the person who told us on three occasions, along with colleagues, that there was no disclosure.  It goes on:</p><blockquote>I have attached copies of two policies that will guide us in terms of developing an approach when we meet on Tuesday at 6.  Please note that the disclosure policy is only in draft currently but I would suggest that we will apply it in this case.</blockquote> <p>That is the email of 12 October 2012.  It would seem to my untrained interpretation to be a clear example of what we would now describe as a disclosure, considering that use of the disclosure policy, albeit in draft format, was suggested by that self-same individual, then vice president, who was responsible for a wide variety of areas and who suggested that no such disclosure took place.  That was brought to the Minister's attention in the House on 10 July last and I note there has been correspondence with Dr. Love.  What is the HEA's position on this?</p></speech>

The HEA got a disclosure in 2017 that went around the houses.

It is never possible to say whether a disclosure is a protected disclosure until a third-party process adjudicates on that and a claim is determined in looking at whether a person has been penalised for making a protected disclosure.  Obviously, the policy is that an assessment is made as to whether an issue should be treated as if it was a protected disclosure and as to whether it looks, by virtue of that process, that it may fall into that category and should be treated in a serious manner as a result of that, but one cannot determine outside the legal process whether a protected disclosure was made.</p><p>We must be careful on that as otherwise-----</p></speech>

If I made a protected disclosure in the Department and I felt penalised by the Secretary General as a result, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 allows me to go to the Workplace Relations Commission and have it determined as to whether I have made a protected disclosure and been penalised as a result.  In those circumstances I would have very significant legal rights in terms of compensation, for example.  Those are the circumstances in which the issue is ever only answered.  Outside of that, it is around this process of making an assessment of whether it is likely and whether people believe it falls under the categories in the Protected Disclosures Act.  It is an important distinction and we can never be absolute.  There are clearly circumstances in which one might look at a report or disclosure and be quite convinced that it falls into the category of protected disclosure and should be treated as such, but one cannot say it definitively.  It is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission or the Circuit Court if some interim leave has been granted.</p></speech>

The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is clear this is in process.  The person who makes the disclosure can always go to the Workplace Relations Commission if he or she wishes to.  That is the protection in the legislation.  We cannot get into analysing protected disclosures when the process has not been completed.  The HEA has indicated there may well be a link between a possible disclosure of some sort in 2012 and the case under consideration.  It cannot come to a view until the process for the current disclosure is complete.  It is very hard for us to say anything more than that.

Dr. Love has said he does not believe anybody involved with the disclosure is involved with the process.  The authority will have to satisfy itself when it sees the response.  Other than that, it is all hypothetical comment on a real disclosure.  This is risky territory and I am a bit uncomfortable about this.</p></speech>

In other words, power rests with the Minister.  In parallel, the Minister for Health could commission HIQA to do a report on a hospital if he or she so chose.  What power does the Minister have to commission an investigation?  I know the HEA might be constricted with its legal powers but perhaps whoever drafted the legislation did it to leave the power with the Minister.  If people feel the HEA has a role and authority, perhaps it should have some of the delegated power that the Minister has.  The power might exist but it might not be with the HEA.  I am only asking a question as I want to understand this.</p></speech>

It is simply not working.  That is why we end up with tribunals or commissions of investigation.  That is the difficulty I see.  If we look at the Grace case, which has nothing to do with the HEA, there were three reports.  Had those reports worked, there would not have been a need for a commission or a tribunal.  I refer to Project Eagle and all of these investigations.  That is by way of preface.  I am only mentioning a tiny amount and we are only a very small country of just over 4 million people.  It seems extraordinary.  On the report into WIT, when is it envisaged that it will be published, if at all?</p></speech>

On the question about UL, the report goes back a few years.  There were a number of attempts to access UL that either were not received or were not complied with.  I imagine it was then that the HEA understood it did not have power with regard to universities, at least, because it was clear the Universities Act prevented it.  The power has moved on and been built up subsequently with the institutes of technology and so on, which comprise separate legislation, which the WIT case made clear.  It has been a process of becoming clearer over the past couple of years since about 2016, when the UL report was published.</p></speech>

I am probably a bit blunt here but I think that is helpful to the committee.  It is hard to put an exact percentage on it, but I think I have spent more than 70% of my time in this space since I joined a year and a half ago.  While I understand that oversight and governance would be a part of the role, I did not think it would be on such a vast scale.  It is partly because a significant number of issues were coming forward, but also because of all the other issues we have been discussing here today, namely, that the machinery, the architecture and so on are not suitable to take care of some of the issues.</p> <p>  Also, something we have not discussed enough here today is the responsibility that lies with the governing bodies of the institutions themselves to manage this, which is the bit that we ultimately need to get right.  We talked about the HEA legislation that is required for the emergency position or spillover, but we have to get it right at the level of the individual institutions.  They need to have this working properly.</p></speech>

All the governance procedures are in place to avoid these types of investigations.  We agree with Dr. Love and we see the gaps every time the organisations come before us.  It is particularly shocking to see it in the third level sector, which is one of the most privileged sectors, where there should not be any difficulties.</p> <p>  The regulation and compliance should be dominant.  I am not sure if I am correctly interpreting the phrasing in Dr. Love's letter.  Does he mean there is an absence of regulation and compliance where they should be dominant?</p></speech>

I wish him well in his future career wherever he goes.  Is the reason for his departure the system of governance in place and the relationship between the HEA and the Department?

I was attracted to the job because of development work such as pushing along the universities and institutes of technology.  As Deputy David Cullinane referred to, I am passionate about this stuff and research.  Ireland's talent is its main chance.  We do not have a big internal market, or oil and other resources.  Our people, their education and smarts are what Ireland has to offer; it is what makes living standards high in this country.  I really believe in them.  In my year and a half with the HEA I have struggled to advance this work significantly, for some of the reasons I have laid out in my letter.  Frankly, all four aspects are interrelated in terms of legislation.  For example, the term "dominance of the compliance and regulatory agenda" may be a poor choice of words, but it has subsumed me and much of our team.  We have not been able to work enough on the really good initiatives because of the time available.</p></speech>

We consider Ireland to be the island of saints and scholars.  While I do not know about the saints, it is important that the scholarly ambition be retained.</p> <p>  On Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s statement, every bit of the report is about accountability and governance.  It includes lines such as, "The introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015 ... to provide assurance of compliance with legislative and other requirements."  It goes on: "The review of the allocation model for funding higher education institutions, undertaken by the HEA ... will provide greater transparency in how State investment in higher education is being allocated," and  "The Department works closely with the HEA to strengthen governance arrangements and ensure a robust system of accountability in the sector."  It is all about accountability and governance.  Have we had a creaking system in place up to now?  Was the system broken when this five or six page report which is all about new rules and regulations and proposed plans was compiled?  What was wrong with the system up until now that we had to look at reviewing all of this?  Where did it fall down during the years in the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority?</p></speech>

There has been a hugely increased emphasis on governance.  In a way, we have sought to detail the nature of governance relationships, be it through institutions and the HEA or between the HEA and the Department, in order that there will be increased clarity.  The committee will see in our performance delivery agreement with the HEA that there is clarity on what it plans to do and what the Department's expectations are in terms of outputs and outcomes.  It is a much improved way of doing business with agencies.  We are doing this with all of the national agencies and it can work very effectively in order that we will all know what our plans are for a given year.  We do a lot more than governance; there is a lot more than governance being called for in the actions in the performance delivery agreement, or in the Department's strategy for the action plan.  The focus, obviously, has to be on governance and accountability.</p></speech>

Obviously, there have been some governance issues, but there has not been any major investigation.  I cannot refer to the Waterford Institute of Technology investigation, but previously there were serious governance challenges, which is why there is an investigation.  The issues are related to the nature of borrowing to fund certain activities.

They would not have been before the committee which investigates how public money is spent unless there was a breakdown.

For example, membership of governing bodies and so on is not about self-governance; it is just governance.  Institutions have to be able to operate independently.  There cannot be command and control in how institutions are run as that would not work and we would not have our responsive education system in meeting the need for skills.  Dr. Love spoke about the responsiveness of the system.  There have been significant developments in recent years in the work of the National Skills Council and the engagement of the human capital of the institutions.  These aspects are best enabled by having responsive institutions taking responsibility.  If the Department was to oversee and control higher education institutes, I could guarantee it would not work and it would have a worse outcome for Ireland's future economic development.</p></speech>

We have achieved a lot together.  Dr. Love referred to issues where there might have been legislative lacunae.  We are seeking to address them.  It is not that the HEA and the Department have been arguing.  I can think of quite a number of aspects that have been advanced significantly in recent  years through co-operation between the HEA and the Department.</p><p>A very good example of that is the technological universities and the Dublin Technological University.  When the legislation was passed the HEA went out of its way to ensure that an independent process would be put in place very quickly while the Minister of State in the Department is encouraging all of the institutions to come together, appropriately, to serve these and to establish technological universities.  The HEA has to be independent in its role.  It  undertook its role independently and speedily and that led to the designation of the first technological university.  That is just one example of good co-operation and reflecting respective roles.  </p></speech>

We need legislation that clarifies who does what.  We also need to strengthen governance in the institutions because I do not think it is the role of the HEA or the Department to step into every situation and sort it out.  There has be a self-learning and self-correcting capacity, and it is there in quite a number of institutions but it needs to be spread further.</p> <p>  Can I make another general comment?</p></speech>

In addition to our tax, talent is one of the reasons we are where we are and it is really important that we treasure this.  It is also a reason to get the governance right but I do not want that message being lost in here.  There are 250,000 students and nearly 20,000 staff across 24 institutions.  In terms of the level of funding, by international standards we are pretty efficient in producing approximately 45,000 graduates every year.  It is really important to make that intervention and get that on the record here.  This is one of our good products as a nation.</p></speech>

I wanted to expand on them earlier but I had to deal with other issues.</p> <p>  I will make a general point about the overall issues raised today, one which is separate from but also slightly related to the issues with Waterford.  We have had a very good hearing for a number of reasons.  The meeting has given us a glimpse into where improvements need to be made, and we, as legislators, must do our part.  I fully concur with Dr. Love that we need to get this right at local level in the institutes.  Governance boards in institutes and universities are extremely important.  If one gets governance right in the first instance, the HEA would not spend 60% or 70% of its time engaged in firefighting.  </p></speech>

I hear that message loud and clear.  There are real lessons to be learned.  I hope the Department will also accept that because it is very important for all us that that is the case.</p> <p>  We are also very mindful of the huge amount of talent in the third level sector.  I will discuss Waterford Institute of Technology in a moment.  I have visited Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, in Waterford a number of times.  I have also visited ArcLabs.  I was blown away by the incredible cutting edge research and development and technology in those centres.  Such talent should not be lost and it is not lost on me.  Sometimes it is portrayed as that by those who seem to have an issue with people asking genuine questions.  The work that is being done is amazing and I share Dr. Love's enthusiasm and respect for the huge level of talent we have in the third level sector. </p> <p>  I will return to the Waterford issue because it is important but I will first quickly contextualise it.  The matter first appeared on the radar of the Committee of Public Accounts when the accountable person, the head of the institute, made what seemed to be genuine mistake when, in answer to a question at a meeting of the committee in 2015, as to whether he was a director of the FeedHenry company, he said "No".  Subsequently, he wrote to the committee stating he had made a mistake and confirmed that he was a director.  However, he did not disclose that he was also a shareholder but we subsequently got that information.  He then asked the governing body to do a report and examine whether he had acted appropriately.  It then did a review and the individual in question then asked the HEA to validate this internal review.  Then, coincidentally or not, protected disclosures were made to me and information came to light that people had broader concerns connected with research and development in spinout companies.  This led to the deeper dive, as described by Dr. Love, that resulted in the HEA review.  Mr. McLoone was appointed to be the person to conduct the review.  He met many more people than Dr. Love may have expected. </p></speech>

There is also what is in the report, its content and the facts that were established.  Were there concerns about the facts that were established?  Was it more-----</p></speech>

My apologies.  The principal concern was the facts that were established led to the legal view that the HEA, with the kind of material being written in the report, was potentially impacting on individuals and, ergo, what power does it have to do that.  The legal opinion then was that it did not have power to do this.</p></speech>

We have established facts that are in a draft report and a modified report, which we cannot see and may never see.  The facts are there so the issues do not go away.  We will deal with whether the HEA has these powers but the issues still remain.</p> <p>  I want to paint the scenario and maybe Mr. Beausang can help me with this matter as well.  The Attorney General will consider whether the HEA has powers.  In fact, this matter is very interesting because it could set a precedent in many ways in terms of what the HEA can and cannot do.  It is, therefore, very important and has wider implications beyond Waterford.  Let us consider for a second that the Attorney General decides the report is outside the powers of the HEA and cannot be published.</p><p>In that scenario, there seem to be a number of options.  The HEA could start again within its powers.  The report could be scrapped by the HEA and we could have a report compiled on foot of a ministerial direction, which is, perhaps, what should have happened in the first instance.  Alternatively, some other body could do it.  Would that body be a commission of investigation, a law enforcement organisation or some other regulatory entity?  The witnesses are going to have to help us to understand who will examine this, because the facts remain and they are not going away.  Before I leave here today I want to know what is going to happen if this report is dead in the water.</p></speech>

When we receive that advice, we will have to apply it to the situation in which we find ourselves or in which the HEA finds itself.</p></speech>

The HEA will make that call at some point.  The call will be that it cannot publish the report, based on the legal advice and the advice of the Attorney General.  Dr. Love said that, in principle, he wants to publish the report but that it may be out of his hands; it may not be possible.  In that scenario, we should not leave the matter there.  The committee can form its own opinion, but in my view we should not leave it there.  We are going to have to look at the options.  The options I can see are the ministerial or departmental option; or alternatively, some other body.  The issues have not gone away.  I know that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; cannot answer the question, but perhaps-----</p></speech>

In light of that advice, we will then discuss what is next.  My point is that the matter cannot be let go; it cannot end there.  It is not going to end with a conclusion that the report cannot be published, that we must forget about the 50 people who engaged with the process and who have concerns because, unfortunately, the review relating to the report was outside the proper remit.  We will come back and look at a different avenue.  That is my point.</p> <p>  I want to raise several other issues-----</p></speech>

We have legal advice at the moment, so we have to manage that risk as well.  It would be the intention of the board to look again at the process we have gone through and at the contents to see if there is a way that we can produce a report.  That is what Dr. Love was suggesting.  The principle of producing a report remains.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; can answer my questions because they do not relate to the actual report.  The accountable person who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last year said to me outside this committee room - in a very robust way, if I can say that - that if I continued to ask the questions I was asking, he would resign from the institute.  Does Dr. Love think it is acceptable for an accountable person to do that?</p></speech>

We have a HEA examination into an institute.  The accountable person - the head of the relevant organisation - went to local media in the constituency of a Deputy who is member of the Committee of Public Accounts and called into question the motivations of that member in asking questions.  This person said that the member, referring to me, was trying to deconstruct 20 years of work done by the institute; that he was trying to damage Waterford city and county; that he was not acting in the best interests of the staff; and that he was acting on the basis of ulterior motivations which he has never put on the record.  That is a very inappropriate way for an accountable person to respond to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have written to the accountable person and asked him to put his claims in writing.</p> <p>  I am saying this to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Dr. Love because it fits into our relationship and the role we play.  It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to have to examine issues concerning any institute.  However, we are appointed to this committee to do a job without fear or favour and to pose questions.  I did not invent the issues.  People came to me with protected disclosures and information and we had to do what we felt was best with that.  It is completely inappropriate for an accountable person to call into question the motivations of a member of the Committee of Public Accounts who was simply asking questions.  That has also happened to other members here in the context of work they do.  Yes, it is a matter for the accountable persons, but surely it is also a matter for the Department and the HEA to ensure that we get certain protection.  We are allowed to do our job and nobody is above accountability.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; accept that?</p></speech>

I will be very straight with him, as the Accounting Officer for the Department.  If the head of an institute comes before the Committee of Public Accounts, is asked questions and then raises questions outside the committee about the motivation of the member who asked the questions in the first instance and if all of the questions asked were about facts and information which was presented to us - which actually led to a report that ventilates the questions - that is a real issue.  It could happen to any member of the committee.</p></speech>

I will note that there is an issue concerning evidence from one institution in higher education and we will come back to that at another time.  The committee has had issues with the University of Limerick.  We are very concerned about that and we have acted on that concern.  To be clear, when accountable persons are before the committee, it is their role.  I may not think their conduct outside of here is very advisable behaviour, either as presidents or accountable persons.  If, however, there is a concern, the primary responsibility for the behaviour of a president of an institution is with the governing body.  It is not for the HEA or the Department of Education and Skills to intervene in that regard.  That is where the primary responsibility for an overview of that person's behaviour is.</p></speech>

We will have the Accounting Officer before the committee again at some stage and we will address those issues.</p> <p>  If I can just make a final observation to the Chair, this issue has given rise a larger one, namely, the remit of the HEA in the context of conducting reviews.  That is actually quite serious for our work.  It could call into question previous reviews and whether they have protections.  Perhaps some of those were done outside the scope of the HEA.  To me, this has very profound implications beyond WIT.</p><p>We cannot pre-empt and one has to extrapolate from the advice of the Attorney General, but if it is the case that the report has to be shelved, then we are in very dangerous territory, as to future reviews, who does them and what exactly the role of the HEA in all of that might be?  We raised concerns about some of this, about these independent reports that were being done and their nature and powers.  The Cathaoirleach may remember that there was a lot of them and we had these concerns.  In fact we raised concern about legalities on the Waterford one.</p><p> We are where we are with it, in many respects.  We are definitely going to have to come back to this once the advice comes back.</p><p> The issues at Waterford IT are very real.  There is a huge amount of good work being done.  I commended Dr. Love, and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; will know that the cutting edge technology we have in research and development in Waterford is absolutely first class.  As we sit here today, however, we have 50 people who engaged with a process who are left without answers to questions that they put.  That is the outworking of it.  They deserve the answers.  Those 50 people who engaged with the process, many of whom still work within the institute, deserve answers.</p><p> In a point to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, individuals have to account for their own behaviour.  Given how I was treated by senior people in WIT, if I was one of those 50 people who came forward, I would be thinking if that is the way they treat a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and a TD in the constituency, it raises very serious questions.  I am uncomfortable about that because it is not fair or right.  Those people who work in that organisation who engaged with the process deserve a report and answers to questions that they put, be they good, bad or indifferent.  I do not know what the outcome of the process will be but the process needs to be brought to a conclusion.</p></speech>

Wherever he is headed, the best of luck.  A number of things arise from our last engagement that I want to put on record.  </p> <p>  On that specific disclosure, in June 2018, the vice-president said that the person did not engage.  In October 2012, the discloser requested a meeting with the president, the vice-president and the head of faculty.  The meeting took place but only with the vice-president.  In November 2012, the whistleblower-discloser asked for an investigator.  The vice-president did not set terms of reference and was told that that would not happen.  In 2013,  the discloser wrote - I have seen evidence of all of this - to the chair of the audit committee, to the president, to the chair of the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT board, requesting a dispute resolution committee, which was turned down.  In 2013 also, the whistleblower went to the office and met with each of the vice-president and registrar - now the president, vice-president of strategy, head of faculty and head of school.  In 2016, the whistleblower's legal firm asked twice if the CIT board was made aware of the case.  There was no response to that.  In 2017, the discloser wrote directly to each board member without response and in 2017 also wrote to the then and current president without response.</p> <p>  It is important that that account was defined as not engaging last June by the vice-president.  The reason I am bringing this up is that the HEA requested a report, which will come back and feed into its own conclusions.  Many people are in the same positions now, or maybe have moved up a little, as was the position as far back as 2012, most notably the chair of the board and the vice-president, who are one and the same, and the president is a former vice-president.  I hope, and I am putting it to the chairman of the HEA - Dr. Love is obviously moving on but hopefully the chairman will still be with us - that when this report emerges, that the HEA's consideration of it, without prejudice to what is going to be in it, will be is tempered by the fact that many of the participants in drawing up the report may well have been associated with the subject matter of the original disclosure in 2012, and indeed that of 2017.  There is the X plus one that the chairman mentioned - a disclosure could be made against me, yet I am the party that this disclosure comes to; in the context of CIT, this does not exist.  It is the Department or the HEA or the HEA or the Department.  This should be borne in mind, also.</p></speech>

The issue concerns the sale and purchase of the Harold's Cross centre for a much-needed school out there in the area, which we all support.  The issue concerns two schools and the issue of price.  I had the misfortune to have had some experience of valuing.  Back in May I crudely put a valuation on it that was less than half of the amount paid.  I queried whether a valuation was available and the Irish Greyhound Board said that it had one from Savills but would not give us the amount at the time.  I speculated that it would have been very substantially less.  This figure is now in the public domain and it is &euro;11 million less.  How does that happen?</p></speech>

He has been here on a number of occasions in his short period and he has always acquitted himself in a very straight, honest and upfront manner in which he knew his job.

Before I introduce our witnesses today, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, visitors in the Public Gallery and members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to flight mode.<br/><br/>On behalf of the committee I extend a very warm welcome to Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General, and Mr. David Hegarty, Ms Marie Bourke and Ms Claire Pyke from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I also welcome Professor Mark Ferguson from Science Foundation Ireland, Mr. Kieran Donoghue from IDA Ireland and Ms Rowena Dwyer from Enterprise Ireland.<br/><br/>Before we commence I advise the witnesses that by virtue by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>Due to our time constraints I ask that Dr. Quinn would give the committee a synopsis of her opening statement because the members have already read the opening statement.  I shall give Dr. Quinn three minutes and if she feels there is anything else to add throughout the questioning Dr. Quinn can come back in at any time.</p></speech>

We know that the development of low-carbon, bio and circular economies presents commercial opportunities to companies across many sectors in Ireland, and we work on that basis.</p> <p>  In my statement I have touched on the importance we are placing on the Future Jobs for Ireland initiative, which will be launched next year.  This very much takes into account environmental issues, international agreements and industry responses around the global economy and the technology sector.</p> <p>  Regional development is a particular concern of Government and we have focused very strongly on the need for balanced regional development and job creation.  My statement includes some data on the work the Department has done in that area, which is all focused within the development of the national planning framework.  This is also focused on sustainable enterprise.</p> <p>  We are particularly involved in innovation policy, which is very strong with regard to our strategy for research development.  Again, this has a strong focus on Ireland being a global innovation leader while being very focused on sustainable resource management.  This brings us into many of the areas this committee is looking at with regard to climate change and decarbonisation.  The Department has completed a major refresh of our research priority areas, which includes energy, climate action and sustainability; advanced and smart manufacturing; and sustainable food production and processing.</p> <p>  Disruptive technology is another initiative of the Department where we have highlighted and put out a major call.  We have had a very successful response to that and it will be coming through at the end of the year.</p> <p>  The Department is represented on a wide number of committees across Government.  We contribute from our research perspective and from the corporate perspective.  Corporate responsibility is something on which we lead and we are taking a very strong approach and we are working with companies to develop it.  All of this is around mitigation efforts.  We are involved in adapting and mitigating and we have reviewed all of our policies from the climate perspective.</p> <p>  The Department also recognises that there are many opportunities for Irish business.  The whole development of the bio-economy and the circular economy provides opportunities for Irish companies to get involved.  We have reflected that.</p> <p>  I have given the committee some details of the schemes in the mitigation sector.  I have touched on the role of our enterprise agencies IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and on the strong partnerships working with industry in this area, and in particular Science Foundation Ireland.  I am delighted that Professor Ferguson can be with us today.  There are 17 research centres and I am sure that Professor Ferguson can speak about those and the impact they have, and on how we develop.</p> <p> This is a very short breakdown of the written statement that I had submitted to the committee.</p></speech>

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on global warming of 1.5o C as a result of CO2 emissions from industry, pathways limiting global warming to 1.5o C are projected to be approximately 75% to 90% lower in 2050 relative to 2010.  That is compared with the 50% to 80% figure for global warming if we are projecting up to 2o C.  Will Dr. Quinn indicate the emissions trajectory for Irish industry from now to 2030 and from now to 2050?  Will I continue with my questions?</p></speech>

If there is a difference in that respect, how different is the current trajectory in terms of the requirement for industry to cut emissions by more than 75%?  I cannot see any specific figures in Dr. Quinn's submission on cutting emissions.  I would like to see information from the Department in respect of those figures.</p><p>The second theme also emanates from the recent IPPC report.  How will the Department assess the specific actions it must take to lead Irish industry in delivering what we call the deep cuts in overall emissions in the next 12 years?  We have gone from a 2030 to 2050 outlook to a 12-year outlook, which I believe will be the <i>modus operandi</i>of this committee.  I refer to the recent IPCC report dealing with the 12 years from now.  How will individual Departments move towards radical policies across their agencies to target those deep cuts that are so necessary?  What specific actions will the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation take?</p><p>On the research, development and innovation, RDI piece, priority areas were noted in the submission.  I have some degree of familiarity with those priority areas.  How much money is being allocated across those thematic areas, specifically relating to energy, climate action and sustainability, including the decarbonisation of the energy system and sustainable living?  What are the names of the research centres?  How much money is each research centre receiving?  What is the total amount of moneys being received for each of those centres?  Is the issue of climate change or radical climate action in respect of the 12 years mapped across the area of food, for instance, in terms of smart and sustainable food production and processing and on manufacturing and novel materials, including advances in smart manufacturing?</p></speech>

A number of questions have been put and the witnesses may respond to them in whatever order they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.1427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018101800002#F00700"><p>I will start, and I will ask Ms Bourke to come in on the emissions trading scheme, ETS.  Professor Ferguson might comment on the science in terms of the research centres.</p> <p>  From the Department's perspective, our main contribution to reducing emissions is through the European Union ETS.  That involves approximately 100 of Ireland's largest energy users who account for 25% of emissions.  All Irish industrial installations with installed energy generating capacity of more than 30% are included in the ETS.  For the larger energy users, they are there.  Is it achieving its aims?  It is true that we are not on course to meet our climate change targets.  The projections are that we will fall short of both our emissions and our renewable energy targets.  We have a target set and we are working to achieve that.  It is estimated that we will reach approximately 80% of the target.</p> <p>  What I have heard is that as the 2013 to 2020 requirements from the EU in particular run out, the sectors covered must reduce emissions by 43%, so there are areas on which we have to work.  Our job is to help companies move towards those targets.  We have a number of schemes in place.  Enterprise Ireland, EI, and IDA Ireland can talk about their specific schemes.  In particular, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  </p> <p>  It is the case that as enterprises, and particularly smaller enterprises, move to reduce emissions there will be costs involved and, over time, there will be areas that we will need to help and incentivise to do that.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned the food companies.  Some of the bigger food companies are in that sector.  Many of them are already in the 100 companies, so they are working already to reduce their emissions.  There is a huge amount of work going on in that area.  Those of us in the Department are very much involved in the research aspects.  Professor Ferguson can speak on the research institutes.  I will ask Ms Bourke to contribute on the ETS.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.1428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Bourke" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018101800002#F00800"><p>The emissions trading scheme is the key scheme for getting the large energy users into energy efficiency.  We are now moving into phase 4 post-2021 and each iteration of the scheme is more stringent, with less auctioning of allowances.  Surplus allowances will be withdrawn through a market stability reserve.  That will increase the price of allowances within the ETS and lead to the more efficient operation of the scheme.  That scheme has just been negotiated.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will be going out to consultation shortly on some of the options within that scheme and looking for applications on it.  Each phase of the scheme is leading to an increased price of carbon, which will incentivise emissions reduction.  That is our main focus for companies in the beverages, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and ICT areas, the dairy co-operatives and food companies.</p> <p>  In parallel, there is the large energy user scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Two hundred of the large energy users are engaged in that scheme.  They account for 50% of total industrial use and 20% of primary energy use.</p> <p>  There is a series of other schemes for the smaller users to try to improve energy efficiency with mentoring programmes, access to technology experts and management training in the area of energy reduction.  There are a number of agency client companies and businesses and the key objectives of those is to reduce their energy consumption.</p> <p>  As Dr. Quinn referred to earlier, we have worked with companies on corporate social responsibility and shown how businesses can improve their business activity by showing they are energy efficient and sustainable.  Increasingly, we are seeing consumers and users demanding that of corporations.</p></speech>

Deputy Sherlock asked about the research centres that would be involved in climate change.  There are four, principally.  MaREI is the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centre for marine renewable energy.  The SFI investment on that is &euro;18.9 million, to the nearest &euro;100,000.  There is almost a comparable investment from industry and the EU for all these research centres but that is the SFI investment.  BEACON, which is about the bio-economy and will be formally launched tomorrow in Lisheen, is an SFI investment of &euro;15 million.  iCRAG, which is about applied geosciences, is an investment from SFI of &euro;24.8 million.  VistaMilk, which was launched recently and is about precision dairy, is an investment from our Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine of &euro;25.6 million.  Each of those research centres do research that is relevant in some way or another to climate change.  I extend a very warm welcome to the committee members to visit any or all of those research centres; we would be delighted to host them.  MaREI is in Cork, as is VistaMilk, and BEACON and iCRAG are at University College Dublin.</p><p>Committee members would be very welcome and we would be happy to host them.  </p><p> I will say a couple of words-----</p></speech>

On specific programmes to assist companies, there is a range of initiatives.  Ms Dwyer from Enterprise Ireland and Mr. Donoghue from IDA Ireland can give details of specific initiatives where we work with companies.</p></speech>

Competitiveness and innovation are the areas where the environmental supports for companies are most relevant.  As has been mentioned, there is the ETS for larger companies.  For smaller companies, in particular, we have a significant number of competitiveness supports under the Lean programme.  The programme aims to make companies aware of the dividend available by improving their resource efficiency.  That will increase their competitiveness and, in many cases these days, their access to the customer base.  We know that consumer demand is driving behavioural change in companies.  Our competitiveness supports for companies in this area range from straightforward guide books on resource efficiency for smaller companies - many of our client companies are quite small - through to funding feasibility projects to examine improving production design to make it more environmentally sustainable.</p> <p>  On the innovation side, there are a number of initiatives co-funded by us and IDA Ireland and in close co-operation with SFI.  Our technology centres, for example, are industry-led, collaborative research entities that look at where industries together can achieve a competitive advantage through research.  In a number of the technology centres there is a strong focus on energy efficiency and improving environmental outcomes.  A good example is the dairy processing technology centre based in the University of Limerick, in which all of the major dairy players are involved.  As well as looking at their cost competitiveness, one of the pillars is energy efficiency and environmental research.</p></speech>

Two specific initiatives might be of interest to the Deputy.  In 2009 we introduced an environmental aid programme which we marketed and promoted to our clients to encourage them to adopt renewable energies - combined heat and power, biomass, CHP energy efficiency and so forth.  There has been a significant take-up of the scheme by our large energy users.  It has allowed many of them to move to 100% renewables or significantly change the fuel mix in their energy use.  The second initiative was we established new forms of FDI teams in 2015 and tasked them with going to the marketplace to identify potential investment opportunities aligned with a pro-environment, positive climate action agenda.  We have won a number of investments in that area, for example, smart metering, new forms of energy and so forth.  During the summer we also introduced our Go Green programme which we are actively promoting to our clients to raise environmental awareness within the portfolio.  We are providing financial incentives for them to reduce their energy usage, become more efficient and move to a 100% renewables model.</p></speech>

In what way is the Department connecting with it?  We heard at one of our previous meetings that the retrofitting of domestic houses was going to be crucial.  I believe there will be a great deal of business in that area for small and medium enterprises.  Does the Department have a link with local enterprise offices, for example?  They are a targeted group that is connecting at that level.  Do they have a climate agenda in considering businesses they could potentially assist?</p></speech>

There was a major refresh of our research priority themes in 2017, as part of which we introduced decarbonising the energy system and sustainable living as a new priority.  As we roll out programmes and adapt, they set the priorities.  </p> <p>  I will have to refer back to the Deputy on the LEOs, unless Mr. Hegarty wishes to comment.</p></speech>

We will see if we have any information on LEOs funding or assisting companies in that area, but I take the Deputy's point that it is an opportunity.  More generally, there are opportunities in adapting to climate change.  We want to ensure our programmes and agencies are able to facilitate and exploit these opportunities.</p></speech>

In the refresh of priorities we have identified advanced and smart manufacturing and manufacturing of novel materials which we see as opportunities.  We also redirect funding and grants in that area.  The disruptive technologies fund had a specific theme to address climate change challenges.

In fact, we are the major funder in some of the research activities.  We co-fund with it and make sure the research is aligned with its policy and implementation.  Clearly, it does not have anything to do with retrofitting but with future stuff.  There will be new opportunities, not just in mitigation but also in the active removal of greenhouse gases.  I hope the committee will look at new science in taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  There are major opportunities for Ireland in that area.</p><p>There are various technologies, from the rehydration of bogs and peatlands to the pumping of CO2 into the spaces vacated by gas extraction, which produces low-carbon gas - the Corrib field would be a good place for this - to the absorption of CO2 from crushed basalt, of which we have a lot, particularly in Donegal, to the new way of manufacturing concrete and then to very active CO2 capture.  By way of showing the committee that some of this research is coming through, a company called Silicon Kingdom Holdings, which is all of two weeks old, is carrying out active CO2 capture in Ireland and will build a small pilot CO2 farm over the course of 2019-2020, with one or two clusters of CO2 collectors, each capable of capturing approximately 1 tonne of CO2 a day.  Its plan envisages CO2 farms of 120,000 collectors, which would capture 3 megatonnes of CO2 per annum.</p><p> In managing climate change, we definitely must implement all the mitigation measures on which the committee is focused but we also must think of active ways of managing greenhouse gases by removing them from the atmosphere.  We will never have a carbon-zero economy, and this acknowledgement must be part of the strategy.  There is a lot science in this regard which is mostly at the research stage.  However, some of it is filtering through to the commercial stage.</p></speech>

Professor Ferguson mentioned some of the State agencies and referred to  bogs.  I am from the midlands so, naturally enough, my ears pricked up straight away.  What kind of engagement have the witnesses had with the biggest landowners in the country, namely, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, regarding the resources they possess?  They are very progressive in what they want to do.</p> <p>  My other question is more of an observation.  I refer to the responsibility to get the message and the communication strategy out that while it is a huge challenge for us to decarbonise society, there are huge opportunities for business in it.  Are the witnesses prioritising this in light of the IPCC report?</p></speech>

I recommend that the committee talk to Professor Murray Hitzman, who is the director of iCRAG.  Rehydrating bogs is a most effective way of capturing carbon.  Basically, the plant takes CO2 out of the environment.  It does not decay properly so all the CO2 is trapped in the bog.  There are people looking very actively at this, and iCRAG is working very closely with Bord na M&oacute;na.  I will hand over to my colleagues for the other questions.</p></speech>

In this regard, it is important that we are represented on all the relevant groups.  We are represented, for example, on the climate action high-level steering group.  We are on the Cabinet committee that the Taoiseach chairs on economic infrastructure and climate change.  We are on the technical research and modelling group and the senior officials' group on sustainable development goals, energy labelling and offshore renewable energy.  To all these areas we bring the expertise of our colleagues in our offices and agencies.  I should also mention the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which is not represented today, because one of our offices has a huge role in setting standards in this area.  We bring that into all these fora and work collectively with colleagues to inform Government policy.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach stated just a few months ago, Ireland is a laggard.  All the information is stacking up to show us this.  The IPCC report just last week gives us a 12-year window.  As a result, our ambition in this area cannot be great enough.  I have a number of questions about just transition.  In her report, Dr. Quinn rightly recognises the economic opportunities which come from the transition to low-carbon and circular economies.  However, she fails to refer to the impacts on employees and communities which have come to depend on this fossil fuel economy.  These impacts are significant and we must address them out of concern for the welfare of the citizens and communities involved.  In addition, failing to ensure a just transition makes making the transition even more difficult.  What is the Department's understanding of the just transition process and what are its plans for the coming years?  We have a just transition commission, and SIPTU, ICTU, F&oacute;rsa and IMPACT have all been working on this issue for some time.  What is the Department doing to help the trade unions support their employees?  Could the witnesses give an indication of specific things it is doing in this regard?</p> <p>  Health, the arts, education and community work are low-carbon job areas in Ireland, which is great.  What supports is the Department giving to these industries to grow in the context of climate?  Is it refusing to support the expansion of fossil fuel-based economic activity?  From an enterprise perspective, has it set a line in the sand and said, "That is it.  It is over.  No more support for the fossil fuel-based industry."?</p> <p>  Regarding renewable jobs, at least 7,200 jobs in solar are waiting in the pipeline.  David Connolly's Green Plan Ireland and the Northern Ireland Green New Deal Group have both outlined how there are opportunities for 100,000 new jobs if Government takes action now.  I do not see any mention of this kind of ambition in Dr. Quinn's report.  Why is that?  As Professor Ferguson outlined, an opportunity exists.  Why are we not unleashing this opportunity?  We do not see it in Dr. Quinn's report.</p> <p>  Regarding FDI, Microsoft, for example, is looking for 100% renewable energy to run its offices and IDA Ireland is not providing this.  Why is that the case?  Ireland is the second windiest country in Europe after Scotland.  In Scotland, 50% of renewables are owned by community co-operatives.  Why are we not doing the same here?  What measures could be put in place to support the community co-operative system?  What is the Department doing to provide good-quality jobs in cheap energy for rural Ireland?</p> <p>  What is its definition of "sustainability" in the context of climate change?  What is the analytical approach used by the Department in assessing the sustainability of business in Ireland?  Does the Department carry out carbon footprint analysis?  Does it measure material flows?  Does it have a unit with the necessary expertise to analyse the sustainability and climate impact of policies which affect business?  How-----</p></speech>

That plan is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but we obviously have a very strong interest in it and have played our part as a stakeholder.  We must acknowledge that there are implications for employment in any transition, including, as Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned, in terms of peat extraction, power generation and other environmental services.  We are very conscious of the transition period that some enterprises need in order to move from their current state to a low-carbon state.  The bioeconomy policy statement, for example, identified the opportunities to grow rural and regional businesses and jobs, and we see this as a major opportunity.  In fact, I think when the Minister published her most recent budget statement, her focus was very much on Brexit, regional development and innovation, which are the three themes on which we are working with her to deliver.  There is huge potential to grow rural business.  We accept that for some enterprises the opportunities are not there and it will take time.  We also recognise that our current employment figures are extremely successful and we now face a very different set of problems from those we faced seven years ago when we had 16% unemployment.  We now have 5.4% unemployment.  Again, part of the model we are working on will flow from the research that Professor Ferguson outlined regarding the pilot bioeconomy centre at Lisheen.</p><p> We are aware of the new employment opportunities from a circular economy.  This is one of the areas we have flagged.  We are currently working on and hope to publish in January the future jobs initiative for Ireland.  Up to now we have had the Action Plan for Jobs.  It has been extremely successful and delivered 370,000 jobs.  However, we are in a different phase of economic development now so we are working on identifying the following: quality jobs; pressure points; and areas where Ireland can innovate and add value.  That reflects back on the work that we have done in identifying our research priorities.  It will set our priorities and how we advance for the next future cycle of Ireland's development.</p><p> I have outlined our position.  Perhaps my colleagues might wish to comment.</p></speech>

It is important to put on the record that IDA Ireland actively encourages and supports all of its clients to act in an environmentally sustainable way.  As members will know, the vast majority of the companies involved come from very mature and well-developed economies with high environmental sensibilities.  They bring with them into our economy those sensibilities, an environmental awareness and a desire to embrace best practice in terms of sustainability.  Globally, Microsoft moved to a 100% renewables energy model in 2014 so it is already there.  Recently, Microsoft entered into a power purchase agreement in Ireland with a wind farm constructed by General Electric in County Kerry.  That is another practical example of what our clients are doing in this jurisdiction in order to act in an environmentally sustainable manner.</p></speech>

As already stated, we have an environmental aid programme.  This means that there is a suite of financial incentives we can deploy and utilise with out clients.  Separately, and consistent with Government policy that dates back to 2010, we sponsored the establishment of the International Energy Research Centre at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.  One of our clients, United Technologies, also brought in an energy research centre.  Deputy Eamon Ryan would have been a major advocate for that centre at the time.  The initiative has proved very positive and sends a signal to our clients about the importance that we attach to the environment.  The initiative also enables companies to carry out environment-related research in this jurisdiction.</p></speech>

The opportunities that are available to enterprises in Ireland in the area of clean technology have been mentioned.  Enterprise Ireland, recognising that there are opportunities in renewable energy, energy efficiency, smart services, etc., has had a designated sectoral grouping of what we call our clean-tech clients for a number of years.  Similar to all other Enterprise Ireland clients, the members of this group are supported in their research and innovation, in their competitiveness and in areas such as management development in order to make them better at realising opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland supports the enterprises in this sector to realise opportunities.  Very importantly, Enterprise Ireland builds a lot of awareness among companies of what other companies provide in terms of services.  While a lot of work is done to make companies aware of energy efficiency and how it can impact on their business, there is also an ecosystem by means of which companies are brought together in order to make them aware of the services others provide and to generate opportunities.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland is a co-ordinator for the EU's research programme Horizon 2020.  Irish companies have secured a significant amount of funding in recent years in the area of energy efficiency, grid integration and ocean energy in particular.  The companies are supported by Enterprise Ireland and the other agencies to win research funding thus improving their understanding and ability to deliver services and products in this area that will make them market leaders.</p></speech>

The Senator has ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.1465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018101800002#J00700"><p>I will not need ten minutes.  I will be as brief as possible.</p> <p>  Most of the conversation has been about working with existing companies and trying to improve their efficiencies.  How far outside the factory gate do our guests' organisations go?  Does they have an input in that regard?  I am talking here in terms of the national development plan or the national planning framework.  One can have the most efficient company business, whatever their business may be, but if they are located in the wrong place, their workers can have an enormous carbon footprint.  How far down the line do they go in having an input into that aspect?</p> <p>  Jobs and job creation are king, especially for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Let us say that a super company wants to locate operations here.  It is a massive FDI opportunity and there is massive job potential but, depending on the nature of the business, it does not tick all of the boxes when it comes to policies on CO2 or other greenhouse gas emissions.  Where would our guests draw the line?  Would climate change take precedence?  Where would they draw the line and say, "Sorry, we are not interested.  We suggest you go somewhere else"?  Let us say afterwards it becomes public knowledge that the organisations our guests represent turned away a company that wanted to create 1,000 jobs.  In that instance, how would they justify turning down such an opportunity?  Would they say that the company in question was going to have an enormous impact in the context of the greenhouse gas emissions of this nation?  Where would they draw the line?  Where would they finish their negotiations as to how they can achieve more acceptable figures when it comes to CO2 emissions or whatever?  How much precedence would climate change be afforded in negotiations?</p> <p>  My final questions relate to interdepartmental communication and the initiatives the Department is driving through research and development.  In terms of the companies that are buying in and that are actively involved in research and development and improving their processes through the work the Department is doing with them, how successful are their efforts?  How difficult is it for companies to recruit the employees they need to work on new initiatives?  What level of communication has the Department got with the education and science sectors, for example, in terms of apprenticeships or third-level training or education for the workforce that, possibly, is going to be needed if people row in with the Department and are successful in developing their industries?</p></speech>

I will answer the Senator's final question first.  We are very involved with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Education and Skills is chair of the national skills council, of which my Department is a member.  The Department would feed in, very strongly, in terms of its view of the economy, apprenticeships and skills because we hear that directly from the industry representative groups.  We play a strong role.</p> <p>  The Senator asked how far does the Department go in terms of an enterprise and employees.  That is not our role.  Our role is to work with enterprise but we do very much work with companies.  For example, in the retail sector, the retail forum is chaired by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We can exert influence on things like plastic packaging and we support our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which has overall responsibility in that area.  Retailers have announced initiatives to reduce the amount of plastic packaging they use.  Again, we can support such initiatives and we can bring companies together.  I know that Enterprise Ireland will convene an industry-led conference on the matter in early 2019.  My Department has what I call a soft influence in those areas and we work collectively with colleagues across other Departments.  It is not our role to assess what other colleagues are doing in terms of their initiatives.  We will certainly come back through on the evidence of the research.  It is on that basis that we work.</p> <p>  The Senator asked how far we would we go.  Mr. Donoghue may also wish to comment on this aspect.  The Department operates within the policies, guidelines and criteria set down by the Government.</p><p>We use the current guidelines.  Mr. Donoghue may want to add a word to that.  Ireland is not in the business of attracting business that is not sustainable or that damages our reputation.  That is really where we position ourselves.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting question.  I would say that the vast majority of the sectors that we target are relatively low emitters of CO2.  Considering the composition of our business, a lot of it is now services rather than manufacturing and those businesses tend to have a low carbon footprint and are attracted to compact, urban centres with public transport and so on.  In terms of the commuting patterns associated with their workforce and the type of goods and services they deliver to the global marketplace, we do not associate them with potential damage to the environment from a carbon emitting perspective.</p> <p>  On the manufacturing side, the types of clients that we win in the life science and bio-pharmaceutical sectors have all embraced very strong environmental agendas at corporate HQ overseas.  They bring those agendas into Ireland and we see them immediately taking steps at their local sites to embrace 100% renewable energy and to take a range of actions consistent with the best interests of the environment.  Specifically in response to the question, we have never had to turn down an investment on the basis that it was high carbon emitting.  We have not come across that scenario.</p></speech>

It is about the bio-economy.  It officially launches tomorrow.  It is in the Lisheen disused mine.  The researchers are concentrating on how to get high value products out of waste, specifically from the dairy industry.  When dairy products are processed, by-products are often put into landfill.  They can be made into lactic acid, which is a starting block for building a bio-plastic.  We can make plastics from milk, to be simplistic about it.  It is scaling.  Glanbia, which members will know is a large co-op, secured a very large grant of about &euro;30 million from the European Union.  We and others are co-funders of that.  Glanbia is building a pilot plant to process the waste that has been piloted in this research into building blocks for the circular economy.</p> <p>  We want to do a lot more in fishing, where there is a lot of waste, and in other areas.  The bio-economy is an active area.  There is a policy on it from the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have implemented this with very good funding though a research centre and there are companies pulling through on that.  We are working closely with our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and other bodies.  Of course there is more that can be done.</p></speech>

Things are going to be stepped up a gear very quickly on that.  One of the big issues we are facing is the availability of biomass.  This issue crosses over with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other Departments.  What is being done to develop a biomass industry here?  A related issue is biogas.  On the Continent, other countries are ahead of us even though proportionately they do not have as large an agricultural sector as we have and do not have the peat sector or the landmass to locate some of these plants.

They are taking forward a number of actions.  One is around making sure we have coherence between all the sectoral strategies that impact on the bio-economy.  That is really mapping out what is happening across the board.  They are also looking at a network of representatives of commercial entities operating within the bio-economy and the relevant public bodies.  That is where the likes of Bord na M&oacute;na would be coming in.  They are looking at recommendations of how that can be impacted.</p> <p>  Professor Ferguson has already alluded to research.

There were a number of recommendations in that report that the Department of Education and Skills took up with regard to apprenticeship training and traineeships and, more particularly, looking to see whether we needed specific graduate programmes in some of these areas of renewable energy.  The decision was that the graduate students need to come through the core programmes and do an add-on module as they specialise in these particular areas.</p></speech>

I am talking about businesses bearing carbon taxes - we are told we need more carbon taxes - as well as the public service obligation levies on their electricity bills and every other thing that we are going to be asking of them.  What is the cost and how will that affect our competitiveness internationally?</p><p>Has it been assessed formally and how has that been done?</p><p> Under the national planning framework, does the Department have a mandate now to roll out job creation in the regions that are structurally weaker and which have not attracted jobs in the same fashion that the big urban centres have?  We often hear job announcements; I know we hear only about the foreign direct investment, FDI, jobs, but they are still all in the cities and not in rural areas, that is, the counties or areas that do not have big cities.  It seems that in spite of our objectives to spread development more, and to take the pressure off Dublin, Galway, Limerick and so on, the natural way the economy is developing is that these cities are becoming more and more pressurised because they are where everybody wants to invest.  What policies has the Department developed since the national planning framework?  On the different regional action plans for jobs to ensure there is more job creation in these areas, what specifically is the Department doing?  </p><p> There are regular parliamentary questions on how many visits there have been by the IDA with a potential investor into counties such as Mayo or Roscommon, which have some FDI.  There has been growth in FDI but it is in the companies that are already there and which have been there for years, which we welcome, but there is no new investment and it is often only a handful of visits a year.  What is the IDA doing now that is different to realise the objectives of the national planning framework, specifically to regional areas, bearing in mind that there are issues with getting investment in those areas?  One thing that comes to mind is the whole area of data centres.  We are told there are issues with Apple, where an issue with planning delayed the whole project.  In Mayo we have planning permission for a data centre where there is a high-speed transatlantic fibre-optic cable, and there is planning permission for a combined heat and power plant beside it.  There are no takers for the data centre, however.  What is being done to promote investment in these situations?</p><p> Are some parts of the country more attractive from investment and energy security points of view?  Some parts of the country have better energy security and better transmission infrastructure than others.  Is that an impediment?  Will the witnesses identify the areas of the countries where it is not so attractive and, where, if one was looking for a great deal of power one might not invest?  Where do we need to invest in infrastructure?</p></speech>

We have a target that we should be within 1% of the national average outside Dublin, which all the regions of Ireland have achieved with the exception of one, namely, the midlands.  In the Senator's area, the west, it is 6.7%, while the figure for the State is 6%.

I do not think we will ever see an Ireland with a concentration of jobs in every village, but we need to ensure we have sufficient presence across the region, which I think people in Dublin would say about commuting as well.  It is about trying to make it clustered and attractive for companies and people to locate, and it has been extremely positive.  Both the agencies have been extremely successful in growing jobs, as have the local enterprise offices across all the regions of Ireland.</p> <p>  From our perspective, regional employment is one of our main priorities, as I mentioned earlier.  Yesterday we met with the heads of the eight regional action plans for jobs, all of whom are private-sector people, in each of the regions with committees, highlighting the particular attractiveness and opportunities in each region because each region is different, and discussing how we can support them.  We have a team of people in the Department working collectively with each of those regional action teams, which is how we drive employment forward.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Donoghue to answer the Senator's question on the IDA visits.</p></speech>

The Senator makes valid points.  Our approach to this is that we must try to match the right locations with the profile of the investor.  It is important we take the investors' needs into account.  One must consider that an increasing number are in the services sector and they emphasise the importance of locations either in or near cities.  That does not prevent us, however, from showcasing other locations.  We take a hierarchical approach, from cities and city regions to large towns and rural areas, as appropriate.  Manufacturers, for example, do not want to locate in a city or city region.  Rather, they want their own dedicated site in a more rural location.  We showcase a variety of locations, therefore, to our clients.  In Mayo, specifically, we have taken the step of putting an advance office building in Castlebar, and the Government has given us &euro;150 million specifically for a regional property development programme to put some of the enabling infrastructure in place in advance of an investment decision, with a view to raising the overall attractiveness of a variety of locations including rural areas.</p> <p>  On data centres, there are approximately 45 in the country.  We look at their development in two phases.  They first appeared in the 1990s and the vast majority of them were attracted to the eastern seaboard and the region near Dublin for two reasons.  They needed high-capacity, high-speed broadband and they needed access to the high-capacity points in the electricity grid.  There was an automatic bias, therefore, towards the eastern seaboard, which was understandable from their perspective to enable their businesses to operate.  Following EirGrid's reinforcement and investment in the national grid on a national basis, and following investment in fibre-optic cables, we anticipate a second phase of growth where the data centres will take a more active look at regional locations, potentially including the Senator's region.  We have completed a report looking at a variety of locations in a regional context that could potentially accommodate the next phase of data centre development.  We now see the data centre industry potentially becoming an instrument or a vehicle for regional development.</p></speech>

Some research was published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, last week which argued that for the exports sector the effects of an increase in the carbon tax of &euro;5 per tonne would be relatively small in terms of competitiveness.  That is the ESRI's finding and I just wished to draw the committee's attention to it.  There are limitations attached to the institute's methodology, however, and one cannot infer that a much bigger increase in the carbon tax would not necessarily have a stronger effect.</p></speech>

If there is an industry for which it is a concern, are there enough support mechanisms for the industry to go to the next level, to take an industry from one that presented a problem historically to becoming one that will be able to contend with new regulations and commitments to targets that they would struggle to achieve on its own?</p></speech>

That is the starting point.  To the extent that an investment might appear in the IDA's portfolio where the carbon footprint of the investor is above average, the IDA has a range of programmes and schemes that it would draw to the attention of that investor to enable it to proactively lower its carbon emissions by, for example, moving to a 100% renewable energy model.  The IDA would be proactive in that context.</p></speech>

The discussion has moved to a different space now and we are dealing with energy and its effect on greenhouse gas emissions.  Returning to the success of the Action Plan for Jobs and the governance of that, the committee, in the course of its work around climate change, has become aware of the fact that this needs to be cross-departmental.  A clear governance structure is needed if Ireland wants to meet its 2030 and 2050 targets.  From the witnesses' experience, how did the governance of the action plan for jobs work?  How were the different public bodies held to account?  Was that a new structure?  Unemployment reduced from 16% to 5% and the committee would appreciate any enlightenment as to that governance structure that may be able to work for us.</p></speech>

It was led by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of the Taoiseach.  We had that whole-of-Government approach from the word go.  Within the framework we set, each Department identified the actions it could take to deliver.  There was a strong focus on delivery and implementation thereafter.  Representatives from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation met quarterly with the Taoiseach, as part of a Cabinet committee, to report on the action plan and how Departments were doing.  There was a strong governance approach, which was important.  There was also strong input from colleagues.  Addressing Ireland's unemployment problem was recognised as a huge and important emergency issue.  It had huge buy-in around the system and people recognised its importance.</p></speech>

The first plan had something like 320 actions.  Some of them were small, although everything had an importance.  When we move to future jobs, we are talking about 20 big actions, so we are trying to home in on what is important.  That is not to say those 20 actions will ignore things that are already happening but some Departments are doing that work anyway and do not need the collective, cross-Government approach.  The Department has learned over the seven years of the Action Plan for Jobs that each new iteration saw a reduced number of actions and the Department prioritised based on what was high impact and what was low impact.  The focus in the next phase, next year, will be on the 20 big things that can be done to drive Ireland's enterprise and economic approach for the next ten years.</p></speech>

The stick was probably the reporting.  Department officials regularly reported to the Taoiseach, or the relevant Minister, or a Cabinet committee.  I would not call it the stick, but it was important from that perspective that a track was kept.  There were many actions taken collectively, not just within one Department.  Many of the things our Department does are not delivered by ourselves, but through work with colleagues across Government.  People recognised that and there was a lot of working together on joint projects, which was positive.</p></speech>

How will we decouple economic growth from the greenhouse gas emissions?  I am a little disappointed because I was hoping for some blue sky stuff today where we would be talking about renewables and the enterprise and opportunities that are happening here and now in renewables and I have heard nothing in that regard.</p> <p>  Has Dr. Quinn looked at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly?  What opportunities does she see in the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly relating to enterprise and innovation?  I am looking at micro-generation.  How can the Department support communities in terms of micro-generation?  What tools has the Department available to it?  We need to recognise the urgency.  We are talking about 12 years.  We need a massive change in how we are doing business and enterprise in Ireland.  There are opportunities in terms of innovation.  Could the witnesses give me some sense of that?</p> <p>  What is the Department doing to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in terms of oil exploration and oil and gas exploitation?</p><p>In terms of the mechanisms that are emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, what work is going on in the Department to stop this happening as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the great work being done by Science Foundation Ireland.  In his opening statement, Professor Ferguson referenced marine energy resources.  Will he comment on the road towards the commercial viability of wave energy and offshore wind not in the Irish Sea but in the Atlantic Ocean, where this is more challenging?</p></speech>

On the Department's response to the Citizens' Assembly, the assembly is hugely important but I think its work in this area was more focused on the private individual than on enterprise.  The Department has to address climate change in the context of enterprise across Ireland.  There is no doubt that there are conflicting objectives here.  For enterprises to be able to plan and change takes time, support and assistance.  In regard to micro-generation, to be helpful I will send the committee details on the regional action plans and the dedicated work that is ongoing in this area.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  The committee's discussions, appropriately, are focused around mitigation, reducing emissions, trying to insulate and do things better and that is terrific but there is new science coming on stream around how to actively cut emissions without necessarily cutting activity.  I will send the committee the report of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering entitled, Greenhouse Gas Removal, from which I will comment on two or three issues relevant to Ireland.  </p> <p>  I have spoken a little about the rehydration of peatlands and carbon capture.  I ask that the committee not necessarily demonise oil and gas because we are getting close to low carbon gas.  There is a lot of gas extraction going on offshore in Mayo and Cork.  Once gas has been extracted from a particular area one then concentrates on pumping back down carbon dioxide.  These fossil fuels will be required in any transition to a low carbon economy.  The trick is to lower the carbon footprint of the gas extraction.  There is a big business opportunity in terms of reusing the vast amount of empty space available once the gas has been taken out.</p> <p>  I would like now to focus on an issue I have not spoken about before, particularly for the benefit of members from rural Ireland.  Five per cent of the world's global emissions are from concrete manufacture.  Concrete is used in buildings.  When silica is heated it gives off carbon dioxide and this leaves one with a carbonate which makes concrete.  There is an alternative way of doing this.  Basalt, of which there is a lot in Donegal and in the North of Ireland, can be crushed into a powder and spread over the ground.  It then absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  This is one way of trapping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  This can be used as a fertiliser but interestingly it can also be used for making concrete.  If concrete is made in the way I have just described not only is the carbon footprint reduced, the concrete is stronger and throughout the life of the building it absorbs CO2 .  In terms of visionary thinking, grinding up basalt would lead to a whole new industry in rural Ireland.  This is a really interesting strategy, which is at research stage and also at the early implementation stage.  There is a very exciting and active research pathway but it would be wrong to say that any of those is immediately commercialisable.  </p> <p>  Senator Mulherin asked about marine renewable energy, which is definitely an active research area.  Currently, it is expensive and inefficient, which is being examined in the research.  Wind and so on is much more efficient at the present time but this does not mean that wave energy cannot improve.  There are active research groups around the world, including Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, MaREI, SFI's research centre in Cork.  I encourage the committee to visit the centre, where members will see test wave plants and so on.  Wave energy has potential for the future.  All of these areas for potential for the future.  </p> <p>  As a scientist I am optimistic.  Climate change is a big problem and a big issue but I remind the committee that no crisis that was ever predicted in human history has come to pass.  Many times we have predicted that we were going to run out of food but it has never happened.  Why?  It is because science innovation has moved faster than the crisis, through either mechanisation of forms, the fertilisation of ground, genetic engineering of crops and so on.  I believe the opportunity in climate change will be for the science and innovation to move faster than the problem.  This means doing what we do better in terms of mitigation and so on and focusing on new industries.  I ask the committee not to lose sight of this and that we have to transition from existing fossil fuels into an new era, part of which is low carbon gas.</p></speech>

I am responsible for civil law reform and courts policy in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Mr. Seamus Carroll is responsible for, among other matters, the area of land and conveyancing law, and Ms Madeleine Reid is responsible for, among other matters, the areas of insolvency, bankruptcy and related matters.</p> <p>  Mortgages provide lending institutions with security for their loans.  In the event of financial difficulties resulting in default by the borrower, a lending institution&rsquo;s claim on the secured property takes precedence over the claims of other creditors.  The appointment of a receiver is one of the principal remedies available to lending institutions in cases of mortgage default.</p><p>Where the lender does not wish to take possession of the mortgaged property in such cases, the alternative remedy of appointing a receiver to ensure more efficient management of a business such as a shop or a hotel, or to receive rents where housing or accommodation has been leased or let to tenants, may be a more effective option.  In this latter case, the receiver&rsquo;s main task will be to repay the mortgage from the proceeds of the rental income.<br/><br/>The appointment of a receiver does not normally arise in the case of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence, which is a key issue, but rather in the case of commercial property, including buy-to-let, BTL, premises.  Where a borrower has mortgages over several properties, the appointment of the receiver facilitates a more orderly approach to the management or disposal of the premises.<br/><br/>As Professor John Wylie, who members may know is the author of the classic text on Irish land and conveyancing law, points out in <i>Irish Land Law</i>, there are several sources of appointment of receivers to land and the position of the receiver, particularly in terms of his or her duties and powers, will vary according to that source.  Provision for the appointment of a receiver in the case of default is normally contained in the mortgage contract, especially in the case of commercial property.  The point about the contractual basis for many receiverships is critical.<br/><br/>Professor Wylie identifies categories of receiver as a &quot;fixed charge&quot; receiver who is appointed over a specific mortgaged property; such a receiver is entitled to collect any rental income.  A receiver may be appointed to manage the mortgaged property where the objective is to rescue the business, if possible.  Another form of receivership arises where court assistance is sought by a creditor who has been unable to execute a judgment obtained against the debtor by other legal means.<br/><br/>Arising from the fact that receivers are generally appointed under the terms of the mortgage contract, rather than on application to court, detailed information on the number of receivers appointed, and the properties to which they have been appointed, is not available.<br/><br/>The committee's invitation specifically referred to the two Acts, namely, the Conveyancing Act 1881 and the Land and Conveyancing and Law Reform Act 2009.  Apart from the express power to appoint a receiver that is normally reserved in the mortgage contract itself, lending institutions have had a statutory power going back to 1881 to appoint a receiver to land.  Section 19 of the 1881 Act has a statutory power which permits a mortgagee to appoint a receiver over the mortgaged land, and this power has been carried over into section 108 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, which, as the members probably know, is an Act which consolidated and reformed many hundreds of years of land and conveyancing law.<br/><br/>The power to appoint a receiver under section 19 of the 1881 Act and section 108 of the 2009 Act applies generally to legal mortgages and registered charges.  Under the 1881 Act, which applies still to pre-2009 mortgages, the power to appoint a receiver arises when the mortgage money became due but it is not exercisable until default occurs; under the 2009 Act, the power vests when the mortgage is created but, again, can only be exercised in the event of default.<br/><br/>The main function of a receiver in these cases is to manage the mortgaged property and to use the rental income to repay the mortgage.  The 1881 Act also provides that a receiver shall have the power to demand and recover all the income of the property, and this power is also carried over in the 2009 Act.<br/><br/>On regulation of receivers,<b></b>as my Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation colleagues will discuss with the committee in due course, receivers appointed to corporate entities are subject to regulatory provisions set out in the Companies Act 2014.  Part 8 of that Act also sets out requirements governing the appointment of receivers, their powers and duties, regulation etc.  These statutory provisions do not apply in the case of receivers appointed to mortgaged property held by non-corporate entities.  While neither the 1881 nor the 2009 Acts contain provisions in respect of regulation of receivers, the provisions of the 2014 Act will apply where the mortgagor is a corporate entity.<br/><br/>In terms of obligations on receivers, under existing law, including relevant case law, a receiver appointed to mortgaged property is subject to a number of important obligations.  A lending institution must act in good faith, and fairly, when appointing a receiver; the lender must not act in a manner that unfairly prejudices the borrower; on his or her appointment, the receiver is also obliged to act in good faith both to the lending institution and the borrower in his or her management of the mortgaged property; where a receiver chooses, for whatever reason, to exercise a power of sale, he or she is obliged to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the mortgaged property for the benefit of both the lender and the borrower; and the receiver must act as a reasonable person would act in selling the property.<br/><br/>The receiver, and this is an important consideration, and any agents employed by him or her for the purposes of exercising his or her functions as receiver, will be held liable for the commission by them of offences, whether against an individual under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 or otherwise under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts.  Enforcement of these statutory provisions is a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.<br/><br/>With regard to possible licensing reform - I am nearly finished - during a Topical Issue debate recently, which concerned events outside premises on North Frederick Street in Dublin, the Minister for Justice and Equality referred to possible changes to licensing requirements for those involved in the execution of court orders.  He stated that while matters concerning the enforcement of a court order are a matter for the courts, consideration was being given in his Department to the matter of oversight.  This could include the introduction of a licensing regime for personnel directly involved in enforcement actions.  One possible option to be looked at would be to extend the licensing remit of the Private Security Authority, which operates a licensing system for the private security sector, to such persons.  By such persons we mean security type personnel who are there with the receivers, and sometimes when receivers are executing their powers.  An examination is currently under way and recommendations will be submitted to the Minister in early course in respect of that.<br/><br/>Finally, I refer to work that has been going on in the<b></b>Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It established a working group on receivers last year to examine the scope for amending legislation to provide for greater protection of tenants&rsquo; rights during the receivership process under Action 5 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector.  The appointment of a receiver to a buy-to-let property can create great confusion and concern for the tenants of such properties, and it is important that their interests and rights be protected during the receivership process.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice and Equality, together with our colleagues from other Departments including the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance, and the Office of the Attorney General, has participated in the working group.<br/><br/>The objective of this initiative is to improve protection of the rights of tenants during the receivership process, in particular regarding the discharge of landlord obligations by receivers.  The working group sought legal opinion on the feasibility of amending legislation to provide for greater protection of tenants&rsquo; rights during the receivership process.  The final report of the working group is being prepared at present for presentation, I understand, to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in the near future.  We are mentioning that because I am aware that particular aspect has also been a key element of the public discourse about receivers, particularly where receivers, or groups of receivers, are appointed to buy-to-let properties where there has been a default on the mortgage by the buy-to-let lender.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to contribute here today and to answer questions.  We are happy to help the committee in any way we can.</p></speech>

I am a principal officer in the company law unit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  To my left is my colleague, Ms Tara Coogan, who is also a principal officer in the Department.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to address issues concerning the governance and regulation of receivers in the context of the Companies Act 2014.<br/><br/>At the outset, as Mr. McKenna has emphasised, it is important to state that the principal source of law relating to receivership is contract law.  Receivership is a long-standing legal mechanism for the enforcement of security.  By far the most common method of appointment of a receiver is under the power contained in a debenture.  A receiver is an appointed person whose duty is to receive a debtor&rsquo;s assets and property for and on behalf of a creditor who is entitled to take them in satisfaction of the debtor&rsquo;s obligations, pursuant to a written agreement.  Parties to the contract, for example a company and a lending institution, agree that one of the terms on which the company borrows money is that, in the circumstances specified in the agreement, the lending institution can appoint a receiver over its assets.  The parties have freedom to contract and agree contractual terms, including in respect of the appointment of a receiver.<br/><br/>While the terms on which a receiver can be appointed may vary from one debenture to the next, according to Forde, Kennedy and Simms's <i>The Law of Company Insolvency</i>they generally include the following events: whenever the principal sum due under the agreement becomes payable; whenever the company fails to pay any instalment, or the principal sum or the interest due under the agreement; whenever the company contravenes covenants in the security instrument; whenever the company ceases or threatens to cease its business; whenever a resolution is passed, a petition presented or an order is made to wind up the company; whenever the company acts in such a way as to jeopardise the security created by the debenture; and whenever any prior debenture becomes enforceable against the company.<br/><br/>There are advantages to a contractual receivership as it avoids the need for the debenture holder to go to court to enforce the security and therefore saves costs; costs which the debtor would have to pay.  Receivers may also be appointed under specific statutory powers such as that contained in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 or by the High Court under its equitable jurisdiction under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877.  Where a receiver is appointed by the High Court, his or her powers will be dependent on the court order of appointment.<br/><br/>A receiver&rsquo;s primary duty is towards the debenture holder who has appointed him or her.  Receivers will generally have the power to sell the secured assets with a view to paying off the debt owed to the debenture holder.  A receiver-manager will often have the power to carry on the business of the company, to borrow money, to employ or dismiss employees, to compromise debts of the company and to insure and repair property.<br/><br/>Section 437 of the Companies Act 2014, which I will refer to subsequently as &ldquo;the Act&rdquo;, confers statutory powers on receivers of the property of a company to do certain things and is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  Examples of these things include the power to enter possession and take control of property of the company; to lease, let on hire or dispose of property of the company; to grant options over property of the company on such conditions as the receiver thinks fit; to borrow money on the security of property of the company; and to repair, renew or enlarge property of the company.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that these powers are subject to any provision in the instrument under which the receiver was appointed which limits the receiver&rsquo;s powers in any way, again underlying the essentially contractual nature of receivership.  For example, if the agreement provided that the receiver was not to borrow money, the Act would not prevail over that restriction.<br/><br/>A receiver is very different from a liquidator or an examiner.  A liquidator has the task of winding up a company, realising its assets and distributing those assets in accordance with the law.  An examiner is appointed for the purpose of examining the state of the company&rsquo;s affairs and to put together some compromise or scheme of arrangement which may facilitate the survival of the company and then reporting to the court.  A receiver, appointed on foot of a debenture, has a much narrower function.  His or her principal task is to secure the assets of a company which have been mortgaged or charged in favour of the debenture holder which appointed him or her and realise those assets so that the secured creditor&rsquo;s debt is repaid as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>The Act sets out a number of duties that a receiver must comply with.  Of these duties one of the most often cited is that a receiver, in selling the property of a company, must exercise all reasonable care to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property as at the time of sale.  This statutory duty makes it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice on the sale of property, consistent with that duty.  In addition, he or she must give notice to the company&rsquo;s creditors if he intends to sell by private contract a non-cash asset of requisite value to an officer of the company.<br/><br/>There are provisions relating to the regulation and governance of receivers of the property of a company in the Act.  The following are illustrative examples.  When a receiver is appointed the Registrar of Companies must be notified within seven days of the appointment and must also be notified when a receiver ceases to act.  In addition, every business letter, order for goods, or invoice issued by or for the company or the receiver must state that a receiver has been appointed.  Failure to comply with these requirements is a category 4 offence, which is the most minor type within the fourfold classification of company law offences set out in section 871 of the Act.<br/><br/>The Act provides that the receiver must make certain information available to the company and to the Registrar of Companies.  In addition, there is an obligation on receivers to send periodic accounts to the Registrar of Companies.  Breach of the requirements is also a category 4 offence.  A receiver must also report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Director of Corporate Enforcement if it appears to him or her that a past or present officer or member of the company has been guilty of an offence in respect of the company.<br/><br/>Section 433 sets out the categories of persons who are disqualified to act as the receiver of a company, for example an undischarged bankrupt, an employee or officer of the company concerned, or a person who was such within the period of 12 months before the date of the commencement of the receivership.  Certain specified family members of an officer of the company concerned are also disbarred.  A body corporate cannot be a receiver of the property of a company.<br/><br/>Section 444 of the Act allows a liquidator, a creditor or a member of a company to apply to the High Court for an order to fix the amount to be paid to a receiver, notwithstanding that his or her remuneration has been fixed by the instrument appointing him or her.<br/><br/>Section 446 of the Act provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement may, where he or she considers it necessary or appropriate, request that the receiver produce to the director the receiver's books for examination, either in regard to a particular receivership or to all receiverships undertaken by the receiver.  Failure to do so is a category 3 offence.  The court may, on cause shown, remove a receiver and appoint another and may end or limit a receivership on the application of a liquidator.<br/><br/>That is the end of my initial presentation.  I thank the committee for its attention.  We will be pleased to address any questions on the governance of receivers in the context of the Companies Act 2014.</p></speech>

It is certainly a complex area.  It seems that much is determined by the basis on which the receiver is appointed - whether on the basis of the mortgage or debenture loan, whether there is a legal basis under the Companies Acts, and so on.  It seems to be quite varied in terms of the basis and the impact that has.  On the issue of buy-to-let property and tenants' rights to which Mr. McKenna referred, currently the basis of a receiver being appointed to a buy-to-let property - which we know has happened in many cases involving several different banks - derives from the mortgage contract.  Is there any statutory basis to that?</p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Carroll to come in on that point if that is okay.</p></speech>

The receiver, when appointed, has a duty of care both to the lending institution that has appointed the receiver and to the borrower.  The receiver must act in a fair and proportionate manner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the lender and the borrower.  Current land and conveyancing law does not specifically refer or cover the role of tenants in any buy-to-let property.<br/><br/>Tensions and potential conflict may arise because the role of the receiver is to manage the property but at a certain stage the receiver may move to sell the property.  The obligation on the receiver then, as has been said, is to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property.  That is a strict obligation and has been interpreted by the courts in a strict manner.<br/><br/>If the buy-to-let property is in a residential area, for example, likely buyers will want to use it as their residence.  Therefore, the best price reasonably obtainable for that property will normally require vacant possession of the property.  A potential buyer will not wish to buy property with tenants if he wants accommodation for himself.  This is where the conflict arises because the obligations of the receiver are to the lender and the borrower.  In a way the tenants are caught in the middle.  A code of conduct has been issued by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland.  The code is voluntary, obviously.  It is entitled A Residential Tenant's Guide to Receivership.  It answers some of the questions that would arise with regard to the payment of rent.</p></speech>

There are no positive qualifications.  Obviously, receivers are subject to a range of civil and criminal sanctions and they may be disqualified for misconduct.</p> <p>  As I have said, receivership results from a private contractual relationship between a lender and a borrower.  On the other hand, examinership and liquidations affect all creditors and members as they concern the whole of the business.  Receivership is a private matter.  The receiver is appointed to realise an asset that the secured creditor has over the property belonging to the debtor.  The responsibility for appointing a competent receiver is obviously on the part of the creditor initiating the receivership.  Creditors are expected to choose competent receivers because it is in their interests to do so.  We understand that most receivers are in fact accountants but I have no statistics on that.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

Who is the receiver accountable to?  What obligation, if any, does the receiver have to the business that is the subject of the appointment?</p> <p>  My experience is that no information is shared with the business owner &ndash; the debtor &ndash; who is the subject of the appointment.  Business owners are kept completely in the dark.  The business is being run by the receiver.  In some cases, it is being run into the ground.  Fees mount and mount and are allowed to get to a ridiculous level.  There seems to be no accountability or transparency around it.</p></speech>

There are two parts to my final question.  What is the position on the regulation of fees charged by receivers appointed to a business?  Second, if someone wishes to bring a complaint about the conduct of a receivership, or the behaviour of a receiver, where do they go?  What does the data say about complaints taken against receivers and the outcome of those?  Have we seen action taken by the Director of Corporate Enforcement and so on against receivers for bad behaviour that contravenes the law?</p></speech>

The court's powers extend to fixing the remuneration before the making of the order of the application if the receiver has been paid previously in excess of the amount fixed by the court; the court order may extend to requiring him or her to account for the excess, or such part of it, that maybe specified in the order.  However, this power shall not be exercised in relation to any period before the making of the application for the order to fix the fees unless in the opinion of the court there are special circumstances that warrant it.</p> <p>  On complaints on the conduct of a receivership, the terms under which a receiver will act have been set out in the terms of the contract.  If there are specific offences which the receiver has committed under the Act, there will be provision for reporting such offences to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  There are various offences under the Act, such as reporting offences that a receiver who does not file abstracts and so on may be amenable for.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement can seek the books of the receiver, in particular, in relation to particular receiverships or all receiverships with which the receiver has been engaged.</p> <p>  I am afraid I do not have the data around numbers of complaints.</p></speech>

I refer to a comment made by the Master of the High Court in connection with a case taken by constituents of mine in relation to to property going into receivership.  The Master was quoted as saying: "I have sympathy for the view that the unaccountable receivership is a licence for theft."  What is Mr. McKenna's view on that?</p></speech>

Where a receiver is appointed under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, there is a statutory instrument from 2010, SI 655, which specifies that the rate of commission of the receiver may not exceed 5% of the gross amount of money received by the receiver.  The 5% limit is in place where the receiver is acting under the land law provisions.</p></speech>

First, the receiver in a non-corporate instance is subject to the criminal law in terms of their behaviour, whether it is non-fatal offences or under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act.  Their behaviour as a receiver is accountable under the criminal code.  Equally, the receiver would have liability for any other issue that might arise in tort law with regard to their actions.  The fundamental question is whether receivers in the non-company context are accountable and whether there is a system of complaints about their behaviour, and the answer is there is not.</p></speech>

Many people have told me that receivers are unaccountable, unregulated, require no licence, can run up fees and are running up fees because the longer they are there, the more they benefit, even though under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act they are supposed to be acting as an agent for the borrower.  There are State institutions such as NAMA which earlier this year paid out &euro;129 million to receivers, &euro;15 million alone in Spencer Dock.  I have been raising these issues over several years.  When I raised the lack of regulation on receivers in 2016, the former justice Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said that the Company Law Review Group was examining the issue.  Two years later the group is still looking at the issue.  What are we to say to people, and it is not in all cases, where receivers land in in the dead of night, wearing balaclavas and changing locks?  There are tenants who pay rent to a landlord, sometimes to companies, who have done nothing wrong, and have their businesses closed down on them.  All the anecdotal evidence given to us - and I am unable to back this up because I have not investigated it as it is not my job to do so - suggests that these receivers are milking a system because they are allowed to.</p></speech>

There are a couple of questions.  I do not think that anyone can countenance the idea of people arriving in the middle of the night, particularly to residences and people living in houses.  One cannot see why there would be a necessity for that in the first place.  Sometimes issues are raised about those who accompany receivers or bailiffs or similar, and the behaviour of those particular people.  The Department of Justice and Equality is looking pressingly at rendering those who work with receivers or sheriffs in those instances subject to regulation under the Private Security Authority.  However, we are not proposing that receivers would come within that because the Private Security Authority obviously licences security people.  However, returning to Ms Curley's earlier comment, our understanding is that the vast majority of receivers are themselves regulated professionals and would be subject to complaints about their conduct to their professional bodies, and I am not sure whether that avenue is being used.</p><p> If a receiver is a member of a particular accountancy body that is subject to a regulator, as they often are, that is a quite serious avenue of complaint about their behaviour, depending on how misconduct is defined in the legislation or charter governing that complaint system .  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.1593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101800002#J00200"><p>The problem is that somebody has lost possession of or access to their property and there is no body to which they can complain.  There is no overarching regulatory body regulating receivers.  This was touched upon earlier in reference to qualifications.  Required qualifications for examiners and liquidators are set out in sections 519 and 633 of the 2014 Act, but no qualification whatsoever is required for receivers.  I make this comment because there are numerous properties with receivers appointed about whom I have no knowledge.  I presume that is done in a fair, transparent and decent way.  I am not suggesting that the idea of a receivership is wrong.  However, I am aware of numerous cases where there has been thuggish or unacceptable behaviour; where tenants are locked out of their businesses without notice; where they have no access to their own personal property; or where the receivers fail to communicate with the individual over and over again.  There are countless examples of properties being sold below market value and below what was offered several months earlier.  There are other cases where the overall cost of the receivership, not just the fee, is nearly 30% of the actual value for which the property is disposed of at the end of the day.  In other cases, businesses that one could argue are going concerns are run into the ground.  When are we going to deal with this?  We need to regulate receivers.  We need to set up a minimum standard of qualification, just as there are for examiners and liquidators.  We need to regulate them and have a governing body for them, and we need to set up very clear structures for people who feel they have been wronged by receivers.</p> <p>  This is the madness of this issue.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 very clearly provides that the receiver is the agent for the borrower.  We all know that the receiver does not act for the borrower.  The receiver is appointed by the bank or institution.  In law it is an agent of the borrower.  The receiver is supposed to run the company or business and pay back the mortgage on behalf of the borrower, but the reality on the ground in numerous cases is that their work is in complete conflict with that aim.  The option open to an individual such as my constituent is to go to the High Court.  That is out of the reach of most people.  I want to get to the crux of this.  As I said, I have been raising this since December 2015.  We still have not moved forward much in my view.  Has the Company Law Review Group looked at this issue?  Is it actually going to take any action on it?  </p></speech>

The Company Law Review Group is not looking at this issue at the moment, and it has never looked at it since 2016.  Receivership is not currently on its work programme.  I wish to correct that misunderstanding.</p> <p>  In regard to the other aspects the Deputy has raised, such as the running up of fees, all I can tell the committee is what the legislation currently provides.  I have mentioned section 444 of the Act and the possibility of going to the High Court to have the receiver's fees reviewed.  Regarding minimum qualification standards like those for liquidators or examiners, I have attempted to point out the difference between a liquidator or examiner and the more narrow role a receiver will have in a lot of cases.  That role is to secure an asset and sell it at the best price obtainable so that the debt can be repaid to the person or institution that provided the money.  Mr. McKenna has alluded to the fact that many receivers may be accountants and thereby amenable to the professional standards set by their own professional body.  </p></speech>

We have tried to render all of those pieces more effective, including through the Abhaile service and various other mechanisms.  We have managed to bring about a number of significant successes in that area.</p> <p>  In regard to the question of regulation of receivers as such, as I mentioned earlier we had a working group with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We also have very good contacts with our colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation about insolvency and related areas.  To the extent that there is a perceived significant gap, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for us to get together and have a good look at that issue.  Obviously the Companies Acts provide for issues relating to receivers, but only for companies.  Issues concerning receivers also arise for small and medium-sized businesses which are not companies.  Then there are individuals who are both tenants in and owners of buy-to-let properties.  They may have bought one or two houses and they are now caught in the headlights of a receivership as well as the people living in the houses.  It is not beyond our capacity as a group of Departments with various stakes in this to get together, look at this issue and see if there is anything that could be done about it directly.  I emphasise that all of our efforts so far have been around trying to deal with the issue of chronic mortgage arrears.  Looking at how the numbers have changed, a huge amount of success has been achieved in that area through very good and effective co-operation between Departments.  Mr. Carroll also wanted to mention something</p></speech>

Ms Curley wanted to correct a misunderstanding and stated that the Company Law Reform Group, CLRG, had not been dealing with the issue of receivers.  That is fine.  I have been raising this case since 2015.  In 2016, we got an answer from the then Minister regarding the issue of receivers.  She wrote:</p><blockquote>However, the 2014 Act does not specify any regulatory standards for the appointment of a receiver.<br /><br />The Company Law Review Group is a statutory body which advises the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the review and development of company law in this jurisdiction.  As part of its Work Programme 2014 &ndash; 2016, the Review Group is examining whether it is desirable or necessary to further amend the law in light of developments in case law or any submissions received on matters which have not been addressed in the 2014 Act.</blockquote> <p>The only way to read this is to say that exactly what I said was supposed to happen was supposed to happen, yet Ms Curley is telling me that the CLRG has never considered this issue.

I searched for the answer to check that I was correct.  There have been numerous references on the floor of the D&aacute;il to the non-regulation of receivers.  Along with other Deputies who had raised the issue, that reply left me with the clear message that this work was ongoing.  We can talk about this or that section of the Act, but let us call a spade a spade - receivers are unregulated.  In Irish law, they do not have to have any minimum qualification.  They are running up large bills.  While they are supposed to have a duty of care to the borrowers under Irish law, a borrower seeking to secure that duty is required to go through a legalistic process, which such people are usually not in a position to do because a receiver has been appointed to their premises.  This is not about the validity of the appointment of the receiver, but about the receiver's actions.  I am not saying that every receiver is involved in actions that are not appropriate.</p> <p>  Of course there should be accountability for whatever receivers have done in the past, but how can our committee move forward?  Is there any hope?  I believed there was, given the assertion that the matter was being discussed by the CLRG for the past two years.  I thought that it might come up with something and that it was just dragging its feet.  Will there be any change to the law outside of the report on protecting the rights of tenants where a receiver has been appointed, which we have been waiting on?  According to an update in June, it was imminent.  Now we have another update claiming it is imminent.</p> <p>  I have raised other issues, those being, fees, the minimum qualifications that a receiver should have and the regulation of those same receivers.  Falling back on the claim that they are usually accountants and are regulated by their own body is not good enough.  That is like saying that private security firms usually have other roles and are regulated there.  That does not work.  We have strong legislation on the regulation of security firms.  Someone cannot change a lock now without being registered as an appropriate person to undertake the task, although there might be some overreach in that regard.  I am not sure that receivers who are walking into properties and changing locks are actually registered with the Private Security Authority, PSA.  If someone wanted to change a lock on a front door, that person would have to go through a stringent process in terms of the qualifications he or she would have to meet.  The person would have to pay a fee to be registered, meet certain criteria, be Garda vetted and so on.  However, were I an institution to whom someone owed a few euro, I could appoint any Tom, Dick or Harry to go in, take over a premises and run it on my behalf and supposedly in the interests of the borrower.  The problem is there is no regulation, no minimum standards and, without going to court, no body to complain to for anyone who believes he or she has been wronged where a receiver has been appointed.</p></speech>

We will not move on from that.  I will give Mr. McKenna an example.  A receiver appointed in the dead of night goes in to change the locks on a premises.  The premises is a public house somewhere in the State.  The individual who was operating it was renting the premises from a landlord and was meeting his or her payments on a monthly basis.  The individual's contract was fine and secure.  However, that individual is completely locked out of the property.  All of his or her investments - life savings that have been thrown into the business - are gone because the place was closed down overnight and the individual has no access to it.  The firm appointed is usually a reputable group of accountants, but it is not the accountants who are out changing locks or sitting inside playing cards and so on, for example.  Another group of people are employed to do this.  The individual has no access to the building.  The company closes and jobs are lost as a result of that receivership.</p> <p>  Mr. McKenna said that tenants' rights were being protected.  What changes have happened or will happen to ensure that people who are abiding by their contracts with their landlords and whose landlords' premises then go into receivership will not have their businesses disrupted as a result?</p></speech>

In both of those situations the receiver is appointed by the lender, but is the agent of the borrower.  The general duty of the receiver is to secure the property and to act for the lender in terms of servicing the loan.  There are certain obligations when it comes to acting fairly in the interests of the borrower.  Deputy Doherty mentioned what appeared to be a fire sale, which would appear to be contrary to the law, because the legal obligation set out in the legislation is to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the property, in other words, to act fairly in the interests of the borrower, not just of the lender.  As I mentioned earlier, that can lead to tension where one has tenants in a situation because if it is residential property, for instance, one will not maximise the sale price of the property unless there is vacant possession.  That is where one potentially comes into a conflict between the interests of the borrower on the one hand, as the receiver has duties towards the borrower, and towards the lender on the other hand.  A missing part of the jigsaw at the moment is rights towards tenants who may be caught in the crossfire between a mortgagor, the borrower, who wants to maximise the sale price to reduce debt and the obligation on the receiver to service the loan on the other hand.</p></speech>

We are aware from other discourse that there are concerns in these areas.  If there are gaps it is well within the competence of the Department to deal with them.  We have worked successfully with our colleagues in other Departments on a number of related aspects.  We will take this away and look at that general issue and if there are substantial gaps that need to be addressed then we will come up with a strategy for dealing with that.  We must bear in mind that there are two other pieces of work ongoing, one on the protection of residential tenancies and the other on the security personnel who may be changing the locks or opening the door.  I have listened carefully to what has been said here and we will take this away and have a good look at it.</p></speech>

A consultation by the Department will provide a lot of evidence to suggest that there are huge gaps and that there needs to be tighter regulation and an easier pathway for people to fulfil their rights under law, whether that is the 1881 Act or the 2009 Act.  If it is a financial institution we do not force everybody to go to the High Court.  We have the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The regulation needs to be more stringent.  I would suggest a short, sharp consultation period which would give a great insight into what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

We have been running the Abhaile scheme together with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection since July 2016.  We are just finalising a report on the outcomes after two years, which will go to the Government shortly and the data I will provide is a little foretaste of that.  We hope that once the report goes to the Government it will be published very quickly.</p> <p>  The question was about the impact on the mortgage arrears problem.  The Abhaile scheme is targeted in particular at those who are in the worst mortgage arrears, those who are in immediate risk of repossession on their homes.  That would be the cohort who are in arrears equivalent to two years of repayments, who are over the 720 days category as set down by the Central Bank.</p> <p>  As Mr. McKenna said, that category has been dropping, but it is the slowest to reduce and that is the hard coalface really in addressing the mortgage arrears problem.  It peaked at the end of June 2015 and it has gone down considerably at this stage.  The Central Bank figure at the of June this year was 28,000 household accounts, which is probably equivalent to approximately 25,000 homes, because the Central Bank counts mortgage accounts which include top-ups and second mortgages.  If we take it that there are 25,000 households that are at serious risk of repossession, we have 10,000 households already in receipt of financial advice and help under the Abhaile programme and that is having a significant impact.</p></speech>

Most people would be offered a consultation with a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, but if they do not wish to look at personal insolvency they get help from a dedicated mortgage arrears, DMA, adviser in MABS.  There are two alternative streams of mortgage advice.</p></speech>

There are two streams, so if one is with a DMA adviser with MABS, no fees are paid to the DMA adviser, as they are paid salaries under contract with the MABS body they are working with.  If one is directed to a PIP, what we negotiated with PIPs is that under Abhaile they will provide a basic package of advice and assistance which follows statutory requirements laid down under the Personal Insolvency Act and for doing that they are paid &euro;500 plus VAT which comes to a total cost to the taxpayer of &euro;625.  They are not paid anything else, but they are expected to continue assisting the borrower until there is a solution in place for them.  The ISI is the regulator for PIPs.  We are tracking and following up very carefully what is happening to borrowers who get financial advice under Abhaile and the indications are that they are staying helped in the process until there is a solution in place for them.</p> <p>  Approximately 30% of all the households that have been receiving financial advice from a PIP have already got a solution in place.  Approximately 95% of those solutions are keeping them in their homes.  Approximately 50% of borrowers are with a PIP and still in progress towards a solution.  That is slower than we would like but it is natural because they are the people in the worst arrears and it takes time negotiating a solution for them.</p><p>A lot of them have to establish a repayment record with the lending institution before a solution can go in.</p></speech>

I will start from that point.  The reason I asked that the committee would bring in the officials is because of the numerous stories I have head about receivers.  I am giving the officials information that has come out of my discussions with borrowers and so on.  The first thing I wanted to get absolutely clear was the fact that receivers are not accountable and are not regulated.  I think Mr. McKenna said receivers are not accountable and not regulated although they may have a background as accountants or whatever.  Receivers are appointed and when they are appointed, they take total control.  In fact, a number of receivers - I am not saying all of them but the ones I have experienced - act like thugs and bullies.  In Kilkenny, they set about notifying almost a complete housing estate that the receiver was taking over the property and they set out their case.  There was no prior lead-up to it, they just notified everybody.  In fact, they did not even own the houses; the houses belonged to Kilkenny County Council.  Yet for the period that the tenants had got these letters, they were terrified.  They saw people acting for receivers literally breaking down front doors, changing locks on vacant houses and bullying people in their family homes.  That is just one example.</p> <p>  I have another example of a case here in Dublin where the receiver was Grant Thornton.  I am naming the company because it was in the public domain so there is no issue around that.  I went and tried to meet with them to discuss a case they were pursuing.  They did to me what they do to an awful lot of other people who try to help.  They got their solicitors to write to me.  They spoke to me about the separation of powers and accused me of interfering and so on.  That is the type of activity that is going on all over the country.  Deputy Pearse Doherty gave an example that is not unusual.  Social media give us reports of the various attempted evictions and so on that have taken place and the activities of these people when they visit homes.  It is shocking.</p> <p>  I always believed that there was some form of regulation in place but there is not.  Receivers are often appointed with no other purpose but to strong-arm the borrower and take possession.  Once they take possession, the borrower cannot even get an account of the rents that they collect.  The borrower is totally ignored and the asset is often run down to the extent that there is far less value in it in the context of the sale than what would have been the case had the borrower sold it.  This is what is going on.  The rip-off in professional fees relative to this activity is criminal.  I note from the Deputy Doherty the quotation from the Master of the High Court to the effect that unaccountable receivership is licence for theft.  That is the experience of people.  My view is not extreme.  It is based on fact.  There seems to be no effort being made to curtail the activities of these receivers.  Some of them may very well be accountants but I doubt very much they are all accountants or all qualified to do this job.  </p> <p>  We absolutely have to intervene; there is no question about it.  I am disappointed, given all the experiences Deputies have had, that a greater effort is not being made to ensure that these people are accountable.  When the difficult point in negotiations is reached between the borrower and the vulture fund, bank or whatever, the threat is made that a receiver will be appointed immediately.  The intention is to force the hand of the borrower to come up with the money or lose everything.  That is the threat.  It is another method used to squeeze money out of the already squeezed borrower.  The whole thing is simply corrupt.  </p> <p>  Now is not the time to be referring it to another group to deal with it.  There must be immediate action to put the small things in place to prevent some of these big things from happening.  We must then deal with the overall picture later on.  It is outrageous that they are neither accountable nor regulated.  There are clearly opportunities being taken by these individuals to collect large sums of money from rents, to sell properties and push up the price because the borrower is in trouble.  I wonder if receivership is also used to clear title through court so they can sell properties and, after the sale is over, if the title is wrong or there is something odd about it, they can clean it and off it goes.</p> <p>  There are serious misgivings about all of this that the various Departments need to address without delay.  I would like to know what sort of immediate response we are going to have to the issues we have raised today.  Please do not tell me we are going to have a review group because the receivers will jump with joy when they hear that.</p></speech>

If someone is a receiver and an accountant, his accountancy regulator does not look at his work as a receiver.  Mr. McKenna may be putting forward a case that someone who is regulated as an accountant must be an okay kind of person.  I question that, too.  We had the accountants during the bank collapse and they were not okay kinds of people.  They certainly got their figures wrong, to put it at its mildest.

I suppose where we are coming from in that regard is also that a number of professional regulatory bodies and regulators have clauses in their regulatory systems about actions bringing the profession into disrepute and things like that.</p><p>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that those kinds of routes could be used.  Having said that, we take the point.  Most of what we are hearing about receivers, including what we have heard today, relates to the rights of tenants in cases of receivership and to unacceptable behaviour by receivers or receiver assistants, or both.  I tried earlier to point out that those two areas are already being examined carefully.  In the case of tenants, that examination is nearing a conclusion.  The committee might want to look at the report when it is produced by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I think it will be quite effective.</p></speech>

The borrower did not expect that the receiver would turn up, ignore the obligations and beat the lard out of the borrower, or completely ignore the rights of the borrower.  That is what is going on all over the country.  I am not just saying it.  There is lots of evidence that this is happening.</p></speech>

The fact is that it is a matter of criminal law.  I am talking about someone who was beaten up by the economic crash and turned to the contract to try to get some comfort from it, only for that approach to fail miserably while the person in question was busy trying to keep his or her life, business or family together and, at the same time, trying to stave off the actions of a receiver who has no interest in obligation.  Such people often do not have the money or the physical or mental disposition to go to court to defend themselves.  They presume that because these people are acting in the way they are acting, they must have the full might of the law behind them.  We are discovering today that this is not the case.  We have learned that the people they are dealing with are not regulated.</p> <p>  I mentioned a case I took up.  It is one of many cases with the same outcome, unfortunately.  In that case, the receiver decided to get me off the pitch by sending me a stiff solicitor's letter.  I was supposed to buckle at the knees when I received it, but I did not do so.  I can imagine that a person who is defending his or her property and family, and trying to keep some of it together for the future, would buckle at the knees in such circumstances.  He or she might not have the funds required to continue.  I am trying to get a message across about how weak the system is, and how weak the individual is against the might of the lender and one of the big accountancy firms.  They are using their money to ensure they get what they want, and they will beat up anyone in the process.  That is the reality.  I am asking Mr. McKenna to take note of that.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Martin Stapleton, chairman of the IFA farm business committee, and Mr. Damian McDonald, the IFA director general.</p> <p>  Ten years after the global financial crisis, the failure of banking institutions in Ireland and abroad has led to significant changes in the sale and restructuring of loans to third parties.  For the past three years, this restructuring and selling of loans to private equity firms or so-called vulture funds has been having a significant impact on borrowers.  Many of these sales have farm debt in the portfolio.  The IFA has been contacted directly by farmers in such cases and, since July 2017, we have had a dedicated debt support services team.  We have approximately 150 cases active on our system and we receive new inquiries every week.  We represent these farmers in negotiations, with the aim of finding a workable resolution for all parties.</p> <p>  I will outline the issues faced by farmers and the negotiating environment they face, as borrowers in financial difficulty.  The agricultural portfolio in Irish banking institutions is one of the best performing portfolios given the rate at which farmers repay their borrowings.  Central Bank figures indicate that the overall level of outstanding borrowings in the primary sector has fallen over the past eight years.  In 2010, outstanding credit was estimated to be &euro;5.1 billion and in June of this year it was estimated to be &euro;3.6 billion, which is a reduction of 30%. </p> <p>  In a wider context, agriculture as part of the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector, and accounts for 22% of all new lending.  These figures reflect the importance of the agricultural portfolio to the wider economy, with particular significance in rural economies.  Farmers generally borrow from the pillar banks.  These are financial institutions that have built up long-standing relationships with families over generations.  These were relationships where farmers sought advice from banks and trusted them to act in their mutual best interest.  On this basis, farmers borrowed money in good faith from established and reputable banks.  They did so in the knowledge that they would have to repay the money but also with the security of knowing that the bank had a restructuring unit to provide options should their business plan struggle.   </p> <p>  As stated, in recent years these institutions have sold farm debt to third party vulture funds.  These funds take a short-term debt recovery approach to the loans acquired.  They are not interested in working out a long-term debt resolution with the customer.  This short-term debt recovery approach through the sale of assets damages the underlying viability of family farms as the repayment capacity of the business is not considered.  As the ratio of the security value to debt level tends to be significantly higher in farming, this issue is a particular problem for the farming sector.</p> <p>  Regardless of the repayment capacity of the farm, the fund views these debts as having high recovery potential.  Funds are in a position to liquidate the assets against which the loans are secured at whatever value and in whatever timeframe they wish to maximise recovery on the debt.  This means the vulture funds consider it possible to recover the full value of loans, plus their costs, immediately by appointing a receiver and forcing a farm sale.  In many other sectors where there is significantly less security, deals are being done based on the repayment capacity of the business and businesses are refinanced accordingly.  It is the IFA's policy to prevent vulture funds from killing off farm businesses that have the potential to repay their debts over time and, by doing so, return to viability.</p> <p>  The issues I have outlined are not confined solely to vulture fund engagements.  In the case of the banks that are not selling loan books, there is some potential to discuss longer term repayment arrangements as they seek to protect reputation and ensure a viable farm can return to being a profitable customer in the future.  Farmers view banks which sell their loan books as abdicating their responsibility to see through their dealings with their customers.  The farming community has lost confidence in the banks.  It is now necessary for the banks to recognise this and provide all possible solutions to borrowers before the sale of loans, in particular, an opportunity for farmers to repay loans in line with their repayment capacity, with longer-term options established to ensure the sustainability of the business.  The four major issues that must be addressed for current and future lending are the regulation of loan owners, engagement by lenders, accountability and rebalancing in negotiations.</p><p>The IFA acknowledges the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018, the purpose of which is to regulate credit agreement owners of mortgage loans and SME loans.  Provision must be made in the regulation of funds for enforcement by the Financial Regulator and oversight post sale.  This means that the Financial Regulator must have information on loan owners, the number of loans they own and the profile of borrowers.  Borrowers must have the option to engage directly with the loan owners and not only through third party agencies.  The current system of employing asset managers as intermediaries is not working.</p><p> Banks should be conscious that to sell loans is to crystallise a serious failure on the part of a bank.  Such action leaves an irremovable stain on the legacy of the bank.  Lenders must realise that to commit to a long-term repayment plan is an enormous challenge and may lead to a generation of a particular family devoting their entire working lives to retaining the family farm.  In doing so, they accept that the alternative is to sell.  A partial sale is often viewed as a more practical solution but each family should have the opportunity to negotiate an option.  The risk of moral hazard is often quoted as a reason for using funds to sort our non-performing loans.  However, we need to acknowledge that moral hazard dies when there is a partial asset sale.  Loan owners must be forced to provide long-term repayment options as demand loans are totally unsuitable for farm businesses.</p><p> There must be accountability of these funds to the Minister for Finance and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There must be a mechanism whereby information on the actions of these funds can be made publicly available through Oireachtas scrutiny.  The current secrecy around sale values leaves the door wide open for sweetheart deals at the expense of the borrower and the taxpayer.  It is unforgivable that loans are being sold to foreign hedge funds for less than could be recovered from the borrower.  This leads to a loss of capital from the State which could and should be available for investment here in future projects.  Furthermore, profits from these transactions are leaving this country tax free.</p><p> A balance must be struck in supporting farmers who are in a difficult position.  In doing this, we must maintain the integrity of the wider agriculture sector in which the majority of parties are paying off debts in full and for whom the ability to give assets as security as part of their loan application is very important.  Steps must be taken by the Government to provide a greater balance in the negotiating strengths of the parties in these cases.  Where the farm family is willing to agree to commit to a reasonable, credible long-term repayment plan in accordance with the repayment capacity of the farm, the following steps should occur.  First, there should be no forced sale of farming assets which undermines the viability of the family farm and, where the farmer has meaningfully engaged, a workable solution should be found.  Second, a full and final agreement should be reached between the borrower and loan owner prior to the disposal of any assets.  Third, there should be no forced collection of debt that is not yet due and assets must be sold for their full market value and with proper advertising.  Fourth, no interest or penalty should accumulate on the outstanding debt where delays occur in arriving at a decision.</p><p> Insolvency legislation should be adapted so that farmland is treated in a similar manner to a principal private dwelling house.  In effect, a farm is both a home and a means to make a living, as is provided for in insolvency under the term "tools of the trade".  This option would give court protection to borrowers and ensure that a fair repayment plan is implemented, giving security to both borrower and lender.  Interest should be based on the cost of funds for the loan owner rather than the money owed.  A fixed minimum percentage of total debt plus a margin on cost of funds paid annually should offer protection against a repossession order.</p><p> In conclusion, the sale of loan books is not a necessary or suitable way for banks to deal with debt secured on farmland.  Greater protection is required to protect borrowers and better engagement by banks is needed to achieve sustainable solutions.  The Government has recognised that farmland and business assets should be treated differently from other asset classes.  This was most recently recognised in the proposed new fair deal scheme.  It is vital that similar recognition is applied here.</p></speech>

I was to have been accompanied here today by a member company which is going through a debt restructuring, but it was made very clear to its representatives that the offer being negotiated currently would not be honoured if the company appeared before the committee.</p> <p>  ISME members are not ignorant of the fact that some borrowers are unable to repay their debts and that lenders must have recourse to debt resolution mechanisms.  We are also aware that many of the funds to which SME debt is sold are willing to come to negotiated settlement arrangements with borrowers.  What is incomprehensible to many SMEs, however, is that these banks seem incapable of coming to what are, in many cases, straightforward arrangements without having recourse to selling debt to third parties.  These debt sales are cost additive in terms of professional and legal fees.  They are also highly complex and impose on borrowers a stress and workload they would never normally encounter as part of their normal business lending.  Added to the fact that debt sales are normally confined to distressed borrowers, these factors place a major strain on the customer.  These sales typically take place at a substantial discount to the book value of the debt and one wonders why those taking the business decision to sell that debt cannot come to an agreement with their customers at, or close to, the written-down value at which they are selling that debt.  We know of one member company which was recently informed that its overdraft of some &euro;20,000 had been sold by a pillar bank to a fund.</p> <p>  The most common complaint we encounter about the sale of debt to funds concerns the unreasonable exercise of personal guarantees.  We understand that lenders need some degree of security for the funds they extend, and personal guarantees can form part of that.  However, personal guarantees are never extended by borrowers on the basis that they can be suddenly or peremptorily exercised.  Borrowers view them as a last resort, not something to be used to exert heavy, short-term leverage.  Some institutions maintain personal guarantees after the debt raised against them has been discharged.  This is immoral.  Settlement agreements also typically involve confidentiality and gagging clauses.  Included in the written submission provided to the committee are the testimonies of two ISME companies involved in debt sale and restructure, one of which has been promised some debt forgiveness, while the other has repaid 100% of its debts sold.  I do not propose to read them out but I note that the debt forgiveness arrangement set out involved the sale of a family home, while in the other case the business was liquidated at the cost of redundancies for all the employees working therein.</p> <p>  The ISME bank survey will be published later today.  We ask our members regularly now how many have had their debts sold.  The figure that will appear in the press release today indicates that 10% of our members have had their debt sold by their lenders to third parties.</p></speech>

They are collectively known as domestic loans, although they are for both homes and investment.  I know that it spreads across to other businesses and areas, as we have heard.  I listened to the previous discussion on receivers, which is strongly connected to this issue.</p><p> This issue affects both homeowners and residential rental units.  Discussions on this matter are complicated, with words such as "morals", "hazard", "NPLs" and "appropriate percentages" used often to confuse matters.  There is no doubt that the percentage of loans in arrears in this country is higher than it is in the rest of Europe.  The question is why that is the case.  Why do Irish people have a greater level of arrears on their loans than other countries in Europe and is it all the fault of the customers?  I suggest that in most cases it is not.</p><p> There are a number of reasons arrears are so high, examples of which include the price the property was bought at and the levels of lending to facilitate that purchase available at the time; interest rate levels for loans in Ireland, some of which are at 6% or greater; the economic circumstances that befell the country for the past nine years; the treatment by the Government of the residential lending market through, for example, non-principal private residence tax and reduction in interest relief; decreasing or depressed values versus the loan size; decreasing rental yields and, concurrently, a decreasing rental market; the property culture and the atmosphere that existed at the purchase time, where property was the primary topic of discussion in the country; and customers' economic, income and employment position.  </p><p> All interested parties contributed at the time.  For example, the stamp duty rates available for rental purchases and the contribution to the economy made by amateur investors involved in the rental market seem to have been forgotten.  The question that should be defined is what, when one takes the issues as a whole into account, is a non-performing loan, NPL.  Is a loan not performing because of external factors or is it the customer's fault?  That is the question.  When one looks at the position at purchase time, the position a few years later was the polar opposite of what the majority of customers and lenders expected at the time of purchase.  All were caught in the tsunami of the crash and panic set in but responsibility was deflected.  The initial solution offered by the banks was interest-only extensions to loans followed by further extensions and, finally, a sudden shift to demanding payment in full or sell or the banks would sell.  In addition, the balance of the loan also had to be paid.  An example of shortening the term, which interest-only extensions would have achieved, would be if one borrowed &euro;1 million over 20 years at 0%, that is, &euro;50,000 per year, that same &euro;1 million repayable over ten years is &euro;100,000 a year.  </p><p> The short-sighted view of interest-only extensions as a solution is staggering.  Each interest-only period was actually increasing the difficulty for customers to be able to recommence repaying capital and interest, but it was presented as a solution.  It shortened the term of the loan.  I cannot understand the reluctance to offer the most obvious solution, namely, term extension and interest reduction, to see how it all played out.  It is arguable that it would not present any risk to the banks to retain many of these loans on an interest-only basis for the full term of the loan.  All would then be classed as performing loans but with debt levels not reducing.  This assumes the interest repayment would be made in full.  I cannot understand that not one of the 12 lenders I encountered when dealing with the tracker mortgage issue took the view that it would assess a customer who had borrowed a great deal of money, propose to extend the term on the loan by ten years and reduce the interest rate by 1% to see how it would work out.  Not one lender saw this as a solution for any of its customers.  All, including our Government, fed from the trough of property in the Celtic tiger years, but when the feed, that is, credit, started running out, panic set in and the world changed, as it did in Ireland.  </p><p> Properly thought through solutions were as scarce as the credit lines.  Solutions that took a long-term view were non-existent and are still not considered in most rental cases.  I cannot understand how a bank in the style of a domestic national asset management agency, for example, was not established.  If properly established, such a bank could still have a role to play.  As a country, we export the profit from the recovery to entities that have done little but wait in the wings until meltdown.  They have come in and picked up the assets at the bottom of the market.  This is an enormous industry which ironically recreates itself as a market every few years.  </p><p> At a meeting of the United Nations in 2002, the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, described vulture funds which make profit from purchasing distressed debts of a country at a reduced price to then make a profit from suing that country as "morally outrageous".  The same is occurring here in some instances.  If the value of a home, for example, is greater than the loan, full repayment by the sale of the home is the only option given in some cases.  What is paid by these funds for the loans is a great mystery as nobody seems to know.  If one reviews the websites of the main players in the Irish market, however, the answers are clear.  They are queuing up to come here.  It is a very profitable business.  Is there not a way to control this given the fallout that will occur in the domestic market and, in particular, in regard to farms, both of which are connected, and given the property crisis that exists?  </p><p> The need for property is clear around the whole country but that need was always there.  It appears the market will become such that only the big players are involved in the rental of property.  It has been stated that the whole area of moral hazard revolves around these issues and the repayment of debt, but that morality must extend to all.  Are other options open to us as a State?  If any of these affected customers or tenants is moved out, who picks up that tab?  The discount on the loan must be priced to encourage the vulture to buy, but in Ireland it is certainly the case that if a bidding war ensues, there must be little, if any, risk to the vultures.  Why is the risk so much greater to the bank for holding these loans?  </p><p> The European Central Bank, ECB, issued many directions to this country early in this debacle.  It seems as though it is involved again, but that may be just how it is being presented by the lenders.  The ECB says we must reduce our NPLs and, therefore, it seems selling loans valued at billions of euro to eager vultures is the only solution.  Why, for example, can the Government not create the vehicle and benefit from the upturn that the vultures expect to receive?  After all, there is a queue of bidders willing to purchase these loans.  The question must be why that is the case.  What of the tax treatments and benefits that each of the vultures and the lenders receives with add-backs which will benefit the banks for many years to come, as has been confirmed?  </p><p> The responsibilities for this lies on many desks and some are certainly running from those responsibilities.  It should be noted that some of them are customers, but I do not believe the figures are as high as those presented by the banks.  I quote one of the vulture funds from its website as an example: "We believe less efficient markets exist in which dispassionate application of skill and effort should pay off for our clients, and it is only in such markets that we will invest."  An inefficient market is described as one in which an asset's market value does not always accurately reflect its true market value.  That is the game for these funds.  The fallout affects not only customers but tenants, the Government, lenders and Revenue, and it can collectively be called a big contributor to the housing crisis.  There is certainly room for some more thought to be applied here and in most cases the short-term solutions actually present longer-term problems.  A longer-term view needs to be taken, similar to the original granting and intention of the loan.  Just because an injury occurred does not mean the idea should be dropped.</p><p> I wish to provide some final thoughts for consideration.  The shortage of housing in 2010 was missed by most, including the Department of Finance.  NPLs became the next subject matter for the ECB.  Does this approach drive the sale of the loan book?  Why are interest-only extensions not listed as a long-term solution?  Repossession is hinted at and is a threat across all spheres of lending.  Incentive to reduce NPLs by disposal is put forward as the only solution.  Banks are forced to take provisions at the lowest part of the market but the add-backs are not considered.  What is an NPL and, more important, who defines it?  These questions have never been properly answered.  What is the tax treatment for the private investment funds on the profits gained?  Why is the market so buoyant in Ireland for vultures?  What drives that market?  Vultures are in this for profit and it is predominantly short term.  Is the position the same in Spain, Portugal and Italy?</p><p> On warehousing loans, the question that is not being asked is what happens at the end.  Most do not know what will happen with the three-year reviews.  If there were more certainty in the answers to these questions, it might solve some of the mystery surrounding vulture funds.  What protections are in place?  Are those protections certain for investors as well as homeowners?  As an example, I know of two homeowners whose loans are with vulture funds.</p><p>Both had performing loans, neither was ever in arrears and both were with PTSB.  They now want to extend their homes and have approached the vulture funds in question, which have said they are not banks and so can do nothing.  These are both tracker mortgages.  The mortgagors' only option is to move their loans and pay three times what they were paying in interest.</p></speech>

If I may start on either the farm or the business end of matters - I do not mind which of the witnesses takes this question - can they characterise for us what their members report as to what these funds are like to deal with and what are the prospects of getting a deal?  We sometimes hear from supporters and advocates of these funds that they are more likely to do a deal that would be put forward normally for mortgages.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of what they are like to deal with?  Are deals being done and, if so, what kinds of deals?  Are long-term restructures being done, whether of farm debt or SME debt?  Are the funds entering into long-term restructures that clearly go beyond their investment horizons in Ireland, which are for a short number of years?</p></speech>

When a farmer gets what we call a "hello" letter from the fund - and I presume it is the same for any other borrower whose loan is sold - engagement is then directed towards the asset management company the fund employs to do business on its behalf.  More often than not, the instruction the asset management company has received is that par recovery of debt is the only option available.  I think the asset management company was put in place as a regulated entity for engagement, but instead of this system working to the benefit of the borrower, it works to the benefit of the loan owner.</p></speech>

The agent's aim is to recover that debt as quickly as possible.  Letters will be sent, which will lead determine how the case develops and usually involves the appointment of a receiver.  Then the receiver will take over the communication and work towards selling the asset.  There is, therefore, no possibility I can see of the funds being interested in long-term arrangements.</p></speech>

We are not in the business of gathering much information on that.  I tried to cover off the two bases in the case studies in my presentation.  Both my colleagues either side of me have referred to the degree of opacity in the process.  A lender sells a loan for 40% of face value and the fund has an asset worth 60% of the original borrowings.  What is not evident to the borrower, who is dealing with a receiver acting on behalf of a fund, is how many cents on the euro the parties expect to receive and the bonusing arrangement working between those two parties.  Effectively, a negotiation is taking place between the two, and this is not always evident.  This arose in the earlier session.  I was listening in to the Chairman's interaction earlier.  This is as much an interaction with the receiver, which can force sales at a totally unrealistic pace, especially in a market in which assets are depressed in value.  Now the dynamic is reversed and asset prices are rising, so there is a concern among some of our members that where there was forbearance before, it was tactical and due to asset values being depressed.

One might ask, once the deal is done, what recourse is available.  Given the fact that most of these borrowers are dealing with the pillar banks, there is a genuine fear of retribution.  I have experienced this in recent years.  Even where the behaviour of a pillar bank was disgraceful and the member went to the media, he or she did so on an anonymous basis and would not have the name of his or her company or its directors put in the media.</p></speech>

The first loans to be sold were sold, what, four or five years ago?  How much experience is there now across the witnesses' organisations of dealing with this issue?  I know it is building and growing all the time as more and more loans are sold, but there must be several years of experience now.</p></speech>

As we said in the presentation, we have give or take 150 active cases now, so the funds' absolute desire to recover the money in the fastest possible timeframe gets more and more frustrating for us as we deal with them.</p><p>We had a tradition in the past that when borrowers got into trouble - I am speaking specifically about farm owners - there was some sort of asset sale, generally non-core assets, and then a write-down to a level that would allow the bank to put in place a long-term sustainable debt.  The write-down and the sustainable debt working together share the pain between the borrower and the lender.  Eventually that borrower, through hard work and dedication in paying back the money, was given the opportunity to get his or her business back to viability and operating again, thus allowing the family to maintain ownership and continue to work the farm.  That has changed completely.  Once the loans are sold, that option is no longer on the table.  It also impacts on the incentive for the banks to do the deal because they now have the option of selling on the loan as a way of getting the NPL off their books.</p></speech>

Will organisations such as Lone Star, Cerberus, Oaktree and Tanager do basic restructures such as extending the term and interest only arrangements, which Mr. Kissane mentioned, or split mortgages?  Although they do not have a long-term investment horizon, are they prepared to enter into new restructures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-18a.1722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraic Kissane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101800002#T00300"><p>The first thing they are prepared to do is enter the market.  The one difficulty they have with a domestic mortgage is that the term of the original loan will dictate how long it can run.  If some arrangement can be put in place it will relate to the original loan.  As I mentioned, the difficulty with many of the owner-occupier mortgages that are being sold is that they might have had a forbearance arrangement directly with the bank heretofore which would have been interest only, or part capital and some interest.  They are losing dramatic time in that, but now that it has been shoved out to the vulture fund, the original term of the contract stands and so all this time is lost.  I gave the example of a 0% loan at &euro;1 million, which is a repayment of &euro;50,000 over 20 years and &euro;100,000 over ten years.  That is what is causing a huge issue here.</p> <p>  Concurrent with that are the increasing values in the properties.  A good loan is being sold at approximately 50% in the better cases and below that in the worst cases.  That is a generalisation because I do not know for certain.  I know David Hall has done a significant amount of positive work here.  I suppose the collective group is asking whether we can start to think outside the nine dots here.</p> <p>  These organisations are coming into the market to make profit.  According to the websites, Goldman Sachs vulture funds collected &euro;465 million in distressed Irish loans last year alone.  The facts are there.  They are not here for any benefit of the customer.  The difficulty in all of it is the "don't know" factors relating to a home or a farm.  I would connect farms to this because the shame, embarrassment and "don't know" factors of that are not being captured.</p> <p>  I hear many people talking about the moral hazard of people not paying their debts but I have not come across this.  I do not know where all these strategic defaulters are.  I raise these questions.  Who would strategically default on their home?  It would be the stupidest thing someone could do.  Some people are in severe difficulty and will have to sell their homes, but that should be a finite percentage that a state should be able to carry.  However, under the current proposals, thousands of homeowners will suffer repossessions, which no state will carry, yet these companies will fly off with the profits from this because they are just selling the property.</p></speech>

I put that question back to him.  There is approximately &euro;1.5 billion of warehoused debt under split mortgages, with the average loan in the region of &euro;50,000.  If somebody enters into a restructure, her or she will pay the active part of the mortgage but ten or 15 years down the line when the mortgage comes to an end there is a debt sitting there.  This is untested because these agreements have not come to an end yet.  However, about &euro;1.5 billion of mortgage debt has been parked.  What does Mr. Kissane believe will happen to it?  With the uncertainty over what might happen to it, do split mortgages and warehousing debt represent a good model?</p></speech>

The banks are taking the view that they should move the distressed loans out to the vulture funds.  As night follows day, the next area to be looked at will be warehoused loans because they are now the next non-performing loan and these will get moved out.  I am raising the question to create the possibility that answers might come.  Nobody is asking what happens to warehoused loans at the end.  Will all these 70 year olds have to leave their homes because they have to sell?  Some will definitely take the view that they should trade down and move to a smaller house and so forth, but nobody is asking the question.</p> <p>  It is even more serious than that, however.  Most of the arrangements that were put in place have three-year reviews attached, which are currently in play with the vulture fund.  They were told it would be reviewed in three years with a pillar bank.  It is now being reviewed with a vulture fund and that is their opportunity to come in and take the short-term view they have.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  As a financial adviser, I do not know today what will happen with warehousing.  I am being told in the surrounds that it is written off already so why not do it if the provisioning has already taken place that the taxpayer has taken the hit for?</p> <p>  The other aspect that is not considered is the rental market and the contributory effect of the sale to vulture funds.  A large number of properties are empty because receivers have been appointed.  I have been at meetings with clients and the bank cannot tell me who has the keys.  The client knows they gave them back to the bank, but nobody knows who has the keys and the property is empty.  It is astonishing.</p></speech>

We are being told by many business customers that there is constructive non-engagement by the banks in terms of looking at restructuring loans because they have the backstop of selling to the funds.  It is a form of moral hazard in its own right.  I ask the representatives of the IFA to tell us about farmers' engagement with banks and whether that view of constructive non-engagement is a reality because they effectively have the default position of being able to sell to the vulture funds.</p></speech>

I do not see the examples that the banks are talking about.  There are people who overextended.  If that is where the moral hazard is, we are probably all overextended.  However, nobody is addressing how to resolve the issue.  The State is losing out, as much as anybody else.  I have in my office a loan offer, the term of which was 12 years, the amount borrowed was &euro;480,000 - which indicates the borrower was elderly at the time - and the interest only term was for ten years at &euro;500 plus per month, following which the repayment was to be &euro;7,500 per month for the remaining two years.</p></speech>

This is the defence continually thrown at me.  When they ask whether a solicitor's advice was obtained, I ask who underwrote the loan.  As I said previously in this committee, in 2007 the branch manager told me that he was required to give out &euro;7 million in loans every week and that the bank did not give a damn how he did it.  With regard to the farmers, an issue that should be challenged with the pillar banks is the withdrawal of the discretion from local branch managers to put in place arrangements for families they have known for years.  This is now the function of head office.  This is a major issue.  The discretion given to a local manager to take the chance he or she previously took with a farmer is gone.  This is now a matter for the underwriting department - hidden people.</p></speech>

The sale was postponed and negotiations on the case are ongoing.  Cerberus will argue that it does not know the detail of cases.  We have no sight of what information is transferred from the bank to the fund and what information the fund is entitled to talk to us about.  For example, I know of a case where a borrower asked a pillar bank for all of the information around his loan and when he got it, most of the details were redacted.  It is difficult to understand how the pillar banks, which are partly or wholly owned by us as taxpayers, are behaving in such a manner.</p></speech>

People must have an opportunity to work their way through their debt, in all cases.  In our proposed solutions we suggest that the personal insolvency legislation be applicable to farm land in the same way as it is applicable to dwelling houses.  We suggest that interest charged by the fund be on the basis of a return on its investment rather than on the amount borrowed.  This is important.  If the fund is buying loans at 30% and the bank was charging 6%, in effect the fund is charging 18%.</p> <p>  The final ask is that the AIB loan book sale be stopped.  This would benefit the community at large.  This bank, which is owned by the taxpayers, should be made to work through its debt in the best interests of borrowers as well as the bank.  I reiterate the point made by Mr. Kissane, that large amounts of money are leaving this country as profit, tax free.  This money could be made available to other borrowers for growth and sustaining this economy into the future.</p></speech>

That is the issue.  I gave the committee two examples, the second of which involves Irish Bank Resolution Corporation lending that went to another very well-known fund.  It has been paid back in full at the effective cost of the liquidation of the business and the employees within it.  There are different ways of looking at this.</p></speech>

We met the ECB to discuss loan restructuring, particularly of home loans.  It informed us that it did not issue any instruction on non-performing loans and did not define a time for reducing the number of NPLs.  It wanted loans put in place that were sustainable.  If a loan was &euro;200,000 and the only element that was sustainable was &euro;100,000, it wanted an arrangement for &euro;100,000 and was not worried about how many years it would spread over, which would depend on the age of the person.  This would involve parking or warehousing the &euro;100,000 in unsustainable junior debt, and having the senior debt, which would be 100% sustainable, repaid.  Does Mr. Kissane find that the banks do that or are they only willing to restructure loans to a certain percentage, such as 75%?  The ECB was frustrated by the banks because it felt it was being blamed for the timeframe associated with reducing the NPLs.  It wants to see sustainable mortgages.  What is Mr. Kissane's experience of that with the banks?</p></speech>

It is the greatest joke of all time.  Every one of them has said it in this room.  I have listened to them all.  They do not want to put it that they do debt forgiveness in case the other 90% of their customers will stop paying their mortgages, which is a complete fallacy.  One of the difficulties with a vulture fund, which is now only becoming known, is that if all the loans are sold, the customer cannot borrow, build an extension or improve his home.  This means the economy for all the small builders who would get those jobs is gone because he cannot borrow a cent extra until the mortgage is paid off in full, irrespective of the arrangement.  Until he pays that mortgage off he is stuck, especially if it is on a tracker rate because then he cannot move at all.  In the two examples I gave, these loans were put in to sweeten the deal for whoever was purchasing the loan because the people never missed a payment.  I heard the same bank tell this committee that no performing home loans were sold to vulture funds.  That is factually incorrect and I have two clear examples that can prove it.</p> <p>  The second issue in what the Senator says is that there is so much confusion put about that it is almost deliberately done to create confusion.  The banks have decided, as they are about to embark on this new culture shift, to move the problem to somebody else.  They say that if somebody is to be brought to court, let it not be the banks taking the case because their reputations are damaged to such an extent that they will not bring cases to court or seek repossession.  It is the bad vulture fund that will do it because it does not care, having bought the loan for 20%, 30% or 40% of the original value.  That is the vulture funds' game in any event.  It is second nature to them to go before the courts because asset disposal is part of what they do.  It is also extremely difficult to get repossessions and so forth.  That contributes to the difficulty with getting repossession from actual strategic defaulters.  </p> <p>  The lenders are the ones who describe what is a strategic defaulter.  The fact, as David Hall will say, is that a strategic defaulter, according to the bank, is one who is not paying the full loan mortgage to his lender and may be paying something to his credit union or other personal loans or his overdraft facility.  He is classified as a strategic defaulter by the domestic home loan banks.  The definitions for everything we are discussing here are also coming from the same banks.  We believed them before when it came to a banking bailout and here we are starting to believe them a second time.  </p></speech>

The farming organisations are helping in cases where vulture funds are trying to get control.  We see farmers campaigning but we do not see the same type of campaigning by small businesses in difficulty.  ISME is not seen helping out where loans and businesses are being sold to vulture funds.  Does ISME carry out any campaigns to protect these businesses, similar to the campaign Mr. Kissane is running for mortgage holders with non-performing loans?  Has ISME any plan to help these small businesses?</p></speech>

If we represented 40,000 of a 250,000 businesses, we would be doing well and we tend to have the bigger companies.  There is, therefore, a difficulty in getting anything like that suggested by the Senator to happen.  There is also a difficulty in getting our members who have these debt issues to come forward at a time when we can do something about it.  When we get into that long grass with a fund we will require the services of people like Mr. Kissane because we will be dealing with this on a case-by-case basis.  It is very difficult to present a united front among many small businesses.  Many of the matters I deal with involve complicated debt structures, for example, a small business that has a family home or farm land or outbuildings or mobile assets that are part of a deal in a cross-guarantee on another functioning business or another illiquid business.  If people saw down the road to what would happen to them with some of the types of guarantees they entered into, they probably would not get into them in the first place.  It can be extremely difficult to resolve those.</p></speech>

I find it hard to believe that ISME did not have some sort of a plan or that those people have not contacted it in desperation seeking help.  The fact that ISME has no plan suggests it has not discussed this issue or perhaps it has discussed it and decided not to put a plan in place to help those people.</p></speech>

Debt comes in many forms.  There is very long-term mortgage debt, short-term business debt of between five and seven years and one thinks of an overdraft as a very short facility, generally of less than 12 months and similar to credit card debt.</p><p>All of those are in scope if one's bank decides that it wants to liquidate an asset.  We will come up with a policy on this if there is an upswell of demand or a persistent demand for one type of issue to be dealt with by the membership.  The fact is, as an organisation, ISME is constrained in the presentation we were going to make to the committee.  I am not sure what Senator Burke is after but we are doing our best.</p></speech>

We have a clear plan in terms of how we help people but a major issue is the number of people who are suffering in silence and have not sought help.  The IFA has a team structure and an individual can go to somebody in the region or outside the region if one does not want the information to be known publicly or locally.  The suffering in silence is a factor for all representative bodies in matters such as this and it makes it harder to get a grip on just how big a problem this is.</p> <p>  We run campaigns daily and weekly on various issues and the reaction we get from our members on this type of issue is huge.  We look at the hit rates for stories on our websites and monitor all of these issues.  From looking at that, one must conclude there is a significant number of people who are worried about this issue, are on the radar, are in trouble and are not sure where they will end up.</p> <p>  Another concern is that when farmers eventually contact the IFA, it is sometimes too late.  Many problems have arisen as a result.  Some are afraid to contact us because they fear that if their case becomes high profile, the fund in question will be harder on them.  That is a factor as well.</p> <p>  It is hard to get a grip on the extent of the issue but based on the reaction, we are worried that a large number of farmers are in trouble.</p></speech>

We have said time and again that vulture funds are aggressive and should be stopped in their tracks.  We have raised the need for a political response from these Houses, but the response seems to be slow in coming.  Legislation needs to be put in place, but it is almost as if the political system is in paralysis and in fear of bringing forward the type of legislation that is necessary and often spoken about by the Master of the High Court.</p> <p>  We have a number of players before us this morning.  The IFA is a highly respected organisation and is one of the last men standing, as it were, that has a huge commitment from its members.  It is well used to campaigning, as is ISME.  It is an astonishing that Mr. McDonnell indicated in his opening statement that ISME had been prevented from making an appropriate presentation to the committee.  That underlines how bad the vulture funds are.  ISME is an organisation that is well rooted in the world of commerce in this country.</p> <p>  Mr. Kissane mentioned Mr. David Hall a number of times in his contribution.  Mr. Hall could not be present for personal reasons.</p></speech>

I admire the work of the IFA and ISME and Mr. Hall and Mr. Kissane.  There is a problem, however.  On 15 March last, a motion was tabled in the D&aacute;il on the lack of engagement with this committee by vulture funds.  We compared their engagement with their engagement with the Department of Finance in the period from 2013 to 2016.  It transpired that they had 125 engagements with the Department in that period.  They continue to have engagement with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Government's amendment to the motion on the engagement of vulture funds with this committee was defeated.  We spoke about the lack of engagement from the vulture funds and our unsuccessful attempts to have the agents that represent the funds appear before the committee and to be held to account.  We also called on the unregulated investment funds and the regulator to attend the committee and that was supported by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank said that firms with a serious role in the economy had a social responsibility to account for themselves before the committee.  We then asked the Government to cease all engagement with unregulated private investment funds and credit services firms until these entities were accountable to Parliament.  We are talking specifically about vulture funds and their activities.  We also asked for legislation to be introduced to regulate the unregulated entities.</p> <p>  The reason I am prompting the witnesses to consider the scope of their organisations and understand the level of respect they command is that they should take that motion, which was passed on a cross-party basis in an effort to bring focus to this issue, and lobby the Minister for Finance, as this committee does.  I encourage them collectively to ask the Minister for Finance for a meeting to bring a stop to this practice, which is causing the destruction of family farms, businesses and homes.  It  has led to suicides and is continuing to have a major negative impact on our economy.</p> <p>  I do not want to leave the meeting without advocating some kind of step forward.  The IFA, ISME and Mr. Kissane bring credibility to the story because they have heard the stories from their members and the people who interact with Mr Kissane.  We must not leave this issue here.  This committee will bring this information to the Minister for Finance but in the name of the people of Ireland whom we represent, I ask the witnesses to join in the campaign to stop these vulture funds.  The political parties and political system have an unwillingness or fear of dealing openly with the issue.  They have the capacity to deal with it but refuse to do so.</p> <p>  I am asking the witnesses to take this issue forward and put it on their agenda in their engagement with Government.  Mr. Healy, as president of the IFA, has an important position in the country, as has ISME.  They should not underestimate the respect and power they have. </p></speech>

We have no intention of parking this issue.  The IFA is becoming more deeply involved in what has become a long campaign.  As Mr. Damian McDonald said, many of our members are too shy or too embarrassed to come forward.  The Government could play a role, as Mr. Martin Stapleton stated.  For example, it cannot wash its hands of the proposed sale of loans by AIB.  The Government can prevent that sale from going ahead.  We cannot state strongly enough that it needs to do that.</p></speech>

What I mean by this is that people here feel a sense of shame if they miss a loan repayment or are unable to pay a debt.  This is built into our make-up and the fabric of every one of us.  The concern I have is that the vultures know this.  They know damn well nobody will come forward.  I have spoken with various television companies about having people appear in television programmes in silhouette and I have been told it would make them look like criminals.  I stated they cannot show their faces on camera because they would be known forever more.  This is a small country.  My point is that perhaps it would be appropriate for the committee to get some examples from people who are brave enough to appear and get another four people to come in to discuss the issues, including ISME representatives and farmers.  These should be people who will stand up and say they do not care what they have signed and they will tell their story and how it happened to them.  It is difficult to do this.  The example of the four people summarised how difficult it was but we must consider the effect it had when they did so.  We need to pass on to the customers affected the message that there are people who will stand by them and go shoulder to shoulder with them.  I say to every client on the day he or she comes into me that the problem may not have been solved but it has been shared.</p></speech>

This definition is much too broad.</p></speech>

Before selling loans to vulture funds, the banks often restructure them.  The clients feel comfortable with this but they overlook the fact that the structure or restructure is only for a three-month or six-month period, which leaves it open to the vulture fund in question to review their loans three or six months after completion of the sale.  The clients can then find themselves in a very uncomfortable position.</p></speech>

In the life assurance and financial services industry, commission disclosure is in statute and must be done for the customer.  Here, there is the hidden issue of bonuses.  Nobody knows about them and the fees in this area are astronomical.  When we add in the main players on the accountancy side, there are more Chinese walls in Ireland than there will ever be in China from what I can see.  They are now external and internal and the firm handling all of this is also involved in all aspects of the tracker investigations.  Everything is connected.</p></speech>
