    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#A00700"><p>I bid "Good morning" to the witnesses.  I welcome Mr. Moran.  It is his first visit to the current Committee of Public Accounts.  We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  I remind all of those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode.</p> <p>  There are a number of matters for examination from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts 2019, Vote 7 &ndash; Office of the Minister for Finance from the audited financial statements of the Exchequer for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2019 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019, chapter 1 - Exchequer financial outturn for 2019, and chapter 17 - Ireland Apple escrow fund.</p> <p>  To assist us in our examination of the matters before us today, and with regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by: Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department; Mr. John McCarthy, assistant secretary and chief economist; and Mr. Gary Tobin, assistant secretary, EU and international division.  We are also joined remotely by representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who work in the Finance Vote section, namely, Ms Victoria Cahill; and Mr. Brian O'Malley, principal officer.  I welcome them all here today.  It is the first time that they have come to the current committee of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.  I thank them for the briefing that they have provided to the committee.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I would also ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and taking their seats, that they sanitise their area.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#A00800"><p>I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  All revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Most public services are funded by issues of money from that Central Fund, either through annual voted provisions or directly to pay for what are called Central Fund services.</p> <p>  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund, together with a set of statements and schedules that itemise the transactions.  The format of the accounts is unusual, with a significant amount of explanation and information presented in footnotes to the schedules.</p> <p>  Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of the public services is a recurring report, which is designed to summarise the transactions on the Central Fund in a more accessible format, and to highlight relevant trends over time.</p> <p>  Overall, the Central Fund receipts and issues in 2019 were close to balance.</p> <p>  Exchequer receipts in 2019 totalled &euro;64.4 billion.  Over 92% of this was accounted for by tax receipts.  Payment of just under &euro;2.4 billion by the Central Bank from its 2018 surplus income accounted for a further 3.7% of the receipts.</p> <p>  Issues from the Central Fund in 2019 amounted to &euro;63.8 billion.  Issues to fund voted expenditure accounted for &euro;54.1 billion, or just under 85% of the total.  Service of the national debt accounted for &euro;5.2 billion, while Ireland's contribution to the European Union's budget accounted for &euro;2.4 billion.</p> <p>  The finance accounts do not include any kind of balance sheet, or statement of the Exchequer's financial position at the year end.  For this reason, the chapter on the Exchequer outturn tries to set out the summary position in relation to key assets and liabilities at the year end.</p> <p>  At the end of 2019, Ireland's gross national debt stood at &euro;206.7 billion; this was up &euro;1.5 billion from end 2018.  However, the cost to the Exchequer of servicing the national debt continued to fall in 2019, reflecting the impact of the refinancing of debt by the National Treasury Management Agency in the prevailing low-interest market.</p> <p>  Liabilities under public private partnerships, PPPs, are regarded as "off balance sheet" from a general government perspective.  Separately from the finance accounts, information published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform indicates that PPP-related commitments totalling an estimated &euro;7.1 billion were outstanding at the end of 2019.</p> <p>  Finally, the value of cash and other financial assets held by the Exchequer stood at &euro;18.5 billion at end 2019.  This was up 5% on the 2018 year-end position, continuing the significant upward trend from end 2016.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be familiar with the circumstances that gave rise to the Ireland Apple escrow fund account.  In summary, following an investigation, the EU Commission ordered Ireland to recover alleged state aid, plus interest, related to the tax on profits reported by Apple for a ten-year period.  The money in the escrow account is held under the terms of a formal agreement between the Minister for Finance and two companies in the Apple group, pending the outcome of legal proceedings.  The use of the account allows the escrow parties to determine jointly how the fund is to be managed and invested, until the owner of the fund is determined.  Any gains or losses in the interim will be incurred by the eventual owner.  The parties have agreed to pursue a low-risk investment strategy for the fund.</p> <p>  Apple's lodgements to the account between May and September 2018 totalled &euro;14.285 billion.  By end 2019, the net assets of the fund had declined to &euro;14.02 billion &ndash; a loss in value of &euro;265 million.  The largest part of the reduction in value related to a &euro;209 million withdrawal from the fund in respect of what is referred to as a "third country adjustment".  This related to payment by Apple of tax in another jurisdiction on the profits within the scope of the state aid decision.</p><p>The remainder of the loss in fund value was attributable to investment losses, administrative expenses and tax.</p><p> Separate from the administration expenses incurred by the fund account, State bodies have incurred significant costs in setting up the escrow account and in mounting legal challenges to the Commission's state aid determination.  The 2019 appropriation account for the Vote 7 records gross expenditure of just over &euro;60 million.  This is divided between two expenditure programmes.  These relate to the costs incurred in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent &euro;47.5 million, and banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent &euro;12.6 million.</p><p> Expenditure under the economic and fiscal policy programme included a very substantial exceptional item.  Note 6.3 on the account discloses that the Department reached settlements relating to protracted legal proceedings arising from an air travel tax introduced in budget 2009.  Payments under the terms of the settlement totalled &euro;24 million and were charged to subhead A4 for "consultancy services and other services".  The payments were not provided for in the original Estimate, with the result that a Supplementary Estimate was required for the Vote in 2019.  When this item is excluded, the programme expenditure in 2019 was only marginally up on the 2018 expenditure.</p><p> Members may also wish to note that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has provided a number of staff on loan to the Department to work in its banking unit.  The related staff costs and certain consultancy costs are paid by the NTMA, and are not recouped from the Department.  As a result, the reported expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation account does not include the full costs of the functions undertaken.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording me the opportunity to address them.  With me today are Mr. John McCarthy, the Department's chief economist, and Mr. Gary Tobin, head of the EU and international division.  I will focus on the specific items on today's agenda and keep my comments brief.</p> <p>  The Estimate for the Department of Finance for 2019 was originally set at &euro;41.1 million, or &euro;39.7 million net of appropriations-in-aid available.  A Supplementary Estimate was obtained in December 2019, bringing our gross estimate to &euro;62.3 million, or &euro;60.9 million net of appropriations-in-aid.  The net outturn for 2019 was &euro;58.8 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;2.083 million.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 7 was to meet the cost of legal settlements entered into by the State following advice from senior counsel and approved by the Attorney General's office.  The settlements were in respect of protracted legal proceedings arising from the air travel tax introduced in budget 2009, and agreements were entered into following mediation.</p> <p>  Savings which had arisen during the year were used to offset partly the supplementary allocation required.  These savings were approximately &euro;1.4 million in capital and &euro;1 million of the original consultancy allocation.  Despite this, at the end of the year a surplus arose for a number of reasons.  There was an underspend of &euro;1.1 million on programme-related costs arising from lower legal and consultancy costs, mainly relating to the shareholding and financial advisory division of the Department.  There were savings of &euro;200,000 relating to the disabled drivers fuel grant scheme, and &euro;300,000 was returned to the Exchequer in respect of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Underspending of some &euro;500,000 occurred in respect of non-pay administration expenses, &euro;300,000 of which was due to capital projects not proceeding during the year.</p> <p>  Regarding the Exchequer financial outturn for 2019, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2019, at &euro;59.3 billion, were up &euro;3.8 billion, or 7%, year on year and &euro;1.3 billion, or 2.4%, on profile.  Regarding income tax, the largest tax head, the 2019 performance was strong, with receipts finishing the year &euro;1.7 billion, or 8%, ahead of those for 2018 and in line with profile.  Corporation tax receipts in 2019, amounting to &euro;10.9 billion, were up by &euro;500 million year on year and some &euro;1.4 billion ahead of profile.  VAT returns saw strong annual growth of 6.2% in 2019 and were in line with expectations.  Total VAT collected during 2019 was just over &euro;15 billion.  Excise receipts were in line with profile, with some &euro;5.9 billion collected.  This represented an increase of nearly 10%, or more than &euro;500 million, on 2018.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at &euro;63.8 billion, represented an increase of some &euro;3.6 billion on 2018.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, as part of the European Commission's decision of August 2016, Ireland was ordered to recover from Apple the alleged state aid, plus interest, related to a ten-year period from 2003 up to 2014.  Notwithstanding Ireland's appeal against the Commission's decision, the Irish Government complied with its obligation and recovered a sum of &euro;13.1 billion plus interest of a further &euro;1.2 billion.  The Minister for Finance agreed with Apple that the amounts collected should be held in an escrow fund until the legal process is completed.  The Ireland Apple escrow fund was established under the terms of a formal agreement between the Minister for Finance and Apple pending the final outcome of legal challenges to the findings of a state aid investigation undertaken by the European Commission.  The investment and management of the fund is jointly overseen by the Minister and Apple, with the Minister's functions delegated to the NTMA.</p> <p>  In July this year, the General Court of the European Union annulled the Commission's decision, with the award of costs to Ireland.  However, the Commission has now lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice of the European Union, so it could be at least a further two years before legal proceedings are concluded.  The Ireland Apple escrow fund will continue to be operational during this time.  I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which presents an excellent overview of the performance of the fund and how it is managed.</p> <p>  The Department's mission is to manage Government finances and play a central role in the achievement of the Government's economic and social goals, having regard to the programme for Government.  The Department is currently in the process of drafting a new strategy statement for the period 2021 to 2023.  It will set out how the Department will continue to work towards achieving strategic goals pertaining to public finances, the economy and the financial sector.</p> <p>  In 2019, the Department continued to make progress on achieving its goals, which are fully aligned with the two programmes set out in the Department's appropriation account for 2019.  Solid economic growth was recorded in 2019, notwithstanding heightened uncertainty regarding the form that the UK's exit from the European Union would take.  GDP grew by 5.6% over the year, with modified domestic demand &ndash; a better indicator of domestic economic conditions &ndash; recording an increase of 3.3%.  Robust economic growth continued to pay dividends in the labour market.  Employment growth of around 3% or higher was recorded for the seventh year straight, with the level of employment reaching 2.3 million in the fourth quarter, the highest level on record.  Accordingly, the unemployment rate edged below 5%, which is broadly consistent with the achievement of full employment in economic terms. </p> <p>  The role of the Department and others in the Brexit process has been to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to minimise disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible.  Brexit is mainstreamed in the Department's work in all areas including economic analysis, financial services and taxation.  During 2019, the Department continued to contribute to the EU-UK negotiations and to domestic preparedness work within the whole-of-government structures overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Department's dedicated Brexit unit oversaw the co-ordination of this work.  In fulfilling its mission, the Department carried out a broad range of activities in 2019, as well as international outreach, representing Ireland's economic and financial interests abroad as well as strengthening Ireland's alliance-building efforts.  </p> <p>  The arrival of Covid-19 in 2020 has had a profound impact on both the economy and the public finances.  The very positive outturn for 2019 has helped to facilitate an early, ongoing and economically appropriate countercyclical response to the crisis.  We went from virtually full employment in quarter 1 to a peak unemployment rate of 27% in quarter 2, with an expected average of around 16% for the year as a whole.  This illustrates the scale of the challenges we face.  I would like to refer to some of the Department's work this year in responding to Covid-19.  It has managed this work in a very different way.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was introduced in March to provide income support to eligible employees where the employer's business activities were negatively impacted by Covid-19.  The aim of the scheme was to maximise staff retention and firm viability by maintaining the link between the employer and employee.  The July jobs stimulus plan contained a suite of tax, loan and expenditure measures designed to directly support businesses at all levels of the economy that are negatively impacted by Covid-19.  The employment wage subsidy scheme replaced the TWSS in September.  It is an economy-wide support open to all sectors and gives a subsidy to qualifying employers on the basis of the number of paid employees on the employer's payroll.</p> <p>  Budget 2021 was set against much uncertainty for the coming period in the context of Covid-19 and Brexit.  Despite the challenges posed by the current pandemic, the Department delivered on the budget from both policy and logistical perspectives.</p><p>The Covid-19 restrictions support scheme has been designed to assist those businesses whose trade has been significantly impacted or temporarily closed as a result of the restrictions set out in the Government&rsquo;s plan for living with Covid-19. </p><p> We are in the process of applying for EU funding towards the costs of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks, SURE, could result in Ireland accessing just under &euro;2.5 billion and will help to diversify sources of funding for the Exchequer.</p><p> We have been engaging with the European Commission while it develops the details of how the Brexit adjustment reserve will be allocated and how it must be spent to put forward our case that it should reflect, in particular, Ireland&rsquo;s significant adjustment and expenditure needs.  </p><p> I once again express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work, particularly this year in light of the additional challenges faced on foot of Covid-19.  It is only through their hard work, professionalism and commitment that we can continue to deliver.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention and welcome any follow-up questions.</p></speech>

I will take up where he finished and thank all his staff and everybody in the Department who have been working during what has been a very challenging six or seven months at this stage.</p> <p>  There is a lot of interest, as Mr. Moran knows, in the Apple escrow account and how it is managed.  The sums of money involved are beyond people's imaginations.  They are so massive that there is a public interest in understanding how they operate.  One of the areas of particular interest is the issue regarding the fact that payments of approximately &euro;9 million were paid to investment managers, escrow agents and custodians.  That is a huge amount of money.  There was an issue about the VAT payment, I understand, that resulted in payment being deferred and made late.  Why were those payments not made on time?  Did the fund incur any interest or penalty charges as a result of the error?</p></speech>

There was some uncertainty about whether the fund was liable to withholding tax or VAT.  Tax advice was sought on that.  My view is that if one thinks one has a tax liability, one pays it and recovers from the Revenue authorities in due course.  I understand that, as it turned out, the VAT payment and withholding tax payment were due and were probably chargeable to the fund.</p></speech>

We tend to see the big number of &euro;14.2 billion and the run-offs on that.  This is small, but I agree with the Deputy that this should have been caught at an earlier stage.  It is small in the overall context but given the nature of the level of advice available to the fund, one would think it would have been caught earlier.</p></speech>

I wonder has Mr. Moran any fears because of the way in which the fund is managed.  As he says, it is almost in the ether so nobody knows who is losing at the end of the day, whether it is Apple or the Irish State, in terms of any expenditure.  Lawyers, financial advisers and investment firms see an opportunity to make a lot of money, in real terms.  Is Mr. Moran satisfied that the safeguards are in place to ensure that these guys are actually providing value for money, in the first instance, and that there is appropriate accountability on whether they are being paid for doing real and valid work?</p></speech>

If they are underperforming, the portfolios can be redistributed among those who are performing better to ensure that the amount of money in the fund is maintained to the greatest possible extent.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the fact that it is a very conservative investment mandate and that is at the heart of the care being taken to make sure that the costs are not excessive and the losses are minimised.</p> <p>  Our options were to put that money on deposit if we could find somebody to take it or to put it into escrow.  The risk with putting it on deposit is that in the negative interest rate environment, the fund would probably lose &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million a year every year.</p></speech>

I understand that William Fry, for example, has received approximately &euro;3 million.  The current Attorney General had received &euro;612,000 up to March of this year.  Those are substantial sums of money.  Could Mr. Moran give an indication of the type of work that would be conducted in order to receive those types of funds from this account?</p></speech>

The fees break down as roughly &euro;4 million for the establishment of the escrow and that detailed legal work has now been completed.  The &euro;4.6 million is the cost of the legal team, expert witnesses and so on, in contesting the case itself.  I have provided a detailed breakdown of what fees were paid to whom and I think the Deputy is quoting from that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the solicitors that were engaged.  They would have been engaged competitively.  We have a framework and there would have been a tender process.  We have a set of qualifying solicitors and we would have carried out a sub-tender within that.  A company won the contract.  We did what we needed to do to ensure the best value we could get there.  As I say, in terms of the establishment of the escrow, those costs are finished.</p> <p>  On the defence of the case, we have a team that we think is appropriate to the defence of what is an enormous case.  As the committee will have seen in July, the case was annulled with the award of costs by the general court so there is a potential to recover those but I understand that both sides tend to meet their own costs in these sorts of cases.  That said, there is an award of costs that is now being appealed.  The legal team is employed within the framework of the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Attorney General's office and so on and so forth.  The procurement of legal advice tends to be done through those channels rather than through ourselves and they are the experts in fee structures for that work.</p></speech>

It may have no bearing on the Irish State, depending what happens with the escrow fund.</p><p>It may have a substantial bearing if we were to lose the case, ironically.  I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that &euro;4.4 million is associated with costs to the State and other statutory bodies, apart from legal appeals.  On the forthcoming appeal, is there any estimate on how much it is likely to cost the State in legal fees?</p></speech>

We are looking at the terms of the appeal and the Government will have to consider how it responds to that in due course.  It will be December before it does that.  In the end, we will be represented.  Will we be represented at the same level that we were heretofore?  Again, the approach taken will be determined by the legal advice.  This time around it is the Commission appealing the decision rather than Ireland making the running, which possibly changes the balance.  At this juncture it will continue to cost for the duration to the next hearing, which probably will not happen for two to three years.  I could not say what the costs will be at the end.</p></speech>

There were two pieces.  There were four of five strands of precedents around this.  The first challenge was a complaint made by Ryanair to the Commission that it was state aid, and that they should be refunded the difference between &euro;10 and &euro;2 on their flights.  The second strand was when the Commission spoke to us on the basis that the imposition of differential rates had an impact on freedom of travel within the Union.  The Directorate-General for Competition was dealing with two elements, one on a complaint from Ryanair and one on the concern that it distorted the freedom to travel within the Union.  On the first matter we engaged with them and within one year the conclusion was that a single rate was most appropriate.  Some 12 months after the measure had been introduced, we imposed a single rate of &euro;3.</p></speech>

For example, at any given time the Irish competent authority, which would be the Revenue Commissioners, could be in discussion with the competent authority in the United States of America or in Italy or Spain about companies that have a presence in multiple jurisdictions, and if a portion of that tax should be paid here, and <i>vice versa</i>.  These adjustments are reasonably routine.  Do not forget that this Apple money goes back over a period of ten years so the adjustments were made.  Third-country adjustment has very little, if anything, to do with the case itself.  It is that tax moneys are owing to the country.  These are routine transactions that go on.  They probably could diminish over time given the fact that this is historical.</p><p>They are just properly payable and the Commission, when it reached its adjudication, recognised that there would be some draw on these funds and that adjustment could be made of the top without us in any way invalidating its obligation to collect the money.</p></speech>

I appreciate the difficulty of finding somewhere to put something of that nature on deposit in a negative interest rate environment, but can Mr. Moran tell us about the decision making to move to an escrow account and the implications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#E00300"><p>The interesting thing is that on the day of the decision, the Commission had mentioned that this money should probably be lodged to an escrow.  The Commission had said it.  As it was pending we had been doing much thinking about it.  One of the risks of not doing so was giving the Exchequer a large exposure to having to meet any shortfall.  If one puts it on deposit at a negative interest rate of whatever it might be, there is an annual fall in the value of it.  I must get this right.  If, ironically, we were to win and the money was going back to Apple, the State could be in for several hundred million in terms of moneys lost to negative interest rate charges.  If that had been on deposit with the Central Bank, it would have seriously distorted its balance sheet.  We would have got 80% of that in additional profit back from the Central Bank, so there is a gap.  One can see in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report the third country adjustments.  There was a loss.  Negative interest rates would be a contributing factor to that.  The benefit of the escrow is that at the end of it, let us say three years hence, if one loses &euro;40 million per year to negative interest rates the State does not have to make up the difference.</p></speech>

It is &euro;37 million in 2019 and &euro;16 million in the half-year period.  It is already losing money as a consequence of the negative interest rate environment.  Other than that, the State would be liable at the end of whatever the period is for additional money in circumstances where the case goes the way the State would like it to go - we will take out the words "winning" and "losing" - in our overall best interests.  It is not the case that there is an amount of money that can be tapped into in the interim.  In circumstances where one tapped into that money for houses, coronavirus supports or whatever else, the State would ultimately be liable should the case go the way we want it to go.  It would be additionally liable for those funds to Apple.</p></speech>

There was one case that ran for approximately 16 years with money going both in and out of the fund, albeit a much smaller scale, before it was finally settled and taken in.  Deputy Carthy referred to the air travel case.  We would have taken in moneys on suspense, as it were, covering the state aid, pending the outcome of the legal process.  When that is completed the moneys come to the State in that instance.</p></speech>

What is the implication in terms of retrospective certainty in that instance?</p></speech>

It is important to remember that in contesting the case it is very much about saying that the Irish tax system abides by the law, does not give favourable deals and the like.  In other words, it asserts that certainty that it applies the rule of law both nationally and internationally and does not exercise discretion.  It is much less about the company for the State than it is about the principles.  That gives companies certainty that we are willing to defend our tax system against all of those.</p></speech>

It is complex.  Unquestionably, international corporate tax policy and international corporate tax law are incredibly complex and difficult.  On the idea that there is a fund we are simply not availing of, not only are we not availing of it but to get to a position where it reverts to the Exchequer is deeply risky for the rest of the foreign direct investment base, the companies that have been here for many years, and the read across for them in terms of retrospective certainty, and in planning for the future in terms of tax policy and attracting investment into Ireland.</p></speech>

Ultimately, if the Commission had decided not to appeal, we probably would be unwinding the escrow now and the money would be going back to Apple.  If one had spent it, one starts borrowing for it, so the money is held separate until the end of the legal proceedings.</p></speech>

They will be familiar with me raising the IBRC liquidation previously, going back to my interest in having a committee of inspection appointed to the liquidation.  It is the biggest liquidation in the history of Europe and has been ongoing since February 2013.  I am aware that subsequent to us raising it here that legal cases were brought relating to oversight.  I appreciate that the witnesses cannot talk about courts and so forth, but can they give us a status update on that and in terms of oversight of matters such as professional fees and so forth?  Having not proceeded with the appointment of a committee of inspection have they, in parallel with ongoing court cases, padded out the level of oversight regarding professional fees?</p></speech>

Liquidations are all different, but it is the scale here.  They looked at the hourly rates applicable and found them to be lower than court-approved rates.  Given the exchanges we have had with the Deputy over the last couple of years, it was really important that we get somebody, not us, to look at this.  There are lower than average UK insolvency rates.  There has been no increase in the fees over the period since the liquidation started, which is unusual.  Usually one would have a liquidator going to the court and looking for increases of fees because of the duration.  If the Deputy remembers there was a rebate on fees of &euro;5 million that was agreed with the liquidators and, while they could not be exhaustive on this, they had not come across a situation like that.  I am happy to make it available to the Deputy and I am happy to deal with any queries.</p></speech>

The other query about it at the time was that, apart from the fees being low, and I am sure these particular liquidators are the exception, in the past accountancy firms have been known to add hours to the time measure and stick that time into liquidation A or liquidation B.  That is the reason for oversight.</p><p>I have no doubt that the hourly rates are competitive.  Indeed, they were based on the NAMA rates.  That concern still exists.  Does the report deal with the matter?</p></speech>

What it endeavours to do is compare the costs of similar scale.  I think the fees up to the end of 2019 were about &euro;277 million.  The Estimate, when this is over, will come to somewhere between &euro;304 million and &euro;313 million.</p> <p>  When this ends is open to question.  The IBRC currently still has 40 active legal cases - 26 in which they are defending and 14 where they are the plaintiff so this remains complex. </p></speech>

I think that is correct.  Everything that the Secretary General has said is absolutely correct.  Given the scale of moneys involved, it is quite conceivable that other competent authorities, so other tax authorities, may decide that they feel due some of the Apple money.  Members will recall that the way the OECD views taxing rights is on the basis of where the added value was created.  This follows the international arm's length principle.  So, it is conceivable that another jurisdiction may feel that it is due some of the taxing rights involved so they may lodge a claim.</p></speech>

I want to touch on a few issues concerning the Exchequer financial outturns.</p> <p>  Irish Water received &euro;96 million in 2015, &euro;184 million in 2016, &euro;270 million in 2017 and nothing in 2018.  In 2019, Irish Water received &euro;758 million by way of a capital contribution.  Please outline the difference between a capital contribution and a capital grant.  I understand that no shares were issued to the State in respect of the funding and that it was in relation to the domestic debt of Irish Water.  What is the scenario in terms of non-domestic debt?  Is there not a structure in place for the State to fund Irish Water?  What is the reason for the variation in contributions?</p> <p>  The dividends amount received from State bodies has decreased from &euro;551 million in 2016 to &euro;262 million in 2019.  Why?  What is the prognosis for dividends from State companies for the next number of years?</p> <p>  Finally, in terms of the value of State shareholdings, I understood that a public sector balance sheet was to be produced.  Where are we with that?      </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#F03900"><p>On Irish Water and the big &euro;758 million amount that is reflected in the 2019 accounts, it is really a function of the history of Irish Water.  Irish Water, as originally conceived, was supposed to be a commercial semi-State company.  It had, therefore, a commercial borrowing mandate.  It had approved borrowings up to a certain amount.  It had exercised an amount of that.  However, as we all know, EUROSTAT determined that actually it was not off-balance sheet.  It was not commercial in that sense.  It was on-balance sheet so what one had is them carrying debt at commercial interest rates when the State could actually replace that debt at zero or, possibly, negative interest rates.  Essentially what we did is we rolled up to cope with that debt and funded it through the Exchequer.</p><p>In direct terms, it has a cost on the Exchequer side but in general government or wider accounting terms, it is neutral.  We changed that level of debt for the same level of debt differently funded.  One accrues a saving on the interest payments going forward.  Does Mr. McCarthy think that is a reasonable summary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#G00200"><p>Absolutely.  I suppose the key thing is that there may have been an impact on the Exchequer.  It was more than offset by an impact on Irish Water.  Both entities are within general government.  From a general government perspective, which is the bottom line from a European perspective because it is what investors look at and so forth, it was absolutely neutral.  This transaction had important cash flow savings to the State by way of lower debt service payments by replacing commercial debt with cheaper sovereign debt, so to speak.  This was, therefore, a positive without any general government balance implication.</p></speech>

It is the same process if the Exchequer borrows on that basis and gives the money to Irish Water.  A cheaper way of doing it, however, would be if the Exchequer borrowed via the NTMA and then provided the money to Irish Water.  In other words, that is a cheaper way of financing Irish Water.</p></speech>

For this session, we were sent some briefing notes that included previous recommendations from this committee and responses from the Department of Finance.  Recommendation 3 was around annual reporting of all contributions.  It is useful to see the report that was put out by the Department in September.  I think that even sectoral committees should look at that information.</p> <p>  I am mindful that a huge amount of change and debate is happening in the EU at the moment in the context of tax.  We have the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and the OECD process.  We have a new EU subcommittee on tax matters.  Obviously, Ireland attends the code of conduct group on business taxation which debates the future of taxation measures in the EU.  As a new person in all of this, I find it difficult to glean always from the information available to me what position our Government takes on some of those issues within these debates.  I am aware that there is a twice yearly report from the code of conduct group to ECOFIN, but it does not always give me the information I am looking for.  Is it possible to have the minutes of those meetings made available and tabled to this committee on a regular basis?</p></speech>

We attend it like all other members.  It allows for a discussion where somebody thinks something harmful is happening in one jurisdiction and an element of persuasion in terms of the correction of that.  That goes on all the time.  As the Deputy correctly said, a report goes to ECOFIN twice a year.  Mr. Tobin may wish to speak to those reports because he is more familiar with them than I am.</p></speech>

Certainly, much is happening at EU level with regard to taxation at the moment.  Obviously, the BEPS process is happening at the OECD.  In many ways, the OECD process is a multilateral process that will inform the EU process.  Some of what is happening at EU level, therefore, will probably only kick in once the OECD has completed its work, as the Deputy will be aware.</p> <p>  The subcommittee on tax matters mentioned by the Deputy has been set up.  As I understand it, it is a subcommittee of the European Parliament.  Currently, as things stand, the European Parliament does not have any jurisdiction with regard to taxation matters at the EU level.  It is a matter for the Council.</p></speech>

I have a quick question.  In the summer of last year, the European Commission served formal notice on Ireland asking us to implement key anti-tax avoidance rules earlier than the delay we put on it to 2024.  It was reported that we would work with the Commission to speed up the implementation of those tax avoidance rules on how companies use interest payments to cut their tax bills.  Can we have an update on that?</p></speech>

This becomes increasingly important as we move from 40 years of being a net beneficiary into being a net contributor.  I understand that over the next seven years, we will move from paying approximately &euro;2.5 billion per year up to &euro;4 billion by the end of the seventh year.  It is important that people are informed and the Deputy made the point that it is relevant to sectoral committees as well.</p></speech>

I watched some of it from my office so the Chairman might tell me if I go over old ground.  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, which was a combination of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, had a huge cost somewhere in the region of &euro;35 billion.  It was &euro;30 billion and &euro;5 billion, respectively.  Much of that is simply not recoverable.  We can see that &euro;682 million was received by the Exchequer in 2019.   Is there anything due in 2020?  What is the schedule for receipts with regard to the IBRC?</p><p>When is the liquidation expected to conclude?

I should have my notes in front of me.  We hope that it will be concluded over the next two years.  I believe I mentioned a figure of &euro;277 million for the total cost of fees in the liquidation stage.  It could be in the region of &euro;305 million to &euro;315 million by the end.  When this will end is not in the liquidator's control or ours, as there are still 40 legal cases outstanding.  They are approximately split between 26 cases in which the liquidator is the defendant and 14 cases where the liquidator is the plaintiff.  There is still money to come back to the State from the liquidation process.  I will correct myself in due course if I am wrong, but we expect approximately &euro;150 million to come back next year and a further &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million the year after.</p></speech>

Both taxes have held up.  The multinational sector includes ultra-modern ICT services, pharmaceuticals and so on and has done well during the crisis, if the Deputy understands what I mean.  This means that revenues from that source have helpfully stood up strongly, which is a positive.</p> <p>  We in the Department have always spoken about - we were probably the earliest to do so - the risks to corporation tax in the medium term, particularly given the changing global environment in the form of BEPS I, BEPS II and so on.  In the previous budget or the one before that, we began including a negative drag on corporation tax receipts from about 2023 onwards, accumulating to approximately &euro;2 billion in value, because we recognised-----</p></speech>

We published a medium-term forecast for the economy and the public finances in January in advance of the election because the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the budget had changed.  The budget was based on a disorderly Brexit.  In January, we said that because of BEPS, we would lose &euro;500 million every year from 2022 onwards.  That amount would accumulate.  There would be &euro;500 million in 2022 and &euro;1 billion in 2023.  We went out to 2025, when the loss would have accumulated to &euro;2 billion.  We also said that that owed purely to BEPS and that if a company relocated from Ireland, there would be an additional hit on the corporation tax front.</p></speech>

The UK has left the EU and we are now talking about an EU 27.  A country's EU budget contribution is based on the percentage size of its economy relative to the entire EU's.  Essentially all member states will have to absorb the fact that the UK will no longer be paying into the EU budget in the way it was.  Interestingly, it is important to say that, depending on the ongoing Brexit negotiations, the UK may decide to remain in aspects of certain programmes.  For example, it is well known that there has been some discussion about the UK remaining in the Erasmus+ programme.  If the UK remains in certain programmes under a deal scenario, it could be envisaged that there would be certain payments by the UK into the budget in the coming years.  However, the Deputy's overall point is accurate.  The UK has left, so all other member states will have to pick up the-----</p></speech>

A political point might be that one would wonder how there is anything left in the account given the number of times Opposition politicians have asked that it be spent.  With regard to the decreasing balance, I believe there is a figure of &euro;209 million for the transfer and &euro;56 million for investment losses, administration and taxation.  On the investment losses, I heard the contributions on whether the moneys should be on deposit or in an escrow account but a loss of &euro;37 million is a loss of &euro;37 million in an investment strategy.  It could amount to nearly &euro;100 million if it lasted for over three years.  What is being done to address that?  Why was the loss so acute between May 2019 and December 2019?  The figure is &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

In a negative interest rate environment, even the preservation of the capital amount is going to be a challenge.  There is a very conservative mandate.  The mandate is to preserve the actual amount in so far as that is possible.  It is not an investment fund to make big profits, although there could be a profit at the end of the day.  However, it is a winner-takes-all formula.</p> <p>  One of the reasons for the escrow is to protect the State against the risk of exactly what the Deputy is describing - large losses or potentially large losses.

Irish Water was meant to be commercial and was a commercial borrowing authority.  It borrowed at commercial rates and paid interest on the borrowings.  The body was then deemed not be commercial and it was on the State's balance sheet.  The State can borrow a whole lot cheaper.  What the State did was intervene and replace commercial debt with sovereign debt, with no impact on the overall balance sheet, which saw &euro;758 million going in and &euro;758 million going out, bearing in mind the position on costs and general government expenditure.  The longer-term debt-servicing cost is cheaper.  In the round, it is.  It can look very complex but, in substance, it is not.</p></speech>

It has been an extremely challenging time for many Departments.</p> <p>  I would like to have an understanding of the position of mergers and acquisitions regarding corporation tax receipts.  The year 2019 was probably one of the busiest in terms of biopharmaceutical, life sciences and technology companies.  Recently, there was a &euro;46 billion acquisition of Allergan by Abbvie.  How does the Department factor that into the receipts?  Is it accounted for in the report?  What process is used to determine the figures and transactions?</p></speech>

That amount has been paid.  It is roughly in the order of &euro;600 million.  The company has paid this but it will appeal it through the Tax Appeals Commission in the normal way.</p> <p>  We deal with the information we have available to us.  Sometimes, through the Revenue Commissioners, we can get more granular information that feeds into the work of Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues on forecasting, including in respect of potential restructurings, changes of payment dates, acquisitions and so on.  On the forecasting, does Mr. McCarthy want to give us a flavour of what happens?</p></speech>

Ultimately, corporate taxes paid are a function of corporate profitably.  What we are trying to do in the Department is forecast what profitability might be.  We know the effective rate of corporation tax is around 8% or 9%, in total.  We forecast profitability, which is pretty much a function of GDP and so forth, so it is very much a macro-driven process.  As Mr. Moran mentioned, however, we also supplement it with additional information from the Revenue Commissioners regarding restructurings, changes in payment date and so on.  I would point out, however, that there are important Chinese walls.  We could never be given the name of a particular company.  It is illegal for me to receive that but we can get an indication that there is a big transaction that is going to affect our results.</p> <p>  When we are compiling our forecasts, it is a combination of a top-down approach, again based on a macroeconomic base.  I refer to information on corporate tax, which is related to corporate profitability, supplemented by additional information from our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners.  We will take into account factors such as mergers and acquisitions.</p></speech>

In terms of the figure of &euro;3.9 billion, a sizeable portion of that will be interest repayments on the bank debt.  The Department of Finance must have some figure for that.

The State has shares in three banks.  It has a 13.95% share in the Bank of Ireland, and as I understand it, there was a dividend payment of &euro;24 million in 2019.  In respect of AIB, the State has a share of just over 71% in the bank, and, in 2019, there was a dividend payment of just over &euro;228 million.  How much of a share does the State have in Permanent TSB?  There was no dividend payment from that bank in 2019.  Will Mr. Moran address that point briefly?

It seems that the taxpayers have taken a substantial hit, if all the State received was &euro;300 million from the three banks from which it should receive dividends, when the annual cost of servicing the debt, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, is somewhere between &euro;1.1 and &euro;1.3 billion, and the overall debt is approximately &euro;40 billion now.

The amount of the gross investment in those three banks was approximately &euro;29.6 billion at the start.  Over the years, in terms of sales of shares, investment income and fees paid by the banks, the State has got back approximately &euro;19 billion of that and, therefore, the gap between what the State put in and what it has got back, is about &euro;10 billion.  The equity value of the three banks is currently approximately &euro;2.3 billion, so there is a gap of &euro;7 billion in terms of the State being able to recover the full amount of the investment.  It is a question of strategy.  All bank shares across Europe and the world have done particularly badly over the past two years.  If I had attended the committee two years ago, I would have put a value on the banks' shares closer to the full &euro;10 billion that is outstanding.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Irish Water is not subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I was in the D&aacute;il when it was established and I spoke to the Minister at the time about the issue as I was a spokesperson.  I always felt that it should be subject to audit, but that is the way it is.  The figure I mentioned amounts to a substantial sum compared to the other semi-State bodies.  Due to how Irish Water was initially structured, subsequent events and how everything panned out from a policy perspective, there is now a substantial transfer of taxpayer's money to it.  Does the Department receive annual financial reports from Irish Water?  If there is such a large tranche of taxpayers' money going to this body, and the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have the opportunity to audit its accounts, and the committee does not see its accounts, is the Department seeing detailed financial reports from Irish Water on income, expenditure, investment plans, etc?</p></speech>

There is a significant financial expertise in Mr. Moran's Department overseeing this.  There is a large sum of money going to Irish Water - a cartload with creels on it.  From the public's perspective, the concern, which has been a concern since the body was established, is that no audit conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. Moran said that his Department writes the cheque, and that is how it is structured and that is the role that the Department has been given.  However, neither the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is overseeing the payment of this money to Irish Water and getting detailed reports on its business plans, income, expenditure and financial practices.</p></speech>

Let me clarify.  What I am saying is that the cheque is going across from your Department or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is basically being left to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to oversee this.  That is what the officials here are confirming.  There is no Department with a financial remit overseeing this expenditure.</p></speech>

I wish to ask three specific questions.  The first relates to the insurance compensation fund.  A repayment of &euro;80 million was made to the Exchequer and to the fund in 2019.  This will reduce outstanding balance to &euro;555.7 million as of 31 December this year.  When is that balance due to be repaid?  Were any amounts received this year?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the financial accounts for 2019.  I have before me section 11 of the financial statements.  My question relates to the State savings schemes.  The figures show a comparison between 2018 and 2019.  I gather that the Department will not have figures for 2020 yet but I assume there will be an increase this year in terms of investment in those schemes.  Can the officials elaborate on that?</p> <p>  My third question relates to the statements for current non-voted expenditure.  One thing that caught my eye was the sugar levy.  There is an amount for 2018 but nothing for 2019.  Why is that?  Will the officials come back to me on those questions, please?</p></speech>

It is coming back through a levy on insurance policies over time.  We reckon there will be ten more years before that will be full repaid.</p> <p>  We promised Deputy Murphy a note on the savings funds.  That is an important part of it.  We will do that.</p> <p>  I am unsure about the question on non-voted expenditure.</p></speech>

My final question relates to the appearance of officials before the committee last May.  There was a recommendation from the committee about insufficient progress being made on the PULSE system.  Work was due to be completed by 2020.  I realise the officials might not have the information at the committee today, but perhaps they can come back to me on that.  I understand clear timelines were agreed by the Central Statistics Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would be interested in anything the Department has on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Devlin made a valid point about the State savings schemes and so forth.  One of the real issues at the moment is not so much State savings but household savings.  That is probably where Deputy Devlin was coming from.  There has been a vast increase in household savings.  It seems to be mostly at the commercial banks but I imagine it would affect the State savings schemes as well.  We have seen data from the period from March to August.  It is double what it was in the same period last year.  That is a valid point.</p></speech>

The highest ever figure was 16% or 17%, but the figure hit 35% in the second quarter of this year.  It was the same in the UK and the USA, where the figures hit 30% or 33%.  These are figures we have never seen before.</p></speech>

The figure has decreased substantially in the past five years.  Is there an explanation for that?  What is the expectation over the coming three years?  Is there a particular reason it has literally come down by more than 50%?</p></speech>

It could easily have been that there was a one-off issue in 2015 because the figure comes down and then stabilises on the basis of the figures in later years.  It is possible that it was a one-off but I will ask my colleagues to firm up on that and come back to Deputy Colm Burke in writing.</p></speech>

The figure was &euro;209 billion at the end of December 2019.  It will now be up to &euro;220 billion.  Will there be a substantial increase?  We are obviously going to have to pay back capital as well as interest.  What likely change will arise in respect of same?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110500002#L02400"><p>That is a very relevant question.  I can set out the trajectory in pure money amounts.  Last year the figure was &euro;204 billion.  For 2020, we estimate &euro;219 billion by the end of the year.  For next year, we are looking at a debt of &euro;239 billion.  My view is that the State can absorb the one-off increase in the level of public indebtedness.  What really matters is the trajectory of the debt to income ratio, in other words, debt to GDP or debt to GNI*.  In spring, the Government will set out the stability programme and a medium-term trajectory to get that debt ratio on a downward path.  Most economists take the view that economic growth can do the bulk of the heavy lifting.  In other words, even if the nominal amount has increased to almost &euro;240 billion, the growth rate in GDP will reduce the ratio over time.  Forgive me for going on.  Deputy Colm Burke also made a point about the burden of servicing the debt.  It is important that monetary policy has reacted on this occasion.  In recent years we have seen interest rates fall, not only at the short end of the curve - in other words the policy rate - but also at the longer end of the curve, as the European Central Bank has stepped in via quantitative easing and what is now called the pandemic emergency purchase programme.  It is hovering up a great deal of Euro area sovereign debt.  It is keeping long-term borrowing costs down.  For instance, the Irish sovereign can borrow ten-year money at approximately 0% at the moment.  That does not mean it will always be the case.  The one thing we do know is that is a non-equilibrium position.  Interest rates will rise.  It is a question of when.  The key point I wish to make is that Euro area sovereigns can carry a higher burden of debt because of the lower interest rate environment.</p></speech>

We have financial statements from the 13 bodies that the Department has responsibility for from 2018 but we have not had an audited financial statement from the Credit Union Restructuring Board since 2016.</p><p>Is that board still active or is it being wound up?  I will not beat the drum for a system of public banking, as we often do in the Green Party.  However, in the absence of a kind person with &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion to capitalise a community bank, we are reliant on the commitment in the programme for Government to a reform of policy around credit unions to enable them to grow and to broaden the remit of credit unions and post offices to allow them to provide some community banking facilities.  Is work being done on that and, if so, where are we in that regard?</p></speech>

It is fair to say that in terms of the budget, which was announced only three weeks ago but seems like a lifetime ago, the amount of money being pumped into the economy is larger than ever before.  In terms of what we have done this year and plan to do next year by way of additional borrowing, which is in the range of &euro;42 billion to &euro;45 billion, a lot of that will go into capital.  A lot of it will also go into supporting the economy as it is and to kick-start it.  We often speak at this committee about the fiscal rules and how they constrain spend.  I once heard the fiscal rules characterised as being in place so that one can repair the roof when the sun is shining so that when it is raining one does not get wet.  The Department is of the view that the response in terms of additional borrowing and investing in the economy and supporting incomes is the correct countercyclical policy at this juncture.  I will ask Mr. McCarthy to comment further.</p></speech>

The total budgetary package was &euro;17.75 billion, which is unheard of.  On the capital side, &euro;9.2 billion is the figure for this year, which is the highest ever.  It increases to just under &euro;10 billion for next year, which is unprecedented.</p></speech>

I genuinely hope it plays a pivotal role in highlighting the issues and encourages all those involved in education to commit to an inclusive culture in schools so that bullying is never tolerated.  I also hope the voices of young people are heard and listened to in this important work.</p> <p>  I will invite the witnesses to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members.</p><p>I will invite our guests to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions by members of the committee.

Transition year classes across the country are also watching for what will be an important conversation.  Bullying in schools includes many types of bullying, including physical and verbal.  In recent years, it has changed in recent years with the occurrence of cyberbullying.  This bullying can have serious effects on many people, including suicide.  </p><p> Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their presentation to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If their statements, therefore, are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Dr. Milosevic is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p><p> As a witness participating in this committee session from another jurisdiction, they will have been advised that they must also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they may give. </p><p> They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  If their statements are potentially defamatory to any identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue so as not to repeat that.</p><p> At the conclusion of today's meeting, I will ask all members to stand for a few moments to show that this committee stands against bullying.</p><p> I ask Dr. Mazzone to make her opening statement</p></speech>

I am delighted and honoured to be here.</p> <p>  I will outline the main points of our submission to the committee.  Concerns about children being bullied online have increased in recent months due to the measures adopted in response to the pandemic.  When children use educational platforms and social media and are more connected with peers online, the opportunity for cyberbullying and other forms of online abuse might increase.  Cyberbullying consists of negative behaviour occurring through electronic means of communication that is either repetitive and long-lasting or occurs once but is intrusive and leaves the target unable to stand up for themselves.  </p> <p>  Cyberbullying can involve a large audience, a distance between the perpetrator and the target and anonymity.  The national Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre conducted a research study on the online experience of Irish children aged ten to 18 years and their families during the Covid-19 lockdown.  It found 28% of children in the sample have been the target of cyberbullying during that time and 50% have seen others being cyberbullied.  It is important to underline that online interactions are likely to mimic in person dynamics, meaning that some adolescents may have already had problematic peer interactions before the pandemic.</p><p>However, international research also shows that maintaining online social connections has been important for mental health outcomes during the Covid-19 restrictions.  Furthermore, not every risk will result in harm and some risks will help develop resilience and digital skills.  </p><p> Although cyberbullying incidents often occur outside school grounds, fall out and consequences can filter into the school environment.  Overall, research suggests that stopping bullying and cyberbullying should be a combined effort of students, parents and educators.  Based on this, we suggest the committee considers the following points.  Research shows that it is challenging for school principals to implement the most practical aspects of the anti-bullying procedures.  These challenges could be overcome by offering more support and training to both principals and school staff.  It would be beneficial to schools to have in place a specific anti-bullying audit tool in place to assist with the oversight management of their anti-bullying policy.  Additional funding should be provided for the establishment of a permanent observatory based at the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre to continually measure bullying and cyberbullying nationwide.  We propose revising the current anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools to represent current bullying prevention and intervention research and the changes in society.  Online safety and anti-bullying and cyberbullying prevention programmes implemented in schools should be evaluated continuously.  Online safety messages must be designed in such a way that they resonate with children and young people.  We suggest enhancing engagement with social media and other online platforms and other stakeholders such as online organisations to optimise the reporting process and provide schools with effective ways to report cyberbullying and work on take-down measures.  Existing social structural inequalities are being exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis.  Victimised children belonging to minority groups may not have access to social support services.  These children may be in great need of counselling and psychological support.  Continuing professional development for teachers, special needs assistants and ancillary staff should include a strong focus on tackling bullying and cyberbullying in line with the Teaching Council guidelines.  Any future anti-bullying changes should reflect current developments at policy and curriculum content level.  We recommend that anti-bullying prevention and intervention be embedded in existing school policy and curriculums.</p></speech>

I published a paper with Dr. Stephen Minton and did a lot of work with Trinity College Dublin's anti-bullying centre going back years.  My greatest frustration is that the subject keeps being analysed and talked about but there is a lack of mainstreaming or implementation of models of very good practice.  I was glad to hear Dr. Mazzone speak of the necessary training and supports.  It is probably more than ten years since we developed a whole-community approach to anti-bullying, which involved school transport, efforts outside and inside school and training for teachers that was approved by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra.  All of that was done but the resources to implement and mainstream it were not forthcoming.  How can we all work together to stop talking about the issue?  It is almost like there is an industry around it - I sometimes feel the same about mental health - but we do not actually get to take action.  Young people's lives are being destroyed while we analyse all this.  All of us on the committee, the Government, academics and everyone else have a responsibility to ensure there is implementation and resources for schools.</p><p>They do not have the resources - let us face it.  They are just trying to cope with what they can do.  There are the most fantastic anti-bullying policies, but there will be schools that say bullying does not happen in their school, which always worries me because bullying behaviour can happen anywhere there are human beings.  We have to recognise and face up to that.  How do we better work together in order that the resources are in place, that the audit tool is in place and accepted and that there are resources for continuous evaluation of what is happening?  I mean a 360&deg; evaluation whereby the students and the young people are involved as well as the bus drivers, the parents, the GAA team and everybody else.  I know that was a bit long-winded but I am passionate about this subject because I have seen too many lives destroyed because bullying behaviour was not addressed.</p></speech>

As we have shown in our submission, however, teachers or other school staff and even parents may not integrate the school-level changes or contribute to such change or even to the policies.  The school may tick the boxes and have the policy but, for instance, children might not be even aware of the policies.  Perhaps we need to make the policies available in an accessible language for the children.  That is the first step but it is clearly not enough.  In the international context there are countries where one anti-bullying programme has been implemented nationwide based on research.  If there is lots of fragmentation and lots of commercial programmes, they might not work.  Programmes should be evidence-based.  We need to rely on evidence-based programmes.  They have proved effective in other nations because they are grounded in theory and research, updated regularly and receive support from the state or the ministry of education.  Finland, for example, has a national anti-bullying programme which is implemented in 95% of schools across the country.  A national evidence-based programme could help, but these programmes should be also sensitive to the context.  We need to adjust them to the needs of each context.  In addition, bullying is a very complex phenomenon.  Deputy Conway-Walsh mentioned the bus driver.  Bullying happens especially when supervision is low, so we need to involve everyone, all social actors.  That is the main idea in the whole-school approach.  With bullying, children are embedded in many social contexts, so it is essential to involve all those social contexts and raise awareness about the problem.  In addition, children need consistent messages.  The message they get in school should be in line with the messages they get in other contexts, online and offline.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the models used there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.340" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Seline Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#D00400"><p>It is not necessarily that we have failed.  The year 2013 was a huge positive step in that every school in Ireland had to have an anti-bullying policy.  Where we are struggling is having these policies active and engagement.  The role of parents and guardians in supporting schools can never be overestimated.  Parents need to know what to do if their child is being bullied or is the bully.  They need support.  The model that may be in place is parent talks and teacher talks.  I do not think talking is enough.  School staff and parents need to be involved in an experiential approach whereby they are not being talked at but are actively involved and trained and have acquired a skill set to handle bullying, which is really important.</p><p> Perhaps one of the failures, if there is one, is that anti-bullying policies and the oversight management are not being evaluated annually, as recommended in the 2013 guidelines.  Much of that is down to curriculum overload, administration overload, not having the time and, most importantly, not knowing how even to approach this element.  Having an audit tool will make it feasible for all schools to check in on their anti-bullying policies and see what is working.  Most importantly, when we look at what schools are doing, we need to look at the positives as well such that there is a balanced view and that when schools analyse their anti-bullying policies, that audit tool gives them the opportunity to see the areas in which they are succeeding and then the areas that need improvement.  This will enhance the self-esteem of school staff as well.  Perhaps they will feel that the communication of the school's anti-bullying policy is working really well but that they really need to work more on including the pupils in their school.  Perhaps they will suggest that for the next school year they focus directly on that and involve staff, pupils and parents in the ways in which they can do that and then, the following year, check whether they tackled that and devise another action plan such that there is a realistic cycle approach each year.</p></speech>

The witnesses are very welcome.  This is a very emotional but very interesting topic.  It is one of the biggest challenges of our times in education when we consider some of the research that has been carried out show the levels of anxiety among young people, to show that one in three is being bullied in school and that one in ten is being bullied through social media.  The huge increase we have seen in the past few months in the number of young people being bullied through social media is quite frightening, to say the least, particularly those who are bullied because of their identity, sexuality or race or colour.  That really opens up what a difficult world we are living in and shows the tools and resources we need to give our young people.  Life is difficult enough, but when they have to deal with this on top of everything else, it makes life very difficult for the individual, his or her family members and the members of the school.  In all this we have to think about the perpetrator as well.  While the victim is at the heart of what we want to do, the problem is that there is somebody who is perpetrating this behaviour who may not understand the impact it is having.  This may be for myriad different reasons in their own lives.  Examining such behaviour is every bit as important because if we deal with a case of bullying in which one child or student is rescued, there is the absolute likelihood that if the behaviour is not addressed by the person perpetrating the bullying behaviour, he or she will go on to do it again.</p> <p>  I have spoken to a number of principals and teachers about bullying and how they handle it.  I completely agree with the view that we need to invest more funding in longitudinal studies to examine the types of interventions that are there.  I have come across three different areas that seem to have made a positive difference, and I would be very interested to hear the witnesses' views on them.  One principal spoke to me about a restorative justice practice that she has introduced in her school.  She has found it incredibly effective, particularly in dealing with ongoing behaviour from a child bullying others.  I would certainly like to see that rolled out.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on it.</p><p>The Joint Committee on Education and Skills of the previous Oireachtas looked at the area of positive mental health and the potential and positive possibilities of introducing mindfulness in schools.  I spoke to some of the schools in my area in Kildare.  A local drama teacher, Paula Conlan, introduced mindfulness sessions.  She did them online during Covid, which was fantastic, and the schools disseminated them.  They found that a positive tool in bringing harmony and serenity to the classroom.</p><p> The other area is drama and the creative arts, specifically improvisation and role play, with young people playing the role of a victim or bully and exploring the feelings that brought out.  Peter Hussey of Kildare Youth Theatre has done incredible work.  I have attended some of the workshops.  That type of initiative is happening outside schools, which is important because we are looking at this as a whole-school community and as a society in the context of how we can deal with bullying in and outside schools.  One can lead to the other.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p><p> Looking at some of the submissions, it is shocking to see peer bullying going on even at preschool and early childhood centres.  That is obviously a situation where early intervention is important, to help both the victim and the bully.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Seline Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#F00200"><p>The continuity and early intervention are important.  Each education sector needs to have a spiral approach so that they add to the learning from the early childhood setting to primary and post-primary school, and that connections are made between the three sectors of education.  The Senator raised a good point about the role of the perpetrator.  One important thing that is present in some existing anti-bullying programmes is looking at the bullying circle and the role of the bystander.  If one looks at the anti-bullying role that pupils can play, Daniel Olweus has led much theory in the field, looking at the relationship one has to the bully and the victim and how one responds.  When standing up for someone, one does not have to put one's self in danger and directly go to the bully.  Telling someone, knowing who to tell and how to tell it can be effective.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned drama, which is a good tool to use in the classroom.  Having opportunities for pupils to have the opening sentence, to start this conversation with a parent or teacher, to develop empathy, to walk in the shoes of what it is like to be someone experiencing that, and to look at feelings and emotions, is key to bullying prevention and intervention.</p></speech>

I am always interested when people mention that country, which is very different from Ireland.  It has a different education system, fundamentally underpinned by the radical idea of equality.  It does not have the multitude of patrons that we have here.  When the relevant legislation was introduced in 2013, it was considered slightly controversial because we were asking schools with a religious ethos to put in place anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic policies which, it could be suggested, were not in keeping with their ethos.  Is there evidence of the nature of bullying changing from school to school here?  In Ireland, we disproportionately separate children and decide that difference is important.  Approximately 17% of children attend single-gender schools.  One third of Irish second-level schools are single gender.  I have already mentioned the religious dimension.</p><p>We separate children on the basis of income.  Many other European countries are like that.  Are there different dynamics of bullying in different types of school and is the way to address it different?  Is addressing bullying now different to how it was 20 years ago because of the nature of social media?  I know the witnesses will say yes.  Would the witnesses agree that it can be difficult for a school to tackle bullying regardless of resources because it does not stay in the school?  There used to be a time when a child went home from school where the bullying took place and back into his or her family's embrace, and had to endure or worry about it the next year.  Now it follows the child via a mobile phone, smartphone or other connectivity that young people have.  It is not necessarily something that they can switch off, or it is more difficult to.</p><p> The next question that I have is about what bullying actually means.  Some parents do not understand the nature of bullying and what it means.  A fight, scrap or name-calling can happen in a school but that is not bullying.  Bullying is a repeated action over a period of time.  It is about power.  Sometimes many interactions between a school authority or parent body are about incidents which are called bullying but are not bullying.  I know Senator O'Loughlin had to go but I am interested in what she said about the person who is the bully or is called the bully, how that person identifies and views himself or herself and how our policies can get that person to change his or her behaviour.  I know we have this no-blame approach that has been used in certain circumstances and in certain schools.  Parents do not like it because they want a perpetrator and a victim.  If their child has been victimised, they will then say that that person has done it, but if one stands back from it, both children are victims.  One child is trying to act out something that he or she feels gives him or her power in a dysfunctional, destructive way and that needs to be analysed and corrected, because that child is feeling hurt as much as the child who is on the receiving end of it.</p><p> I know I am asking a lot of questions but I will give the witnesses time to respond.  Parents are a significant part of the answer.  What strategies do the witnesses feel have worked?  Children do not live in schools.  Regardless of whether there was or was not connectivity with online devices, parents have to accept that children live in a community and a family, so school is only one element of their lives and cannot solve all their problems.  Parents also need to realise that confrontational, humiliating behaviour, if it has come into our culture, which I believe it has more than in the past, will be identified, copied and repeated by children in their own lives and interactions.  Parents have a powerful role in finding solutions.</p></speech>

From my own experience of being a primary school teacher, before I began work in DCU, bullying can be a buzzword and is often used incorrectly.  One of the key steps that schools have to take is to have a clear definition of bullying.  Its three features are repetition, the imbalance of power and the intent to hurt someone.  It is important when working with pupils and adolescents that they know the difference between having a laugh and slagging, and when that moves into the realm of being bullying behaviour.  Pupils are sometimes unaware that they are actually bullying.  We need to be clear in our definition and make it accessible to parents.  The definition should not be too wordy.  It should be in language friendly to pupils, adolescents and parents.  I spoke earlier about parental involvement.  There is not a one size fits all approach to get parents involved.  Schools have to be adaptable and flexible.  They know the community that their school is positioned in.  One has to give schools some agency in how to approach this.</p><p>It involves giving guidelines regarding approaches that are inclusive of parents so that they are not just listening and being told what to do but are part of the conversation, can ask questions and get some type of training.  This training should be provided at times that are flexible such as at the morning drop-off time, rather than during the evening after a day of work.  It involves utilising and optimising Zoom and online platforms to allow parents to connect in from home and still be part of anti-bullying prevention and intervention.  We need to look at different models because one size may not fit all.  We need options for schools so that they can choose those that suit the needs of the communities in which they operate, which is really important.  </p></speech>

This is the research with which I have been dealing.  We need to add that to the discussion.  There have been regulatory efforts in Ireland in the form of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is in the works, that have proposed to enhance the role that social media companies play and ensure they assist in ensuring that children, teachers and parents have effective ways to report when cases like this happen.  One of the problems we see is when a case happens, even now, especially in the context of Covid when much schooling has happened online, the line between school bullying and out-of-school bullying will become ever more blurry.  It is extremely important to have a way to effectively report and engage the platforms to assist cases when these happen.  That is one actor whose responsibility in all of this needs to be brought into this discussion.</p> <p>  The second point is the issue of culture, which has been mentioned, and the difference between drama and the cases of cyberbullying and what is not cyberbullying and bullying.  Children get involved in conflict and there is a lot of issues around the issue of drama, which happens in the process of social positioning.  This means that children, especially adolescents, are trying to find their way and their identity.  In this process of establishing power, power and balance happen as well and the line between cyberbullying and drama can be very blurry.  It is extremely important not to flood schools with cases of bullying and cyberbullying that do not actually amount to the definitional criteria.  At the same time, it is extremely important to provide help to those children who might be suffering the process of drama because they do not have sufficient resilience in this process of social positioning and establishing who they are in a group.  It is extremely important to make sure everyone gets the help while maintaining this idea of the boundary between definitional bullying and cyberbullying is and what falls outside it.  It involves the role of school culture and an understanding of how the broader culture in which we live affects bullying.  We see that in the case of the US elections and the discursive culture of the past few years.  At the same time, we see the culture on social media where children learn to take their value and identity from how many likes they have, how many shares they have, how they look and if they look good enough and get social approval.  All of that needs to get into anti-bullying and cyberbullying prevention.  It involves bringing in the social media platforms and, at the same time, understanding what is the role of the broader culture in all of this and how we are teaching children to derive their self-worth.  That is a broader cultural issue.  </p></speech>

From what Dr. Mazzone said, the nature of bullying has changed and there is less of a safe space.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to it as well.  Even in terms of the bleed between what happens within school and outside the school gates, it now does not stop at the front door but goes all the way to the child's bedroom if he or she has a smart device.  It no longer necessarily stays local.  It is no longer necessarily within a child's school community or town.  It has the capacity to go nationwide or wherever else.</p><p>It is certainly increasing pressure.  Children have fewer and fewer safe places to go where they can be themselves and engage in that business of identity-finding, to which Dr. Milosevic referred, in a non-social media-mediated environment.</p><p> Dr. Milosevic referred to some of the social media platforms.  Are we seeing any new platforms emerging.  I always find it difficult.  I have just caught up with TikTok but I am sure that the next one has already superseded it.  I also wanted to ask about online educational resources.  What we often see is bleed between those things.  If people are using Seesaw, it might not be the case that the bullying is happening on Seesaw.  It could be screenshot and shared somewhere else.  Are we seeing any evidence of an emergence of bullying patterns in educational software or are we seeing that migrating to other social media platforms?  To simplify the question, where is cyberbullying happening and is it changing due to Covid?</p></speech>

We have seen an even increase across different types of platforms.  We did a Covid study in collaboration with the joint research centre of the European Commission.  Europe's Anti-Bullying Campaign did a study that we reported in our submission regarding cyberbullying patterns.  We asked children if they had experienced it on different types of platforms.  We see that the increase is evenly distributed so we do not see a spike in any particular platform.  We must also be careful about how we talk about an increase and not undermine the importance of the issue of bullying and cyberbullying in any way.  We see that this sharp increase during Covid is only visible for certain groups - at least in our study - for example, younger boys.  We do not see that pattern evenly distributed but short sharp spikes so I cannot tell the Deputy that we need to pay attention to a specific platform.  As Teams, Zoom and other platforms are being used for educational purposes, cyberbullying can slip in.  I still do not have the qualitative research that our partners are doing where I would be able to give the Deputy specific examples of how this is happening during Covid on different platforms.  Once we have that evidence, I will be able to provide the Deputy with it.</p> <p>  In terms of overall patterns, I just received the preliminary report from the study I mentioned, which shows that children in Ireland followed by children from Germany and Italy have seen the highest frequency of different types of meanness.  Nasty or hurtful messages were sent to them, nasty or hurtful messages were passed around or they were excluded from group or activity on the Internet.  Again, I do not have the data for specific platforms.  I am saying that Irish children are among the top frequency numbers in Europe.  That is worrying in and of itself but when we look at the specific platforms, I cannot say that we must pay attention to one platform.  We must bring more attention to the better use of educational platforms for online schooling.</p></speech>

She knows that a lot of this ends up happening in an SPHE lesson, which is 30 minutes per week and, right or wrong, is the one that is most easily pushed to the side.  Are we seeing interface with the NCCA to help redesign?  Our SPHE curriculum is still largely from 1999 - two decades ago when the world was completely different.  If we are interfacing with the NCCA, are we seeing follow through in terms of CPD courses and summer courses for teachers?  Are we seeing it in terms of in-service?</p><p>As much as the SPHE curriculum was designed in a different world, teachers inhabit a different world that also lags two decades behind the reality of the children in front of them.  That needs to be updated.  Is there sufficient interface between the type of expertise the witnesses are developing and the NCCA, and then translating that down into the primary or secondary school classroom?</p></speech>

Being a lecturer in SPHE, it is frustrating to see that it is only allocated 30 minutes, as that is the subject area where all the skill set for bullying prevention happens.  One learns how to become a good decision maker and the consequences of one's decisions.  One learns how to manage and regulate feelings and emotions, and how to communicate and resolve conflict.  However, 30 minutes per week is not a meaningful way in which to address it.  In February this year, the NCCA launched its draft framework for the new primary school curriculum and more time has been allocated to SPHE.  It is now in the realm of well-being.  Well-being includes SPHE and physical education.  There is an open consultation at present on the format the NCCA has proposed.  I am chairperson of the SPHE Network in Ireland so I was invited by the NCCA to a meeting and I have given two written submissions in the capacity of being a teacher educator as well as being the chairperson of the SPHE Network.  The NCCA has been very open and active in hearing my voice and the voices of others in SPHE.</p> <p>  It extends further through the curriculum as well.  At initial teacher education, one cannot forget about the pre-service cohort.  There are more than 400 students per year in training colleges such as Mary Immaculate College and DCU.  Having SPHE spread across the four-year bachelor of education, B.Ed., programme is very important so students will acquire that skill set and the confidence to deliver SPHE and realise the value and importance of the subject.  However, only having such a short time in the four-year course, which represents the 30-minute allocation from the curriculum, does not give students the opportunity to engage in the subject in a meaningful manner.  When the Teaching Council reviews the B.Ed. programme model, which is now four years, SPHE should be adopted in a spiral approach, beginning in first year and adding in during second and third year and getting a strong top-up in fourth year, before they are out working with children.  That would be very important.</p> <p>  Looking at post-primary level, which has arisen a great deal, I was the lead author-----</p></speech>

What was echoed in the feedback in the consultation with schools was the need for a post-primary qualification in SPHE.  There is none at present.  If teachers had that qualification, students at post-primary level would get the content delivered by a person qualified to do so, rather than it being added-on hours for somebody who might teach mathematics or geography and not have the capacity or competency level to teach it as well.  That is a very important element as well.</p></speech>

It is great to meet them and to hear such a good debate today.  It is wonderful that today is the inaugural UN international Day against Violence and Bullying at School Including Cyberbullying.  It recognises the right of children to education, health and well-being.  It is fantastic that the President of Ireland, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, have released a video this morning highlighting how important it is for all of us, including parents, teachers and especially public representatives, to call this out.  I was taken aback when I heard the statistic of 30%, one in three, in every classroom in Ireland.  I welcome the resources that are available.  I have had a chance to go through websites like <i>tacklebullying.ie</i>, <i>webwise.ie</i>, <i>soar.ie</i>and <i>spunout.ie</i>.  I am curious about what other proactive measures are being taken along with these websites.  What programmes are being delivered, especially during the Covid pandemic?  Normally, workshops might have taken place.  What else is happening in a proactive way?</p><p> There are many symptoms for the students.  There is anxiety, distress, a drop in school performance and low confidence and self-esteem.  Sometimes it is hard to recognise that this is happening.  It is the definition of bullying.  We have probably seen it to some extent in all walks of life, or we have heard about it or we know of people to whom it has happened.  It is about the tools we need to help.  What are the tools for parents and teachers to help them with mediation and, specifically, what mediation training is being given to teachers to help them deal with students who are impacted by bullying and also the children who are doing the bullying in certain instances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Angela Mazzone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#L00200"><p>The Senator asked about corrective initiatives.  I can talk about the FUSE programme, an anti-bullying programme which has been implemented since 2019 by the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, ABC, in DCU.  Initially, this programme was implemented in post-primary schools and now it will be adapted for primary schools as well.  The programme is grounded in theory and research.  It is the result of research that ABC conducted in 2017.  This research showed that principals had some difficulty putting in place the procedures the national action plan established in 2013.  Clearly, principals and school staff need support.  This programme aims to train teachers.  Again, we rely a great deal on teachers, but they need support and we try to provide the support they need.  Teachers are trained to put the programme in place.  The FUSE team, my colleagues in ABC, are trying to recruit more schools.  Ideally, we would like to recruit as many schools as possible because they could benefit from this programme.</p> <p>  In addition, the programme has a strong focus on by-standing behaviour.  That is very important.  Bullying is a group phenomenon so we cannot just focus on the perpetrator and the target.  We must look at bystanders as well and try to empower them.  We are not asking them to behave as heroes, but we try to change the fear norms, meaning that everyone in the group should consider bullying a wrong behaviour.  That would empower children to help.</p></speech>

What training in mediation has been done with teachers?  It could potentially be divided.  As the witness says, it is a cross-community approach.  We have Garda vetting for people engaging with children.  If this is happening to 30% of children, what training has been put in place for people who will be engaging with children, be they the bus drivers, coaches of clubs and parents, with regard to mediation?</p></speech>

It does not include this component yet, but I can talk about the international literature.  We know of the two approaches - the non-confronting approach and the confronting approach - which are used with the perpetrator of bullying.  There are contrasting findings in the literature.  Some research shows that the confronting approach, meaning having a serious conversation with the perpetrator of bullying and explaining that the behaviour is unacceptable, seems to work, but there is also research showing that this approach works with short-term episodes of victimisation, those cases where children are victimised for a short time.  There is research that shows both approaches are effective in reducing victimisation.  As long as bullying is tackled and addressed and not ignored, and the school staff are trained to adapt these two approaches, bullying can decrease.</p></speech>

It has provided great insight.  I suppose, while we are not directly involved in how schools deal with this on a daily basis, upset parents come to our constituency offices.  I recently had contact with a family of a child who has been through two secondary schools and is currently seeking home schooling.  It has a profound, traumatic impact.  It can be a traumatic few years that also has a considerable impact on the parents who are impossibly upset and grieving during severe bullying episodes.  It can be absolutely appalling.</p> <p>  To speak frankly, I feel lucky in some respects.  I turned 18 and did my leaving certificate examinations in 2007 so I was the last to get through the gap before social media and video phones became prevalent.  While I had difficult episodes at various stages during my lifetime, at least there was respite when I went home.  I have sympathy for children who go through episodes of bullying and do not have that respite because it can follow them home.  I also have sympathy for parents who are facing these issues at the moment and who may not have, or feel that they have, the skills to deal with it.</p> <p>  I will ask my questions together.  While they are not separate, there are two different elements to them, the second of which will be digital element.  We need to have a sense of how well we are doing to deal with the problem.  How successful has the 2013 strategy been?  How do we feel those policies have worked?  The FUSE programme has been tremendously successful but it has reached in the region of 400 schools while there are approximately 4,000 schools in the country.  How much can that programme be expanded?  How well are the teacher training colleges doing in ensuring that teachers are sufficiently well trained to deal with bullying incidents?  </p> <p>  I am taken with the point that has been made about the bystander approach because the culture within a school is crucial.  Sometimes when parents come to us, they suggest that teachers who might be sympathetic may not have the skills and training.  They may have said to the parents that they have not been able to demonstrate that there has been bullying because there is no proof and so on.  A whole-of-school approach is needed.</p> <p>  It is absolutely right that there be a definition of "bullying" but the problem with a definition is that sometimes people will fall short of it and may not feel that is a fair evaluation.  I can imagine a difficult situation for a teacher or a school if a parent comes in and says that their Seanie got a puck on Tuesday and something was said to him on Friday, only to be told that is not bullying.  The parent may feel profoundly that it is bullying.  That would be a difficult place for a school, stating that an experience, while traumatic, falls short of bullying.</p> <p>  There have been proposals from the Law Reform Commission on digital safety.  I introduced the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, proposing the establishment of a digital safety commissioner and other measures relating to online safety and takedown measures.  I understand some proposals from Europe on takedown measures are at the early stages of development.  I do not know whether an update can be given on that and whether we are hopeful that European legislation can tackle social media.  We can do a lot here but we cannot do it all because they are global entities.</p> <p>  There is a lot in what I have asked for our guests to answer in two minutes.  I ask them to do the best they can and to write to me if they do not get to it all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Seline Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#N00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will address the issue of the level of success of the 2013 anti-bullying procedures.  One of the major positives is that they have created an awareness of bullying at all schools.  Every school now has an anti-bullying policy.  That was not the case before 2013.  Rather, anti-bullying was the subject of a paragraph in the codes of behaviour of schools.  That progression is a strong positive.  However, elements of the procedures are not being implemented.  Some schools may adopt an <i>&agrave; la carte </i>approach to dealing with bullying.  They may not have the confidence or skill set to tackle transphobia or homophobia elements of bullying and, as such, they pick and choose which types of bullying to address.  The 2013 anti-bullying policy procedures should be updated soon, rather than allowing another ten or 20 years pass before so doing.  The updated procedures should provide guidelines on how to deal with homophobia and transphobia, as well as highlighting to schools the programmes that are in place to help them, such as the All Together Now programme or the Gender Equality Matters, GEM, project at European level that tackles gender-based bullying, gender-based violence and gender stereotyping.  Schools should be made aware that there is support available.  If pupils and parents can have confidence that a situation will be addressed, that will have a significant benefit.  Pupils need to feel there is consistency.<br/><br/>In a case such as that highlighted by the Deputy where a parent contacts the school regarding a matter that may not involve bullying, the parent still needs to be listened to.  It may be preferable to keep a record of that contact.  If schools are consistent in recording all incidents, that will highlight patterns such that the school scan see at the end of a school year that cyberbullying is a significant issue that keeps coming up or identity-based bullying or racism seems to be prevalent in the school in the past year.  When the issue is identified, it needs to be tackled.  If a school does not record incidences of bullying or keep records of what has happened, it will not have the opportunity to see the pattern.  It needs to be a mandatory component of any revised procedures that schools keep records and that there is consistency among staff.  Staff should have a responsibility to keep a record of what was discussed with a parent who contacts them, as well as noting the follow-up in terms of the intervention that needed to be explored and whether it was effective.  If the intervention was ineffective, there should be a consideration of what the school could do differently.  There should be a consideration of the effects of implementing something but not going back to check in on all of the children involved.  The school should also check in with parents and have follow-up questions for and discussions with them.</p></speech>

It is important to raise awareness of the programme in the first place.  Last week, I received emails from teachers who wish to participate in the programme.  It is always rewarding to see that schools are at least looking for support and are willing to engage.  It is great that the programme will also be implemented in primary schools.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about the definition of "bullying", but I think that has been addressed by Dr. Keating.</p></speech>

I also have high hopes also for the super complaints scheme, which would assist in monitoring what is happening on social media platforms and, when there is a problem, would effectively alert the commissioner in order that the codes can be adjusted.  It would also ensure collaboration with social media companies in such situations.  In addition, the digital services legislation that is currently being discussed at EU level may enhance the duty of care of social media platforms.</p> <p>  One aspect I wish to emphasise that we still do not have in Ireland and that relates to the difficulties in transposing the audiovisual media services directive is that the individual complaints scheme, which would allow for parents, teachers or children to alert a company regarding a case of persistent bullying on the platform that is not being taken down, is not being instituted at this time.  It is important to bear in mind that the fact that the item or items have been taken down can, in and of itself, be of assistance to the child in the case of persistent and serious cyberbullying.</p><p>The take down first helps to signal that this is wrong behaviour that is not tolerated, and that take down has to happen, but take down in and of itself is not enough.  It has to be the full system of assisting the child, which happens at school and family level, which my colleagues have discussed.  Viewing these take-down measures and the role of social media companies in isolation is not sufficient.  At the same time companies are proposing, and have developed and are innovative in the field of, artificial intelligence.  They are using proactive measures to monitor their platforms to catch cyberbullying before it is reported by an individual user.  Companies in their transparency reports say the use of artificial intelligence is very effective in addressing the issue.  There has to be more transparency in how this is done, however, and also to ensure that we tap regularly valuations from the children's perspective of these proactive measures.</p></speech>

This study was also done in ten other European countries with children aged ten to 18.  We conducted research into the children's use of digital media, the experience of risks and the exposure to different types on online harm, with cyberbullying being one of those.  We have seen a 28% increase in cyberbullying victimisation during the lockdown.  We asked children how much cyberbullying they had experienced and if they had experienced it less frequently, with about the same frequency or more frequently during the lockdown than before.  That was our focus.  We gave them a definition of cyberbullying.  This was an increase when compared to previous studies in Ireland that have shown a cyberbullying victimisation rate of about 14% for primary school ages and just under 10% for post-primary school ages.  There had been an increase, but as I hinted earlier, I would be careful because while it is an increase it is not as huge a spike as we might have expected based on the media reports we saw during the lockdown.  I just have to be careful about that.  When we break down the numbers across age groups and gender, one realises that the most frequent answer is "as frequently as before the lockdown".  Only for some age groups do we see a large spike with regard to children saying "a lot more frequently during the lockdown than before".</p></speech>

To be precise, the measure we recorded in our report is a different one to that recorded in the European Commission's larger study.  We must bear in mind that with cyberbullying the issue is that operation-wise analysis is done in different ways and the frequency varies significantly from study to study.  It also depends on how we ask the children and how we define cyberbullying in the survey and so on.  We must be very careful when talking about frequency with regard to what it is we are actually measuring.  This large study reports on a different measure to our study in Ireland.  We added questions about cyberbullying in the study in Ireland.</p></speech>

Such companies have repeatedly told legislators that they are committed to resolving the problem of online bullying and harassment.  Do our guests believe that social media companies are doing enough to meet this challenge?</p></speech>

Social media companies can do a lot more and that can be achieved through effective regulation.  They are doing what they can while being mindful of their business models.  There needs to be more transparency there.</p> <p>  One company recently issued a report that shows how different regulatory measures might incentivise a company, advertently or inadvertently, to change its behaviour in regulating online harm.  We have to be mindful as to how we design our proposed regulatory measures in order to properly incentivise companies to do what we want them to do.  That is difficult to assess if there is insufficient transparency in terms of how the mechanisms of companies, particularly their artificial intelligence, are actually working.  More transparency would help us understand how effectively the companies are dealing with these cases already.  Especially important in that respect is that there is insufficient research on how the policies of those companies are affecting children.  It is extremely important to involve children in the process because there is insufficient research into how the measures that the companies have in place at the moment are impacting children and whether they find them effective.  My previous research, for instance, found that social media companies are providing safety centres and other educational measures for children, parents and teachers.  Large companies have specially designed sections on their online platforms where they provide a lot of information about how to tackle bullying on their platforms.  Based on my research in Norway, many children are not aware of these and are certainly not using them sufficiently.  There has to be a greater effort.</p> <p>  In my view, based on research, companies should invest more resources in assisting children with the psychological consequences that they face when they encounter cyberbullying cases on their platforms.  There can be a way for regulators to incentivise the companies to assist more.</p></speech>

I know of hundreds of families around the country who home educate their children.  The research from the UK is fairly old and we do not have any research on the reasons people home educate.  For this reason, much of my experience is based on anecdotal evidence.  That said, the research in the UK shows that approximately 50% of families who home school take their children out of school rather than starting home education for ideological reasons.  I am a former chair of Home Education Network Ireland and from the contact I have had, I would say that the same is probably true in Ireland, excepting the current blip of Covid-19 related home education.  I have heard stories from one particular family in Galway of a child crying before going to school every day for two years.  The family finally took the steps to take the child out of school and found the experience to be like chalk and cheese.  Not every family can do that.</p><p>We are dealing with the problem after the horse has bolted in a sense.  We are looking at how we deal with bullying.  In the Growing Up in Ireland study, 40% of nine-year-olds - this is going back years - said they had experienced bullying in the previous year.  We are dealing with that problem when instead we should be asking how we are organising our education in a way that is facilitating that.</p><p> The Sudbury school system in Boston, with which I have many links, has done research on bullying which has shown that if children are with mixed-age groups, it brings out a sense of empathy in them.  Are there other steps and changes we can make to our education system rather than dealing with bullying happening in the system as we see it now?</p><p> Other families are affected.  For instance, transphobia is a significant problem.  Many children in the home education community would have experienced transphobia and homophobia.  What is it we can do with the schools?  Rather than the anti-bullying policies, what can we do with the school structure that would suit our society better and better reflect what is going on outside school?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Seline Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#Q00200"><p>Schools need to be proactive rather than reactive in that they should not wait for a situation to happen to then respond to it.  It goes outside the policy in the sense of looking at different initiatives which schools could be doing.</p> <p>  For example, BeLongTo does a stand-up awareness campaign which is a good opportunity for post-primary schools to get involved with LGBTI inclusivity and promoting a safe climate in their schools.  While the policy is a key component, having assemblies and an ongoing awareness throughout the schools is important.  It should not just be once-off tokenistic events.  It should start in September and be ongoing until the end of the school year in May and June.</p> <p>  There are many different awareness campaigns in schools.  Pupils have a voice through student councils in which they can tell what is happening and what they are experiencing.  The decisions made at management are representing the reality of what students and children are experiencing.  It is important to have their voice, as well as the voice of the parents, to find solutions to ensure that families do not feel they have to pull children out of the school system.</p> <p>  Every child and adolescent in Ireland has the right to feel safe in school.  We should be looking at it through the lens of a rights and equality approach to education.  Parents should feel safe sending their child to a school.  For example with transphobia, if a child is going through that state, then it is important that they are supported by the school and that it is involved with organisations such as Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, to help them.  If schools do not know how to help deal with a situation, they should know exactly who to go to for help.  TENI and BeLongTo could support both the family and the school.  It is important support services are involved and it is not just the schools.</p></speech>

From a behavioural point of view, it is important to work not just on empathy but also on children's attitudes.  There is research showing most children actually have anti-bullying attitudes.  Why do they not intervene when bullying happens?  It is because they believe that the other children would disapprove of their behaviour in standing up.  When bullying happens, it is hard to stand up because the other children might be silent.  The ones who would like to stand up might have the false belief that the others would not approve of their behaviour.</p> <p>  One step we can take is making children aware of the real beliefs of the others.  Many children believe that bullying is wrong and we should make them aware that they can tackle it together.  When it comes to diversity and inclusion, transphobia and homophobia make it a complex matter.</p><p>Children's prejudices and stereotypes are affected by the larger society.  Children are embedded in many contexts, so a strong focus on diversity and inclusion might help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#R00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  It strikes me that the problem of bullying is often, sadly, related to what children are experiencing at home.  We need to recognise that problematic home lives lead to problematic behaviour in schools.  This illustrates the complexity of the problem we have.  I have a particular memory of a very impressive school principal in my life who spotted something going on in the classroom with a child at a young age who had prominent ears or something like that.  I remember her saying that she would come down like a ton of bricks on anybody who picked on anybody else.  It strikes me there is a need to keep matters simple and we must recognise that bullying is a moral issue.  Bullying is wrong.</p> <p>  One school principal of whom I am aware operates a three-part formula, saying that bullying is wrong, that one needs to be strong and that one should not leave it too long.  He means by this that from the get-go he imparts a strong moral message that bullying is not fair and that it is wrong to pick on somebody, whether it is because of a perception of sexuality or whatever else.  He emphasises that the need to be strong is about the building of resilience and children must be helped to see that they can change other people's behaviour in a more positive direction.</p> <p> The third part, namely, that one should not leave it too long, involves acting quickly and posing questions to parents.  For example, parents should consider if their children are too young to be given smartphones.  Very often, some of these problems manifest when it is too late for some parents to have considered the necessary strategies that would have prevented them arising in the first place.  I am interested in hearing views on that formula.  Could steps be taken to increase parents' knowledge of common apps, programmes, social media platforms and particularly the dangers they pose to children?  It seems the education of parents is a key part of all this.</p> <p>  The scoping note sent to the committee mentions building resilience in children and young people.  We must take every step to prevent bullying in all its forms from occurring but we can look at what happens in the adult world with social media and the likes of Twitter, etc.  We can see nastiness and toxic behaviour is not just experienced in childhood.  Perhaps it is another reason we must focus on building resilience.  As much as we try to work on this in schools, people will face challenges in real life.</p> <p>  Are the witnesses familiar with restorative practice courses in schools, particularly with regard to mediation, as mentioned by Senator Dolan?  This is about dealing with schoolyard incidents involving elements of bullying and so on.  Is the practice widespread or useful?  Will the witnesses comment on such courses?</p> <p>  There is a big debate about identity politics and there are concerns about politics coming into this issue.  Bullying is a moral issue and it is a question of how we treat each other.  It will ultimately be a stronger approach than seeing this as a legal issue, although we must look at mechanisms.  There is a very difficult issue of transpersons and schools will have different views and philosophies.  The evidence is not in with many of these areas.  We must be careful not to politicise these matters when the strategies we need to combat bullying may be much simpler.  Whether a child is being bullied about perceptions of his or her sexuality, body features or as a result of slow learning or a stammer, the same thing is in play and, in a sense, there to be tackled.</p> <p>  I am concerned when I hear one particular reason for bullying because I wonder if it distracts from the need to realise that bullying takes many forms, with each form as bad as the next.  I would welcome the thoughts of the witnesses on that matter.</p></speech>

These people have the ability to realise their behaviour is harmful but they do not feel a strong concern towards the target.  Some successful intervention programmes, therefore, have worked on empathy.  This is, of course, a way to address the programme when looking at those children who perpetrate bullying.</p><p> Morality is also important when we look at the bystanders because research shows that they sometimes do not feel the moral responsibility to do anything.  They do not even feel the responsibility to report the bullying because they assume it is not their responsibility.  Increasing the sense of responsibility, therefore, could be a way to address the problem.</p><p> The Senator also mentioned mediation and restorative justice.  I am not familiar with this but I can look into it and email some research to her.  I know one method called the support group approach has been adopted with the target of bullying and the shared concern method implies having informal meetings between the teachers or some appointed members of staff to talk to the perpetrator of bullying in a kind of indirect way.  It is a non-confrontational approach.  They try, in a way, to enhance moral compassion and enhance the perpetrator's sense of moral responsibility.  This should be a kind of restorative way to somehow address the problem.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance if I end up repeating a few points.  I will pick up on Dr. Keating's contribution earlier where she referenced that many  teachers who teach the social, personal and health education, SPHE, modules in schools are not qualified to teach that very module.  As a teacher, I found myself as one of those and I got the extra few hours in civic, social and political education, CSPE, SPHE or whatever it was.  Going forward as a profession, it should be the minimum that teachers are qualified to teach that relevant subject considering the importance we place on well-being.</p><p>From much of the testimony given by the witnesses today I put it that we are ticking many boxes in terms of what our boards of management and school management must comply with.  We need, however, to recognise that tackling bullying goes beyond just ticking boxes and having anti-bullying policies and so forth.  Many people in this room will have sat at board of management meetings over the years and the one thing that comes up is the bullying incidents that month.  It might not always be a box-ticking exercise but, certainly, looking from the outside in, it feels that way on reflection.</p><p>Many of my questions have already been answered but I will focus on one or two practical issues from a school point of view and being a teacher.  In its submission, the ABC made the point that teachers do not always feel responsible for helping students deal with cyberbullying.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the responsibilities teachers have with regard to being professionals and employees?  What are their responsibilities?</p><p>My second question relates to the reference that teachers often respond ineffectively and express a need for additional training.  Will the witnesses elaborate on what training is currently <i>in situ</i>for teachers and what training, if any, they propose would be beneficial to teachers in terms of continuing professional development, CPD?</p><p>My third question relates to guidance counsellors.  A number of years ago, as everybody is well aware, a number of guidance counsellor roles were taken out of the education system.  Since the restoration of guidance counsellors have the witnesses found instances of bullying and cyberbullying are being treated more efficiently or are the instances of bullying and cyberbullying continuing to escalate despite their restoration?  Perhaps the witnesses could just comment on the importance of the role of guidance counsellors in that respect.</p><p>There was a reference to research carried out by ABC at the end of 2016 that less than half of school principals had a designated person to deal with anti-bullying cases in schools.  When I heard that I was astounded.  My experience with boards of management goes back perhaps five or six years and every board I have been involved with, which by my count is seven, has had a designated person to deal with it and has ticked those boxes.  I was astounded to see, albeit the research goes back to 2016, that half of schools were non-compliant in that regard and no research might have been done since that report in 2016.  Even if ABC has anecdotal research, however, has that improved?  Is there further compliance with that?</p><p> My final question concerns the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, or Coco's law, which is before the D&aacute;il.  I believe it is on Third Stage at present.  Can I get the witnesses' professional opinion on that?  Perhaps, the question is for Dr. Milosevic.  What is her professional opinion on the premise of that Bill and criminalising online bullying?  What are her opinions on that?</p></speech>

I spoke earlier about the in-service element and that there needs to be more at pre-service level so those high numbers of qualified teachers coming out at primary level with the specific SPHE qualification have the confidence and competency levels to deal with anti-bullying situations.</p> <p>  One needs to adopt a CPD model that is realistic if one is taking a whole-of-school approach.  I have recently been part of a project where I undertake continual professional development with both primary and post-primary teachers.  I have also designed a tool they use as part of it.  The feedback has been that adapting it to suit the school's needs by having it straight after school, which fits into the Croke Park hours done by schools, makes it much more feasible.</p> <p>  Looking forward to a possible Government revision of the anti-bullying policy, perhaps schools would be obliged to engage in this for X amount of years so newly qualified teachers and new members of staff do not miss out on that; it will happen again and it is an ongoing CPD that is in line with the Cos&aacute;n programme.</p> <p>  What is really key with CPD is who delivers it.  Schools need guidance on the experts and facilitators they should go to when it comes to CPD.  That needs to be considered strongly.</p></speech>

I am in favour of an educational approach because of the reduced responsibility of children.  I have also been looking at international laws were cyberbullying is criminalised.  First, there are various cyberbullying behaviours.  We can think about some behaviours like social exclusion which could be less harmful than other types of behaviour that could be more serious.  Of course, I am not saying online social exclusion is not serious.  I am not trying to say that because it is harmful as well.  Social exclusion is one of the most painful experiences.  We need, however, to be careful about the types of behaviour we want to criminalise.  As I said, I am in favour of an educational approach.  In some countries where cyberbullying is criminalised, educational measures can be literally imposed.  I believe education should be a right and an opportunity.  It should not be seen as an imposition.  We need, therefore, to work on prevention measures.</p> <p>  As for cyberbullying that does not happen on the school grounds, I believe teachers and appointed members of the school staff have a duty of care.  I am in favour of supporting them to tackle and not to ignore those incidents because when they are aware of these episodes and ignore them, it could give the false belief to children that this behaviour is tolerated.  That is a dangerous message for children because it leads to the normalisation of bullying and cyberbullying.  That is something we do not want, of course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tijana Milosevic" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#T00400"><p>I will add that I agree with the point made by Dr. Mazzone about criminalisation.</p><p>Different Departments have to have different initiatives in mind.  In the case of Coco's law and the online safety and media regulation Bill, I favour the other approach because as we have seen from other calls for criminalising cyberbullying, it can be quite problematic.  At the same time, we have to be wary of linking cyberbullying as a cause of suicide.  While it certainly can contribute to it, we know from previous research that labelling it as a main cause does not do justice to the complexity of the issue.  There has to be an effective way for the companies to remove abusive content but criminalising it may not be conducive to the educational solutions we seek.</p><p> On teacher education, which was mentioned, we are developing modules on social media and youth well-being to be delivered to pre-service teachers.  It is very important to make teachers aware of the digital environments, and different technological developments and how they relate to cyberbullying.  Much work has to be invested into that.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen made a point about keeping matters simple.  I have had many conversations with school teachers and principals about keeping it simple because much of this can go over the heads of both parents and teachers.  Will our guests comment on giving parents the skill set to identify school bullies and where their child may not be doing as well as he or she should be?</p> <p>  There are a number of forms of bullying, such as from pupil to pupil, teacher to teacher, teacher to pupil, and pupil to teacher.  Will our guests comment on that?  There are isolated incidents where teachers bully pupils, and others where pupils know a teacher is bullying another teacher and feel that because the teacher is doing it, it is okay and they can do it too.  In recent days, the US election took place.  We have seen some of the tweets that have been posted and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has been sending out unbelievable tweets.  It is almost the case that if world leaders do it, anyone can do it.  I would be interested in hearing our guests' points of view on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan asked whether social media platforms are doing enough and Dr. Milosevic replied they are doing what they can.  Will she comment on that?  I believe that they are not doing nearly enough.  Some are very good but others are not so good.  Will Dr. Milosevic comment on which are good and which are not?  Social media platforms include Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and many others.</p> <p>  Senator Mullen referred to the age groups of people on social media.  In some instances, there are children as young as seven and eight years of age on Snapchat.  As we know, there have been instances where naked pictures have been sent around on Snapchat.  If that is happening at the age of seven or eight, one can imagine what they will be doing when they are 13, 14 or 16 years old.</p> <p>  Dr. Keating spoke about student councils.  Is there evidence that if there is a very good student council in primary or secondary school, there tends not to be as much bullying in the school, whether online, physical or mental?</p> <p>  As for teacher training, the Minister for Education will appear before the committee next week or the week after that.  Is there something we should pick up on to ensure teachers are educated to tackle this issue?  If our guests believe there are teachers who have not been trained in educating pupils on the matter, is there something we can follow up on?</p><p>The Department action plan on bullying was published in 2013.  I would like the witnesses to comment on whether there is a need to update the plan considering how bullying in schools has developed over the years.</p><p> The other point I want to raise is the reporting of bullying in schools through the inspectorate.  Has evidence been gathered and shared with other schools?  For example, a school in Donegal could pick up on what is being done by a school in Wexford.  Are incidents that are reported inputted centrally in order to educate other teachers on what is happening so they can pick up on an incident that might have happened in a school? </p></speech>

They were published in 2013 and they need to include current research on bullying prevention and intervention.  The societal landscape in which children and adolescents are now growing up has significantly changed.  Having appendices would be helpful, as would having a section for schools which includes a list of support services that are there to help them if they have specific queries.  With regard to child protection procedures, schools have a list of services that can help them if they have an issue, and there should be something similar in the anti-bullying procedures.</p> <p>  It would be good to have a specific tool to measure bullying.  If schools are serious about tackling it, they need to see what is happening in the school.  Having a tool to measure it could be linked in with the anti-bullying centre, which could work with schools to design a tool.  In one school that I taught in, we measured the level of bullying and it was very good to see the level in classes so we could zone in on it.  This highlights that a lot of media education and education on social media can happen too late in that it is mainly at fifth and sixth class, and we need to start earlier to educate pupils before they begin their journey with social media.</p> <p>  It would be good to have Department of Education and Skills-approved anti-bullying programmes.  There are so many programmes that schools are inundated with them, whereas they need to have one, two or three that are recommended and that they can use.  Particularly at primary level, there needs to be a cross-curricular approach so this it is not isolated and where bullying is seen through the holistic development of the child, and where there are opportunities to integrate with the arts and other elements of the curriculum.  </p> <p>  We need to have a list of skilled and qualified organisations and facilitators to help with home-school continued professional development and having exemplars in the new procedures for child-friendly and parent-friendly anti-bullying policies that keep it simple so it does not have to be lost in translation.  There is a need for readability in these policies.  I listened to what the Chairman said about keeping things simple.  A lot of this comes down to respect and teaching children, beginning at a young age in early childhood settings, how to respect people.  This can have a huge impact as they progress through childhood and adolescence, and even when they go into the workplace.  It is very important that, in anti-bullying work, it is not just talking about what bullying is but about promoting respect, celebrating diversity, creating that culture from the get-go in education settings and acknowledging what schools are doing.  We need to take the focus away from the "nots" and the things they are not doing.  We should look at what they are doing so they get acknowledged for the work they are trying to implement and we can actively look at how to provide support.  We all know they need support but action is needed now.  It is a question of how we are realistically and authentically going to provide this support to principals and to schools. </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the student councils.  I have not engaged in research on that element but it might be an area that could be explored to see if having the voice of students through a student council is working to help schools deal with bullying.  To have school anti-bullying committees and the use of care teams in some schools so they can identify at-risk pupils from an early stage and intervene quicker, rather than leaving it to be reported, might be also beneficial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tijana Milosevic" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020110500002#W00100"><p>On the question about social media, when I said the platforms are doing what they can I was referring to established social media companies.  I was advised not to name any specifically but it is along the lines of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, that is, the more established companies that have been around for a longer time and that have more resources.  That is not enough, because there are many cases that are not dealt with effectively, but one of the challenges is the volume of content and the ability to monitor it adequately.</p> <p>  Another issue I would emphasise in regard to the large companies is there has to be more transparency in respect of how they do what they do and how they regulate the content.  In the case of one company, for instance, my research team asked for an anonymised data set to help us optimise a machine-learning tool we were developing to assist it with cyberbullying on its platform, and it was not able to provide us with such a data set.  There is not enough transparency for the wider research community outside of the large volume of research that is being conducted in the companies already, given that these companies tend to have their own research initiatives in house.  They have access to all our data to do all that research, but they are not necessarily sharing it in a way that is helpful to our community of outside scholars to scrutinise their policies.  They are being protective of their business models in ways that are not always transparent to us, and there has to be more transparency in that respect.</p> <p>  For the smaller companies, the problem is different.  Very often, a start-up will gain considerable popularity in a short period and will not have the e-safety expertise.  Such companies are too small, although they may have gained venture capital and are growing in popularity, so there has to be a system to make it a requirement for certain safety measures to be in place for smaller companies too.  Smaller and larger companies, or the more established, older companies and younger companies, face different challenges.  Where regulation can assist is in providing the requirements for the smaller companies to have certain standards of effectiveness.  At the same time, when a large company tells us that it relies on artificial intelligence to proactively catch cyberbullying cases, it is not enough, in my view, for it to tell us it has caught a certain percentage of cases proactively.  We have to be able to understand how that happens and why the company did not catch the cases where children have complained their case was not addressed.  It is not enough for social media companies to work in a vacuum and to look solely at their responsibility.  There has to be a collaboration between the broader educational system, as my colleagues have outlined, and the social media companies in this respect.</p> <p>  There is a great opportunity, in asking for resources from companies, to assist not only the educational system and also the counselling system.  Given that they are established in certain countries and they are complying with the laws, more can be asked of the companies to assist in enhancing the capacity of the entire educational system.</p></speech>

I return to the community approach, which is very important and works.  Baseline studies, measurements and so on were carried out ten years ago and the evidence is there.  We need to listen to teachers to determine what resources they will need and to connect that to class sizes, in the context of what teachers and teaching principals are trying to cope with as it is.  There is a connection there and we cannot just treat anti-bullying initiatives in isolation.</p> <p>  To what extent do the delays in psychological assessments impact on addressing the bullying behaviour of perpetrators?  How much collaboration is there among universities on the research being done?  Should legislation in respect of cyberbullying be passed at a member state level or an EU level, or should it be a combination of both?  Have any EU member states brought in legislation that addresses the responsibility of the platforms and the companies involved?</p></speech>

It strikes me that with the lifestyles people have now, it is very difficult to get education done outside of school, yet this seems to need a broader community response than simply what goes on in the schools or at occasional parent-teacher meetings.</p></speech>

We have a significant problem.  It has always been there but, with the advent of social media, it has escalated to a different level.  Whereas, before, if young people were bullied in school or in the school yard, at least they were away from bullying while they were away from the school.  However, the type of bullying we have now can pervade somebody's life 24 hours a day, which is hugely regrettable and sad.  We have to do what we can to combat bullying, to build resilience and to promote a shared culture of inclusivity and of diversity.  We absolutely need to tackle head-on the bullying on social media and to tackle the companies that allow it to happen.</p></speech>

Members who have children, in particular those who have boys, will be very aware of Fortnite.  I would be interested in hearing the views of Dr. Milosevic on Fortnite.  I ask the witnesses to sum up and I first call on Dr. Keating.</p></speech>

In my earlier point, I said we should not look at what they are not doing but look at all the wonderful things they are doing.  That is evident when we see how happy children were to return to schools, and there is strong evidence in the education system that children love school and love mixing with their friends.  That is a positive to take out of the challenging year we have all had.</p> <p>  In regard to the training of parents, I mentioned earlier that we need to look at the different models to enhance the inclusion of parents in training.  That training should not just be talks and talking at parents as they need a chance to engage in dialogue and to acquire skills to help them deal with bullying.  We also need to accommodate their busy lives and to have it available, say, at drop-off in the mornings, not just at parent evenings.  We also need to look at platforms like Zoom and to link in with the National Parents Council, which does webinars for parents.  If we can engage parents in this area, it would be of huge benefit.</p> <p>  Since 2013, we have taken steps and I do not think we should be looking only at the negatives.  However, while these steps have been taken, bullying is a social problem, so it is a complex challenge to tackle.  Any future changes should look at current developments and international developments, and should be embedded in existing policy and curriculum in schools, so we are not adding to the workload of teachers and schools.  It is a question of embedding it.</p><p>Much of it is there already.  It is just to give confidence and a skill set.  I thank the committee for inviting me today.</p></speech>

Sometimes we are very focused on the targets and obviously we need to provide support and help to them, but the perpetrators also need help.  These children need help before the cyberbullying or bullying escalates.  Prevention measures should be put into place and teachers should not be left alone.  Children need more psychological support and counselling.  I watched a video that was posted today on , posted by two teenagers.  Teenagers are calling for more counselling and psychological support in schools, which is a clear sign that children need more support.<br/><br/>On the question of how to engage with parents, we are developing some tools and an action plan for parents that provides concrete steps on how to respond to bullying.  Of course, this is a reactive measure, and we also need prevention.  However, sometimes parents can become overwhelmed and emotional when they learn that their children are being bullied.</p></speech>

I can tell the committee that our research, and in particular a Covid study which I cited earlier, found a 60% increase in cyberbullying on online multiplayer games during the pandemic.  It is an issue that we need to look into further, and there needs to be more research done into how cyberbullying specifically happens.  I am happy to provide the committee with that.<br/><br/>At the same time, there is a large body of research on the influence of gaming, and aggressive games, on children, which dates back to the digital era.  It is not a straightforward case that games which contain some elements of aggression and violence necessarily lead children to become more violent.  It is a large research field with extremely contentious conclusions, and contradictory evidence.  We must be careful to avoid creating a panic around specific types of games, because that has happened before.  There have been incidences where one individual game has been blamed that for something that is a broader cultural phenomenon.  Therefore, we need to take care, but I am happy to provide examples for the committee.<br/><br/>In respect of the legislation and different examples from Europe and further afield, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill was, in a way, inspired by the Australian e-safety Bill and the creation of the office of eSafety Commissioner.  I have hopes that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill can facilitate collaboration between policymakers, the educational system, the charities and the social media companies, and that it will be able to assist with some of the problems that we are seeing on social media platforms.  Other models have tackled hate speech specifically, such as the <i>Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz</i>, NetzDG, law in Germany which requires companies, on receipt of the notification of the presence of the content, to act within a certain amount of time and to take it down.  Those models can be more or less effective, but hate speech is a different issue from cyberbullying.  I would also be careful of following the example of such takedown systems.  In the e-Commerce Directive, which dates back to the early 2000s, companies are exempt from liability based on the fact that they are online intermediaries.</p><p>There is a greater acknowledgement that companies are not only intermediaries, but they are actually actively curating our content and data.  The exemption from liability is currently being debated and there is an emphasis on a duty of care, safety by design, and age-appropriate safety mechanisms.  Theses efforts will move towards understanding how the design of algorithms and of the platforms might contribute to certain behaviours.  The issue of digital ecology, and how cyberbullying happens in the context of children's interactions online, is one which is extremely important and does not get sufficient attention.  This includes how many likes one receives, and behaving in such a way as to augment the attention one is getting.  There is a certain design to digital media that perhaps inadvertently enhances certain aspects of our psychological characteristics.  For instance, one of the platforms introduced a change where users can no longer see how many likes other users have received for an image they have posted.  Efforts, such as these, which are not directly aimed at suppressing cyberbullying, but instead consider how the design of technology can inadvertently influence our and children's behaviour, might be the way to actually understand why all these efforts have, to an extent, been ineffective.  It is because we have failed to address the broader cultural issue of what we get from social media interactions.</p><p> When I previously mentioned age gating, I raised the issue of whether children should have mobile phones in a certain place and at a certain age.  In my opinion, and that of the community of researchers, one has to understand that taking technology away does not take away the problem.  There is the issue of peer pressure to consider.  It could be, for example, that the parent of a nine-year-old child does not think he or she should be on social media, and according to the terms of service of the social media platform, he or she is not supposed to access it until the age of 13 and, if one also considers the GDPR in Ireland, the age of digital consent is 16 years.  At the same time, the child's school social circle and their social life is happening on a certain social media platform, therefore, by excluding him or her, it may result in the unintended consequences of excluding him or her from a broader discussion of what is happening, and his or her participation.</p><p> Going back to the issue of children's rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have to protect children, but at the same time, children have rights of participation.  Therefore, ensuring that there is a balance is very important, and we must encourage design that is conducive to delivering the outcomes that we want to see.  The question of how to deliver this is an incredibly difficult one, and one that companies and regulators are trying to address.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.430" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eimear Cotter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110500002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the EPA to discuss the general scheme of the water environment (abstractions) Bill.  I am joined in the committee room by Ms Mary Gurrie, a programme manager in the EPA, and remotely by Ms Marie O'Connor, also a programme manager in the EPA, and Dr. Matthew Craig.</p> <p>  The agency has a wide range of responsibilities as environmental regulator, knowledge provider and advocate.  Specifically related to water quality, the EPA conducts national monitoring programmes to assess water quality and a national hydrometric monitoring programme to assess flow and levels in rivers, groundwater and lakes.  In addition, the EPA&rsquo;s regulatory activities include the authorisation of industrial, waste and wastewater facilities and the enforcement of those authorisations.</p> <p>  The general scheme of the water environment (abstractions) Bill proposes new responsibilities for the EPA related to licensing of large and significant water abstractions.  This follows on from legislation published in 2018, which established a register of abstractions and which is maintained by the EPA.  Overall, these measures are designed to protect water bodies from excessive levels of water abstraction and give effect to the water framework directive, which requires the protection or restoration to good status of all surface and groundwater bodies.</p> <p>  The EPA welcomes the measures in the heads of the Bill.  These measures will improve the monitoring and regulatory control of large and significant water abstractions in Ireland.  The measures will ensure the requirements of the water framework directive regarding the control of abstractions are met, as well as supporting European reporting requirements.</p> <p>  While registration and control of significant water abstractions is required under the water framework directive, EPA analysis indicates that, overall, water abstraction in Ireland is not a major issue for achievement of good status of water bodies.  This is based on a quantitative risk assessment of existing water abstractions conducted by the EPA, which informed the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021.  This assessment showed that the level of risk due to abstractions is low, at approximately 6% of all water bodies.</p> <p>  The EPA welcomes the risk-based approach for the proposed licensing regime. This means that abstractions considered low risk to the environment will be addressed by way of registration or general binding rules or both, while medium and higher-risk abstractions will require an assessment of the significance of the abstraction on the environment and licensing where appropriate.  This approach balances environmental protection, such as protection of ecology and overall water quality, in a proportionate way while minimising costs and administrative burden. </p> <p>  It is estimated by the EPA that approximately 490 abstractions will require an authorisation.  These are abstractions over 250 cu. m per day and include drinking water supply and water abstraction by industry.  For the purposes of accountability and transparency, the EPA will publish a guidance document for consultation setting out the principles of authorisation, the assessment methods used and the basis for decision-making following enactment of the primary and secondary legislation.  We propose to engage directly with stakeholders in this regard. </p> <p>  The heads of the Bill also include provision for environmental impact assessment, EIA, and appropriate assessment under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The EPA expects detailed process steps for EIA in accordance with EU Directive 2014/52/EU and as it relates to the EPA&rsquo;s abstraction licensing functions, to be set out in secondary legislation. </p> <p>  The national register of water abstractions was established in 2018 and is maintained by the EPA.  This requires that abstractions of greater than 25 cu. m per day be registered.  By November 2020, a total of 1,583 abstraction registrations have been received by the EPA and these are estimated to account for approximately 95% of all water abstracted.  The EPA is continuing to promote and secure compliance with the register by engaging with the relevant sectors including agriculture, industry, commercial and golf courses. </p> <p>  In summary, the EPA welcomes the registration and control of significant water abstractions in Ireland to improve understanding of where abstractions are causing a water pressure and to better manage abstractions in areas of high risk in the future.  In particular, a risk-based approach for the licensing regime allows the regulatory effort to be directed to where the environmental risk is greatest.  The EPA looks forward to the finalising of the Bill and associated regulations to establish the licensing regime. The EPA continues to maintain the national register of water abstractions, which it has done since 2018, in order that there is one national register of water abstractions in Ireland and it continues to engage with those sectors that are required to register their abstraction to improve compliance levels. </p></speech>

It is based on independent desk research published in October by SWAN and circulated to members.  I am joined by three experts, namely. Dr. Elaine McGoff, freshwater ecologist with An Taisce; and Mr. John Kenny, barrister, and Dr. Kieran Craven, who are co-authors of the report.</p> <p>  I will start with a few comments on the significance of abstraction as a pressure on our environment and then Dr. McGoff will say something about the thresholds in the Bill as they compare with other jurisdictions.  Mr. Kenny will comment on legal deficiencies in the Bill and Dr. Craven will be available for addressing technical queries.</p> <p>  SWAN fully acknowledges that abstraction is currently not the most significant pressure on Ireland's waters at national level.  Nonetheless, our research has identified significant risks.  It can pose a significant risk at local level to vulnerable water bodies, their adjoining habitats, such as groundwater dependent ecosystems and rural domestic wells.  It can impact on the hydrology and ecology of water bodies, including base flow reductions in rivers, fluctuating water levels in lakes and reduced levels of groundwater.  It is also important to note that even small abstractions can have a significant impact on certain sites and this is exacerbated by the cumulative impact of multiple abstractions from a water body.  These impacts are variable across seasons, which will be exacerbated by climate change.</p><p>A report this year from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, predicted we could have an up to 50% increase in extended drought periods by the middle of the century.  We really need to future-proof our water management.<br/><br/>Abstraction pressures are likely to increase with increased economic growth, including agricultural intensification.  In order to manage abstractions, we need to know where the abstractions are, how much is being abstracted and who is doing the abstracting.  Research commissioned by the EPA and led by Trinity argues<i>, </i>&quot;Progress on evaluating the current status of abstraction for Irish rivers ... was severely hampered by the lack of an integrated national database of abstraction&quot; and, critically, we contend we still do not have that integrated national database and the proposed Bill will not address this deficit or the others I have outlined.  My colleagues will now provide the detailed rationale and legal analysis to support that contention.</p></speech>

This Bill purports to mirror the system which they have in place for Northern Ireland and Scotland.  However, we highlight that it is far more lenient.  I will focus first on the registration of abstractions which is proposed at 25 cu. m.  This compares with 10 cu. m in Northern Ireland and Scotland, meaning the threshold is 150% higher.  Below this there will be zero record of who is abstracting water, where and at what rate.  If these abstractions are unknown to the authorities, there is no way to manage them.</p> <p>  For licensing, this Bill proposes that any abstraction over 2,000 cu. m would require a licence but this is 100 times higher than what is in place in Northern Ireland, England and Wales.  No rationale is provided for setting it so high, and very few abstractions will ever hit that threshold.</p> <p>  While there is a provision for abstractions between 250 cu. m and 2,000 cu. m being subject to a licence, this is only where the risk is deemed significant by the EPA, and it is our contention that the EPA risk assessment is lacking because it does not take into account a significant proportion of abstractions, which are, and will remain under this Bill, unaccounted for.  Similarly, even when abstractions are registered or licensed, the Bill does not provide for the means to adjust, pause or revoke a licence if conditions change, such as if there was an impact on the environment or on adjacent private wells.  In Northern Ireland the regulations provide for this, and this responsive approach is an essential part of any effective management system, especially in light of far more frequent droughts under climate change projections.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Kenny, who will outline the legal issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110500002#C00300"><p>There are fundamental problems with the Bill, as drafted, and it is my view that it will be in breach of the water framework, environmental impact assessment and the habitats directives.  It requires substantial redrafting.<br/><br/>The headline matters are as follows.  The first is water framework directive compliance, as the heads of the Bill are not consistent with the requirements of the directive, which it purports to transpose.  Article 11.3 of the water framework directive requires the establishment of &quot;controls over the abstraction of fresh surface water and groundwater ... including a register or registers of water abstractions and a requirement of prior authorisation for abstraction.&quot;  It allows that &quot;member states can exempt from these controls, abstractions ... which have no significant impact on water status&quot;, and it is clear that registration and licensing of all abstractions is required unless it can be demonstrated that these do not have a significant impact.  That is, there is a presumption of registration and licensing.  The proposed Bill, on the other hand, appears to proceed on the assumption of non-registration unless significant environmental effects have been identified.  That has the effect of the standing the water framework directive on its head.<br/><br/>The Bill will not have fulfilled its primary purpose unless it reverses the presumption such that only <i>de minimis</i>abstractions are excluded.  The exemption in Article 11 presupposes that even such <i>de minimis </i>abstractions are at least measured and assessed in the first instance before an exemption can be granted.  That is not reflected in the Bill.<br/><br/>The legislation proposes to approach existing licences differently to new licence applications.  It does not provide for the legal means to refuse a licence to an existing abstractor.  This has significant implications if those existing abstractions are found to be having negative environmental impacts.  Simply because an activity has been in operation for a certain period does not exempt or reduce the obligation to comply with the stringent requirements of the water framework, habitats or the environmental impact assessment directives. There is simply no warrant in the water framework directive for the head 11 proposal to allow existing extractions to continue effectively undisturbed.  Head 11 should be removed entirely and replaced with a section allowing a 12-month transitional period.<br/><br/>There is a 250 cu. m threshold and no licences under 250 cu. m will be required to seek a licence, regardless of their potential impact.  There is no scientific rationale for this threshold, and recent Court of Justice of the European Union case law makes clear that unjustified and unjustifiable thresholds are incompatible with the environmental impact assessment directive.  As the Bill is currently drafted, there is no provision for an environmental assessment at all below 250 cu. m extraction levels and there is simply no scientific basis or data upon which to base any such decision.  The same observation applies to the 25 cu. m and 2,000 cu. m thresholds.<br/><br/>Head 10 adopts a unique approach to licensing, where, in effect, the EPA is under an obligation to identify water bodies at risk and where significant abstractions are occurring.  It is then under further obligation to initiate contact with those significant abstractors to bring those abstractors into the regulatory net.  There is no warrant for this approach in the water framework directive and it is a recipe for significant abstractors to continue their activities in an entirely licensed fashion.  There is no comparable model used for licensing anywhere in Ireland and, with respect, no justification for introducing it in this context.<br/><br/>There are three recommendations from SWAN, based on our research to date.  Licensing and registration thresholds should be significantly reduced in line with those used in Northern Ireland, with general binding rules introduced for all abstractions, irrespective of quantity.  Head 11, which confers special exemptions on existing abstractions, should be removed entirely.  The Bill should provide for responsive licensing to allow licences to be amended if and when necessary, similar to Northern Ireland.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I will address questions to the EPA and SWAN but if we do not get to the answers in this round, I might get them in a further round later.</p> <p>  From our session with departmental officials last week, one of the key ideas we are trying to grasp is why the heads have settled on the 25 cu. m and 2,000 cu. m thresholds.  My first question to the EPA is for it to provide more detail on the scientific and data basis for it.  There is also the very significant deviation in both of those from regimes in the North, in Scotland and other EU jurisdictions, as highlighted in a briefing note we received from the Library and Research service in the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I am also a little confused by the general binding rules.  There does not appear to be enforcement and nobody has the power to ensure these rules are being adhered to.  It seems a light touch regulatory regime and I would like the EPA's view on how this can be monitored and enforced.</p> <p>  There was mention that of the current levels of registrations under this regime, 30% will come under the new regulatory framework.  This is not broken down in terms of the numbers that will be registered or licensed.  I am particularly interested to know, of the current level of abstractions of which the EPA is aware, how many will end up being licensed.  That is the only firm regulatory framework in front of us.  Will the register be public?  What is the EPA's understanding of why the Department has chosen the idea of indefinite licences.  There is no other licensing regime operating in the State that grants somebody an indefinite licence.</p> <p>  It was indicated that the 1,583 abstraction registrations in place are 95% of all abstractions.</p><p>How do the witnesses know that, given that there is no requirement on anybody currently abstracting 25 cu. m or less per day to register?  </p><p> There seem to be two major differences between the two presentations.  The EPA presentation seemed to say that there is a low level of risk from abstraction whereas SWAN seems to think that at a regional level and in times of potential drought or limited water supply, there is a greater level of risk.  Could the witnesses from SWAN discuss this?  What is their view of the data source on which all this is based?  Do they think it is adequate?  </p><p> Could the witnesses from SWAN give us their view on 25 cu. m and 2,000 cu. m thresholds and explain why SWAN is arguing for 10 cu. m?  My last question is for the witnesses from both the EPA and SWAN.  We keep hearing that about 6% of our water sources may be at risk from abstraction but at the same time, we know that about 32% of our water sources are at risk of breaches of the water framework directive.  Could the witnesses explain to a non-technical person like me the difference between those two figures so we have a full sense of the level of risk?  </p></speech>

Overall, the first question is about the figure of 25 cu. m and the various thresholds.  The starting point for us is looking at this from a risk point of view.  As the Deputy said in his last question, approximately 6% of water bodies in Ireland are at environmental risk due to water abstraction.  That is our starting point for looking at what is in the general scheme of this Bill.  We are very much focused on where those large volumes of abstractions are and whether we can focus the regulatory effort on those larger volumes to allow them to come into the EPA in terms of licensing.  I know there has been much discussion about the 25 cu. m per day threshold.  From our point of view, that is a reasonable threshold.  Above that, focusing on the larger abstractions, be it medium level, greater than 250 cu. m or up to 2,000 cu. m, where they cause a significant risk, they would come into the licensing regime and those larger ones of over 2,000 cu. m will come in anyway irrespective.  With our analysis, technical information and scientific data, they are reasonable thresholds to allow this risk-based approach where we would focus the regulatory effort on those areas that are likely to pose the greatest environmental risk.  This means we can ensure adequate environmental protection is balanced in a proportionate way with the administrative and costs issues.</p> <p>  All abstractions are subject to general binding rules as set out in the scheme of the Bill so irrespective of the threshold, we would welcome some clarity on who will enforce the general binding rules.  That would be useful.  There is a requirement in the scheme that before we issue a licence, the EPA will need to determine compliance with the general binding rules.  Again, this begs the question of who will enforce those general binding rules.  </p> <p>  Regarding the current level of abstractions, a total of 1,583 abstractions are registered.  We estimate that 490 of those will require a licence, that is, looking above the 250 cu. m per day threshold right up to the larger level of abstractions.  That work is ongoing.  It involves assessing the number of licences that would come into us - of course, we will be waiting for the legislation to be enacted - and running the risk assessment provided for under head 2 that looks at the cumulative impact of water abstractions.  Based on that, that will give us the information to say who is abstracting, who is posing a significant risk and who needs to come into the EPA for a licence.  I will hand to Ms Gurrie regarding the thresholds and the volume of abstractions; the 95%.</p></speech>

The EPA is tasked under the water framework directive and the regulations with characterising the pressures on our water bodies.  We do that every river-based management plan cycle.  We use all our monitoring data for our rivers and lakes - all our water bodies, transitional and coastal, and groundwater - and look at the pressures that might be causing the water body to be at risk of not meeting the objective.  The objective is either good or high status, depending on the water body.  The assessment of all the pressures is what comes up with the 32% at-risk figure.  That is then broken down into types of pressure such as agriculture, urban wastewater, forestry, abstractions - all the different types of human activities that can have an impact.  A total of 50% are impacted by agriculture but a water body can be impacted by multiple pressures so that is where the numbers come in.  The assessment for abstractions, which was done for the last river-based management plan, came up with a figure of 6%.  That used the data based on our knowledge of abstractions at the time.  We oversee the national hydrometric monitoring programme so we have all the river flow data levels and we have the water quality information so that all gets put into a model and comes up with the assessment of 6%-----</p></speech>

My question is really for the EPA.  The witnesses from the EPA mentioned that over 1,500 have already been registered on its registration database.  Do the witnesses think this system is working well or would they like to see it moved to a statutory footing?  The witnesses from SWAN mentioned the existing licences and having a different approach to new licences.  Could they elaborate on that?  I would like to hear the EPA's perspective on it.  When new laws came in based on an EU directive to regulate quarries, all of the quarries had to go back and re-apply for substitute consent to make sure they were adhering to the current regulations.  It seems fairly reasonable that everybody operates off the same regulations.  I am not sure if I fully picked up what the witnesses from SWAN were saying but my interpretation was that they were saying that existing licences will have a very different approach to new licences.  I would like to learn what this is the case and possibly rectify that if that is the case.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked about the cubic metre threshold.  The witnesses from the EPA have come in on that so I would like to hear SWAN's perspective on that.  The witnesses from the EPA said that they will be regulating it but from an enforcement perspective, the question remains as to whether the EPA has the resources to administer this from an enforcement perspective if that was given to it.  If not, would that be quite a big administrative burden?  How much of a head count would the EPA require to take on that level of responsibility?  </p></speech>

There is no justification for that approach under the water framework directive.  It appears to be an approach significantly influenced by an attempt not to inconvenience existing abstracters.</p><p>Whatever the rationale, the obligation is to comply with the directive.  One cannot allow existing abstractors to continue their activities perpetually without subjecting those activities to the directive's requirements.  Our concern is that the option has been taken, via the Bill, to distinguish between current and future abstractors and treat them differently.  As per our respectful submission, the Bill should provide existing abstractors with a 12-month grace period within which they should apply for registration or licensing, whichever the case may be, and be given a fair opportunity to regularise their positions.  At the conclusion of that period, existing abstractors and future entrants into the regulatory system would be on the exact same regulatory page, for want of a better term.</p></speech>

There is a distinction between existing and new licences, but I will first highlight how the requirements of existing and new abstractions are set out in this scheme, namely, that those with greater than 25 cu. m will need to register on the water abstraction register and those with greater then 250 cu. m will fall under our cumulative assessment in order to determine whether they cause a significant impact.  That will in then determine whether they need a licence.  Those at the larger end will come straight to the EPA for a licence.</p> <p>  The assessment that we will do under head 10 will include existing abstractions.  If they are found to require EPA licences, we will engage with them and they will come to us for an EIA.  We can impose conditions within the licence to ensure that existing abstractions are not causing any environmental impact.  Under head 13, there is a facility or scope built into the licensing regime, as we envisage it, to grant the ability to impose conditions in licences to ensure that there are no environmental impacts.</p> <p>  The register already has a statutory footing under the 2018 regulations.  They will be repealed and brought into the Bill once enacted.  We have 1,583 registrations, covering 95% of the total volume of water abstraction that we expect to have registered, but there are still some outstanding sectors that we need to continue to work with to promote compliance.  We have been engaging with the representative bodies and Departments in order to ensure that all of those with a requirement to register are abiding by their obligations.</p> <p>  From our point of view, enforcement will be on the licensing side.  Once we have the licensing regime in place and are issuing licences, their enforcement will be done through the EPA's office of environmental enforcement.  We will use our standard method of enforcement, that is, a risk-based approach.</p></speech>

We have looked at their presentations and our own documentation.  I want to keep my focus on two or three questions and then give my time to the witnesses because I want to hear answers instead of spending my time talking.</p> <p>  I wish to speak with the witnesses about two matters.  In terms of registration, we are told that the licensing thresholds are significantly higher in the UK.  This is a recurring theme.  What are the witnesses' views on this?  What is the rationale behind it?</p> <p>  Two issues keep arising, namely, that all abstractions of 10 cu. m should be required to be registered and all abstractions of 20 cu. m should be subject to licensing.  There are two conflicting views on this matter, and I would like to hear both sides.  It is an area of contention in terms of the water directive and the impact on habitats and the environment.  The witnesses and I know it is highly litigated, so they might talk us through it.</p> <p>  The EPA mentioned that approximately 490 abstractions were anticipated to require authorisation.  Has it a breakdown of these applications in terms of agriculture, cement, construction or forestry?  The committee might be interested in having a look at that information in order to understand what is being discussed.</p> <p>  All legislation is good legislation if it has been approved and teased out, and this discussion is part of that process.  The EPA will ultimately be responsible for much of the administration involved.  Deputy Higgins raised questions about capacity and resources.  What are the financial and personnel resources required to administer the new licensing regime?  Enforcement will be critical.  If there was not the capacity to see the legislation through, it would be a concern.  What is the EPA's view on enforcement?</p> <p>  There are 31 local authorities.  How does the EPA work with them?  The local authorities have a great deal of local knowledge.  After all, they are the planning authorities.  We see where there is planning consent for industry and other areas.  If the EPA is not already doing so, significant engagement and synergy with the local authorities in their role are needed.  They can give the EPA an advantage.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in how the EPA will enforce the legislation and what resources it has.  Since no organisation ever has enough resources, does the EPA need more?  Being unable to enforce the legislation would be an issue.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion about the thresholds, including the lower thresholds and those that are going through the graded system.  Our data, evidence and analysis show that these are reasonable thresholds and will allow us to focus our efforts and resources where the environmental risk is greatest.  As laid out in the scheme, this will ensure that where an environmental risk is imposed by a water abstraction, particularly larger volumes, it will come to the EPA for licensing and undergo a detailed EIA while we are assessing and a making decision on the licensing application.  The resources question is nearly as matched to the risk-based approach as it is to the environmental risk.  One is balancing the burden and the environmental risk, which is approximately 6% of water bodies nationally.  This approach allows us to focus our efforts where the risks are greatest.</p> <p>  Many of the 490 abstractions that we estimate will require authorisations will be drinking water supplies and abstractions from industry.  As such, they will be larger abstractions.</p> <p>  We have secured some resources to enable us to establish the licensing regime and make further efforts to understand the data and evidence that underpin the abstractions.</p><p>From the enforcement side of things, there will be a requirement to dedicate staff to that once the licensing regime is in place to ensure it is effectively resourced, and ensure we can enforce it as we do in all our licensing regimes in the EPA.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Ms Gurrie, to discuss local authorities.</p></speech>

Under the second cycle plan, there are many structures and committees in place to ensure collaboration between all the different State agencies and implementing bodies to ensure there is good implementation of the water framework directive, and a sharing of knowledge and information at regional level.  There are regional management committees and that feeds all the way up through the governance structures.  There is certainly much collaboration with local authorities.  We also have the Network for Ireland's Environmental Compliance and Enforcement, the NICE network, which is the enforcement network for local authorities, as part of increasing compliance with the threshold, looking at all the ways we can identify defectors, reach out to them and try to get them on the register.  Again, we will go back to the local authorities to see if they have more information to assist us in that regard.</p></speech>

The Department indicated in the last session that the threshold levels were set to be consistent with the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 and also be based on EPA guidance.  I wish to highlight that this Bill is being introduced to comply with the water framework directive not 43-year-old legislation.  The obligations of the water framework directive are far more stringent and ecologically based and compliance with that must underpin the Bill.  There has been much back and forth with thresholds and who thinks what but let us take a cold hard look at the legislation and see what is actually required legally.<br/><br/>Having reviewed all the submissions, we are also concerned that the threshold has been set in response to the lobbying by industry that does not want to interrupt or undo the <i>status quo</i>of its current arrangements.  It does not want its current arrangements to be altered in any way.  In our opinion, that is not a sufficient reason to fail to comply with the requirements of the water framework directive.  The Department relies heavily on EPA risk assessments for setting its thresholds.  However, our research, which the committee has a copy of, indicates that the risk assessment is based on incomplete data and it is unclear if it has been modelled for future climate scenarios.  As we all know, things are changing quite rapidly.  As far as I understand, they only assessed risk with a view to the water framework directive and do not take account of the risk to Natura sites, under the habitats directive, which might be quite different.  While something might be deemed to be not at risk of failing the water framework directive, that is very much not the same thing as assessing for the habitats directive, and that is very heavily litigated on, of which the Department must be mindful.<br/><br/>With respect to Dr. Cotter, the whole point of a register is that it is comprehensive.  If one does not know what abstractions there are, then I simply do not understand how one can assess the risk.  I know there are significant abstractions that will go to the EPA for licensing but that is only those over 250 cu. m, which is huge, but the cumulative impact of several smaller abstractions could be just as devastating.  Let us be practical and not be confused by the numbers.  First, we must look at our legal obligations.  Second, the man on the street knows that 100 smaller abstractions can have a serious impact so that must be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

Please suggest a <i>de minimis</i>threshold for Ireland.</p><p>We had research carried out that compared a number of other European jurisdictions and their thresholds for registration or licensing but they are not directly comparable.  Examples from the Netherlands and Germany have been given.  Are those countries in compliance with the water framework directive?  Are all of those countries working towards reaching compliance with the water framework directive so are undergoing a similar-type process at the moment?  Does Mr. Kenny have knowledge about these matters? </p></speech>

I cannot profess to know the situation in Germany or the Netherlands.  The figure used in the Netherlands seems strikingly high and is very much an outlier compared with the other jurisdictions identified by the Library and Research Service in its very useful paper.  I cannot give a view on something that I do not know the answer to.<br/><br/>In terms of what is<i>de minimis</i>for the purpose of the directive, the directive in Article 11(3) allows for abstractions that have no significant environmental effect to be excluded from the requirement for registration and-or licensing.  That, to my mind, presupposes that all abstractions - and I mean all abstractions - are subjected to at least some very basic assessments to identify whether they have a significant environmental effect.  The rule of thumb that is used by Northern Ireland and Scotland, in particular, is to have a very light-touch regulatory approach to abstractions that are less than 10 cu. m per day.  Those abstractions do not fall out of the regulatory net entirely and are subject to what are known as general binding rules.  There is a series of basic rules that all abstractions must comply with.  Once one goes over the 10 cu. m threshold one is into mandatory registration and over 20 cu. m one is into the licensing net.  <br/><br/>In summary, the water framework directive requires all abstractions to be assessed.  If the committee seeks to strike a balance between the strict requirements of the water framework directive and what might be practically achievable then I can say that there is significant merit in the 10 cu. m threshold used in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The submission states that 1,583 abstractions have been registered and this is estimated to account for approximately 95% of all water abstracted.  Does that figure suggest that the other 5% is somewhere below that?</p></speech>

We estimate that about 97% of all water abstracted goes into those schemes.  We are excluding them for the moment to keep the numbers more realistic.  We expect that those more than 25 cu. m will account for about 80% of all the volume of water extracted if the hydropower is excluded.  We have the larger ones of those on the register representing about 95%.  That is a lot of numbers.  The register contains the vast majority of the volume of water that is being abstracted.  The risk is really about volume.  As we go down, the risk becomes lower in terms of the assessment.  At lower levels of abstractions, it tends to be local.  For example, a house with a well and a septic tank is almost a closed loop in terms of the risk assessment.  The lower the threshold, the more that gets brought into the system.  I hope that answers that.</p></speech>

SWAN believes that the risk-based assessment is done only on the water framework directive and that appears to be the case based on comments from the EPA.  Is the risk-based assessment done on the water framework directive or does it look at wider issues and impacts on habitats and biodiversity?</p></speech>

For example, a Natura site might need high quality water; that is the objective of that water body.  The risk assessment takes that into account and recognises that the risk to those would be higher.  On the national assessment the habitats are included under the WFD water quality and quantity element.  Obviously, each individual licence would assess the impact on habitats under the normal process for licence applications.</p></speech>

In my ten years as a councillor, I served on the management committee of the Howth special area amenity order.  Within that is a special area of conservation.  We did extensive work in that ten years on a range of issues.  The changes in groundwater and drainage as well abstractions had major impacts on the habitats and the biodiversity in the area.  Virtually every issue we looked at came back to what had happened with groundwater.  In non-environmental terms, the changes in groundwater in the area had some severe impacts on flooding because the historical soakage was no longer in place resulting in some severe flooding effects.  I have a direct knowledge at a community level as to how relatively small changes in groundwater caused by improvements in drainage and-or abstractions can have a significant range of impacts.  That is in an area where much of this was studied and where it is actively managed.  I am conscious that most of Ireland would not have that detailed and intense management and ongoing study of areas.  I am concerned about that.</p> <p>  The EPA has confirmed that resources would be focused on the areas of greatest risk.  There is a rationale and logic to that.  I would not want to see many resources dedicated to the areas of lowest risk.  The EPA emphasises the areas of greatest risk, but what will the approach to areas of medium risk be?</p></speech>

We would first determine if they cause a significant impact.  If so, they will need a licence from the EPA.  All other abstractions are required to be registered and will be subject to the general binding rules.</p></speech>

The water framework directive requires us to take an integrated approach to water management, including looking at protected areas.  This is where we would contest what the EPA maintains.  While there is only 6% at national level, we need to look at each individual water body.  Some of those sites are extremely sensitive.  If we do not know whether they are being abstracted from, we do not know whether there is a significant impact.  The Deputy's point is well made and well taken.  The impacts on groundwater can also have impacts on wetlands and very sensitive habitats.  I hand over to our expert Dr. Craven to make some points on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kieran Craven" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110500002#G01500"><p>Further to what Ms O'Brien said, we do not contend that abstraction is an issue at a national level.  It really is at the local level.  The EPA believes that 20% of water abstractions are less than 25 cu. m per day, which means they are unknown.  Abstraction can have a very large impact at a local scale depending on the interaction of the available water, whether it is groundwater in connectivity with surface water, whether there are adjacent wetlands and whether there are domestic wells there.  The local impact of that abstraction can be profound.</p> <p>  I believe the EPA's 6% figure is based on a database that has been in existence with various iterations since about 2005.  It has tried to accumulate data on the main abstractions.  Between 2005 and 2017 a number of points were raised about the omissions from that database.  About 10% of water schemes were omitted.  Ones from industry and agriculture and unregulated ones are omitted.  The total amount of abstractions and specifically the locations of the abstractions are still relatively unknown.  Using an incomplete database will lead to an underestimate of the impacts.  We contend that on a local scale much is unknown about the impacts of abstractions.</p> <p>  When we take into account the expected effects of climate change, which based on reports by the EPA predict up to a 20% reduction in summer rainfall, increases in dry periods during the summer when we might expect certain industries such as agriculture would then have a higher demand for water and changes to precipitation levels as well, it all exacerbates the requirements for water, increasing the stresses on water, particularly on a local to regional scale.  We feel the proposed legislation should protect and be able to respond to these things.  Having thresholds of 10 cu. m for registration and 20 cu. m for licensing will increase that understanding of abstractions.  Particularly at the local scale, we will be able to respond to that to preserve the vulnerable and at-risk water bodies.</p></speech>

On the risk assessment and how it is being looked at for water abstraction, I refer to the other changes with water courses around drainage and what is going to be happening around climate change.

On the 6%, as I said we will be running that assessment again to get the most up-to-date position.  It is a national assessment but then one does identify the water body that is at risk of being impacted or maybe at risk of not meeting its objectives and one looks at what is going on then that is impacting on it.  To clarify, one looks at the national picture and when it comes to the licensing and the detailed assessment it goes local.</p></speech>

The EPA is again working with all the various stakeholders on that and looking at the evidence and then the programme of measures, that is, on what measures are needed to address that.  All those different pressures are assessed as part of the risk assessment and then when one gets down to programmes of measures, one starts looking at either national measures or local measures for actions.  In some of the prioritised areas, for example, we are looking at what needs to happen in this water body area, whether it is agriculture or others or hydromorphology or physical changes and looking at what needs to happen in that regard.</p></speech>

I apologise if my questions are going to sound a little bit stupid, I am very new to this topic, and I would like the representatives of the various organisations to talk me through some baby information, if that is okay.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the EPA representatives.  Is it proposed that the agency would keep a record of who is abstracting water from a particular water source to gain a cumulative effect, even including smaller operators?  Do the representatives think it would be helpful if the cubic metre threshold was lowered so they could get an idea of who was drawing on a particular water source?</p> <p>  On revoking licences, there is a definition of "significant risk" in there.  How would the witnesses define significant risk and what process do they go through for that?  Is there a mechanism for public participation or complaints about the giving of licences but also the revoking of licences if people are constantly breaking it?  On head 8, the risk is significant abstraction and damage. If the organisations are looking at that, are they looking at one particular person abstracting water or, as in my first question, is there a proposal that they keep a record of smaller abstractions and the cumulative effect of abstractions from one particular water source?</p></speech>

We have each individual registration on the register and then under the scheme of this Bill, we will look at each particular water body in terms of the risk assessment of what the pressures on it are including the pressure of cumulative abstractions of water.  Having gathered the information in the register, step two is that a risk assessment will then be conducted under, I think, head 10 to look at what the pressures are, to see where they are arising in different water bodies which then require a licence.</p> <p>  On significant risk, maybe Ms Gurrie could step in on that.  I will go through the public participation and then we can come back to it.  Significant risk is defined as an abstraction that would impact on the environmental objectives of the water body or the status of a European site.  It is very clearly laid out for those that abstract above 25 cu m. per day.</p> <p>  On public participation and the licensing regime, there are numerous provisions laid out for that public participation.  Those who come in for an application are required to notify the public.  There is a facility for the public to come in and make submissions during the licensing process and an objection period is also envisaged.  Thus, for all our licensing regimes, public participation is a very strong pillar, indeed is a requirement on our licensing.  That public participation piece, right through the licensing process, is something that we will maintain in this abstraction licensing regime as we do in all of our licensing regimes.</p></speech>

I have two questions for SWAN and then I will follow up with the EPA on a few of them.</p> <p>  The European Commission published an opinion of non-compliant with the water framework last week.  Maybe somebody from SWAN can talk us through their view of what that means and its significance to the discussion we are having here.  To pick up Dr. Cotter's point around public participation, it could be that I am misreading the heads but my understanding is that there is no provision for public participation in the granting of a licence for an existing extractor.  There is no provision for third party opinions and I would like the views of both SWAN and the EPA on that.</p> <p>  I have a more specific question for the EPA.  Turning to this business of not being able to refuse an existing extractor, I know Dr. Cotter rightly said that conditions can be applied but what is the logic of simply having no provision to refuse an abstraction?  It could be the case, for example, that there has been a change in the environmental circumstances and on going through the licensing process, the agency realises that there are things happening that were not happening before of which it was not aware.  Surely there should be a provision to refuse existing abstractors if the nature of that abstraction is causing environmental difficulties for the water source and putting us in breach of the water framework directive.</p> <p>  Returning to the thresholds, I know we are spending a lot of time on this and they are not the only thing but they are kind of the central linchpin of this.  A couple of times Dr. Cotter talked of a trade-off between getting to the greatest level of risk and a balance between the administrative and cost burdens.  That is a dangerous way to look at this.  I would have thought that the EPA would start in the first instance with considering what it would like to capture in an ideal world and then moving to considering what it can capture first, within the existing resources.  It may be an unfair question which the agency cannot answer but if it were not constrained by the existing resources, or if it had a Minister who was saying: "Tell me what you need", would the agency still be recommending 25, 250 and 2,000 cu m.?  If the agency had those greater resources would it not be looking at a different threshold?</p> <p>  On enforcement, I thank Dr. Cotter for her frankness.  It is a very significant piece of information for us because when we raised these issues with the Department, its representatives were essentially saying that there is not an enforcement mechanism, that the heads do not make provision for this.  Would it the EPA's view that it is the appropriate body to enforce and if so what would be the resourcing requirement on top of that?</p> <p>  I then have two quick questions.  Will the register be public?</p><p>Does it make sense to grant an indefinite licence?  Are there any other types of licences that the EPA currently grants that are indefinite?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.497" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110500002#J00200"><p>I will answer Deputy &Oacute; Broin's second question first.  I apologise to the committee but I will have to leave after this.  My colleagues will take a note on any questions and I can revert to the committee as necessary.</p> <p>  On public participation, this Bill proposes a completely unique model of licensing, whereby the EPA analyses the bodies, then identifies the significant abstractors, then approaches the abstractors themselves, and then brings those abstractors through the licensing process.  My reading of the Bill is that in none of those steps is there any provision for public participation, because the model adopted - as far as I am aware and I practice in this area extensively - has no other comparable licensing model that is an analogy for that proposed in the Bill.  The uniform approach in all other licensing regimes is that if a person's activity needs a licence or a permission, he or she approaches the consent authority, that is advertised to the public, the public is given an opportunity to make a submission on that, and then the consent authority makes a decision on it.  That is the model used across the board in Ireland.  I do not see any warrant in the water framework directive for this kind of roving jurisdiction which is being given by the EPA, effectively as a water policeman, to have a look at water bodies, have a look at abstractors, and if they think a particular activity is significant, to effectively bring the individual within the regulatory net.  In my very respectful submission, that is simply a recipe to allow significant water abstractors to continue their activities, untrammelled by the requirements of licensing or registration.  I would urge the committee to adopt the uniform approach, which is adopted by regulation in Ireland, whereby if I want a licence I must apply for it and in the course of that determination there is an opportunity for public participation.  In my very respectful view, there is no warrant for a departure from that well worn and well understood model, which is used in the EIA directive, the habitats directive and the industrial emissions directive.  The model is used in every regulatory licensing regime in the State with the exception, for some reason, of what is proposed in the Bill.</p></speech>

Normally I would be sorry that my legal colleague is leaving now and not in a position to address the legal question, but actually it is a very straightforward one.  The water framework directive came into force in 2000, and 20 years later we are not fulfilling the very basic requirement in the directive that says we need controls on abstractions.  The Commission wrote to the Government to say it has two months to sort that situation out.  The water framework directive says that Ireland needs controls over abstractions.  It is a very elegant directive in many ways.  It states that we need to control all abstractions unless it can be demonstrated that they are not significant.  This comes back to the point we have been making, that to deem whether or not an abstraction is significant, one needs to know where it is and the impact it has on particular water bodies.  If only abstractions of more than 25 cu. m are registered it means that significant abstractions are going to take place, we will not know where they are happening, and we will not know if they have a significant impact.  The amount of 25 cu. m is a lot of water, and I believe it is the equivalent of 42 households.  It is on that basis we would say the Bill is not going to bring Ireland into compliance with the directive that says we need controls on all extractions unless they are significant.  It means that Ireland will be back in trouble with the Commission again.</p></speech>

That allows us to focus our efforts where that environmental risk is going to be greatest.  That is our starting point, to ensure we know where there is an environmental risk, and so we can focus our efforts on controlling and understanding them through our risk assessment and, following on from that, through the licensing regime.  That risk-based approach is proportionate given the risk we know exists there overall for water abstractions in the State.</p></speech>

If that burden of administration and costs was not what it currently is, would the EPA still be making the recommendations?  When we ask the Department to tell us why it was going for 25 cu. m, 250 cu. m and 2,000 cu. m, in addition to referring back to the 1977 Act, it placed much emphasis on the recommendations from the EPA, which is absolutely appropriate.  If the EPA did not have the current administrative and costs burdens, would it still be making the same recommendations on the thresholds?</p></speech>

With the data and evidence, as we have it at the moment, the analysis indicates that we are looking at a risk of approximately 6% overall for the State.  We will refine, update and renew that information as it becomes available to us.  Looking at it through that risk-based approach it allows us to dedicate our efforts to where the environmental risk is, which is our starting point for all considerations right through the board.</p></speech>

If water is abstracted from a water body the volume of water is potentially reduced or at times of low flow 25 cu. m or more may have a greater impact than at times of higher flow.  All water that gets abstracted from whatever source, ends up somewhere else, which is the discharge elements of abstractions.  Whether that is the abstraction of water for cooling processes in industry that then gets discharged to a water course, which can increase water temperatures and the effects this can have, or whether it is abstractions for livestock that can end up in groundwater and as nitrates into river water, does that 6% just look at the actual act of abstraction, or does that 6% look at the entire hydrocycle of abstraction and discharge to whatever source it may be?</p></speech>

It is the ecological flow, that is what the lowest flow that will sustain the ecosystem to a satisfactory level is.  That is the threshold.</p><p>What we use at the moment are the UK and Northern Ireland standards.  They are well established and we feel they are appropriate in the Irish context.  We look at the whole balance of discharge.  With some of the smaller abstractions, because they are more local the abstraction and the discharge happens within a more localised area.  It is all taken into consideration, however, as is the cumulative aspect so it looks at the water body, all the abstractions and all the discharges into it to asses their risk.</p></speech>

On the registration process can she tell us what exactly is involved in the process for an abstractor?  How complex and onerous is it to register?  As I understand it the heads abstraction is not metered but only done on estimate.  A person may be abstracting 27 cu. m but that may be estimated as only 24 cu. m.   What is involved in the registration process, both from the abstractor and from the EPA?</p></speech>

What we have is guidance so some people may have flow meters and know exactly how much they are abstracting and certainly the larger abstractions will.  What we put in place was guidance for all the other different types of activity so they could estimate their abstraction rate.  For agriculture it depends on the number of cattle and for golf courses the area are to be watered.  All that is set out.  On the registration process, it is up to the individual to assess what their rate of abstraction is and to register accordingly.  It is quite a simple registration process.  A person logs onto the system and then enters the details of the location, the volume being abstracted, what it is being used for and contact details.  That is pretty much it as far as the registration is concerned.</p></speech>

They vary from a groundwater well which is relatively small and where one might be relying on the pump capacity to do the estimate to abstractions that are maybe a pipe from a river.  Then there are the large-scale abstractions from drinking water sources where they probably have flow meters already so they know how much water they are taking in.  The question of adding it to every abstraction is probably quite onerous and may, from an engineering point of view, not always be as simple as that.  The question of whether it is needed comes back to the risk.  We are happy enough that the assessment method is good enough; it is reliable and accurate.

What other aspects of the directive are we not currently fulfilling?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-05a.525" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sinead O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110500002#K01200"><p>Under that letter we are also not fulfilling regulations for controls of hydromorphology.  I like to imagine it as anything that involves going near a water body with a digger.  At the moment there is very little regulation on dredging, channelising or draining wetlands.  Again, this does lead back to abstraction because it will help us to become resilient with climate change.  If we are draining wetlands and abstracting water and we do not know where it is being abstracted, and if that is happening, for example, in a special area of conservation, then suddenly we have no climate resilience and are non-compliant with the water framework directive and the habitats directive.  This Bill should therefore be helping us to build a picture of the cumulative impacts of many pressures on a water body and also helping us to build resilience; it is doing neither of those things.</p></speech>

Just to summarise, what I am saying is that this Bill is aimed at registering, monitoring and licensing of water abstractions.  The data we have has up to this point been held by local authorities and was a bit vague or incomplete.  We are now on threshold limits and I think we are all agreed that we should be licensing, monitoring and measuring the impacts of all these.  We are at the point now of threshold limits and where they should apply.</p></speech>

If we consider water extraction where it is being used for irrigation or cooling, my issue is when we have a very hot summer and where certain people's crops are under threat, they go to the rivers to extract water to try to keep their crops going.  I have seen in one or two years where they have brought our waterways way down by extracting water such that it interfered with fishing and everything within our waterways.  There are so many points where a person could abstract water that it could not be policed.</p> <p>  Turning to flooding from heavy rainfall, in County Limerick we have recently seen that water was being trapped because of lack of maintenance on rivers which have not been dredged or cleaned out.  The proper flow of the rivers could not be monitored because the flow range was blocked due to lack of maintenance for up to 15 years.  Again, we cannot check out the proper water flow because water was being lodged on land.  Then, when the water level lowers, it gets released but in the meantime people who are not actually on floodplains are getting flooded because waterways are blocked.  In order to get the proper reading for waterways, they need to be cleaned out once and then maintained.  How can we monitor this however if that proper maintenance has not been done in 15 to 20 years?</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Gurrie wants to think about it or can come back in.  It is not completely within our area.</p> <p>  On climate change and drought conditions, there are provisions in the scheme for temporary abstractions.  As I read it, regulations will be made to set out what a temporary abstraction is, how we would define it and that will need to be notified to the EPA.  That is one way where the situations the Deputy describes may come about and that temporary abstraction would need to be notified to us.  What we would be looking for when the discussion of the regulations comes around is how does one define a temporary abstraction, what is an emergency situation, how are different sectors going to be treated, how would different parts of the country and different parts of the year be factored into the decision making?  We need as much clarity as we can have within those regulations.  I do not think it is the scheme but the regulations which will allow us to do our work.  On the larger abstractors in the context of climate change and drought conditions, having done our assessment and looked at the risks according to the different parts of the country and so on, we would be able to develop bespoke conditions for each individual licence that will place restrictions on the licensee, if required, if we do see that impact.  That will give us some control as well and factor in the decision-making around different parts of the year and different pressures on water as they come through.</p></speech>

It could be investigated to determine the best place for abstraction in such circumstances, which would be beneficial.  If there was an issue, the best point for abstraction, to care for the greatest number of people who need it, could be specified.</p><p> Due to flash floods and other recent factors, many areas have become wider.  The river bed has increased from 15 m to 25 m wide and it is taking in land.  The water levels have dropped because the river has become wider.  This, again, has a knock-on effect for people farther downstream.  Will the Bill take into account all these types of waterways in regard to abstraction points, such that everything feeds into a main abstraction point that has been designated as the best place to abstract water?</p></speech>

Abstraction takes account of the flow and the change of flow.  The question about hot weather and where to abstract relates to temporary abstractions.  On the wider issue of maintenance of rivers, there are different views.  Dredging can have significant negative impacts on rivers.  In general, the more natural they are, the better, but that is not the reality of systems.  Hydromorphology concerns the natural flow, processes and ecosystems, and it is an area under attention at the requirement of the water framework directive.  Much work is being done.  The EPA is examining the evidence base of what needs to happen, and while I do not want to speak for the Department, work is under way to examine the different control systems in place for different types of works on rivers that change the natural processes of rivers-----</p></speech>

What is causing many of the flash floods at the moment is that while the river bed may be 15 m wide, when the water comes there may be a section downstream that is only 6 m wide because it has not had the flow from above.  That is causing flooding in areas that are not flood plains.  To get a proper reading of abstractions and points, we have to ensure that where the main stream has these problems and if there is a flash flood, it can get to where it needs to go, without being held by a stopper being put in the way until it reaches a certain volume.  In such cases, the water just flows out and comes in in a different direction, which is turning our roadways into rivers.</p></speech>

The difficulty with asking questions in the later round is that the other members will have asked the good questions.  The issue of enforcement was mentioned.  I always think we should try to push responsibilities and resources to local authority level because there is a great deal of knowledge there.  Could the local authorities play a role in the enforcement of this, whether in partnership or otherwise?</p></speech>

Like Deputy McAuliffe, most of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked.  I may have missed them because I was attending a Zoom meeting.  Will somebody explain the 25 cu. m and the related licensing?</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy McAuliffe's point, enforcement through the local authority is so important, not least in regard to whatever licences have to be applied for.  As an example of something that has not worked in the past two years, our guests will recall that the Oireachtas introduced a law whereby septic tanks had to be registered at a cost of &euro;50 to the local authority.  People who did not register can get no grants.  I am working with local authorities and at least six people have come to my clinics in the past six months who did not register the &euro;50 with their local authority, and now they cannot get anything.  We need to ensure that information is given and that people understand whether they need to get a licence, to register or whatever.  That has been the biggest issue facing me in respect of septic tanks in my area and we need to change it, although I acknowledge that is not a matter for the Bill.  I am afraid we will find ourselves in a position where the correct information is not sent out.  People may not realise this has to happen and perhaps they will not do what they have to.  Then something might happen and they will be told that nothing can be done for them.  Going forward, information is critical, as is explaining it, such as in the case of the example I outlined.</p></speech>

We have worked closely with different representative organisations, relevant Departments and other statutory agencies and organisations such as Bord Bia to ensure we can give that information, through those organisations, to the relevant people so they will understand their obligations.  There is a role for us to engage with local authorities in that regard to ensure they can help people to understand their obligations.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the enforcement issue, one of which is the general binding rules.  We earlier gave some clarity as to who will enforce the general binding rules.  They apply to everybody who abstracts water, irrespective of the volume.  There is also the enforcement of the EPA's licensing regime for medium and larger abstractions.  We will enforce that licensing regime, as we do with all our licensing functions in the EPA, through our office of environmental enforcement.</p></speech>

There is a fee to register a septic tank.  When someone registers, has to get a licence or whatever, what happens?  What is the protocol?  Does paperwork need to be done or is information sent out?

We examine the registrations and take in that information to give us a better understanding of where the pressures are from an abstraction point of view.  That allows us to see which of those abstractions require licence in the medium range and at the higher end of those volumes.</p></speech>

It is the equivalent of about 42 houses, or a farm of about 200 cows or 500 sows.  It is proposed in the Bill that if there are 199 cows or 499 sows, or the equivalent abstraction of 40 households, there will be no need to register and the significance of the abstraction will not need to be assessed.  We argue that is not compliant with the water framework directive.</p></speech>

In terms of indefinite licences, is there any other EPA licence type that is indefinite?  Given that Ms Gurrie said that the registration process is very simple, why would we not just register everybody?  There is a limited requirement.  Picking up on the last point made by Ms O'Brien, how is it proposed to deal with the cumulative impact, for example, of several dairy farms that have less than 25 cu. m but are in the same catchment?  There are multiples.  How will that be dealt with in terms of assessing their impact?</p></speech>

How do the regulations in Northern Ireland compare with the provisions in this proposed Bill?  Do the witnesses consider the regulations in Northern Ireland and Scotland to be best practice or better practice than what we are proposing?</p> <p>  For the witnesses from the EPA, when looking at the aspect of 10 cu. m against 25 cu. m, was consideration given to trying to align the regulations on an all-island basis?  On revoking licences, there have been several issues in my constituency of Cork North Central with waste collection.  I know it is a different issue, but it comes down to licensing.  Once people have licences, they have them for some time.  The EPA has taken court cases against people.  To revoke a licence afterwards, however, seems virtually impossible.  Are we going to be in the same position here?</p></speech>

We review the conditions of licences under the head where the regulations are made.  We can, therefore, review the conditions of the licence and, as part of that, we can impose stricter conditions.  We have the ability, therefore, to review those licences and make them stricter if required to protect the environment.</p> <p>  On revoking licences, a facility for doing this, as far as I understand it, will be allowed within the regulations for new abstractions.  For existing situations, it is the case that we would be looking at it in terms of reviewing the conditions and putting significantly more mitigating conditions in place if we required those.  In terms of revoking licences, we work hard with the people who have those licences to improve the operation of the licences.  Revoking a licence would be a last step, and we would be very keen on ensuring the conditions of the licence and working with the individual licensees, which would be a better option.  However, there is that power there to revoke them if we need it.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for the question.  Ultimately, the thresholds are the real nub of this.  We have talked about them <i>ad nauseam</i>at this stage.  In Northern Ireland, abstractions in excess of 10 cu. m are registered and are licensed where they are in excess of 20 cu. m.  They have a responsive licensing system, so that if things are going a bit awry, they can adjust or pause a licence.  They also have no clause which allows existing abstractors to continue doing what they are doing.  This is really important.  My EPA colleague just there said that this is a function of where we are.  That does not stand up to legal rigour.  We have seen numerous cases go through the courts where there were the quarries, for instance, which were already doing what they were doing.  That does not give them licence to continue what they are doing.  Legally, that is just simply not good enough.<br/><br/>Let me just really spell this out for everybody.  Under 250 cu. m, there are no controls on the licences for abstractors.  There is no licensing under 250 cu. m, regardless of the impact.  Under the habitats directive, the EPA needs to be able to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that abstractors will have no impact on tourist sites.  I would ask the people from the EPA this question.  Are they happy that they can stand over the risk assessment and say that they are confident that, under 250 cu. m, there will be no impact on the tourist sites?  To go back to the original question, that is why we favour the Northern Irish regulations, because they cover this off.  They provide much more environmental protection and much more stringent legal compliance.  They really are the way we should be going.  This Bill is just a disaster, legally, to be honest.</p></speech>

There are many more questions we want to ask and there will be further work for the committee on this.  We did not get the opportunity, I do not think, to go too far into the environmental impact assessment of existing abstractions which would require licensing.  That is an area we need to look into further.</p> <p>  On the registration process, we seem to have established that it is quite a fairly simple process to register.  It is not hugely onerous, and there seems to be nothing to fear by registering.  I am only making this as a suggestion, but if we were to reduce the threshold to register so that it was only 10 cu. m for abstraction, it would provide a greater body of knowledge on what is a finite resource if at some point resources were to be provided to examine the cumulative impact of all of that and to carry out impact assessments.</p><p>At least, we would gather a good baseline of where abstractions are.  That is what I take from today's discussion.  Every abstraction, no matter how small, has some type of impact on that watercourse.  The task is to determine what is significant and the cumulative impact of a large number of small abstractions. </p><p> I thank the witnesses from SWAN and the EPA for their attendance.  This meeting has provided us with a lot more information and added to our knowledge in respect of our task in scrutinising this legislation.  I thank the witnesses and members for their time and co-operation.  </p><p> The committee will adjourn until 10.20 a.m. on Tuesday, 10 November 2020 when we will meet in private session via Teams, followed by a public session at 11 a.m. in committee room 2.</p></speech>
