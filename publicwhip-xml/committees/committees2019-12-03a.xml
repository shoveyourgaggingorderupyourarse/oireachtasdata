I am particularly pleased to introduce our new chief executive officer, who will also address members as part of our opening statement this afternoon.  Ms Imelda Hurley joined us just last month and brings a wealth of experience, which has included roles as chief financial officer, CFO, in Origin Enterprises and previous roles as both chief financial officer and head of sustainability with PCH International.</p> <p>  The Coillte annual report for 2018 highlights a company that has been transformed in recent years and is in good financial health today.  In 2018, the company had revenues of &euro;330 million and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of &euro;115 million.  The strong financial performance and delivery of key strategic objectives in recent years mean the company&rsquo;s debt reduced to &euro;15 million, while we also reinvested approximately &euro;40 million in renewing our forests.  We also paid our shareholder, the State, a dividend of &euro;15 million.  The fact that we have such a strong forestry company in Coillte, which is sustainably managed, is good news both for the economy and the environment.</p> <p>  Since I spoke to the committee in March, climate action has continued to move to centre stage as a critical policy issue, not just in Ireland but across the globe.  Coillte fully recognises and embraces its responsibility to optimise the use of its natural asset and resource for Ireland in a way that maximises its contribution to the climate action agenda and delivers for communities and the economy.  A strong and financially healthy Coillte is a prerequisite to delivering value in these three key areas.  We will be best positioned to contribute effectively to sustainable climate action by continuing to generate sufficient profit and cash from our commercial activities.  This will allow us to continue to deliver important economic benefits, while at the same time self-financing innovative climate action initiatives, which may not always generate a direct economic benefit for the company.</p> <p>  As I said in March, the next phase of Coillte&rsquo;s evolution is to consolidate the financial and operational health of the company and build on this momentum in order that we can contribute further to Ireland&rsquo;s approach to forestry, climate change and the optimal use of our natural resources for the greater good of Irish citizens.  As our range of activities increases and we intensify the use of our forests for climate change and recreation purposes, there will be an even greater need for community consultation.  We are fortunate in having a nationwide staff of foresters who are respected by local communities and understand and live in local communities.  This is a strength we have to build upon and leverage in the best interests of the public at large.  Our objective is to work collaboratively with Government, the Oireachtas, this committee and the public to ensure the value in Coillte is optimised to address our economic growth, the challenges of climate action and biodiversity protection, as well as the recreational needs of our citizens.  Just as we are always changing, so too are the challenges we face and the opportunities that will arise.  I invite Ms Hurley to address the committee and expand on some of the points I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#D00600"><p>I thank Ms Gray and the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to them today.  As I am new to the CEO role in Coillte and have not been before the committee previously, I would like to take a moment to tell members about my background.  I have spent over 20 years in leadership and finance roles in sustainability across a variety of sectors, including food, agriculture, technology-related supply chain management and professional services.  I am an experienced executive and non-executive director, having been a board member in public limited companies, State-owned, private equity and venture capital backed businesses.  During my career, I have worked extensively in Ireland, the United Kingdom, eastern Europe, Hong Kong, China and Australia.  In my most recent roles, as Ms Gray mentioned, I was chief financial officer in Origin Enterprises and CFO and head of sustainability in PCH International.  The opportunity to join Coillte as chief executive officer was exciting for me, particularly because the sustainability agenda and getting the balance right between the social and economic elements of a company&rsquo;s contribution have been important themes throughout my career.  I was therefore delighted to take up this role last month.  Coillte has been through a strong period of transformation and I greatly look forward to leading this progressive and dynamic company through the next phase of its evolution in the years ahead.</p> <p>  The 2018 annual report shows Coillte delivered strongly on its mandate from Government to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s forests are managed on a profitable and sustainable basis.  We are proud of the independent corroboration we receive with regard to the sustainable management of our forest estate, through the Forest Stewardship Council, FSC, and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, PEFC, certification processes.  These are internationally recognised sustainability standards that Coillte has been adhering to for the past 20 years, proving the strength of the company&rsquo;s long-term credentials in managing the State&rsquo;s forests in a responsible and sustainable way.  Given the positive role forestry can play in climate action, we believe it is important for Coillte to be economically strong, not just for the sake of it, but so it can continue to support the success of its sawmill customers, grow forestry in Ireland and allow Coillte to enhance its contribution to funding non-commercial afforestation, biodiversity and recreation programmes.</p><p>Financial strength also allows us to contribute to the targets for increased afforestation in the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan.  The key for Coillte in the next phase is to ensure we continue to strike the right balance between the commercial, environmental and social and recreational agendas in the ever-evolving world we operate in.  However, there are a number of challenges in the year ahead.  Looking out to 2020, a number of elements will combine to make trading conditions more difficult.  The UK is our biggest market and Brexit presents us with a clear challenge, the extent of which will not become known until the final shape of Britain&rsquo;s exit is decided.  Additionally, there is a general softening of market conditions predicted in Europe and beyond in 2020.  My challenge is to protect and build on the progress we have made in the context of a business which is cyclical in nature.  Our trading in this financial year to date reflects the uncertainty that exists in our key market, the UK, which is clearly seeing the effects of Brexit across the economy in general.</p><p> Despite these challenges, Coillte&rsquo;s focus remains to drive a strong commercial performance and to provide a valuable environmental and social dividend to society at large.  In July of this year, Coillte established a new not-for-profit entity, Coillte Nature, which will strengthen our focus on the environment and recreational forests and help tackle the climate and habitat challenges our country faces.  Coillte Nature will target the delivery of new woodlands facilitating species diversity, biodiversity and carbon sequestration as part of the Government&rsquo;s national forestry programme.  It is a timely initiative and it further enhances our environmental and social contribution, but we fully recognise that we will need to be very ambitious as we push ourselves hard to deliver a strong contribution on climate action.</p><p> It is important to note too that in respect of biodiversity, there is a sense in the wider world that the diversity of Coillte&rsquo;s forestry stock is limited.  In reality, Sitka spruce accounts for 53% of our forestry.  Other conifers and broadleaves account for the remainder of the planted areas.  Sitka spruce flourishes particularly well in the Irish climate and plays a critical role in the economy by providing essential timber for building and other wood products.  With the establishment of Coillte Nature, the company is seeking to advance its sustainability agenda by undertaking large discrete projects with a separate non-profit focus.  Coillte Nature will collaborate with other organisations to maximise the impact.  The first of our collaborations was announced jointly by Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in October, with 1,500 ha of bog suitable for forestry and carbon sequestration to be transformed into native woodland on the Bord na M&oacute;na estate in counties Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and Tipperary.  Although our forest sector is small by European standards, it is young and dynamic and recognised by its peers internationally as being innovative, progressive and technologically very advanced.  As the backbone of the Irish forestry sector, Coillte is well positioned to drive the development of forestry and forest products as a central pillar in the emerging bio-economy.  We are working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in examining ways for Coillte to make a significant contribution to the Government&rsquo;s afforestation targets over the next decade, including advocating for changes in policy that might increase Coillte&rsquo;s eligibility for incentives in that regard.</p><p> Before concluding I want to update the committee on the matter of farm partnerships.  Coillte has established a portfolio of 695 farm partnerships, accounting for approximately 12,800 ha of highly productive forests.  The farm partnerships are each based on a management agreement and property lease, with Coillte providing forest management expertise and the landowner acting in a caretaker role.  We have fully recognised that there have been issues with a relatively small number of our farm partnerships and I am aware that the committee has discussed these issues with Coillte in the past.  These partnerships are an important component of our business.  Since 1993, Coillte has paid approximately &euro;17 million in direct payments to its farm partners.  This amount is in addition to grants and premiums received by our farm partners.  Profits do not accrue to Coillte until the end of the partnership.  By way of update, we gave a clear commitment to issue a commercial statement to all partners the year before they receive their first annuity payment from Coillte.  This has been achieved and by the end of this year, we will have completed the commercial assessment process for all partners who will receive their first annuity payments in the next two years, 2020 and 2021, a total of 260 partners.  We have significantly improved our communications, with each partner being assigned a designated forester whom they can contact to discuss their plantation.  We believe we are now responding to any issues raised to the satisfaction of the vast majority of our farm partners.</p><p> Coillte employs more than 800 people and works with approximately 1,200 contractors throughout the country.  At the core of the business is an estate of 7% of the land area of Ireland, comprising over 1 million acres, spread across almost 6,000 individual properties all over the State.  Managing the State forestry is an important task and in my short time as chief executive, I am pleased to say that I have witnessed first hand the expertise, dedication and vision that my Coillte colleagues apply to their work on a daily basis.  Over its 30-year history, I believe it is clear that Coillte has continually evolved and embraced change and brought new thinking to the management of Ireland&rsquo;s forestry estate.  We will continue to do this as we look ahead and recalibrate to take account of the increased importance of climate change mitigation and the role that our forests can play.  In its climate action plan, the Government has set targets for afforestation over the coming period.  Coillte will certainly play its part but reaching these targets will, we believe, require a new strategy in respect of Ireland's land use.  Earlier this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, commissioned a report from independent expert, Jim Mackinnon, to review the approval processes for afforestation in Ireland and this report has just been published.  Coillte will study its recommendations carefully over the coming weeks, with a view to doing what it can to support the implementation of key recommendations as quickly as possible.  We are committed to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s forests are managed on a profitable and sustainable basis in collaboration with the communities in which we are rooted.  We are building strong businesses from sustainable forests and delivering an economic return, mindful of our obligations to actively contribute in a meaningful way to the climate change agenda and to provide benefits for communities, habitats and nature.  I look forward to discussing these matters further with members.</p></speech>

With all the talk about climate change and the challenges we have to meet, forestry has never had as important a part to play in our economy.  Forestry as part of the agriculture landscape has a significant role to play and we have to develop this in a sustainable manner.  I have been on this committee for a number of years now.  I have rarely got as many phone calls to ask questions as I did ahead of today's meeting with the representatives from Coillte.  I have a good few questions to ask.</p> <p>  As regards felling licences, thinning licences and getting permission to plant, is Coillte experiencing any difficulty at the moment?  Has it work ahead for its workers and the contracts it has with various mills?  Is Coillte under pressure as regards meeting its obligations with various mills around the country?  I have had private operators on to me constantly in the last couple of months who are reaching crisis point at this stage.  I heard from a contractor this morning who has 20 people employed and he says that on Friday he is going to have to let them go because there is no work in front of them.  He has very significant repayments on machinery, although I am not going to go into his personal details here.</p><p>I would just like to know what is Coillte's view on that aspect of the business.  Continuity of supply is imperative, but the personnel who are employed in forestry all have expertise in their own areas.  If Coillte has to let individual employees to, that will have a serious impact on its ability to deliver.  I am informed that when land is clear-felled, there is a huge reluctance on the part of landowners to replant and that a lot of this land is finding its way into the hands of pension funds and foreign investment companies.  What acreage has been clear-felled this year?  Have any approaches or advances been made to Coillte to purchase that land?  The Save Leitrim Group has been in contact and it maintains that a significant proportion of land that was clear-felled in the county in the past two or three years has ended up in the hands of investment companies and pension funds.  I do not like that concept.  I would rather see the land remain in the hands of landowners.  If they did want to sell for whatever reason, however, I would like to see an Irish company gaining control of such land.  Could Coillte elaborate on whether there have been approaches made to it in respect of land?</p><p> On planting guidelines, Coillte give figures there about the amount of Sitka spruce that it has planted.  From memory, the company has indicated that 51% of its-----</p></speech>

Are there individual sites that are 100% Sitka spruce?  We receive complaints about Coillte forests that its plantations are extremely close to dwellings and roadsides.  Coillte is planting everything it can at present.  In the event of replanting, however, will the prescribed distances from dwellings and roads be honoured?</p> <p>  I was contacted by a man who, unfortunately, has ash dieback on his land.  He is a contract client of Coillte.  He has 50 ha of ash, which is a significant plantation on which to have dieback.  The financial loss will be huge.  A mature hectare of ash is worth in the region of &euro;50,000.  His complaint is that Coillte is now taking out the diseased trees for him but is replanting with alder which, in his view, will have little, if any, commercial value.  While the alder trees will grow quickly, he feels that this is certainly not what he signed up for.  He had various reasons for choosing ash and wanted a cash dividend after a certain time to leave to a member of his family with physical difficulties.  Leaving that aside, he feels that what has been replanted for him was not what it said on the tin and that he will be left with a plantation of no economic value.</p> <p>  Coillte has stated that it has its own insurance.  Does this mean that there is not independent insurance for contract clients in respect of their forests?  In light of people's anxiety regarding insurance for forests, will Coillte clarify the position?</p> <p>  Coillte claims that it is happy with the arbitration process relating to its 700 plus clients and that there is general satisfaction with how it is going.  I do not get that impression from the people who contact me.  There is a view that Coillte is, at the very least, stalling the process, that it seeks further information from clients and that, to date, no arbitration has taken place, even though clients were told that it was due to start in September.  Some 30 or 40 are in the pipeline with another 100 waiting to get into the process.  What is the timeline for arbitration?  How many of Coillte's 700 plus clients have indicated that they will go on the arbitration route with it?</p> <p>  I have also received representations to the effect that clients who have made complaints about contracts are being visited by Coillte staff.  In most cases, these clients are elderly individuals.  While they have received legal advice, Coillte staff are getting them to sign agreements which bypass the arbitration process and which indicate that everything is hunky-dory.  I am not saying this is the case, it is what has been put to me.  If it is the case, there are questions to answer.  These people are not fully aware of what they are signing and, while I would not say that they are doing so under duress, if it was the case that elderly people were being asked to sign something in the absence of a legal person when they have sought legal advice, that would be a breach of good faith.  Will the representatives clarify whether Coillte staff are calling to individual contract holders and getting agreement signed without others being present for the landowners?</p> <p>  Another complaint I have received from people who own land adjacent to Coillte forests is that the company does not have enough staff to maintain boundary fences around its forests and that the fences are, in comparison with the position which obtained some years ago, seriously neglected.</p><p>There is not the same level of maintenance.  How many staff does Coillte have?  I appreciate that it has a serious amount of acreage to cover and that much of it is in quite rough terrain, but Coillte has forests in other parts of the country that are bounded by land which is used for commercial farming.  In those cases, there are issues with wildlife and other things damaging fences.  Does Coillte have dedicated staff for maintaining the boundary fences relating to its forests?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#J00200"><p>I welcome our guests.  Ms Gray appeared before the committee eight or nine months ago.  The presentation was very interesting.  It set out a strong trend for Coillte into the future.  We all agree that Coillte has an important role to play in terms of regional biodiversity.  It also has an important role in employment in the rural economy by providing approximately 12,000 jobs.  It is highly export-oriented, which leaves it exposed to the ups and downs of Brexit.  I read the climate action plan, which is the Government's policy that was produced in June, and I am aware that expansion of forestry is to play a key role to contributing to carbon abatement by 2021 and thereafter.  How can we be serious about that?  There was an objective of 10,000 ha for new forests and woodlands when I was in school clothing.  We never came within an ass's roar of achieving it.  We fiddled around with 5,000 ha and 6,000 ha and in the new climate action plan there is a target of 8,000 ha.  Am I right in stating that this is the first time it has ever been identified?  It is in the climate action plan.</p> <p>  I suggest that it is time to take this out of the Department altogether.  The Scots are up to between 12,000 ha and 13,000 ha.  Scotland is not dissimilar in climate or anything else, but we are into lip service because it is captured within a Department.  The Scots have a forestry commission and I believe it is time to do that.  What do the representatives of Coillte wish to say about that?  I realise that the company just implements Government policy.  In 2011, we were delighted to get any dividend from Mr. Lowery.  It was difficult to extract any money from him that time.  I was in government at the time.  To remind colleagues who are roaring and shouting about what 2011 was like, we were going around to every State and semi-State company and begging for a couple of million.  We had been told the coffers were bare and the money would be gone in 15 weeks.  That is what we had to face.  Some people might not know that but some day I will write the history, as I was there, telling of everything that happened.  We begged Mr. Lowery and others to get a few shillings at the time, and we did.</p> <p>  The essential objective should be a sustained commitment to promoting forestry.  Some of the matters Deputy Cahill raised illustrate where we are going.  The Deputy knows the answer.  There is not enough wood to keep the factories going over the coming months.  Everybody knows that.  A good barrister never asks a question unless he knows the answer.  Deputy Cahill is a bit of a barrister and he knows the answer to that question.  He is asking it of the witnesses and I am answering it for them.  There is not enough wood.</p> <p>  Let us be clear about what happened.  There is negativity about forestry.  There were negative effects for small forestry farmers.  As soon as the digitisation of premia was introduced, down they went.  There was a major problem with that.  There is indecision in respect of ash dieback.  We know it will cost a multitude of millions to compensate the unfortunate people who got into growing ash and who are still suffering.  It is shocking to see how people are suffering in Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry and across some of the midlands, the consequences of that and the indecision that has occurred.  There are stringent requirements and a great deal of bureaucracy and paperwork.</p> <p>  While carbon sequestration is important, there are other economic benefits as well, such as forestry tourism and social, environmental and health benefits.  In terms of carbon sequestration, is it Coillte's view that a major expansion of native woodland, which Coillte is committed to, or fast-growing conifers, which many people object to, is the best opportunity for carbon sequestration?  Is that an issue?  I note the Coillte Nature initiative.  It is very good.</p> <p>  Coillte is moving back into commercial forestry plantation.  How can it move into anything?  One cannot fight a war unless one has soldiers.  Coillte has 800 employees.  There were nearly that number at one time in counties Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford.  I know that because my late uncle worked with them.  If one went to any forest, one would see plenty of people working, but now nobody is working in the forests.  One would see the caise an ph&uacute;ca mushrooms a lot more often than one would see human beings.  How can Coillte be serious about achieving targets when it does not have anybody to do the work?  Coillte has improved its performance with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or EBITDA, up over 4%, but it is going down as a source of employment for workers.  I always say that to its representatives, and I said it to their predecessors.  It has fallen on deaf ears.  Coillte has no interest in employing people.  That is one of the matters it is not addressing, notwithstanding that it has an important role to play.</p> <p>  In terms of the business, what is the rate of return for the forestry assets in the accounts?  Coillte had a five-year programme in 2015.  Is that renewed or is the company bringing forward a new programme to set in place the transformation strategy upon which it embarked?  What is it doing in that regard?  What is the position with the Avondale Forest Park development?  Has it gone through planning or is it up and running?  Medite Smartply is a panel manufacturing business and there is an associated Medite.  How are they doing?  Do they continue to generate new markets for panel manufacturing?</p> <p>  Those are critical areas but to maintain the forests Coillte has at present and to continue to plant them commercially, and I am glad Coillte is going back into commercial replanting, there appears to be a reluctance to tell the Government what it is doing wrong.  I do not hear that from Coillte.  I believe the Government is all over the place and that is why it is time to take it from the Government.  A forestry commission would be a better way to achieve targets.  Otherwise, ten years hence we will still be talking about trying to achieve 8,000 ha.  It will be like draining the Shannon in that we will spend years trying to achieve it.  We should be aiming to plant 12,000 ha because it can make a huge contribution.  The Government is wrong.  It should be helping small farmers who have a poor area of land to plant that land.  It should encourage them and increase the premiums to enable them to get a decent return.  There is a great deal of marginal land and if farmers are unable to reclaim it they should be given an opportunity to do that, rather than penalise them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernie Gray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#J00300"><p>I will reply to the questions and pass them to my colleagues as appropriate.  On the last point made by Deputy Penrose, Coillte is conscious that it is one of the major players in the forestry sector in Ireland.  It is very conscious of the 12,000 jobs the sector provides and of the contribution it makes to the economy of &euro;2.3 billion overall.</p><p>If the sector does not perform well, it will be bad for everybody in the sector.  It is in everybody's mutual interest that the sector thrives.</p><p> On the overall issues, such as the status of forestry and its significance as part of the climate action plan, we are conscious that Coillte has a significant role to play.  The main enablers that would help us to do that include a national land use policy, which does not exist; a prioritisation of forestry as the main element overall, not just for Coillte but also for the private sector; and a roll-out of processes within the forestry sector, both for the approval of felling licences and the appeals mechanism that is currently a part of the process, that are robust and allow the forestry sector to thrive.</p><p> Although Coillte is returning to the area of commercial forests, it is limited by the availability of land.  While it can acquire farm partnerships, which it has done in a number of cases, and while it can acquire other lands, other interests held by pension funds or other investment vehicles, that will not be a net increase in afforestation for the country.  While it will increase Coillte's shareholding, it will not increase the national holding.  We have been in discussions with the Department in recent months since the plan was introduced on how best to provide a roadmap in the national interest, and Coillte is not the only player in that regard.  Part of Coillte's commitment to having a dialogue in the sector is its support of the Forestry Ireland initiative, which is the first time in the State's history that all the voices in the forestry sector have come together.  All of them have a number of mutual interests to be served, and it is in Ireland's interest that the sector as a whole will move forward.</p><p> They are some of the initiatives the Coillte has taken and some of the practical discussions we have engaged in.  We are clear about what is needed on a national level to help not just Coillte but other members of the sector to perform their role, and we will continue those discussions.  We are disappointed with the progress in respect of felling licences.  We have been in active discussions at the highest level with the Department and the Minister in recent weeks and they will continue this week.  While it is a significant issue for Coillte - it is currently our number one risk - we fully appreciate the impact it has for private operators in the sector.  There are two interests, the first of which is to overcome the immediate tactical issues about the process in place and the accompanying appeals process.  Our second, more enduring interest is to put in place a more sustainable process for the future.  Otherwise, the forestry sector, as well as Ireland's contribution to mitigating climate change through the forestry sector, will be impaired.  That is not in anyone's interest and we are conscious of that.</p><p> On its stated position on employment, Coillte is not averse to increasing employment where it is warranted.  We seek to balance our commercial and non-commercial mandates as provided for in the Forestry Act.  If we were to increase afforestation and assume the 8,000 ha target outlined in the plan, it would cost Coillte on average approximately &euro;100 million per year.  That is because Coillte does not have access to grants or premia that are available to the private sector.  If we did have such access, the cost would reduce to &euro;20 million, which would be a much more viable option for Coillte to engage in.  We have been in active discussions with the Department and made a submission to the EU in respect of the risks of state aid that apply to determine whether we can mitigate the risk and move forward in the interests of both Ireland and Coillte.</p><p> A number of Deputy Cahill's questions related to forestry.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Carlin, in the first instance to deal with them, after which Ms Hurley might address a number of the other questions that were asked.</p></speech>

We will also bring in additional contingency applications to ensure we can sustain a good supply of material for our sawmill customers and our contractors.  The contractors are generally on long-term contracts with Coillte of three to five years.  We want to work with them to ensure they will have continued work, not least at this time of year as we approach Christmas, as well as over the Christmas period, and we are working on that with the Department to try to prioritise licences we believe can get through the system quickly.  It is our number one priority and we are engaged with our customers and contractors on the issue, which no doubt exists.  We will also engage with the Department on how we can implement new environmental screening and appropriate assessment procedures more efficiently and effectively in order that we will not be in the position again.  My understanding from talking to the Department is that the new procedures will put us in a more robust position for the future, although there has been disruption to the normal flow of licences and permits in its implementation.</p> <p>  On the question about private clear felling and reforestation that may not be taken on by the individual who owns the land, there are approximately 1,000 ha of private clear felling per year.  On occasion, we are approached to determine our interest in purchasing land and forestry.  As we move forward into next year, we will develop an initiative to offer our services in mobilising timber or acquiring land in forestry.  We are interested in that area of the business and seek to develop it further.</p></speech>

There are guidelines for the primary and secondary species and we are well under the threshold of 53% Sitka for the former.  We do not measure or monitor it at an individual level but rather a regional level because it makes the best use of the land.  One wants to put the right tree in the right place for the right objective.  It is important that the more productive areas of our estate have more commercial species and that the areas of our estate that have higher biodiversity have greater diversity, perhaps by using native woodlands.  Some sites will have a proportion greater than 53%, some might have as much as 90% commercial, while others might have 90% non-commercial.  It depends on the site characteristics and our objectives.  Nevertheless, when planning our reforestation, we always try to ensure that whatever biodiversity is on site will be enhanced or restored.  A subject of which we are acutely aware, related to one of Deputy Cahill's questions, is that some of our forests, both private and public, are too close to dwellings or public roads.  The new afforestation and reforestation guidelines have done a great deal to address this, with appropriate setbacks from houses and roads.</p><p>New forest which we are putting in place has good boundaries and good setback distances.  However, forests that are more long-established may be too close.  What we are doing is engaging with local landowners and we correct as much as we can, where appropriate.  I am satisfied the new guidelines which we follow take much more recognition of our neighbours.</p><p> On the question of ash dieback, this is clearly a major challenge for the country, given ash is such an important species for us, not only commercially but also culturally.  Unfortunately, we have to remove ash from some of our sites due to Chalara dieback.  We are in discussions with individuals about the best way to approach this clean-up operation and what we can do to replant their sites.  One of the positive news stories is that we are working very hard on a resistant strain of ash to get back into planting ash as quickly as we can.  We are working hard with the Department in terms of identifying strains of ash that will prove resilient for Chalara because it is important to start planting ash again. </p><p> The Deputy had a question on insurance for contracts and I presume he means the contracts for farm partnerships.  Many of our partnerships are on the basis of insurance being carried out by each individual partner.  Coillte is self-insured and we do not specifically insure our crops, so we carry the risk.  It would be simply too costly for us to insure our entire estate.  Some of our partners would insure their own crops and there are insurance schemes available for them to do that.  One point to note is that as these partnerships mature, the risk somewhat passes from the partner to Coillte.  As we pay out annuities, the partner is realising the value of that asset and the value moves towards clear fell, so the risk passes a little more over to Coillte.  However, it is up to each partner to insure their portion of the partnership.  I believe that answers the main forestry questions.</p></speech>

We are putting in the appropriate species and trying at all times to make sure the asset can be realised.  At the end of the day, this is a partnership and there is a value to the client that, clearly, we have to be cognisant of.  However, there is a value to us as well so we are always trying to do the right thing for the partnership in terms of the value.  In individual cases, we are happy to talk to individuals about the best way of handling this.<br/><br/>The Deputy had a question about an important issue, namely, Coillte staff bypassing arbitration processes.  This is not happening in terms of bypassing any legal arbitration process.  There are clear mechanisms within the partnership to deal with any dispute.  We have one case with a partner that is moving towards arbitration and we certainly are not delaying that process.  It is within the legal sphere and there is information flowing on both sides.  We want this to move quickly and it is in our interest to get it moving.  There are another six cases where there has been consent to arbitration, so there are seven cases in this sphere at the moment.  I can categorically say we are not delaying things and there is no delaying tactic.  We want to move through as quickly as we possibly can on this but it is in the legal sphere.<br/><br/>I am trying to think of what we could be asking the partner to sign which the Deputy might be hearing about.  We carry out an annual review every year with the partner.We try, where we can, to meet the partner on site as we think it is better to do this face to face and have a conversation about what is happening with their woodlands and what will happen next.  We like to get that signed off, so that might be a case where a document is being signed off which shows where the partner is at with the partnership and what is going to happen next.  The only other thing I can recall that we would need to get signed is on the occasion of grants to allow us to build roads and so on.  Certainly, there are no other documents we would be forcing a partner to sign, particularly from a legal point of view.</p></speech>

Whatever document is signed surely has an impact on the arbitration process.</p></speech>

In these very few cases we have in arbitration, that is how we would treat it and both sides would be leaving it to their legal advisers.  In the vast majority of other cases where we are getting documents signed, it is more to do with the annual review and grants.  Our front-line foresters would not be dealing with farm partners in regard to legal documents as that would not be appropriate.</p></speech>

One of the big responses we have made, among the big improvements we have made since this issue came to light, relates to improving communications.  Therefore, hopefully, it will not have to come to this and we can deal with issues with the partner, whether they are issues of clarification on the actual plantation or on the commercial statements.  Since we last updated the committee on this, we are pleased to say that any partner who is due annuities in the next two years has received a full financial breakdown and commercial statement, and has met with our teams and knows where they stand.  Communication has improved greatly so, hopefully, that will negate the necessity to take the legal route.</p></speech>

We are in one in four townlands in Ireland and we have 6,000 properties, so it is something we are always very aware of.  We have a responsibility and farmers have a responsibility to fence in their livestock.  Where we have damaged fences through our operations, we always try to do the good neighbourly thing and provide fencing materials or try to carry out the operation ourselves.  We do not always get that right but, certainly, we have tried very hard in the last few years.  We have reorganised our front-line operations to bring in an estates team.  We have a harvesting team that looks after harvesting operations, a reforestation team which looks after planting and a dedicated estates team to deal with local issues and stakeholder engagement.  We are operating in rural communities with our own staff and it is important that we are good neighbours and try to do the right thing.  When there is a case of fences needing to be repaired and, clearly, it has been an issue, we always look to repair those.</p></speech>

Coillte has a dividend policy, which it has agreed with all of its stakeholders and which is that we would pay a dividend per annum of 20% to 30% of our profits.  Last year was the biggest dividend that Coillte ever paid, which was &euro;15 million, and that has increased from &euro;2 million in 2013, so there has been a significant increase in the level of dividends.</p></speech>

This year has been more challenging year for Coillte and 2020 will be more challenging again, and Ms Hurley will comment further on that.  We would prefer to think of our dividend not just in financial terms but also in social terms.  Our contribution to Ireland is both financial and non-financial, which is part of the rationale for setting up Coillte Nature, but, equally, we have a responsibility to make transparent to Ireland what we are doing on a non-financial basis as well.  I will pass to Ms Hurley in regard to the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#M00100"><p>Deputy Penrose asked about the financial return that the business is experiencing.  In 2018, the cash yield was 4.6%.</p> <p>  As Ms Gray has mentioned, in 2019, and more so in 2020, we are seeing and will see a softening of market conditions across Europe.  The business is experiencing the uncertainty of Brexit because the UK is the biggest market for Irish timber.  The UK is the second largest importer of timber in the world and any uncertainty in that market has a knock-on effect on us.  The Medite Smartply business is performing well.  The two facilities produce MDF and OSB which are very important in the construction industry.  It is important to continue to invest in that business to ensure that we are innovative and that the business is able to operate on a very efficient basis.  Coillte has 800 employees but we also have 1,200 subcontractors who work more or less full time in the industry.  As an industry it employs 12,000 people and is worth &euro;2.3 billion.  An important statistic going forward is that, as a result of the plantings of the past 20 years, the industry is expected to double in size over the next ten to 15 years.  It will, therefore, become even more important.  </p> <p>  The land we have is approximately 7% of the landbank of Ireland.  Of that, 20% is directly managed for biodiversity purposes and that is one of the social dividends delivered to the State.  We have optimised the balance in terms of forestry.  Being new to the industry, I have asked a lot of questions in the past month and I have wanted to learn about the business from the moment I became aware of the Coillte opportunity.  Our overall forestry sequesters approximately 50 million tonnes of carbon as a carbon store.  As a carbon sink, on an annual basis approximately 70% of carbon emissions in Ireland are sequestered based on the ongoing growth of trees.  That is part of the social dividend that we deliver. </p> <p>  Coillte Nature is a new initiative launched this year and it considers how we make a further contribution to forestry in Ireland and to improving biodiversity.  It will feature several initiatives, one of which is a memorandum of understanding with Bord na M&oacute;na for 1,500 ha of bogland where we will plant a specific type of tree that we are nurturing.  That will be a two-year project.  These are many of the positive things that Coillte is doing but I am aware that at times there is negativity about forestry.  We have a more agricultural than forestry culture.  I grew up on a dairy farm and have engaged with my family since I took this role.  We need to think about the role that forestry can play in helping to keep farmers on the land rather than have to leave it.  There is much to do but with time and the right enablers, much can be done.</p></speech>

It is not just in our interests but in conjunction with everybody else in the sector.  Coillte invested in the Forestry Ireland initiative where all the companies and players in the sector come together because forestry affects everybody.  The purpose is to make transparent the benefits and attractiveness of forestry as a sector to potential employees.  Coillte operates an annual graduate recruitment programme.  This year, a number of the graduates we recruited came from eastern Europe because we could not source them in Ireland.  We want to be an employer of choice such that potential employees in Ireland want to join Coillte and understand what a job and a career in the sector can bring them.</p></speech>

The fact that forestry is the second most productive and profitable farm enterprise after dairying is rarely mentioned.  I do not think the witnesses mentioned it and other organisations that have appeared before the committee have not mentioned it.  That point has to be made to make forestry more attractive.  One point the witnesses missed was Deputy Penrose's question about separating the forestry sector and following the Scottish model of a forestry commission.  Do they have any views on that?</p></speech>

The Mackinnon report was commissioned by the Department.  It is as anxious as we are to put a better roadmap in place.  We will have further discussions with it this week.  Mackinnon does not draw any conclusions on the status of a commission and its benefits versus a Department as the vehicle for regulation and administration of the forestry sector.  Our concern is not whether it is a commission but to make sure that the processes which play into the sector are the most robust possible.  That is what we are discussing with the Department.  We are also discussing some of the key neighbours the company needs if we are to increase the level of afforestation.</p></speech>

The company made a mess of that because it did not realise the extent of the negativity towards wind farms in rural communities.  I know it intended to go back into wind energy and generate 1 GW of electricity.  The Minister is moving now to ensure communities benefit from wind farms, which is right, rather than those coming in from outside who are almost like vulture funds and pension funds.  Has Coillte given any thought to how wind energy could contribute?  There was some sense in that approach.  Coillte nearly knocked us out here at one stage when it spoke of getting involved in the nursing homes business.  I am sure that proposal is in the dustbin now.  Wind energy was very badly handled but Coillte sold off wind farms and got a great return.  What did it do with the money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernie Gray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#M00700"><p>I will answer that in the first instance and go back to the question about the commission.  An amount of the proceeds of the sale went towards repayment of debt which existed on Coillte's balance sheet at that time.  The balance was then available for reinvestment in the business, afforestation being part of that.  The board this year has been working hard with the management team in looking at the areas for investment in the business.  Ms Hurley will talk more about that.  It is a combination of repayment of debt and capital reinvestment.</p><p>The Deputy also referred to the impact of the forestry commission in Scotland.  The Mackinnon report identified a number of factors which, in Mr. Mackinnon's view, contributed to a higher level of net afforestation in Scotland.  Mr. Mackinnon reported that the commission could possibly have been one of these factors, but he could not be definitive about it.  He referred to the size of the holdings that have traditionally been used for afforestation.  The holdings in Ireland are much smaller than the holdings in Scotland.  Mr. Mackinnon referred in his report to the "lack of political priority given to forestry".</p></speech>

One of the barriers faced by Coillte is that it cannot access grants and premiums.  That did not apply in Scotland, which made it easier and more economical for the authorities there to increase afforestation.  We will discuss all of these issues with the Department, which commissioned the report in the first instance.  The officials in the Department are as anxious as we are to make progress with this agenda.</p></speech>

The Medite Smartply business, which has been mentioned, requires ongoing capital investment to ensure it can produce innovative products, retain its competitiveness on the market and continue to have efficient processes.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose referred to further proposals.  I understand and acknowledge the point he made about wind proposals.  There has been a further proposal to realise 1,000 MW of wind energy over a ten-year period.  We recently signed an understanding with the ESB that requires the consent of shareholders and of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  As that proposal is built out over a period of time, further capital will be required for these purposes.</p></speech>

A number of people contacted me when they heard the witnesses would be in attendance.  The main thrust of my contribution will be based on the partnership arrangements and agreements.  The witnesses have said in response to previous questions that Coillte intends to improve its communications.  I have heard various stories, but I would like to hear Coillte's side of the story.  The first issue I would like to raise has been addressed to some extent.  I would like to hear a little more of a breakdown of how Coillte intends to deal with historical instances of sums of money being paid to partners for timber without any documentation or receipts setting out the weights involved, etc.  This created issues with Revenue because the people in question were not able to account for what specifically the money was for.  They could not provide a breakdown of what they got the money for.  I ask the witnesses to address this matter.  I am reliably informed that there are some cases of this nature.</p> <p>  I was also given a couple of examples of people who asked to dissolve their partnerships with Coillte for various reasons.  They may have become disillusioned or whatever.  They were told that if they bought out Coillte, it would cost them two and a half or three times more than it would cost Coillte to buy them out.  I ask the witnesses to explain those figures.  Are they accurate?  If so, why is this the case?</p> <p>  I have also been told about instances in which no grant is provided for replanting after clear felling.  I would like to hear Coillte's side of the story.  It seems that if an individual involved in a partnership with Coillte is not in a position to engage in replanting, Coillte offers him or her a measly &euro;400 an acre to take over the site.  Is that true?  If so, why are such people not entitled to receive the market value?</p> <p>  I would like to return to the question of Coillte's people maintaining contact with people who have engaged with it through solicitors.  I know this matter has been covered already.  At the same time as Coillte's solicitors engage with the solicitors of people who have been involved in partnerships with it, Coillte continues to carry on individual dealings with them.  I am not happy with the clarification that was given when this issue was raised earlier.  One would imagine that if two individuals had solicitors working on their behalf and negotiating with each other, everything would have to go through those solicitors.  I would not expect Coillte to go behind the backs of solicitors to deal with people on an individual basis.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the markets.  Deputy Penrose has said that when Deputy Cahill asked a question earlier, he knew the answer.  While we have targets as part of our plan to plant 8,000 ha each year, the long-term nature of the development of this project means that it will take a long time to come to fruition.  How are markets going to be satisfied in the meantime?  If we start hitting the 8,000 ha target from this year on, leaving thinnings aside it will take 20 years for us to see the material that is being planted at the moment making an input or coming onto the market.  Given that we are talking about a 20-year span, how are we going to satisfy the markets?</p> <p>  I apologise for leaving, but I have to vote.  I hope to be back before the witnesses answer my questions.  If not, I will see them in the transcript.</p></speech>

I extend a special word of congratulations to the new CEO, Ms Hurley.  I commend Coillte on its Science Week initiative, which involved the provision of saplings to schools, local community development groups and Tidy Towns committees.  Anyone I heard about was delighted with the initiative.  I commend Coillte on the introduction of such a great initiative at a time when we are all talking about climate change.  The local climate action committees that are in place are engaging with and talking about these issues.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about a joint Coillte-Bord na M&oacute;na initiative that has been announced.  As I am from County Offaly, I am very keen to hear about the plan to transform Bord na M&oacute;na lands into native woodlands.  This matter has been the subject of a great deal of consideration at the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We have debated whether these lands should be wetted first and species like alder should be planted subsequently.  Has Coillte looked into paludiculture?  I would be very interested to hear what the witnesses have to say about this.  There was a little negativity when this initiative was announced.  Those of us who thought it was a good idea suddenly realised that the use of boglands to grow trees was not quite as simple as we thought it was.</p></speech>

Senator Daly asked about farm partnerships.  Coillte conducts its business with openness and integrity.  When representatives of Coillte were before the committee two years ago, they accepted that the way in which the administration of farm partnerships had operated needed to be improved because mistakes had been made.  Every effort has been made in the interim to make those improvements and to increase communication.  If there was any sense that such improvements were not visible to all the farm partners, we would be very concerned.  We gave a commitment that every person would receive communication; that we would put additional resources in, which we did; that we would issue a commercial statement to each partner, which we did; and that we would assign a member of staff to farmers an individual basis so that they would know who they were dealing with and there would be a human face to their interface with Coillte.  We would be concerned if that was not the experience.  If there have been particular instances in which this has not been the experience, we want to hear about them because that is not the way Coillte likes to do its business.</p> <p>  A question was also asked about markets and supply.  The strategic review, which we have mentioned, involves ascertaining the extent to which Coillte is in a position to supply timber to the sector in the knowledge that it is growing quite rapidly.  We are looking at the net increase in afforestation and at the profile of our forests.  We want to ensure the ageing of our forests and the harvesting of our trees are in line with the requirement to supply to the market.  As part of our strategy, we will invest in mature forests to supplement years in which the profile of our forests might not meet demand.  Overall, we are happy that we will be in a position to meet demand, even as the market expands.</p> <p>  We are very happy that the Bord na M&oacute;na initiative, which was mentioned by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, has been concluded.  The question of what will happen has been raised with us on a number of occasions.</p><p>Is it the best decision not to rewet?  What is the best way and what species should we use for afforestation of cutaway bogs?  We are taking the best ecological advice on that, as we do with our management of forests and harvesting policy.  Mr. Carlin will provide further insights.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Carlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#O00200"><p>I will start by addressing the farm partnership questions.  The first question was on payments to partners and the clarity on timber removals and trucks being removed.  We have made great inroads in improving the information that is given to our partners on a commercial basis through commercial statements.  The main harvesting events that will be taking place at the moment are thinnings.  A significant advantage that we have over the private sector is that every truck that we have removing timber is tracked with GPS, so we know exactly what timber was harvested and put to roadside and where all the trucks that removed that timber went.  We also make sure that we convert tonnage into volume, which is of benefit to the partner, instead of paying by tonne.  That information is all readily available.  It is not being made available, but we certainly can make it available to partners if they wish.  That can be dealt with locally.  The information is there and it is all very well-tracked.</p> <p>  There was a question on dissolving partnerships, where the buyout price was different from the buy-in price.  That is a matter of how much has already been paid over to the partner.  At a particular moment of maturity of the partnership, depending on the specific partner and type of contract, moneys can already have been paid over.  Those moneys have to be discounted and indexed.  This is a valuation procedure which is pretty well defined in forestry.  We recently had KPMG review our valuation methodologies.  That would explain the buyout versus the buy-in price.  Moneys already paid over would generally cause that differential.  We can look at things on a case-by-case basis but that is the biggest cause of the difference in price.</p> <p>  When it comes to grants for reforestation and Coillte acquiring the land of our farm partners, we are not in that phase of our partnerships yet.  The clear-felling that we have done with our partners has generally been through windblow, where we have had to go in and salvage trees, and there has been very little of that.  We have not come to a position yet where these partnerships have matured and we are clear-felling and looking at reforestation.  However, we would be interested in acquiring land for reforestation, but it would be done at a fair market value.  The partnership ends once the crop is felled and the land reverts back to the partner.  It is entirely up to the partner what to do with the land.  We would like to provide partners with an option of acquiring the land but it will be done at a fair market rate.</p> <p>  There was a question about communications with partners that may already be in or approaching arbitration.  The only communications that would be happening at a local level are not legal conversations.  They relate to the forest operations that are happening.  It will be our local forester talking to the partner about what has to happen with a road or the crop itself.  If the partner feels that is inappropriate, then I think we have to look at that again.  It would be in our best interest to improve our communication with the partner, but if the partner feels that that is inappropriate because it is in a legal sphere, then I think it is fair enough that we have to have a look at these few cases that we have that are approaching legal arbitration.</p> <p>  To address the question of the afforestation of 8,000 ha and how long that will take to come to market, that is not really a constraint at present with regard to demand and supply.  We are in a happy position in Ireland in that we are one of the few countries in the European Union where our private supply of timber will double in the next five years.  It will double again ten years after that.  Following the investment that the State and private sector made in planting forests, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s, those forests are coming to fruition, which is great to see.  This industry will double in size and then double again.  To answer some of the questions that we have heard about employment, our challenge will not be sustaining 12,000 jobs but identifying people who can take on the next 10,000 jobs.  This is a good news story that we maybe need to make known a bit more.</p> <p>  On the question of Bord na M&oacute;na and rewetting, the science about the best thing to do with bogs is really quite complicated.  We try to follow the national peatlands strategy.  In this initiative with Bord na M&oacute;na, we need to make sure that we are only afforesting areas of bog that are appropriate for afforestation.  Where it is appropriate for them to be left alone for reasons related to carbon or biodiversity, then they need to be left alone.  Where it is appropriate for them to be rewetted, that should be done.  We are trying to strike the right balance between creating biodiverse natural wilderness forests and making sure that we do not disturb boglands and the carbon store.  Determining the best treatment is quite challenging but we are taking the best advice that we can.  This is a good news story about creating new wilderness forests for biodiversity.  We will be using seeds from birch and Scots pine so there will be a very natural looking feel to these forests.  It should be seen as a very positive move but we have to respect the ecological advice that we get.</p></speech>

Apparently the alder tree is very suitable for that.  I am no expert but we have been told this is how it is.  We could potentially look at combining the rewetting and planting into the rewetted bog because apparently these are very suitable.</p></speech>

Alder is a species that is very tolerant of wet ground and suitable for that.  If we are rewetting bogs, we have to understand why we are doing that.  If it is to try to recreate pristine bog, particularly with special areas of conservation, then the right treatment might not be to plant trees.  In areas where it is the right thing to do, then that is what we will look at doing.  A combination of both could be an attractive option.</p></speech>

I know that Mr. Carlin said earlier that for legal reasons he cannot comment on this.  I am not asking about the legal aspect but why it is taking so long for arbitration to go ahead with regard to partnerships where there are problems.  At our last meeting here, we asked if there were legal issues with the certification of the farm partnerships.  We were told that there were not.  The information that we have is that 20 legal letters were sent to Coillte by a Dublin law firm.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  While we got this two years ago when Coillte representatives were here, will the witnesses provide an accurate figure for the area Coillte has in circulation at present when the area used for wind farms or LIFE aid are removed?  My understanding is that there is not any.  Some of Coillte's areas, such as Galway with Paul Ruane, do good projects and are very helpful.  When Coillte is trying to work with the community in certain areas, the legal side can be very slow in getting agreements made.  Can that be improved?  As the witnesses touched on with Deputy Cahill, what happens where ash dieback has happened in a partnership and it has to be taken out?</p><p>Ash probably costs &euro;50,000 an acre at its prime.  Why are we putting in alder?  Why are we not putting in beech or something if an area is able to grow ash?  Why are we putting in a less valuable crop?</p><p> Much has gone on regarding environmental objections in a particular case, although I understand it is not Coillte's fault.  Will this mean a serious amount of money even for ordinary people who are planting because they will have to get an ecologist's report, an environmental impact assessment and all of this?  How much of a backlog will that cause?</p><p> Moving on to discuss the people in the farm partnerships that our guests mentioned, I would like the following clarified.  Did our guests say that Coillte has given &euro;17 million in premiums?  My understanding is that the Department pays the premiums.</p><p> Coillte has made a quite substantial profit and I congratulate our guests on that.  When a profit has been made and things are going fairly well, why have we not tackled these partnership problems, rather than heading for the courts, in some cases, and arbitration in others?  Why will someone not try to put a bit of a head on this, so to speak, and try to resolve it once and for all?  Coillte will probably have to use legal people.  Ordinary people who went into something in good faith will also have to use legal people.  Is it not crazy going to court?</p><p> In their opening statements, our guests said that Coillte had gone to the people, or partnerships based on management agreements, and that it is working with people the whole time.  Coillte has admitted that this was not the case, going back years, and that there were major problems.  Our guests also spoke about replanting.</p><p> Turning to bogs, Ms Hurley talked about carbon sequestration.  What does one acre sequester in a year?  What does an acre, or a hectare, sequester in a lifetime?  Others who were before the committee did not give such generous figures as those our guests spoke about today.</p></speech>

I do not have the specific legal information, I leave that to solicitors.  I understand it is moving towards an arbitration process.  Therefore, that is not a process of which we are in control.  It is moving towards arbitration and that means that we are asked for information, as is the other party, and we are moving through that.  We are not delaying and we want this to move through as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  We have 630 partners and 695 partnerships.  It is never great when any partnership ends up in the legal sphere, and we absolutely do not want this to happen, nor do we want matters delayed.  We want to get back on track with our partners, and if there is any other way out, through buy-ins and buyouts, we can look at that.  We are striving hard to do the right thing for ourselves and our partners.  There are no delaying tactics from us in this and we want it to move through swiftly, but we are in a process.</p> <p>  My understanding is that one case has gone to arbitration and six have consented to arbitration.  The 20 cases to which the Deputy refers are probably to do with freedom of information requests that we have received under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to outline what personal information we are holding.  That is the position, as I understand.</p></speech>

I understand that those letters are more to do with requests for information at this stage.  I do not know where they might go but that is their status at the moment.

At that stage, there was a European Court of Justice ruling that stated that Coillte could not avail of grants and premiums because of rules about state aid.  At that stage, the private sector was performing very well in afforestation and more than 20,000 ha per year were being planted.  That was very successful and it was felt at that point that the private sector could deliver on afforestation targets and it was not economical for Coillte to continue doing so.</p></speech>

It is now the goose that laid the golden egg.  That means profit, if we are to believe figures coming out of forestry, of &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 per acre.  Is that not better than all the grants in the world?  Grants, at best, would amount to 15 years multiplied by &euro;200 an acre, which is approximately &euro;3,000.  If Coillte is now replanting what it has cut, it does not have to mound an area again, so the costs associated with it are not nearly as much.  It is only a matter of gathering roots or windrows.  How is it that Coillte does not have to put money back in to increase its portfolio rather than standing still?</p></speech>

One is through more traditional commercial afforestration.  Grants and premiums will make this much easier to do because we do not have lands and must foot the bill for acquiring lands.  Grants and premiums put us in a position to do a lot more.</p><p>As Ms Gray mentioned earlier, it would cost &euro;15 million to do 4,000 ha but it would be done for much less, between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million, if grants and premia are involved.  We can do a lot more planting if we can acquire more land with grants and premia.  However, we are also considering contributing to afforestation using a non-commercial approach through Coillte Nature.  We will start by looking at 1,500 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na lands.  There are 15,000 ha of cutaway bog so this is an initial step in that regard.  We need to consider what else we can do.  As this is not Coillte land, we would need to work with the Department and Bord na M&oacute;na.  There are other potential State lands.</p></speech>

There are fertile areas of the country that will grow commercial forest.  We are competing for such areas with other forms of agriculture.  There is ground that is less suitable for commercial forest that could still grow forestry, and it is those areas that we need to work in.  That is what Coillte is trying to do.  We are trying to take a lead in that with the Department and Bord na M&oacute;na because those are areas where we can create new forests.  They will not be commercial forests but they will be very valuable for the State and from a biodiversity and climate point of view.  We are not saying we are moving away from the commercial model.  We still want to grow our portfolio in terms of commercial forestry, grow timber revenues, expand the industry and create new jobs.  The issue is one of striking a balance between those various areas.</p></speech>

In providing that timber if we make a return of more than 4%, as Ms Hurley has outlined, that gives us a pool of money available for reinvestment and increased afforestation.  One way or another, irrespective of whether we have grants or premia, it costs money to increase our level of afforestation, in particular where we do not have land.  If we do not make a return, which we can then reinvest, the State has to pay for it.  As the protector of the State's asset, we are trying to balance our commercial return with the need to reinvest that return in areas which will meet the State's national policy objectives.  What would make our life easier would be a national land use policy and a national forestry strategy such as Scotland had when it determined that it was prioritising forestry.</p></speech>

The discussion on climate change has accelerated in recent months never mind years and there is a recognition that we must take a different approach.  Forestry is no different.  The issues we have seen in Coillte are now becoming national issues and they need a national response.  Coillte can help in the national response but there must be a debate.  Land is scarce.

Either because the Government did not give Coillte grants or for whatever other reason, Coillte did not increase the amount of forestry so it is up to the private sector or else no one will do a bit extra.</p></speech>

Part of the reason we set up the forestry Ireland initiative is so that we understand the needs of the entire sector, not just Coillte, in terms of how all of those issues can be addressed.

There was one about the Derrybrien case and the impact it would have on the private sector.  We must be very mindful of this.  Coillte can bear some of this in terms of appropriate assessments and Natura impact statements, NIS.  We have the tools and the machinery to be able to do this, notwithstanding that there will still be an impact on us in terms of tougher regulation.  We need to work with and are working with the Department to apply these new regulations or new procedures in as light and smart a way as possible.  For example, we might need to move away from individual licences or individual NIS appropriate assessments into one that is based on our catchment area.  This would remove the need for an individual appropriate assessment for every individual licence.  Again, these are the discussions we are having with the Department in the context of how we can apply the new procedures as effectively as possible.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked a question about the &euro;17 million in premia.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019120300002#R02600"><p>Yes.  First, I think we are supposed to disclose any interests, whether in the Chamber or here.  For many years, off and on, I have worked for Coillte, as my father before me did.  I just wanted to let the committee know that.  I gave a lot of my time in forestry for Coillte.  I heard Deputy Penrose say there are now many Coillte workers everywhere in Ireland, but there was a time when there were maybe 18 or 20 of them drinking tea on one job together at 10 a.m. or whatever.  If there are now supposed to be 800 workers in Coillte countrywide, that is about 30 per county.  I do not think we have 30 Coillte employees in Kerry, the massive county that it is.  I think we are well short of that.  That is sad because there are many acres of forestry and ground in Kerry and a lot of work to be done.  I think one forester is covering all of Kerry, part of west Limerick and part of north-west Cork, even going into south-west Cork, whereas we once had a forester in Kilgarvan, two in Kenmare and one in Sneem.  I do not know how this could run rife with such a reduction in staff numbers.  That is my first concern.</p> <p>  My next concern is about contractors and harvesting, although I do not do that type of work.  I hear that so many harvesters are getting out and even had to go to England for work because of felling licences not being granted.  This is a very serious issue, even for people in the private sector whom Coillte helped with planting.  Families cannot extract the timber that is now ready to cut and take out because they do not have the roadways to do so.  There are two reasons for this, namely, the felling licence and objectors to the making of forestry roadways.  I would like to know what Coillte is trying to do to counteract this because it is very serious.  I think in February of this year there were objections to 144 roadways from one individual.  That is shocking.  As I said, that is having an effect on the work, the machines and everyone who is involved or has been involved in forestry over the years.  I refer especially the harvesting machines.  I believe people can pay up to &euro;400,000 for them.  These people are dependent solely on work on forestry by and large for Coillte and they are out of work because of the situation with the felling licences.  There is land available.  I heard the witnesses talk about purchasing and planting land.  There is a rule now in the Department that if someone wants to plant 100 acres, for example, 80 acres of that must be what is called green ground and the other 20% can be marginal ground.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice and I would know, however, many of the places that surround us consist of 80% marginal ground and 20% green ground.  We have been asking the Department for many years to reverse this or do something about it.  Then we would have more land available for planting.</p> <p>  People cannot operate without a grant.  There was a grant previously.  This is affecting Coillte in the very same way it is affecting private individuals.  Has Coillte been making representations to the Department on this?  It is at a standstill, as we can see.  Deputy Fitzmaurice quizzed the witnesses on activity over the past year or two.  If Coillte is unable to sell timber or get felling licences, the thing is held up completely.  That is where the problem is.  I know people who have been waiting for felling licences for 15 or 18 months.  That is absolutely ridiculous.</p> <p>  How many of the 800 workers are in offices?  I have no complaint about staff in offices - that work must be done as well - but what percentage of the staff is indoors as opposed to outdoors?  There is a need for outdoor staff as well.  In County Kerry I only know about three workers who are going around with bands, organising the work, overseeing contractors and so on.  Maybe there are a couple more there unknown to me.  I know there are people in offices who, as I said, do very real work - figures and accounting and so on - but there is a need for more outdoor staff and more Coillte foresters on the ground to oversee this.  If they spend all day on the road, they cannot give much time to forestry.  I know some of the staff and they are great.  I have worked with them.  They are Coillte people and their hearts and souls are in the company.</p><p>They could perform much better if they did not have to travel as much.</p><p> People who plant trees have another problem as well.  A man who comes to me for his couple of pints now and then told me that he did not get any money out of forestry.  His grant was for 15 years.  It will be, on average, another 15 years before he realises any income out of it.  At the same time, he is helping with the carbon situation but gets no allowance for that.  There is much talk about carbon and he says he is helping the situation.  We should help those types of individuals, as well as others who suffer because of storms.  We have always had storms going back to the 1850s and further.  I do not subscribe to the idea that climate change is caused by man, because such things have happened over the ages and centuries.  We have always had patterns of climate change.  However, people's plantations get windblown because of storms and they do not have the wherewithal to plant them again.  That has affected Coillte as well.  Has Coillte had any hearings with the Department on the issues I have raised or has it requested that it do anything about them?</p></speech>

As we outlined to Members earlier, Coillte has been in discussions with the Department on the overall policy required going forward, particularly with regard to felling licences.  Coillte is very conscious of the impact this issue has for both it and the sector.  It is in no one's interests for the current situation to continue and this is the number one issue for us.  We have had very high-level discussions with the Department about this over a continuous period of time, with further discussions this week.</p> <p>  The issue of-----</p></speech>

One is the length of time it takes to grant a felling licence.  The second is the process for hearing appeals and the number of appeals that arise, to which the Deputy has referred.  Both parts of the process have to be in sync and be robust.  However, there are delays with both parts of the process.  It is impacting on everyone, including Coillte, and the Department is very aware of it.  It is in everyone's interests to fix that issue.  We are trying to get over the immediate hump, but we also have to make sure that, going forward, the process deals with both the granting of licences on the one hand and the appeals on the other.</p></speech>

We are very disappointed that we are in this situation despite continued discussions with the Department since June of this year.  Resourcing within the Department is a matter for the Department.  We want to see an outcome from this, as do other parts of the sector.  We have done all we can to help the Department find ways to overcome the difficulties being experienced.  Our scheduled December auction for our partners in the sectors had to be cancelled due to lack of supply.  We are doing all we can to make sure our supplies can be maximised for next year, particularly in order for the auction to go ahead early next year.  That is all I can say about the felling licences as the matter now rests with the Department.  We have a strong interest in ensuring it is resolved, but equally, so does the sector.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the matter of employment, which is at the heart of this discussion.  He noted that while Coillte has 800 employees, it also has 1,200 contractors around the country.  In total, therefore, Coillte employs about 2,000 people between contractors and employees.  The Deputy also stated that, because of the way Coillte operates, he does not think enough staff or resources are being devoted to make sure it is working well.  However, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and Coillte has had a return of over 4% in the past two years of operation, which is the highest return it has ever made.  That is only possible because the staffing and resourcing model Coillte employs is fit for purpose, though there will always be gaps.  If Coillte performs well, it can also help the sector to perform well.  The 12,000 jobs in the wider sector are there only because Coillte is available to supply timber as required and provide pulp processing facilities for those operators in the sector.</p> <p>  I refer to the number of staff in offices.  I do not know whether the Deputy has ever visited Coillte's headquarters in Newtownmountkennedy.  The office is referred to as the lean centre because the number of staff is quite small and has been significantly reduced since four years ago for that purpose.  Coillte has focused on maximising the number of outdoor staff we employ.  We are trying to be as economical as possible with the State's money in terms of how we run the company, and that is part of our response.  Some would say we have been too tight - I am sure Ms Hurley will have views on that as the new chief executive - but we need to ensure whatever model we employ is fit for purpose.  It should not only be viewed in the context of Coillte itself, but also in the context of the impact Coillte has on the sector and the 12,000 jobs it can support elsewhere.  I will pass to Mr. Carlin to discuss plantation.</p></speech>

The major issue he raised regarding the harvesting contractors was felling licences, which Ms Gray has dealt with.  There is no doubt that this is a short-term challenge.  We have to recognise that, but the sector is very viable in the longer term.  The industry will double in the next five years and there will be fantastic opportunities for contractors to grow.  We are trying to ensure our contract is a five-year contract.  Gone are the days of a contractor only having enough work for the next few months and not knowing when it was coming.  We wanted to move into more of a partnership approach with our contractors.  That is very important.  There is a short-term challenge but the longer-term health of the industry is looking good.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a good point about marginal land, which is a real challenge.  How do we deal with the 8,000 ha?  What are we competing with?  There is so much competition for the land, but marginal land is available.  We need to look at what forestry model we need, which goes back to Ms Gray's point on the land use policy.  If we could identify areas of the country that were suitable for forestry, taking into account carbon, biodiversity and everything else, we could make sure our forest policy was well aimed and well aligned with the potential of the land.  We need to open our thinking a bit more in terms of bringing in more marginal land.  Equally, we have planted in organic soils and deep peats in the past where perhaps we should not have.  We need to bring fresh thinking to this area, and Coillte will contribute to that conversation and debate.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about planting a 15-year premium and then not getting any cash for 15 years.  This is a challenge for private owners and individuals, particularly when they come off premia.  Coillte is exploring whether it would be possible to allow the continuation of the premia to the end of the rotation, by bringing forward the value of the asset and paying it in annuities through the rotation of the crop, thus allowing farmers to access the capital as they go along.  That is something-----</p></speech>

This has been a hugely successful initiative, bringing 12,800 ha and 630 farmers into forestry.  Clearly, there have been some challenges with communications, engagement and the commercials, but we feel in a good position to be able to offer something like this, which I think would go some way towards dealing with the challenge Deputy Healy-Rae recognises.</p><p> To respond to Deputy's question about windblow, this is another challenge for a private individual, particularly if uninsured, if his or her crops blow down.  I believe there are reconstitution grants available, which is clearly the best approach for the individual to take, either insuring the crop or looking at reconstitution of those forests.</p></speech>

Ms Gray referred to the business, the number of employees, the number of contractors and the financial return.  One thing that has struck me is the fact that our forests have for a very long time - 20 years - been managed sustainably.  Everyone involved has employed very good forestry management techniques.  There is that real balance between the financial return and doing the right thing for the business and the forest.</p> <p>  I am equally struck by our need as a country to increase afforestation.  Deputy Healy-Rae raised a point about an individual who is off premia and is concerned as to whether he will be around to see the return.  It is important that Coillte and others look at models whereby forestry is attractive to people to enter and there is not a fear that at the end of premia, there is no other way of looking at their business model, as Mr. Carlin alluded to earlier.</p></speech>

I am the director of privacy for Apple in Europe, worldwide director of privacy compliance and the appointed data protection officer in Europe under the GDPR.  I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to them today on the important issue of voice assistants and the use of data.</p> <p>  Apple has been operating in Cork since 1980 and we are proud of the many contributions we make to the economy and job creation.  We employ 6,000 people in Ireland.  Over the last four years, we have spent more than &euro;1 billion with local companies, and our investment and innovation supports more than 27,000 jobs up and down the country.</p> <p>  We believe privacy is a fundamental human right.  Our approach to privacy is different from that of other tech companies.  We design our products from the ground up to minimise the amount of data Apple collects and we work vigilantly to protect our customers' personal data and give them control over their information.</p> <p>  Privacy is an issue larger than one company or one country, which is why we strongly support the GDPR and advocate for other countries to adopt similar approaches that deliver a highly effective and necessary framework.  During the committee&rsquo;s session last week, the discussion emphasised Article 25 of the GDPR, concerning privacy by design.  This is a core value and fundamental principle that Apple has embodied from the beginning.  Privacy is at the heart of every product and service we create, and we continually develop innovative technologies and techniques designed to minimise how much customer data we, or anyone else, can access while delivering world-class services to our customers.</p> <p>  Privacy by design applies to all Apple&rsquo;s services.  That includes Siri, Apple's intelligent assistant.  Like all our services, our goal with Siri is to create the best user experience while vigilantly protecting user privacy.</p> <p>  We introduced Siri in 2011 as an integral part of our products, helping users get things done faster and easier.  This includes tasks like making calls, sending messages, setting alarms, getting directions, finding photos and playing music and television shows, to name a few.  Like other Apple services, we minimise the amount of data Siri collects and use that data only to improve Siri.  We do not use Siri data to build a marketing profile, and we never sell it to anyone.  Our product is the technology we create, not the customer.</p> <p>  We have built privacy protections into Siri according to some core principles that demonstrate our comprehensive approach to protecting user data.  First, Siri uses as little data as possible to deliver an accurate result.  When a person asks a question about a football match, for example, Siri uses his or her general location to provide suitable results but if a person asks for the nearest supermarket, more specific location data is used.</p> <p>  Second, we design Siri to operate with the most sensitive data on a person's device instead of having to send everything through Apple servers.  For example, if a person asks Siri to read his or her unread messages, the content of the message never leaves his or her device and is not transmitted to Siri's servers because that is not necessary to fulfil his or her request.  This means that messages are not available to Apple or any other third party.</p> <p>  Third, requests made to Siri are not linked to a person's Apple ID, phone number or email address.  Instead, they are associated with a random identifier - a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device to keep track of data while it is being processed.  This is a feature we believe is unique among the digital assistants in use today.</p> <p>  As the committee heard last week, to improve voice assistants such as Siri, there is a need for human review of a very small sample of audio interactions.  This helps to ensure that Siri understands users' questions and provides the right answer.  For example, Siri has to recognise my Irish accent and all the members' accents, and members will understand the complexity if that is multiplied across the different languages, dialects, and styles of speech in the countries where we do business.</p> <p>  However, I want to be clear that human review of audio samples has always been conducted on a very small subset of audio samples from Siri requests.  The people reviewing the audio samples are not shown an Apple ID, phone number, or email.  As I mentioned earlier, all Siri requests are associated with a random identifier.</p><p> This August, customer concerns arose in regard to human review of Siri audio samples.  In response, we immediately suspended human review of Siri audio requests, reviewed our practices and policies, and released the following improvements to Siri&rsquo;s privacy protections.  First, by default, we no longer retain audio recordings of Siri interactions.  Second, users now have the choice to help Siri improve by learning from audio samples of their requests.  For users who choose to share their audio it is still only associated with the random identifier I mentioned earlier.  Third, if customers choose to help improve Siri, only Apple employees - not contractors - will be allowed to listen to audio samples of Siri interactions for the limited review purposes described earlier.  Additionally, our team will work to delete any recording which is determined to be the result of an inadvertent trigger of Siri.  Finally, there is now a "delete Siri and dictation history" option in settings that makes it easy for users to delete Siri requests that have been retained for six months or less.  </p><p> Our mission is to make products and services that enrich the lives of our customers.  Unlike others, we do not view our customers and their data as the product.  That is why we build privacy protections into everything we do.  It is why we intentionally limit our own access to customer data.  Our products and features include innovative privacy technologies and techniques designed to minimise how much of the customer's data we or anyone else can access.  We believe that users should control their data and they should understand how their data is used, stored, and protected.  That is the approach we bring to Siri and all the services we offer.  We do not sign in with the customer's Apple ID to use Siri and the customer's device processes as much information as possible without sending it to Apple&rsquo;s servers, and powerful security features help prevent anyone, except the customer, from being able to access his or her information.  We are constantly working on new ways to keep the customer's personal information safe.  We look forward to continuing our partnership to build on the GDPR's progress and strive for the highest standard of user privacy protection.</p><p> I look forward to answering members' questions.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager.  I am joined by my colleague, William Malcolm, who is a director in Google's privacy legal team.  We are very pleased to contribute to the meeting today and share some information on the Google Assistant product.  Launched in 2016, Google Assistant is designed to be a conversational experience across devices that helps users get things done.  Users talk to it to get results.  They can ask for information, schedule events and alarms, make reservations, or issue commands to control a device such as a smart light or music player.  The assistant responds with the most suitable answer or action.  The ability to interact with technology through a simple conversation is helping more users enjoy the benefits of online access.  Users speak in their natural language when talking to the assistant.  By the end of this year, the assistant will be available in 32 languages in 83 countries, including the ability to handle a wide array of accents.</p> <p>  Advances in speech recognition are benefiting many users for whom typing is a challenge: users with dexterity issues, including people with physical disabilities and older adults, but also users who struggle with literacy or who speak languages where alphabetisation is an issue.  In this sense, the Google Assistant represents the next stage in realising Google&rsquo;s mission to make the world's information accessible and useful for everyone.  For 20 years, Google has made many products that are advertising-supported and thus free for everyone.  It has done this while setting a high bar for transparency, control, and security.  Ad-supported business models have delivered tremendous benefits for users, including an array of world-class productivity tools, levels of security that were previously only available to large multinational corporations, and vast amounts of free publisher content.</p> <p>  When it comes to privacy and data, Google has long been focused on three core goals: transparency, control, and security.  We want people to understand their data, make the choices that are right for them, and be assured their data is safe.  We have introduced a variety of new products and tools to help users understand how their data is used, to be transparent, and to provide users with greater security and control.  This includes Google Account, the central destination to review and control privacy settings, and the privacy and security check-up.</p> <p>  Our policies continue to evolve.  Last year, we refreshed our global privacy policy to better describe the information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.  We also explain how users can update their settings and manage their account.  We now includes illustrations and animated videos to make the experience more engaging and understandable.  Over 500 million users visit this site every year.  Privacy is not one-size-fits-all, and we are focused on building tools that enable people to make the privacy choices that are right for them.  Different users want to make different choices about how much information they share and how it is used.  Tools like privacy check-up allow users to understand how their data is being shared, and through Google Account they can change how their data is used at any time.</p> <p>  Google Account is used extensively.  In 2018, 2.5 billion unique users visited Google Account.  Nearly 20 million people visit every day, demonstrating not only that users are aware of the tools, but they are using them regularly to make informed choices.</p><p>Despite these advances in privacy, our work in this area is never done.  We know the question of human transcription of audio recordings is of interest to this committee, and we want to share how Google approaches it.  As part of our work to develop and improve speech recognition technology for more languages, we use language experts around the world who understand the nuances and accents of a specific language.  The role of these language experts is to review and transcribe a small set of queries to help us better understand those languages to further improve our speech recognition technology.  In recent months, we have heard concerns about our use of language experts in this context.</p><p> When we learned about these concerns, we took steps to suspend this process of human transcription globally in order to investigate, and to conduct a full review of our systems and controls.  We have since communicated more information about how audio recordings work and some changes Google is making which include the following.  By default, we do not retain audio recordings.  This is already the case and will remain unchanged.  We do not store users&rsquo; audio data unless they choose to opt in.  Opting in helps the assistant better recognise a user&rsquo;s voice over time, and also helps improve the assistant for everyone by allowing us to use audio to understand more languages and accents.  Users can view their past interactions with the assistant on their Google Account page or My Activity page, and delete any of these interactions at any time.</p><p> We are making the involvement of human review more explicit to increase transparency.  We will roll out a change that gives existing assistant users the option to review their Voice and Audio Activity setting and confirm their preference on human language review before any such review of assistant user audio resumes.  We will not include new audio in the human review process unless users have confirmed the new setting, and of course users are free to decline.</p><p> We are enhancing privacy protections for our transcription process.  We already take a number of precautions to protect data during human review, for example, audio snippets are not associated with user accounts during the transcription process and language experts only listen to a small set of queries - around 0.2% of all user audio snippets - only from users who opt in.</p><p> We are automatically deleting more audio data.  One of the principles we strive toward is minimising the amount of data we store, and we are applying this to the Google Assistant as well.  We are also updating our policy to vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store.</p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on this important topic.  We believe in putting users in control of their data, and we always work to keep it safe.  We are committed to being transparent about how our settings work so that users can decide what works best for them.  We look forward to discussing our approach and welcome any questions committee members might have today.</p></speech>

This is helpful.  Our concerns were probably aroused by the information that came about as a result of the situation Mr. Davis talked about at Apple.  It was a surprise to many people that data was captured in this way, that it was stored, that it was later used and that it was reviewed by humans, albeit to enhance the user experience.</p> <p>  The biggest difficulty people have raised with me is that they were not aware that data was being captured at times other than when they used a particular word to initiate the capture of data.  In some cases, it was activated by the use of some other word.  We were not made aware that there was something that triggered an immediate closing down of the capture of the data.  Could the witnesses tell us what happens in an interaction where there is an inadvertent capture of data, where the wrong word is used and where it becomes clear, although maybe it does not, that the request is not a valid?  What have the witnesses succeeded in doing there?</p> <p>  Maybe I misunderstood him but Mr. Davis talked about data being stored for a considerable period of time.  He said it was possible for people to have it removed within six months.  For how long is this data stored?  After it has been reviewed, is it automatically deleted or destroyed?  We are all familiar with data that gets deleted, but is it ever deleted?  The same questions apply to Mr. Meade.</p> <p>  There is almost an overload in terms of users' capacity to opt in and opt out, to the extent that people get absolutely frustrated and in order to proceed, they press "Yes", "I do", "I will" or "Yes, please".</p><p>From Mr. Davis's perspective, legally, he is covered because everything has been opted into, accepted or whatever.  Does he not accept that with something as critical as the potential for capturing audio information that was not intended to be captured, it is incumbent on him to make the user more fully aware of the potential for that rather than having it as another tick box, another click or whatever?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, Siri has been available to our users since 2011.  It is a service that a user needs to enable.  It is not automatically on.  Since the very beginning, Siri has been a privacy by design feature.  It has always been the case that when one enables Siri, it is associated only with a random identifier generated by one's device, an identifier that Apple cannot link to one's identity.  The identifier is such that the things one says to Siri are not linked to one's name, Apple ID, telephone number, email address, or anything of that nature.  We worked extremely hard to ensure that Siri should just work in the way that the Deputy talked about, because we agree with him.  The user should get the very best privacy without having to make a choice or a setting choice.  </p> <p>  In response to the public concerns in relation to the audio grading-----</p></speech>

Is Mr. Davis saying that under no circumstances, whether a law enforcement request or whatever, Apple could find some key to trace that back, at a minimum, to the device, recognising that the device will present itself elsewhere using other codes that are connected with an email and a telephone number?</p></speech>

We adopt the exact same approach to every update to Siri.  We work to ensure that this association cannot be made, so I can certainly say to the Deputy that we have never been in a position to provide Siri data to any third party.  We cannot take a person's name or identity and feed it into our servers.  We cannot take an extract of a person's voice and feed it into our servers and produce a result.  We cannot do that because we set out to make sure we could not do that, and that is what we consider to be privacy by design.</p></speech>

That is processed on the device, so there is no transmission with our servers unless the device understands that the user wants to interact with it.</p></speech>

Misactivations or false accepts can happen, particularly where there is a lot of background noise, other noisy environments and so on, but importantly, in all the devices, we have tried to provide feedback to the users so they are aware that the device is recording.  We have also made it a lot easier for users to delete that recording, so one can simply say to one's assistant to delete what one just said.  It will be deleted and will no longer be there.</p> <p>  The other question the Deputy had was about deletion of data.  As I said, we have taken steps to automatically delete more data more quickly, and to make it easier for users to delete.  The third question the Deputy had was about users getting frustrated with the level of notices and so on.  That is a valid point and is one of the reasons we have put so much investment into developing the Google Account site where people can see in an understandable way what the settings are and adjust them - they can use that to opt out of a whole host of settings, including personalised advertising - and the privacy policy which we refreshed in the last year, again to move away from this idea of a wall of legal text into a more understandable scenario.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question was-----</p></speech>

We have a robust set of requirements internally that implement GDPR requirements, including producing, very early, technical design documents that look at the privacy features of devices.  A key principle with the assistant, right from the beginning, was making sure that individuals knew what voice data was recorded, and that they had access to it, that they could play that back, that they could delete it all, and that they could delete a single item.  We had opt-in consent to the collection of that voice and audio data right from the start.  It was really important to us that that transparency, that user choice, and that ability to delete the data existed from day one and that was a fundamental principle of the assistant when we launched it.  We very much look to put privacy by design at the heart of the assistant.</p> <p>  On notice, transparency and choice, I am very proud of the work the Google teams have done.  Our dashboards and tools are industry-leading, but we always accept we can do more and that is why we are looking at this issue of misactivations.  Is there more we can do to make users aware of how that occurs in our notices?  Also, is there more we can do to give users control over the sensitivity of the settings?  It is difficult in  environments where there is a lot of noise, and some microphones can mishear.  We acknowledge that but we are doing work to give users more control over the sensitivity of the settings, and to always put them in control of how that information is then retained and deleted.  Our teams have taken that very seriously with assistant from the beginning because they recognise that users using these devices need to place trust within them and trust with Google.</p></speech>

There was a report in <i>The Guardian </i>on 26 July of this year.  The headline read: &quot;Apple contractors 'regularly hear confidential details' on Siri recordings&quot;.  I am sure Mr. Davis is aware of that article.  It had to do with a whistleblower.</p></speech>

Is that accurate?</p></speech>

In fact, our grading programme is designed to identify those so that we can minimise it but maybe I will emphasise the point that a person's device is not listening him or her but it is listening for the words: "Hey Siri".  At that point, it will contact our servers.  It all happens on a person's device.</p> <p>  In terms of the precise things the whistleblower heard, I do not know precisely those elements but I go back to the point that that grader was not able to link those things to an identifiable individual.  Those are the protections that we have put in place.</p></speech>

What he said was that a number of different words that were picked up wrongly by the iPhone that would trigger Siri and that created a situation where there was inadvertent recordings. He said that they were only encouraged to report these accidental activations as technical problems and there was no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings, so we are talking here about conversations between doctors and patients, criminal dealings, and sexual encounters between individuals.  People want to know if these things happened.  If they happened, what precautions and what actions has Mr. Davis's organisation taken since then to improve on that?  He said there was no obligation on the staff to deal with them, other than having to report them as technical problems.  People would have concerns about that, so can Mr. Davis relay those concerns people might have for us?</p></speech>

As part of our statement that we issued at the end of August, we indicated that we would be putting in place a programme to identify more inadvertent triggerings of Siri and delete them where we hear them.  Where a grader would hear something of that nature now - they are all Apple-badged employees - they are under instructions to delete them when they hear them.</p></speech>

He said there is not much vetting of who works there - that is, the company that would be contracted to do it - and he said the amount of data that they are free to look through seems quite broad.  He said also that it would not be difficult to identify the person that they are listening to, especially with accidental triggers, because it could include addresses and names.  That is quite a stark thing for a person who works in that company to say - this whistleblower - and that would concern people.</p></speech>

We brought them in, and they have very clear instructions now in relation to the deletion of such inadvertent triggers, and we are working to ensure that we minimise them.</p></speech>

I did it very quickly because I have an iPhone.  When a person asks Siri if it is always listening, the response is that it respects a person's privacy, but only when the person is talking to it.  That is not quite correct, because if there are inadvertent recordings or listening, it is not as clear cut as that.</p></speech>

I did it myself before I came in.  I asked Siri if it was always listening, and it came back and said that it respects a person's privacy and that it is only listening when a person is talking to it.

That is the whole point.  There are words other than "Siri" that it picks up by accident or whatever.  It records instances where somebody clearly does not say "Siri", which is not the person's fault if, for whatever reason, the machine or the device itself picks it up wrong.  It is not factually correct to say that it is only listening when a person triggers the Siri system, because it is triggered as we know inadvertently.</p></speech>

Our aim is to ensure that Siri is only activated when it hears the words "Hey Siri", or if a person has activated it on his or her watch, when it is raised in a certain way, or if a person wishes, he or she can press a sequence of buttons.  A person can also disable "Hey Siri" if he or she wishes on his or her device.  That is a choice that we make available, but in the way of all things, as I mentioned earlier, we are trying to ensure that we pick the words "Hey Siri" up in all dialects and languages.  It could be that when they are pronounced by a person in a certain way, they may actually not be the words "Hey Siri", and it may be something quite close.  That is what we are working on as part of our grading programme to fix.</p></speech>

Would the witnesses agree with all the content in their submissions?  The Data Protection Commissioner's office referred to the capability of the witnesses' companies now to translate audio clips into text clips, effectively, and that was a central part to all the machine devices, be it Siri, Google Assistant or mobile phones.  Was the Data Protection Commissioner's office correct in the way it depicted the capability of the witnesses' companies to translate our audio into text?</p></speech>

If I ask Siri who won the football game last night, and I send that to our servers, those words are transcribed into text, and then that is the answer that is given back as to who won the game last night.  That is the only transcription of text that we are undertaking.</p></speech>

I can give a personal example.  I was in the D&aacute;il the week before last and I had a question for the Minister for Education and Skills during Question Time.  I was briefly in my office beforehand and we discussed questions for the Department of Education and Skills.  I went to the Chamber and got out my phone because I wanted to check something.  I tapped in D-E-P-T, and the second thing my search came up with was Department of Education.  The first thing was department store.  I can show it to the witnesses later.  The Department of Education and Skills is not the Department I usually work with, it is usually the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Why did my Google search show Department of Education?  I presumed it was because I had just spoken about the Department of Education and Skills and it heard that and translated it into my search.</p></speech>

The device is not always listening for whatever a person says.  It only listens if a person activates the assistant and there is an actual interaction with the assistant.  A person gets feedback from his or her device to show that he or she is actually interacting with the assistant.  There is no background listening going on or audio being transmitted to servers for that use.  It would be impossible for me to say why the Deputy got that particular result.  If I am right, the Deputy may have opted out of personalised advertising a few years ago, when we spoke about this before.</p></speech>

I should but the vast majority of people do not have a clue.  Google is taking for consent what is not consent.  When I open my Google search, what comes up in my Google feed is the ask Google Assistant.  I could easily flick that on.  I must have on that day because there is no other explanation as to why the Department of Education came up on my feed.  It must have been recording, or hearing, what I said.</p></speech>

All the activity that the Deputy considers may have been logged against his account will be displayed there and he can control not only what activity is captured but how it is used.  He can opt out of any number of settings within that.  We have tried to bring that into one place so it does not matter whether he changes devices.  If he gets a new device but using the same Google account, his settings will carry over and he can continue to look at them there.</p> <p>  We also have the privacy and security checkup again which gives people an opportunity every so often to go in and review their settings.  We are trying to make that situation easier for users so that if they do feel that they are not 100% sure about what they have opted in to there is one place they can go where they can see and control all of this.</p></speech>

Mr. Davis said that when questioned about a football match, for example, Siri uses one's general location to provide suitable results, but if one asks for the nearest supermarket more specific data is used.  What information does Siri pull in if it cannot process or understand that request?  For example, if one believes one is making a request about a nearest supermarket but in reality one is asking about a football match, would it not be the case that Siri accesses more information than is necessary to process that particular request?</p></speech>

Even if I want to find the nearest supermarket, restaurant or whatever else, and at that point we collect a more precise location, it is still only associated with the random identifier, the long string of numbers and letters, and it is not in any way associated with my identity, or in any way that we can work back to that.

In relation to bringing it in-house, that was in response to concerns from our customers who were concerned about things that they say to Siri being heard by human graders who were not Apple-badged employees, and so we took the extra step in order to attain the very high standards that we set for ourselves to bring them all in-house.

Do Google and Apple believe that users have a right to know the data that both companies hold on them and how they are profiled?  They talked about going on to Google and about the millions of users who do this.  As the witnesses heard from Deputy Ryan, many people are not aware, and certainly I would not be, of the profiles that the companies hold in relation to the data on users.  I mention an easily accessible one-stop shop.  Many users would be surprised to know the profiles that companies like Google and Apple have on them and how they use them to them help them, whether to know who won the football last night or what shops are nearby or for marketing and targeted ads.</p> <p>  My question is for Google and Apple.

There is a lot of data processing that takes place right here in a person's device without ever coming to our servers.  In circumstances where we do need to collect it, we try to collect it not associated with users.  Siri was an example not associated with the user.  If a person uses our maps service, it is not associated with the user.  Where we need to collect it - for instance, if a person is storing something in iCloud, or if he or she is downloading an app or playing a song as part of music - well then, yes, there has to be data on our servers, and we do have a central place where we make that available to our users at <i>privacyapple.com</i>and we get great feedback from our users in relation to it.  One needs to step through the various progressions in relation to how companies should work through this, but we certainly believe the first question a person should ask is why we even need to collect that data.</p></speech>

We obviously also strive for data minimisation, and are increasingly using technology to do more with less to generate those relevant results or other useful and helpful products for users without as much data collection.  I would encourage users to review Google Account.  We have made it available from more of our products now so we have a central button on each of the products.  If a person is in maps or in search, he or she can go straight to his or her Google Account and can see exactly what data is stored, and crucially the user can control it, so he or she can delete whatever is there or opt out of things like ads personalisation and so on.  That is available in a very user-friendly form and it has taken a big investment to make sure that it is presented in such a way that people can make use of it, and I think that is borne out by our usage figures.  With 2.5 billion users, that makes it one of our most popular products.</p></speech>

We all get the positives but it is about transparency around what Google is doing with people's personal data, maybe their children's data or maybe other people in the home who may not be using their sites but who are being potentially impacted by this.  When a person goes on to Google Account, can he or she see absolutely everything - all the profiles in relation to him or her and the data that Google has on him or her?  Can I see everything there?  Is there full transparency around it?</p></speech>

When I joined Google, that was one of the questions I was asked most commonly, "What does Google know about you?".

Mr. Malcolm is saying that people have Google Account, but if they want to find further information on what Google knows, they have to fill in a separate form, a subject access request form.  It is not that easy.  People's concerns are around the data and how it is used, and that is the reason Google and Apple are here before us today.  The concerns are about people's privacy and safety online, and how their data is being used.  If there is an understanding about it, some people may be very happy to give the information but when they have to start going through hoops to find out exactly what Google knows about them, that raises concerns for them.  I will go back to my original question.  Does Mr. Malcolm believe I have a right to access and know how I am being profiled and targeted in a very easily accessible way, without having to jump through a number of hoops?</p></speech>

I think that the account controls and the level of access we provide to the data that we hold is industry-leading.  That is not to say there is not more we can always do to improve the tool, but there is absolute transparency around the data we hold, and My Activity gives people that.  They can also exercise all the privacy choices that Mr. Meade set out.  We are absolutely committed to making those account tools a central repository where people can get the information.  The GDPR has very particular ways how one needs to respond and the form is really just there for those users who want to access their statutory rights in the correct way.  We respect that and we respect users' rights to exercise that statutory right, which is why we have made it really easy and intuitive via the troubleshooter.  The evidence is that most users find the experience through My Account to be easy and preferable.</p></speech>

There is a lot of alarm among the general public.  I do not want to repeat myself but I think if there was a very easily accessible route to find out how one was being profiled by what one was Googling, which can be very effective, and how one was being targeted, most people would be happy with that.</p> <p>  These companies have got the height of expertise to do this, and to make it more user friendly.  They would not then be pulled into Oireachtas committees.  We raised this with the Data Protection Commission last week.  We asked whether it has to carry out all these investigations and whether it comes to this in order to get change within the industry.  I am coming from the perspective of protecting the user, and at the same time acknowledging the great benefit that the Internet has.

On 19 November last, the D&aacute;il ordered that the Supplementary Estimates for the public services in respect of Vote 40 - Children and Youth Affairs be referred to the committee for consideration.  The select committee will consider the Estimates at today's meeting and report back to the D&aacute;il.  The committee is required to report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 12 December 2019.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and Dr. Fergal Lynch, Mr. Dermot Ryan, Ms Michele Clarke, Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher, Mr. Gerard Hughes, Mr. Gordon Gaffney and Ms Sinead McEvoy from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Thank you for your attendance.  The proposed format of the meeting is that we will deal with the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 40 which relates to subhead A.3, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The Minister can give an overview of the programme and the requirement for the Supplementary Estimate and that will be followed by members' questions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and guests to switch off their mobile telephones or put them in flight mode as not to do so will result in interference in our sound system and make it difficult for persons tuning into the proceedings to catch what we are saying.  Members have received a briefing document on the Supplementary Estimate.  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for making time available to consider our Supplementary Estimate for subhead A.3 of the Vote which provides funding to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The agency provides both universal and targeted services across a range of areas for children's protection, welfare and educational welfare as well as alternative care arrangements for children who experience domestic, sexual or gender based violence in their settings.</p><p>The additional funding in 2019 is due to cost pressures on non-pay elements of Tusla expenditure.  There are spending pressures across a number of areas, including legal costs associated with the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, but the main cost pressures in 2019 relate to the provision of residential care.  Children's residential services include the provision of special care, respite care services for children in foster care and centres that prepare young people to transition out of care to independent living.  Separated children seeking asylum are also provided for under Tusla's residential children's services.  While the majority of children and young people placed in residential care are there because of family problems, neglect or some other form of abuse, others are placed in residential care because their behaviour is too challenging to be managed in any other care setting.</p><p>Children's residential services are provided across 159 centres, of which 64 are either directly provided by Tusla or commissioned under the voluntary and community provision of services.  Where the existing residential care facilities operated by Tusla cannot meet the identified need of a child in care, a private company may be approached to provide an appropriate place.  Currently, there are 95 centres contracted under private arrangements, of which nine care for one child only.  At the end of September 2019 there were a total of 415 children and young people in residential care.  Of these, 245, or 59%, are provided for under private care arrangements.</p><p>I will outline the residential cost pressures.  Between 2017 and 2019, residential placements increased by 29% or 92 children and young people.  The average cost of each residential place, whether voluntary, statutory or private, is approximately &euro;6,000 per week or &euro;312,000 per annum.  Meeting more complex needs may incur even higher costs.  The cost of providing private and voluntary residential care has increased.  The private contract rate per placement increased in late 2018, principally arising from the requirement to meet rising insurance costs and staffing costs associated with ensuring staffing rosters comply with the European working time directive.</p><p>Staffing requirements are a key factor in the costs of all residential care settings.  Centres must have double cover, night cover at an appropriate staffing level regardless of the number of children in the placement.  Residential placement facilities typically accommodate from two to five young people.</p><p> The high cost and low supply of rental-sector housing also affect young people who have turned 18 in the care of Tusla, and this is now resulting in longer stays in alternative care arrangements.  The number of aftercare placements for those over 18 completing secondary education and the IRPP, and other separated children coming to Ireland at a later age, such as 16 or 17, means there is a requirement for integrated supports.  There has been an increase in this regard also.</p><p> Children's residential services aim to provide physical, emotional and psychological safe space in which children and young people can heal, develop and move forward in their lives.  This is very expensive but our most vulnerable children must be protected and receive the services they need.</p><p> The total cost pressures on residential, legal and other areas of Tusla activity resulted in a figure of &euro;27.6 million in 2019.  In previous years, Tusla managed to contain these pressures by way of time-related savings across other areas of its expenditure.  In 2019, however, this proved more problematic.  Tusla has managed to reduce the overrun to &euro;23.6 million by cost-containing measures, particularly by using &euro;4 million from its 2019 capital allocation.  Capital projects impacted by this will be progressed in 2020 instead.</p><p> In addition, savings of &euro;8 million across other areas of my Department's Vote have been found to help meet the Tusla overrun.  As a result, the Supplementary Estimate required for my Department has reduced to &euro;15 million.</p><p> In the course of my discussions with Tusla, I have been concerned about the impact of costs being met by Tusla, particularly relating to persons over 18 years old, that might otherwise be met or shared by other State bodies.  Tusla has managed to absorb these costs in previous years but can no longer continue to do so.  I am keen to pursue this with my colleagues at ministerial level and I have already initiated contacts in this regard.  Ultimately, these are costs that have to be borne by the State.  However, if Tusla is increasingly incurring costs that should be borne elsewhere, it will limit its resources to meet the needs.</p><p> I recommend the Supplementary Estimate and will be happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

On the figure of &euro;6,000 per week, I would welcome a further breakdown.  The Minister stated it is the average cost of each residential place and that it is across voluntary, statutory and private providers.  It would be very useful if the Minister could provide to us a breakdown.  How is the metric of &euro;6,000 arrived at?  What percentage of it is attributable to insurance?  What proportion of the cost is attributable to the cost of renting private property?  What is the real-time metric for staffing costs?  I have some sympathy in that there are quite a number of children with very complex needs but the figure of &euro;6,000, or &euro;312,000 per annum, seems extremely high.  It would be useful to have a breakdown or a further perspective from the Minister on the justification for those costs.</p></speech>

I do not have the breakdown he asked for in terms of insurance and staffing costs.  It may be possible to get those data.  What we do have is just the average cost, as I have already described.</p> <p>  With regard to the cost of renting private facilities, but not so much the cost of insurance, I understand there is not a significant difference between costs incurred by Tusla and the voluntary and community providers by comparison with the private providers.  The exception is where a facility may be able to have only one child, two children or four or five children, depending on the level of need of the children there.  Even though the numbers of children may vary, I understand that there still needs to be a similar level of cover in terms of staff.  That is one of the challenges, I believe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#B00500"><p>One would always appreciate that.  One always appreciates that there is a ratio of staff to children.  That is a given and it is widely understood in every context where one is dealing with children.  If in parsing a figure of &euro;6,000, the Minister is saying it is across residential, voluntary, statutory and private providers, and if a certain number of private companies are offering the service, how much of the &euro;6,000 is for profit in private facilities?  The private providers are obviously offering the service because the State is not in a position to do so.  How much do the private companies have the State over a barrel - I do not mean that in a pejorative way - because of the lack of supply of State-funded facilities for the provision of services to children with complex needs and children who need residential placements?  I do not deny that we need to use private companies where there is a lack of supply in the public sector but I am worried that it is always possible to make a charge that private companies can profiteer in providing such a service.  That is my worry.  A figure of &euro;6,000 per week, or &euro;312,000 per annum, is an extraordinary amount of money.  That is why I asked the question about the breakdown in the first instance.</p> <p>  If we are involved in an Estimates programme here &mdash; it is one of the few powers we have as Deputies in terms of interrogating the Estimates, especially where a Supplementary Estimate is sought from the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; it is vital that we have a breakdown of the &euro;6,000 and that we have more oversight in respect of how much the private providers are actually earning as private providers of what is essentially a vital service that nobody would deny to any child.</p></speech>

I do not have the more specific breakdown the Deputy requested but we can provide it later.  I have mentioned already some of the differences in a private facility.  A private facility can react more quickly to make space available.  I already indicated the numbers of private centres versus Tusla-run or voluntarily run centres.</p> <p>  The figure I gave was an average but I also have information suggesting that Tusla services can, at times, be more expensive than private services.  I understand the Deputy's question on the profit issue.  The reality is that we do have private companies providing the services.  It is acceptable that private companies look for a certain amount of profit but I understand the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am sure she and her officials will provide the response through the secretariat, so that all Members can benefit.  Perhaps, on foot of Deputy Sherlock's questions, an exercise in transparency might be undertaken within the Department to see whether this sort of information would be forthcoming, but I accept the point the Minister made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#C01100"><p>My questions are not dissimilar to those asked by Deputy Sherlock.  I take umbrage at the word "average".  I am trying to work out the cost of having a child in a Tusla service compared to having one in a private residential service.  As far as I am concerned, "average" is too broad a term.  I am trying to ascertain which provides the best value.  I accept the Minister is going to provide us with that information, but she can understand where we are coming from when we hear the word "average".  It is a fair understanding.  I was doing the sums and &euro;2.5 million a week could be spent to provide the support, which nobody denies is needed, but we are asking if subbing it out provides the best value for money or if there should be more investment in residential care provided by Tusla.  The questions are based on a planning perspective going forward.  What I said is more of a statement because I know the Minister is going to provide the information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#C01200"><p>That is correct.  I have also said I completely understand the request.  I have indicated that sometimes the Tusla service is more expensive.  My information is that is because sometimes the people who are working in those settings are effectively on a higher pay scale.  That is information I can provide to the committee.  A further breakdown has been sought, which is reasonable.  It will be interesting to see how that works out.  Is it a question of comparing a private provider with Tusla or is it the case in certain centres that it costs more because there are fewer children with more complex needs, as distinct from it costing more in a Tusla centre versus a private one?  That is what I was trying to say earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#C01300"><p>It is also a question of capacity and whether we are using our centres to full capacity.  I accept there are costs attached to running a centre but only one child might use it when there is capacity for three children and the costs might be as much for one child as for three children.  Are Tusla centres being used to their full capacity before we outsource to the private provider?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019120300002#C01400"><p>My information is that, in some cases, children need to be cared for in individual settings in light of the requirements of their circumstances and who they are.  In my opening statement I referred to nine children who are currently being cared for in individual settings.  That is because professional practice, regulations and quality provision are being followed.  Unfortunately, that is the case.</p> <p>  I wish to add another point because it is relevant to the wider context of the questions.  In light of the overall work provided by Tusla for the protection and care of children, the number of children who are going into care is reducing but their needs are increasing and they are more complicated.  The cost issue, as it stands, seems to be largely due to the complexity of their special needs and requirements.</p></speech>

No data concerning efficiency are available from 2014 to 2018.  I refer to the conclusions and key findings in the report.  Between 2014 and 2018, it states insufficient data were collected on the level of expenditure and the number of staff at the service programme level for the years 2014 to 2018 to allow for an evaluation of the efficiency of the services provided by Tusla and that Tusla will try to have more accurate data from 2019 onwards.  I am concerned that we have no information on value for money for those four years.</p></speech>

I referred to the conclusions and key findings relating to efficiency.  I am concerned because any organisation that receives funding says that it has to do its paperwork and comply with red tape.  A great deal of information is required of them and they must answer many questions, rightly so.  Yet, there is a lack of data available from Tusla for four years, and it does not seem to be doing anything to try to rectify this.  It says it will have the data from 2019 onwards, but we do not have the figures concerning efficiency for four full years.  The report was done by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am surprised if the Minister does not have it or has not seen it.  My question is why we do not have the information or why Tusla is not going to go back over those four years to provide information.  The funding of any other organisation would be stopped immediately and funding would not be provided until it had all its ducks in a row.  Tusla is off the hook for four full years in terms of providing us with information.  I am concerned about that.</p></speech>

I am very happy to come back to her with information.  Members will be aware that in recent years there was a major investment in the ICT system and practices were standardised.  It may be that the data are now being collected in that context, but they may not yet be fully integrated to provide the analysis sought by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform given the reference to the lack of data.  The position has significantly improved following the introduction of the national childcare information system, NCCIS.  We will take a look at that to see if there is a further reason for that.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation.  I have been asked to talk about the role of the Department with regard to general reforms of the Civil Service, public procurement, the overall public expenditure framework, and in budgetary matters.  These are quite wide ranging and one could spend a lot of time on each item.  I will try to address a flavour of each of these and I look forward to hearing the views of the committee afterwards.<br/><br/>The Civil Service comprises 14 Departments and a number of major offices, including the Revenue Commissioners.  It carries out a broad range of functions and roles from developing policy to delivering front-line public services.  My Department's role in respect of the reform of the Civil Service is to lead and support changes that will assist Departments and offices to improve how they work so that they effectively deliver on their remits as set out in their statements of strategy.  The implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan has increased our capacity and capability to deliver an improved service to the State.  The programme was developed to create a more unified, professional, responsive and open and accountable Civil Service.<br/><br/>The fourth report was published in May and is available on our website.  I will take a few minutes to highlight some of the reforms for the benefit of the committee.  Reforms to make the Civil Service more unified include the development of a common governance standard for the Civil Service.  I recall the Chairman raised the lack of a common approach to governance across Departments with me in his previous role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have developed a common standard, which should hopefully help to ensure that Secretaries General, leaders and managers in offices and Departments know exactly what their obligations are in respect of governance of organisations.<br/><br/>Another reform is the implementation of the shared services programme, which covers a variety of different areas such as HR and payroll, the public procurement transformation programme, and financial management shared services at the project stage.  On the professionalisation of the Civil Service, the launch of the Civil Service people strategy, led by my colleague, Mr. David Cagney, sets out the strategic direction for HR across the Civil Service.  This strategy aims to position HR as the driver to enable the delivery of three priorities.  We want the Civil Service to be an employer of choice that can attract the best talent to help us to deliver on our services.  The second priority is building the workforce of the future, which is critical, given the demographic and other challenges which impact on workforces in the public service and elsewhere.  The third is building, supporting and valuing managers as people developers.<br/><br/>The strategy builds on initiatives in place, especially with regard to project management, performance and development, to talent management and open recruitment.  Since the end of the moratorium in 2015, more than 14,600 civil servants have been assigned to Departments and Government offices.  This is offset by retirements and other departures so it is not an increase in the net number.  Approximately a third of the staff complement have been recruited since then.  This reflects the enormous demographic changes throughout the Civil Service.  Offices and Departments have been dealing with normal demands and having to manage this demographic transition and bringing a new generation of people into the service.  The Civil Service people strategy is also strengthened by the establishment of OneLearning, which is a new learning and development service for civil servants.  There have been approximately 27,000 attendances to date at the OneLearning course across 25 counties and 45 Civil Service bodies since its establishment in September 2017.  A new ICT-based learning management system has been implemented for the majority of public servants across the country.  This is an attempt to centralise and professionalise learning and development across the Civil Service whereas in the past we had a somewhat devolved, <i>ad hoc</i>approach where individual offices and Departments did their own thing.  We have centralised to maximise the benefits from centralisation and to have a more professional approach.<br/><br/>Over the past few weeks, the Civil Service excellence and innovation awards, which recognise excellence and innovation, were announced by the Minister.  Some 90 nominations were received across many different categories.  The standard of projects was particularly high, giving a strong sense of the important, diverse and challenging work that is happening across the system.  They also showcase the creativity and innovation that is being brought to bear by those on the front line to deliver better services to the public.  My colleague, Dr. Lucy Fallon-Byrne, is with us and one of her responsibilities relates to excellence and innovation across the Civil Service.  This is an important event to reward innovation and creativity.  Having an event such as that can be a great spur.  It is not just about people being nominated on the night and winning but about creating a culture of innovation across organisations and recognising those who do the best in their fields.<br/><br/>Reforms have also been introduced to make the Civil Service more responsive.  These reforms include the delivery of the public service ICT strategy and the implementation of mobility arrangements.  There has been significant interest in the mobility scheme with approximately 4,800 staff members making an application.  More than 350 moves have completed to date.  When we were developing the first Civil Service renewal plan, one thing we received from civil servants across the country was that there was an unwillingness, in part, for people to be allowed to move to different offices and Departments.  Colleagues would be stuck in particular areas when they wanted to move and there was not a sufficient mobility scheme.  We have put a scheme in place which is making a difference.  The response is encouraging so far.  We are implementing a more strategic approach to workforce planning approach across the Civil Service, which Mr. Cagney leads on.<br/><br/>The fourth stream relates to making the Civil Service more open and accountable.  We conduct organisational capability reviews to assess the impacts of reforms on Departments.  We have developed the national data infrastructure, which I will talk about later on, to improve how we use data across the Civil Service and public service.  We hold more open policy debates on a variety of issues to engage with experts and others to allow them to provide input on policy.  We have improved communications and engagement with staff, including the implementation of the open data initiative.  I do not have time to speak in detail about all of these initiatives.  I would like to mention briefly the open data initiative, the Civil Service employee engagement survey and the Civil Service customer satisfaction survey.<br/><br/>The benefits of open data are well documented, including allowing for greater transparency and trust in government and facilitating business innovation and efficiency.  Ireland has made substantial progress in its national open data initiative since it was instigated in 2014 and is now leading the way in Europe, having been ranked top in the European Commission's open data maturity survey for 2017 and 2018.  I believe we have been at the top for the past three years.</p></speech>

It is a very positive initiative.  Much of the data are used in various new apps that help people to access services more widely.</p><p> The first Civil Service employee engagement survey was carried out in 2015 and the second one was carried out during 2017.  The results were published in early 2018.  Of the 24 areas surveyed, 22 showed improvements in the most recent survey.  The results indicate that overall employee engagement remains high at 72%.  This result compares well with other administrations across the world.  The findings indicate that the majority of staff have a sense of energy and connection with their work, that they can cope with the demands of their job, and that they find their work fulfilling.  The results confirm that we are doing well in a number of areas but highlight where we need to focus our efforts in the future.  For example, we need to provide opportunities for greater levels of involvement, create a more innovative culture, address performance issues and improve the public perception of the work of civil servants.  </p><p> It is quite interesting that, when we asked civil servants whether they valued their own work, they said they did but, when asked whether they feel their work is valued by citizens, they did not.  We then asked citizens whether they valued the work of the Civil Service and found that they do and that they rate it very highly.  The difference between civil servants' perception of how citizens perceive them and the reality is interesting.  </p><p> The committee may also be interested to know that last week we published the results of the 2019 Civil Service customer satisfaction survey.  Running regular surveys of customers to more fully understand our users' experiences is a key commitment in the Civil Service renewal plan.  This is the eighth survey carried out among the Irish public.  It determines satisfaction levels with services received from Civil Service Departments and offices.  It also surveys more general perceptions of, and attitudes to, the Civil Service.  The results of the customer satisfaction survey show a very positive trend in terms of overall satisfaction with service provision and outcomes.  </p><p> I will highlight just a few statistics from the survey.  Some 85% of customers surveyed were satisfied with the service received from the Civil Service.  These are people who engaged with the Passport Office, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills or other Civil Service offices.  It refers only to the Civil Service, not the wider public service.  This figure is an increase from 83% in 2017 and 76% in 2015.  The same percentage of people were satisfied with the outcome of their most recent contact with the Civil Service and 89% of customers indicated that service levels are mostly meeting, or exceeding, expectations.  Some 87% were satisfied with both the knowledge and helpfulness of staff and the public&rsquo;s perceptions of Civil Service efficiency, trust, independence and equality have also all improved since 2017.  Based on this survey, almost 70% of citizens in Ireland have a high opinion of the Civil Service with regard to trustworthiness, competence, independence and so on.  We are very happy with that result but, of course, we need to do better and to improve upon it.</p><p> We are now reflecting on what has been achieved and what we need to do to support the future development of the Civil Service and to ensure that it can play a more effective role in meeting the needs of the Government and the public.  We will develop a long-term strategy for Civil Service renewal.  We are now engaged in a process of consultation and will welcome engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.  We will welcome input on the next phase of the plan.  </p><p> I would like to briefly mention the reforms of the wider public service that have been undertaken since 2011.  I have already mentioned the establishment of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to drive ICT.   I will speak shortly about the Office of Government Procurement where Mr. David O'Brien is involved in reforms.</p><p> The current framework for public service reform and innovation is entitled Our Public Service 2020.  It builds on earlier reforms while expanding their scope to focus on delivering better services for our customers, as well as building innovative and responsive organisations.  It puts focus on evaluation, the importance of building a reform culture, and developing indicators to support outcomes.  A public service leadership board, on which Secretaries General and CEOs sit, has been established to implement this agenda.  This group involves myself, other Secretaries General, the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff, the head of the Health Service Executive and others.  It is the first time we have had a forum for Civil Service and public service leaders to meet regularly to talk about issues around HR, innovation, data management and so on.  It is a useful forum and we will see how it helps to deliver in the future.  </p><p> I will now turn briefly to public procurement, which is the second item on the agenda.  A division within my Department leads the procurement reform process, sets out the overarching public procurement framework, manages the Government&rsquo;s eTenders platform, engages with and communicates to the large number of stakeholders who are tendering for public service jobs, and provides support and advice to public bodies and suppliers.  This is one of the areas in which there has been a lot of change.  The procurement service is now a centre of excellence.  Colleagues in different Departments and office come to Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues to seek advice on procurement solutions.  This division also delivers these solutions for public bodies, largely through central arrangements such as framework contracts. </p><p> It is important to state that, while the office and its sector partners in health, education, defence and local government put these central arrangements in place for common goods and services, the individual public bodies are responsible and accountable for the contracts awarded under these arrangements.  We provide a service but the Secretary General is still the Accounting Officer responsible for the management and delivery of the service procured.  The work of the Office of Government Procurement brings a strategic focus to procurement, drives value for money, enables compliance, supports business participation and promotes transparency. </p><p> This year to date, the office has established 17 framework agreements with a total value of &euro;3.6 billion, bringing the overall number of framework agreements currently in place to over 130.  During the year, the office also conducted 800 mini competitions, with an estimated value of &euro;654 million on behalf of 222 public bodies.  </p><p> This commitment to better public procurement is also underlined by the ongoing development and communication of the overarching policy framework, which is a comprehensive suite of guidance for public bodies.  With regard to e-invoicing and e-tendering, a significant digital development in 2019 has been the Office of Government Procurement's support for the e-invoicing programme.  The e-invoicing directive has been transposed into Irish legislation and appropriate solutions were available for public bodies through a services framework in time for the implementation date in April of this year.  This has delivered a flexible range of solutions for a variety of finance functions across the public sector.  The outcome of this is apparent in the fact that 85% of central government bodies were compliant within months of the implementation date.  The adoption of e-invoicing in the public sector will facilitate the digital transformation of how public services process the more than 4 million invoices that are currently processed on a paper basis annually.  At the moment, we receive millions of invoices, which are manually checked against purchase orders before a direction as to whether to pay the invoice is given.  With e-invoicing, this will be done automatically, which will have a number of benefits including reducing processing cost and improving accuracy.  The hours spent on this matter will reduce.  It is a very significant reform which, over time, should bring significant benefits to the public sector.  </p><p> I will now turn to the final area, which is the overall public expenditure framework, public expenditure reforms, and the role of our Department in respect of budgetary matters.  The Department, with the Minister, has responsibility for the overall public expenditure framework to support the management of expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, rational and balanced manner to support Ireland&rsquo;s economic development and social progress.  This includes developing central policies and guidelines in respect of public expenditure.  The implementation of this framework, and in particular the management of expenditure within the allocations voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is a key responsibility of the line Departments and relevant Accounting Officers.  </p><p> A sustainable expenditure policy needs to meet certain key requirements including ensuring that the overall level of expenditure remains affordable over the longer term and delivering sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  This requires that growth is set at a level that is consistent with the long-term growth potential of the economy and that there is an ongoing focus on the quality of spending.  To ensure sustainability, these two elements of the framework are necessarily interlinked.  </p><p> The reforms to the framework implemented in recent years seek to embed sound expenditure practices that maintain a focus on the totality of spend rather than the incremental amount added each year.  Key elements within this suite of reforms include performance and equality budgeting, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, and the spending review process.   </p><p> The objectives of the spending review for the period from 2017 to 2019 have been to create a larger stock of relevant analysis and evaluation across all Departments and offices, to underpin continued prudent allocations of expenditure, to identify areas of existing expenditure that require ongoing analysis, to spotlight areas of innovation and good practice, both in programme design and delivery, that will be of wider interest and applicability and to provide an evidence base in respect of departmental spending that informs the choices made on budgetary allocations.  These objectives have been largely achieved.  Nearly 80 papers have been produced and published.  Over the three years of the process, the level of engagement across key line Departments and agencies has increased.  The process is aligned to the Estimates process, with publication of papers in July by the Minister allowing the findings from the reviews to feed into budgetary discussions.</p><p>Significant momentum has been developed and it is intended to continue the process in 2020 and beyond.  This provides an enormous wealth of information and data analysis of spend, the efficiency and the effectiveness of spend, which can guide decisions in any given year and into the future.</p><p> As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, an updated public spending code will be published shortly before Christmas or in the new year, focusing on improving appraisal, cost estimation and the management of infrastructure projects.  This updated guide will better align the realities of project delivery with decision gates at each stage of the project cycle to ensure full consideration of the costs, risks and benefits of each investment.  The guide will be supplemented by a new governance and assurance process for major projects, estimated to cost more than &euro;100 million.  This new process will involve an independent, external review of projects at key stages in the project life cycle.  It is being developed by my Department and will come into effect in 2020.</p><p> In this statement, I have sought to set out some details of the work my Department is undertaking in respect of the items on the agenda for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We have made considerable progress in these areas since the Department was established in 2011.  I am proud of the work of my colleagues in the Department in this regard and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment to this significant and collective effort.  As I have set out, we have ambitious plans for the future.  I would like to highlight that my Department is currently preparing a new statement of strategy to cover the next three years.  I would be happy to receive the views of the committee in terms of priority areas to be addressed in that strategy.</p></speech>

I want to start by asking him some questions on the procedure whereby Deputies claim travel and accommodation allowance and if he has a view on the way the system currently operates, which is that Deputies have to fob in for 120 days, in which case they are entitled to the maximum allowance, depending on their band.  There is no system in place to ensure it is the Deputy who is fobbing in, as opposed to a member of their staff or another Deputy.  Is that something Mr. Watt has a view on?</p></speech>

I believe the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission who are responsible for ensuring procedures are put in place in order that money is spent correctly and people claim their due entitlements.  I have nothing to add to that matter.  It is a matter for the Accounting Officer in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</p></speech>

This system is used by both staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas and Deputies.  When the staff clock in, it records the time the staff clock in at, clock out at and so on.  I have requested my own records but it seems that for Deputies, the time is not recorded.  At some point, a decision was made somewhere to request that this recording of time was not included in the system that was procured from FlexTime.  Unfortunately, that makes it more difficult to establish whether Deputies were fobbing themselves in and then leaving to go to whatever place or country, or whether they had someone else fob in for them.  Does Mr. Watt have any insight or information about how that decision was made?</p></speech>

I presume the flexitime system is the same system we have across other offices and Departments.  We can check that but I imagine it is the same system that operates in our Department.  Many staff have to clock in and clock out and a record is kept of that.  That is used for attendance management by HR and line managers.  It is a system that has been in place for a long time.  In our Department, a record is kept because that is required to reconcile flexitime allowances and so on and I would guess it is the same for staff in the Oireachtas.  Mr. David Cagney knows more about it that do I but if people infringe on that, a conversation with the HR manager follows and so on.  I have nothing further to add on how Deputies go about their business or about how this place operates.  I have nothing whatsoever to say on that.  I would like to stress it is independent of us.  We are reminded each year that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is independent of our Department.  I would probably be fired if I said anything.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn had served on that committee for a number of years and he made his decision to move off that committee.  Mr. Quinn is busy managing a large organisation of 300 people and he has many different responsibilities.  He had made his contribution.  As the Deputy knows, the procurement process for the hospital had reached a certain stage and at that stage I think Mr. Quinn felt it would be best for others to step in and make a contribution.  He has made his contribution.</p></speech>

The Official Report of this committee and of the Committee of Public Accounts is a written record and it shows our views on this project.  There was a two-stage process, which is unusual and that reflected the scale of the project.  There were major flaws in how this two-stage process was managed, that in effect it was thought that the estimate was based on a final specified detailed design.  It turned out that was an outline design that was not complete.  The subsequent bill of quantities when it came to the guaranteed maximum price was out by some quantum.  That explains the cost overruns from the &euro;1 billion plus to the figure that was subsequently disclosed to the committees.</p> <p>  The two-stage process was unusual because we usually go for a fixed price lump sum contract but because of the complexity of this hospital, which is three times bigger than the last hospital we built, Tallaght Hospital, a two-stage process was agreed as the procurement approach.  As we said at the time that was not a wrong decision but what went wrong was the implementation of that approach: a decision was made on a cost based on what turned out to be a fairly outlined design when it was understood that was a detailed design.  There is more to it but in summary that is the main issue that arose.</p></speech>

The thrust of what Mr. Watt is getting at when it comes to the Civil Service changes or reforms has to do with making the Civil Service more attractive to people from the outside.  There is some irony in the fact that a few years ago Mr. Watt came before the Committee of Public Accounts and famously said one of the big problems in recruiting and attracting people to the Civil Service was appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts because in some cases people were not willing to do that.  Does Mr. Watt think it has improved since then now that Deputy McGuinness is no longer the Chairman?</p></speech>

I do not think the point I was making was a controversial comment and I do not think Deputy McGuinness or other members necessarily agreed with it.  It was that for many potential candidates taking up leadership positions in the Civil Service and public service while they do not mind doing the job, the accountability or appearing at a forum like this, there have been many occasions when the way people were treated, not just at the Committee of Public Accounts, did not make the positions attractive.  I know this from having conversations with my colleagues to try to encourage them to go for these jobs.  We might dismiss that and say it is of no concern but that is the reality.</p></speech>

That might be a controversial thing to say, but probably not.

When we have conversations, people say that the potential reputational risk is not worth it because of the potential for something to go wrong.  Things always go wrong.  Mistakes will be made but it is a question of the way those mistakes are dealt with it.  It is more a "gotcha" culture as opposed to what we call a learning culture.  We focus on trying to learn from mistakes and encourage people to do better to try to be innovative.  A gotcha culture does not encourage that.  It encourages all the wrong habits.  Unfortunately we do have a gotcha culture when it should be a learning culture.  That is not to say that people should not be accountable and there should be sanctions for people who make mistakes.  If they make several mistakes there are sanctions of course but we do need to look at things in a different way.  I do not think it has improved.</p></speech>

Can he explain that?  I ask because in my time here I have come across people who I would have thought would be better off doing something else in a different Department.  They probably would have agreed with that but they found it quite difficult to make that move.  How is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform improving that? </p></speech>

We now have a system which goes across different grades and geographical areas so that people can apply to different offices and Departments in the same area.  In effect this is a response to the town hall meetings with staff where somebody in Department X in a particular location felt his or her career was stuck but there might have been opportunities for advancement in another Department that would better appreciate his or her skills. There was no sophisticated system of transfer.  They had to identify somebody who would go the other way, a partner as it were.  This system uses IT so people express an interest in moving then moves or advertises, and managers can fill the place.  It is an attempt to be much more strategic and use the IT to enable those transfers.</p> <p>  It can happen that somebody is in a career and feels stuck and somebody in another office feels the same, if he or she can move, everybody can be happier.  There were 350 moves in the most recent tranche.  It is a bit too early to say definitively but the feedback is quite positive.  It is a challenge for managers who may not want somebody very good to move but for the good of the system they have to co-operate with those transfers.</p></speech>

The only circumstance where they would not go is where there was a clear disciplinary issue or a process in which they were involved.  We would not foist that type of situation on another manager.  The system was designed in co-operation and consultation with HR managers across the system so they kind of own it.  To date they are very happy with it.</p> <p>  There are two other categories which we will address shortly, the higher executive officer and the assistant principal officer and we are likely to have a variation of the IT mobility scheme that Mr. Watt talked about plus an application-based system, most likely for the assistant principal officer.  </p></speech>

It would have been beneficial to have had it a little earlier than 9.53 a.m. today.</p><p>Mr. Watt has a broad area of responsibility.  In terms of members needing time to scrutinise the statement, it would have been appreciated if we had got it earlier.<br/><br/>I want to concentrate first on broadband.  The Government recently signed the contract with Granahan McCourt for the rolling out of the broadband plan, which is the most costly capital project in the history of the State.  As Mr. Watt is aware, two ownership papers were produced by PwC and KPMG in 2015 that formed the basis of the Government decision to pursue a gap funding model, a privatisation model that means the private sector will finance, design, build, operate and own the infrastructure with the State giving the subsidy.  This was chosen over the four other options including State financing and ownership, which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have long advocated.  As we predicted, all of the bidders fell out of the bidding process except Granahan McCourt, wiping away the only stated advantage of the gap funding model, which was competition.  As a result, the taxpayer will be subsidising Granahan McCourt by up to &euro;3 billion, with the private operator contributing only &euro;220 million in the initial funding through working capital and equity.<br/><br/>In his own words Mr. Watt has stated: &quot;I note that by 2028, the private operator [will have all of their moneys paid back] in dividends and interest [...] while the Exchequer could have paid out almost &euro;2.5 billion&quot;.  In his letter to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, dated 16 April 2019, Mr. Watt wrote that the contract &quot;represents a major leap of faith&quot; which represents a major subsidy from the taxpayer for private benefits.  Regarding the final cost benefit analysis, Mr. Watt concluded that his Department does, &quot;not believe that this CBA justifies the use of scarce public funds on this scale&quot;.  Regarding the risks borne by the State and the private bidder, Mr. Watt again wrote that there are, &quot;unprecedented risks to the Exchequer posed by this proposed project&quot;.  He further stated: &quot;New technological advantages [...] could result in a stranded, obsolete asset, despite Exchequer investment of up to &euro;2.275 billion by 2026 by 2026 - in an asset that we will not even own&quot;.  Mr. Watt further stated: &quot;I would question whether the further risk associated with guaranteeing service provision over 25 years is genuinely transferred to the private operator or, in reality, actually retained by the Exchequer.&quot;  He further stated:</p><blockquote>	In effect, the private operator is being insulated from project [risk] while being afforded a massive upside potential in terms of any excess profitability. [...] I wish to re-emphasise one further time this Department's fundamental concerns in relation to the unprecedented risk that the State is being asked to bear in the event that the current NBP contract is recommended for approval by Government. </blockquote><p>In conclusion, Mr. Watt stated, &quot;I find it difficult to see how such a contract represents value for money for the State or is in the best interests of the taxpayer.&quot;<br/><br/>In a reply to a parliamentary question received by my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on 21 May 2019, it was confirmed that after 12 months of full deployment, by as early as October 2028, Granahan McCourt can asset strip, flip and sell on the infrastructure that was predominantly funded through the taxpayer subsidy.  I agree with much of what Mr. Watt said but in terms of my question, has his view on the Government's national broadband plan changed?</p></speech>

It is certainly what the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, wants.  He wants the civil servants who serve the Government and the public interest to give their views, and that is what I did.

It continued along its own pathway.  This will not be the last time Mr. Watt will be quoted.  In years to come, in terms of us examining the value for money, this is atrocious.  It is important to put on the record the Government's dismissal of Mr. Watt's advice around the broadband project.</p> <p>  On the consultancy fees, in his opening statement Mr. Watt stated that the Civil Service carries out a broad range of functions from developing policy to delivering front-line public services.  I want to focus on the Civil Service developing of policy.  Does Mr. Watt believe that the Civil Service is adequately resourced and skilled to develop policy options for Departments and the Government?  In a letter to the joint committee on finance on 18 July this year it was confirmed by the office of the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform that the Government paid in excess of &euro;25 million in consultancy fees for the national broadband plan.  That included, for example, the ownership option papers that Mr. Watt spoke about of PwC and KPMG.  Through parliamentary questions in May, we found that between 2011 and 2018, all Departments excluding the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, spent &euro;82.5 million on consultancy fees from the big four consultancy firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.  Not only does that raise concerns about the ability of the Civil Service to carry out its own functions, it also raises questions about the influence these consultancy firms have over public policy and the direction of taxpayers' money and State resources.  Are private firms dictating public policy?</p></speech>

That is the core function.  There are 40,000 civil servants.  There are many civil servants who are providing a direct service but there is a core of 3,000 or 4,000 who are engaged in policy work from all the different areas.  We have done a lot to improve the capacity.  I will mention two initiatives, the first of which is the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service  where we professionalised economic expertise.  We set up a new structure, and I am very proud of the service we have developed.</p><p>In my remarks, I mentioned the number of policy papers we have produced and the quality of the analysis.  We are much better at using data.  Through the national data infrastructure, we can share and combine data sources to get better insights into what is happening.  I am happier that the Civil Service has far more capacity to analyse.  The Senator knows this from talking to people in Departments.  They have a great understanding of the policy issues and the options.  People can be brought in for particular jobs.  It does not make sense to have an expert on a particular activity who may be required intermittently or every few years all year but one may require a certain expertise.  Consultancy houses that have reach into other countries can help because somebody involved in policy issues in other OECD countries can help.  There is a balance to be struck.  I would be very worried if Departments were overly reliant on consultants.  That is not a good sign.  If a Department goes back repeatedly to consultants to ask for advice on policy issues that are central to that Department, that Department needs to build capacity in-house because, ultimately, it is a better system to have professional civil servants who are there acting in the public interest and who are trained in building capacity and have the values of our service around objectivity and impartiality.  It is much better to have that type of administrative structure than the alternatives.  Too much reliance on consultants is a bad thing but there is a balance to be struck.  Optimal spending is not zero.  I do not know what the optimal spend is but it is not zero.  We will come back to the Senator regarding some of the numbers she quoted but some of those involve ICT projects and legal support as opposed to policy. </p><p> It is interesting to think about the value of that spend in the overall context of the pay bill for the Civil Service, which is approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  How is this consultancy spend relative to the overall size of the service?  I agree with the Senator that it is a challenge, which is why since 2011, we have put a strong emphasis on building capacity.  There is still a reliance.  Getting the balance is the correct thing.  There has been a reliance in some places on ICT.  In effect, if one had the same contractor there providing that support, ultimately, one does not have the capacity in the office or Department to draft the contract properly, procure properly and manage the contract.  That is one of the things on the ICT side where we built up the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, and our in-house chief information officer capacity.  We increased the budget and the number of people so that we do more of that software development in house.  There is a balance to be struck.  If a Department is too reliant on external assistance, that raises questions about the capacity and management of the organisation.</p></speech>

I refer to the JobPath contract.  It has been impossible for us to get details of that contract.  We spend &euro;202 million on services for employment when one adds in local employment services and all the duplication on the ground but we cannot get the details of the contract because of confidentiality.

When it comes to taxpayers' money and contracts, the details must be in the public domain.  The details of the contracts with which we deal are out there.  The contractors who engage with us know the rules of the game.  They know that the terms and conditions, the price and so on will be publicly available.  Let us come back on that because I do not know the exact details of that contract.  There might be particular issues but I do not know so let us come back on that.  We operate a system where the level of transparency is equal to any other country in the world in terms of freedom of information, publication of reports and making information available.  A total of 50,000 parliamentary questions were asked last year and there were thousands of freedom of information requests.  There is very little exempted that people cannot access in terms of what is happening in Departments.  I will check the details of the example cited by the Senator and get back to her because that would be unusual.</p></speech>

It would be useful if he came before this committee as the lead person in the Department at least annually.  I appreciate that we have a relatively tight agenda regarding the three specific issues about which he has agreed to discuss.</p><p>We are speaking in the context of the general reforms of the Civil Service.  I had two parents and two grandparents who worked in the public service.  One grandparent worked there until she got married and had to give up work.  I had a grandfather who was a garda, a grandmother who was a teacher and two parents who worked in UCD.  This is not coming from an anti-public service stance at all.  The witnesses mentioned the ability to reward people who do an exceptional job or a job well beyond what is expected.  I also refer to the ability to do what is very politely referred to as "managing people out".   This happens in the private sector all the time.  Can Mr. Watt tell us how many people are employed in the public service and how many people State bodies able to manage out because their position is not working, either for them or for the organisation they are employed by?</p></speech>

The figure for the Civil Service is now 41,000.  Those are overall numbers as opposed to full-time equivalents.  There has been a significant increase after a period of retrenchment.  We have increased the numbers once again.  There are big issues around both incentivising excellent performance and implementing a tougher regime of exiting people who are not performing.  I would not say it is a regret because when running any office or organisation, one cannot do anything one likes at any time.   However, I regret that we were not able to have proper conversations about different types of contracts and placing more people on temporary or performance-rated contracts involving payments for delivery and penalties for non-achievement.</p> <p>  There is a bit of a misapprehension when it comes to comparing the public sector to the private sector on this.  People in the private sector are on contracts.  The arrangements depend on the level an employee is at, but if someone at a senior level does not perform, he or she is given 18 months' or two years' salary.  The worker signs a confidentiality clause, nobody reveals the details and the employee does not talk about why he or she left.  Nobody will ever know he or she was fired.  Employees are not fired; they are just managed out, as the terminology has it.  Those tools are available.  Would it be better if they were available in the Civil Service or the public service?  We have some of them.  We can offer people early retirement.  As managers, we would like to have the facility to have conversations with people when things are not working out and offer 12 months' or 18 months pay in a confidential arrangement.  Can we do that in a public system with taxpayers' money?  The Comptroller and Auditor General would want to see it recorded in the accounts.  Public accounts show the amount awarded in severance payments and so forth.  There is a controversy about that every year.  We would like a more mature discussion about this.  It would help everybody.  It would certainly come at a cost but it would improve performance.  If somebody makes a mistake in the private sector, there is a conversation.  He or she is told that there will be another conversation if he or she do it again.  If it happens a third time, the employee is managed out.  It depends on the terms of the contract, which can be quite specific about the terms under which an employee will be managed out.  Sometimes things go down the legal route, but they are mostly managed.</p> <p>  There could be a debate about having that type of approach in the Civil Service.  In the UK, they have been doing this for several years.  My UK equivalents have the capacity to have those conversations and do deals that are kept confidential.  This has been very controversial in the equivalent committees in the UK.  There has been a lot of pushback about that.  It is worth debating.  In effect, we make it very difficult for managers.  We do all we can to reward people who do well.  We have an awards event and we try to promote people who perform well through our system.  A lot of our promotions are based on that.  If someone delivers, we promote them.  It can be very difficult to deal with people who do not perform.  We have sanctions.  We prevent people from going for promotions, we dock increments and eventually we move people out.  We do not have the type of tools that are available elsewhere.  I know that was a very long-winded response.  I have tried to answer the Senator's question.  It would certainly help to have a more sensible engagement.  We also have to realise that everybody makes mistakes.  The key is to learn from them.  Clearly if someone makes two or three, it is over.  He or she cannot stay in place any more.  We must have that maturity.  We would welcome conversations on that, but it is not easy.</p></speech>

Not everybody in an organisation of 325,000 people will be on par or above par.  The vast bulk of employees are.  This is Ireland - we all know people who work in various Departments and in the wider public service, which, as Mr. Watt has acknowledged, is much larger than the Civil Service.  It is very frustrating to have an employee who consistently has to be prodded, pushed, minded and watched when there are other people who are superbly good at what they do and they are all on the same pay.  Some people know that they can come in, do as little as they can get away with and go home and there is very little anyone can do about it.  This demoralises people who are breaking their backs because there is not as much opportunity for them.</p></speech>

However, it varies from place to place.  Mr. Cagney is on the coalface of this, but I would certainly hope that our organisation does not tolerate people swinging the lead.  We would address that.  I am not suggesting for a moment that there are no pockets of underperformance.  Of course there are.  It depends on the culture and the leadership of the particular organisation.  That involves having hard conversations.  There is an issue about people not being willing to have hard conversations.  We try to have a culture where we will point it out when something is not working and try to find out what is going on.  We try to engage and so does HR.  There are many aspects of underperformance.  Over the years we have noticed that underperformance can turn into a non-attendance issue, that is, repeated absences.  Our Department has a process whereby an employee who does not come in on Monday is asked to account for what happened to HR.  If we see a pattern, we try to deal with it because it can develop into a bad habit.  Other aspects of underperformance can become apparent, so we try to deal with it.  It is about leadership.  I do not accept the view that we do not have the tools, which I occasionally hear from my colleagues.  Perhaps we do not have all the tools, but we have tools to deal with these situations.  It is about having frank conversations.  It can be very difficult.  In our environment, which is unionised, people make representations on behalf of employees so escalating something can get very difficult.  Managers can find they are doing nothing but dealing with very difficult cases.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that Mr. Watt is responsible not only for the Civil Service but for the wider public service.  His Department deals with public expenditure and reform in local authorities, the teaching profession, universities, An Garda and the HSE.  The role of the Department is to cover public expenditure.  Everything that the State spends should come under the remit of his Department.  Setting up a separate Department with a separate ministerial position, so that finance became two briefs rather than one was a bit of a fudge.  The same Minister now covers both Departments.  Mr. Watt probably cannot give an opinion on this.  There is a lot of work involved in being the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are quite significant Departments, as he acknowledged.  Should one person be dealing with both of them, or should there be two different individuals doing the two jobs?</p></speech>

He now has two Departments.  That is the point I am making.  I saw a report from Mr. Watt's Department last month about the growth in public service numbers and the related planning.  There is almost full employment.  Mr. Watt has spoken of people's unwillingness to go to senior levels because they might have to listen to people like us.</p><p>I say this as somebody who, to put it on the record, is chairman of a school board in south Dublin.  It is incredibly difficult.  Mr. Watt can ask any principal in any school, particularly in south Dublin.  It applies everywhere in the greater Dublin region.  It is difficult to get staff.  It is also difficult to retain staff, particularly if they have links with a rural area.  Historically, the teacher might have come up from a rural area to Dublin.  All of a sudden, there is a job available down the country, the rent or the house price is a quarter of what it is in Dublin, and the pay is the same.  How will Mr. Watt retain and recruit staff, especially in Dublin?  I mean that about all the urban centres in the regions.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to get staff and that, ultimately, is part of Mr. Watt's gig.</p></speech>

I would not say that there is a generalised recruitment challenge.  We can recruit teachers and we can recruit garda&iacute; and civil servants.  There is not a generalised recruitment problem, but clearly, if the economy continues to grow, we have full employment, and there is more evidence of shortages appearing in the economy, we are an employer competing like other employers for talented people.  There is not a generalised issue.</p> <p>  There is an issue with technical staff, such as those with ICT skills - that is a common problem - and those with legal backgrounds in special activities.  We have a pay structure that sometimes can be a little inflexible when it comes to offering salaries that are market facing.  As I mentioned the leadership roles, it is not only about the joys of appearing in front of committees such as this.  There are other factors involved in that.</p> <p>  There are challenges.  If the economy continues to improve, this will be an even greater challenge for us.  There is a debate to be had about what type of public service one wants because, ultimately, we cannot provide in many cases the volume of more public service.  Much of it can be linked to numbers, particularly in the health system where if one wants to address issues, it involves more recruitment.  There are challenges.</p> <p>  It is not a generalised problem.  We recruit at graduate entry level.  We recruit people, such as teachers and garda&iacute;.  The Public Appointments Service does it.  We are able to recruit fantastic people.  It is not just the younger generation and recent graduates.  There are people throughout their careers who come into the service.  It is fantastic.  However, there are definitely pockets.</p></speech>

It is getting ever harder to get them.  When a school gets one, all of a sudden it discovers that the same job is on offer in some other part of Ireland where the teacher happens to be from, he or she has parents there, and that teacher can rent a house for &euro;400 instead of &euro;2,500 a month or spend &euro;80,000 or &euro;180,000 instead of &euro;800,000 to buy one.  I am flagging it because this is not a future problem.  This is a current problem.  I could find 50 school principals in south Dublin who will tell Mr. Watt that they cannot get X, Y and Z, or A B and C.  That is not the future.  That is now.</p></speech>

Somebody who came up from the country, for example, might want, as he or she gets older and his or her parents are getting older, to be a bit closer to the parents in Limerick, Longford, Mayo or wherever.  All of sudden, the teacher realises that he or she could have a much larger take-home pay at the end of every week or month.  I am not asking for a London weighting-type concept.  I am saying that if Mr. Watt is not careful, significant pockets of Dublin that are full of staff from Facebook and Google who are all on &euro;150,000 a year will be affected.  I am aware of schools in Dublin to which teachers drive two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening every day.  That is not good for the teachers.  It is not good for their families.  It is not good for those they are ultimately teaching because the teachers are leaving at 6 or 6.30 in the morning to get to Dublin in time and they are leaving at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. to head home.  That happens every day.  It is something that needs to be flagged to Mr. Watt, as head of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who is responsible for the public service generally, because it is a genuine problem.  It will only get worse with every ICT company that comes in.  Such companies are great.  They pay good salaries.  That is great, if one works for them.  However, they are forcing everybody else out.  I am sure it applies to the Civil Service.  I am sure Mr. Watt has staff in his Department who are travelling long distances every day.</p> <p>  Ultimately, Dublin needs teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses and staff in the public service to do the jobs.  When we were growing up, people of every civil and public service grade were living in all parts of Dublin.  Now it is much more difficult for them to do that on the salaries they are on when they are competing with workers who are on much greater salaries.  It is an important point.</p></speech>

The average AIB salary is &euro;55,000.  At Facebook, it is &euro;153,000, including share options.  Those people, if they are lucky to work for Facebook or Google, are welcome to it.  Do not get me wrong.  They pay plenty of income tax etc. and contribute to the economy.  It just means that with the limited housing supply, they are taking the housing, driving up the price and making it incredibly difficult.  It is important that I make these points to Mr. Watt who, effectively, is top of the recruitment chain in the public service.  I could give Mr. Watt chapter and verse on this, if he wants it.  I am a little surprised that Mr. Watt stated that we can recruit teachers.  Mr. Watt can probably recruit teachers in total but I am telling him teachers are having it very difficult.</p></speech>

We are looking at establishing so-called satellite offices so that colleagues who work in Departments that are based in Dublin can turn up at a satellite office that might be in the outer regions of the commuting belt, log in there, and interact and work with their colleagues in their office in Dublin without having to come in.  That is something Mr. David Cagney and his team are looking at.  This morning we had a presentation, which was quite interesting.</p></speech>

I accept that point.  I have not mentioned public procurement but I want to make the point.  There may be a great deal of good public procurement going on that we do not hear about because it is fine.  I refer to projects such as broadband, the national children's hospital, which I will not go over, and the public service procured printer, although Mr. Watt will probably say it relates to the Oireachtas Commission or somebody.  That is what the people see.  That is what we all see.  I am not saying Mr. Watt will not have a defence.  It was not Mr. Watt, but ultimately they are all on the State payroll.  Somebody somewhere made a costly decision and it is not something that any of us wants to see happen again.</p> <p>  In terms of data sharing and automation etc., there is scope for efficiencies in how one Department talks to another.  With all the limits and regulations on not having staff looking at citizens' Revenue accounts, health records etc., there must be ways of using all the public data available so that a local authority tenant need not fill in a hundred forms, the details of which are already known to the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not sure that there is enough on that.  Mr. Watt might respond on that.</p></speech>

The point I was making is that I am not the Secretary General of that Department.  Ultimately, the person who is responsible must account, as I would and as others have in the past, in terms of issues that are relevant to their responsibilities.</p> <p>  I agree that it presents the system in a poor light.  It misrepresents what is happening because people only hear about the things that go wrong.  They do not hear about all the fantastic things that are built and delivered on time.  I could read out a list of them here.  I had them in my briefing pack.  I might share them instead.  That might be better.  I refer to projects that have been delivered on time and on budget.  Senator Horkan will be aware from his own experience of the fantastic facilities that are being built efficiently, but there is no coverage of any of that.</p> <p>  It is interesting the numbers I gave on people's satisfaction with and perceptions of the Civil Service, at 70% to 80%.  That is because, in effect, they are not listening to this debate.  They are forming their views on the Civil Service based on their experience of dealing with the Civil Service, not what they hear on the radio or what they read in the newspapers.  They do not necessarily say everything is rubbish because of that incident.  They think of their personal experiences.  However, it can do damage.  If citizens believed what they heard and read every day, we would not be getting the type of responses back that we do when we ask them about their perceptions of the Civil Service.  It would not make sense.</p></speech>

The other side of that is when it fails.  In his opening statement he said that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform manages the Government's eTenders platform, that it delivers procurement solutions for public bodies and so on.  In the context of what he stated, he must reflect on the enormous overruns that are taking place.  I just want to deal with this in a general way.  However, I know other members mentioned the children's hospital.  We invited Mr. Watt to appear before the committee to discuss the public services card and he would not come in, nor would the Minister.</p> <p>  Within the schools building programmes we had the Carillion issue and all the local small builders affected by that.  We have had constant overruns in the HSE as well as the enormous settlements being reached by the HSE in court having disgraced itself again by going through the entire court process.  Mr. Watt must be disgusted at that.  Despite all of his efforts and those of his Department, the procurement section and all that, the basic action of purchasing a printer gets so botched up.  I want him to explain what he does when that happens.  Does he ring the Secretary General and ask him, "What the f-ing hell are you up to?"</p></speech>

As we mentioned, the system is vast.  Mistakes are made.  Sometimes there are legitimate reasons for mistakes.  At other times the reasons are based on maladministration, lack of leadership, poor decision-making or systemic failures.  We need to differentiate here.  I will come back to the incidents the Chairman mentioned in a moment.  I just do not accept the general characterisation that can come out of the types of discussions that all projects are mismanaged and that there are overruns.</p></speech>

The vast majority of projects come in on time and on budget.  I wish to deal with this notion of overruns.  Someone planning on building something might think it would cost &euro;20,000.  Following preparation of a detailed specification, the final bid might indicate it will cost &euro;50,000 and then eventually after the contract it comes in at &euro;55,000.  The overrun is &euro;55,000 against &euro;50,000; it is not &euro;55,000 against &euro;20,000.  The Chairman will know this from his time-----</p></speech>

The only cost against which one can judge the outturn cost is the cost based on a detailed design and a tender based on that detailed design.  Across swathes of the public service - education, universities, schools and so on - there are, of course, cases where things do not work.  I have spoken about the children's hospital, which was a unique project and we debated what happened there.<br/><br/>The public services card is a responsibility of the Department.  The infrastructure we built is not about the card but about providing the option of a unique digital identifier for citizens to enable them to access services at a time that is convenient and suits them.  I believe this is transformative and over time will be seen as a very successful piece of infrastructure.  In the past ten days we have seen 13,000 people apply for payments under the national childcare scheme based on using the infrastructure set up by the public services card, <i>mygov.ie</i>.  That avoids us having to replicate that type of system time and again for different schemes.  I would be very happy to have an engagement with the committee about digitalisation of <i>mygov.ie</i>at another time.<br/><br/>The Chairman mentioned school buildings and Carillion.  In that case the contractor went bust.  The Chairman and I have spoken about PPPs in the past and he knows my views on PPPs.  In this case it showed that the PPP model actually worked because the penalty clause included in the contract compelled the entity to go and get a new contractor to finish the work, because until it actually finished and presented the school, it would not get any unitary payment.  There are different issues here depending on the nature of the contract.<br/><br/>When I hear of something going on, I do not think there is any comparison between printer problems in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the children's hospital and other issues.  We need to look at each individual case.  There might be complexities associated with buying a printer and having it installed in an office.  That should in no way be compared with building a children's hospital.  When I see things like that, I am not happy and I ask what is going on and what the issue is there.  When it comes to a Department that has a Vote, I ring up the Accounting Officer and ask what went on.<br/><br/>Obviously, with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission being independent, I do not have that relationship with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I am not in a position to do that.  However, if it were another Secretary General, I would ask what is going on.  We would ask for an assessment report and we would have a discussion about it.  That would be independent of whatever might happen at an Oireachtas committee, including the Committee of Public Accounts, or whatever action the Comptroller and Auditor General might take.<br/><br/>We are not happy about things.  It is inappropriate use of taxpayers' money and it is not good for people's perception of how their money is being used.</p></speech>

That Mr. Watt, as a senior civil servant, would give such direct advice to those concerned on broadband is to be admired but their continuing to ignore that advice must surely be disappointing for him and his officials.

Many of them are political issues that are not for me to comment on.  I have given my views on some of those matters already.  I gave my views on broadband, which is my job.  It is ultimately for the Government to decide how to proceed.</p> <p>  Issues arise in respect of the HSE.  Without getting into the issues of health delivery and health politics, which are not my area, I believe there is an enormous difference between a public system and a private system.  A public system has a vast array of different operations and services whereas a private system will provide a subset of those services.  My view is that the problem we have in the health system is that there is an uneasy mix of public and private.  The way they interact is the problem.  Sl&aacute;intecare, the policy the Minister set out, which will be very difficult to implement, is the approach to try to unravel some of the strands.  The Chairman and I have spoken about this at various fora.  I have set out many the changes made and measures we have introduced.  We have made great progress on many aspects of public administration but, of course, there are things we can do better.</p> <p>  With regard to the management of capital projects and procurement, we have taken a number of steps.  I have alluded to some of them.  On another day, we might be able to talk in more detail about what we are trying to do.  There is an enormous difference between one-off, large bespoke projects and the sorts of routine projects we do.  Somebody mentioned to me the example of the Luas being built in Dublin.  There were overruns and delays when the first two lines were being built.  The final Luas line, connecting the green and red lines, was on time and on budget because the contractors and the State learned how to avoid mistakes.  We had great difficulty building the first motorways.  Back in the 1990s, there were overruns.  We did not have fixed-lump-sum contracts then; there were price-variation contracts and it was a disaster.  We eventually got it right.  We can learn.  With regard to the wider issues concerning the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid has a very effective leadership team.  We need to see what the HSE does.</p> <p>  I talked earlier about the indicators of people's perceptions of the Civil Service.  A few weeks ago, the OECD published Government at a Glance, which is a fantastic document.  Every Irish public service we do well is above average.  Health is the one area where the outcomes, relative to expenditure, are below the OECD average.  Nobody in the system doubts that there is an ongoing challenge in that regard.</p></speech>

That there is no role shows how wrong the whole process is.  I was an employer and know how staff must be managed and how things must be dealt with.  The systems in here are geared for failure but nobody wants to change them.  I heard on the news on my way here this morning that politicians made the arrangements for politicians.  I do not believe they did.  I was never asked about them.  I am quite happy to give in receipts and so on but nobody wants to listen.  The Department says it is the responsibility of the commissioner or somebody else down the road.  Auditing is done by Mazars or some other firm.  It is an absolute farce.  The vast majority of Members and, I am sure, civil servants just come in to do their work and they just want to get on with it.  I will have to get Mr. Watt a fobbing machine in order that he might see what it is like.</p></speech>

There is one major point in common.  Both involve taxpayers' money.  Therefore, they have a lot in common.  At this stage, no matter what Department we go to, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform comes up.  With regard to every item of expenditure we are looking into, the Department in question has to defer to the big daddy of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Is it possible that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is minding the cents and not the euros?  Is it the case that the Department is engaging in micro-management rather than macro-management, leaving Departments unable to manage in terms of their budget allocations?  There are lines of expenditure in many Departments that are questionable in terms of value for money.  There are also areas within Departments where there is major underspend and when we inquire about them we are told the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will not allow them to be spent, despite the fact that this would result in value for money for the taxpayer.  I am interested in hearing about the process by which the budgetary allocations are made.  Is the Department interfering too much at a micro level in the day-to-day operations of the Departments?  How many accountants are employed in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  </p><p> During my questioning of various Departments on items of expenditure, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was referred to an extraordinary number of times.  From my perspective, the Department is the most powerful Department in the apparatus of Government by a mile in that it makes all of the decisions on expenditure.  I ask Mr. Watt to outline the budgetary process in respect of the Department of Public and Expenditure's interaction with the other Departments.  For example, do the other Departments request that interaction and, at that point, do they hold the same level of spend they had the previous year or do we have an imprest system?  It frustrates me to hear the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will not allow spend of an allocation that has not been spent in another areas, even where value for money for the taxpayer is possible.</p></speech>

With any Government system there is a treasury function.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform discharges that treasury function on behalf of the Government.  This function was previously a function of the Department of Finance but it became the function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on its establishment in 2011.  It is the role of the Department to monitoring spending and manage the Estimates process.  Where people are facing down various vested interests or constituents, it is convenient to blame the Department.  For example, if the Senator was to call for more pay for the teachers, the Department of Education and Skills might respond that it would love to do that but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will not give it the money to do so.  That is just an example.  I am not suggesting that happens but if that were to happen, it would move the conversation on and away from the Senator.  That is the nature of it.</p></speech>

In effect, the system we have is one of delegated sanction for budgets.  In response to an earlier question from the Chairman, the budget is negotiated.  There is a process of negotiation for the budget.  We engage with Departments about their spending priorities and demands and we come up with a budget which is announced by the Minister.</p></speech>

Do we have an imprest system such that each Department holds the budget they have the previous year?</p></speech>

It becomes an administrative political debate and discussion.  For example, taking the Department of Social Protection and Employment Affairs budget, there were a lot of increases in its budget in the past when unemployment rose to 15% but the spend on unemployment benefit has since decreased dramatically and that money is no longer allocated to that Department.  The leeway generated by that has been used to improve pensions and other payments.  The budget allocation remains in place but the spend is different.  The ultimate budget administrative challenge is how to identify lines that are not performing and reallocate that money to other parts of the Department, let alone other Departments, which, in the end, comes down to politics.  It might be that there are schemes within a Department that one would want to close down or operate differently so that funding could be allocated to other areas but within that there would vested interests around that scheme and different priorities.  That is the challenge the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform faces all of the time because he has endless demands every year, most of which can never be met.  He would love to be able to do things differently.  He can, of course, enable reallocations but there is an enormous challenge in getting people to agree to it.  People do not see the opportunity cost of the funding.  Let us take the Department of Education and Skills and the best way of achieving value for money being to reduce class sizes and an allocation is made.  The value of the spending is not considered in the context of the opportunity cost of reducing class sizes but is considered against the objective of what the benefits delivered by the scheme are.  The benefits would be greater if the funding was reallocated but that is not how it the conversation happens.  The debate turns to getting more money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to keep the scheme going, as well as getting money to reduce class sizes.  This is the ultimate challenge of managing budgets and individual Departments.</p></speech>

The health budget continuously increases.  In terms of 2020, the health budget is up 6% and the remaining spend is up by 3% or 3.5%.  Spend for the Department of Justice and Equality is up, as is spend for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of the affordable childcare scheme and spend for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In cash and percentage terms the spends for housing and health have increased most.  There is a differentiation between Government priorities in these areas, such that they received more of an increase than other areas.</p></speech>

By any criteria, whether in the public or private sector, the figures are utterly astonishing.  The Revised Estimate for the Department of Health stands at &euro;17 billion.  The Estimate for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which used to be significantly larger than health, is now just over &euro;20 billion.  At the same time, the total allocation to the education Vote, which we all agree is vital to the country&rsquo;s future, has fallen back.  It is miles behind the Department of Health.</p> <p>  What needs to be done?  There is the Department of Health and the HSE, yet we are in an appalling situation.  I listened to people talk about the children's hospital.  What about the maternity hospitals and what will happen to women giving birth to babies in the three hospitals in the Dublin area and other hospitals right around the country?  Recently, the master of the Rotunda Hospital said in public that the hospital&rsquo;s facilities are dangerous for seriously ill babies.  It is difficult to fathom what exactly is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in all of this.  I know it does not have clinical responsibility.  However, in 2015, when the current Taoiseach was the Minister for Health, he announced, on behalf of the Rotunda Hospital, that it was going to move to a new campus on the west side of Dublin, adjacent to Connolly hospital, where, by and large, a significant proportion of the women giving birth are living close to the motorways serving the hospital.  The same argument was made for the children's hospital.  In the intervening years, the Rotunda has got, according to its master, more concerned about the care it can provide.  At the same time, the question of a new maternity facility has been stalled.  It is unbelievable.</p> <p>  Take the case of the national maternity hospital.  Is somebody in the Irish foreign service or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on to the Vatican to ask it when it will make its decision as to whether it will be hands off from the governance of the hospital to allow the new national maternity hospital to commence?  Is this something that has to be thought about?  Will we hear in a year or two from whoever has the go-ahead from the Pope to be a decision maker on this?  I see the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform having an overall managerial role to be able to intervene critically.</p> <p>  In fairness to the Chairman, he asked a significant question for everybody who has the honour to be a Deputy or Senator.  What on God's earth is going on with the fob system?  Why are we reading about this in the newspapers?  The Chairman made a plea to Mr. Watt because it is the reputation of public service that is under challenge when one hears that somebody can pop in and out on Friday night or Monday morning.  We do not have a clue.  Maybe the person sleeps here for the weekend and then heads off.  We have no idea.  The point is that when public confidence is lost in institutions, it is democracy that is damaged and, therefore, our particular role as elected representatives.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has oversight of all staffing.  I am not aware that any Deputy has had any involvement in the design of the fobbing system.  We just got our instructions as to what we were to do.  Most people followed that honourably.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has the oversight management role but, again, it does not have any oversight.</p> <p>  When Professor Fergal Malone, master of the Rotunda, says that sick babies will die, does somebody in the Department pick up the phone to him and say they are distressed to read that today?  Does it have to go all the way through the HSE, over to the Department of Health, down to whoever opens the letters in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and back up again?  We seem to be in some kind of communication system.  Maybe it is all done by email but it sounds like it is done by pony and trap.  There is just no reaction to crises which are building up.</p> <p>  Most of us here have had experience of difficult years when everybody pulled together to get better outcomes for the country.  We got to a certain plateau and then it all seemed to fall apart, be it in housing, health or the new childcare scheme.  I am glad to hear people are signing up to the new childcare scheme.  On the ground, however, many parents are confused by what they are asked to do.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Watt regularly meet the Taoiseach to tell him how the public service is performing?  Does he attend a Cabinet committee?  The previous Taoiseach had a practice of having Cabinet committee meetings on Monday once a month.  From parliamentary replies, it would seem the Cabinet committee system has fallen back.  How often does Mr. Watt meet the Taoiseach?  Is his communication via the Secretary to the Government?  We are beset by problems which are not about lack of money but about the failure of the issues to come together, along with the failure of people to be able to get reasonable answers. </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the meetings are on Mondays.  The Taoiseach chairs those meetings which are organised by the Department of the Taoiseach.

He is a politician like the members and he is out there meeting people so he has a sense of what is going on in the country.  I am sure that he has a better sense than I have about how people are assessing where we are.  My job is to have conversations and the agenda is set by the Taoiseach, as ever.  He gives us his views on what we are doing.  He asks questions.  We bring issues to him.  That structure takes place, which is quite an effective structure in terms of the engagement between the Civil Service and the people we work for - the Taoiseach and Ministers.  So that structure is there.  There is the formal Cabinet structure, there are more informal engagements, as may be required, and we work with the Taoiseach on the Government's agenda and priorities.</p> <p>  In terms of the fobbing system, I have nothing to do with the fobbing system that operates here.  It is not my business to comment on it.  I have sympathy for how politicians are portrayed in terms of the whole issue of fobbing and expenses and I think it is very unfair but it has nothing to do with me.  It is the business of yourselves.</p> <p>  In terms of the capital projects, there are capital projects, I understand, in terms of the maternity services.  I do not have the details but we can certainly come back to the Deputy on the timeline.  There are projects in relation to Holles Street and the Rotunda.

In some jurisdictions there would be an immediate query as to why one moved from estimates, which start off sounding reasonable, and then climbed dramatically.  I do realise that situations can change.  However, we have crisis after crisis in the health service yet we have an escalating health estimate.  Does Mr. Watt think we will get &euro;17 billion worth of output from the health services this year?  There are people working in the health service who are under tremendous stress and, very often, completely exhausted.  Last week, we saw an image of a woman in her 90s sitting on a trolley but spending her third day on a trolley.  Is there a rapid reaction or response within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when something is seen that is genuinely outrageous?  Does someone in the Department lift up a phone and call the Department of Health to ask what is going on?  The public cannot understand what is going on at the moment.  It would be helpful if the public could understand the situation.  We have had incredibly difficult years and people made tremendous sacrifices yet now we are looking at a lot of that go down the drain because there does not seem to be anybody in control.  Is Mr. Watt surprised that the outcome of the health service this year is &euro;17 billion?  Perhaps it should be &euro;18 billion or &euro;14 billion.  I do not know.  Does Mr. Watt have a view on the matter?  His Department looks at the overall Estimates.</p></speech>

That reflects the priority that the Government gives to improving the health system and the demographic pressures and so on.  There is a big challenge in terms of managing the budget and staying within it.  This year, as the Deputy mentioned, there is an overrun of around &euro;330 million.<br/><br/>As to the issue of financial management and overall value for money, it is a massive system that provides many different services across many different units of the health system.  Of course, there are issues around that.  Of course, there are issues about how we could improve the service and how service delivery can get better.  As I mentioned earlier, the OECD's government publication at a glance has very interesting metrics on spending <i>per capita</i>in countries.  On the outcomes, nobody would disagree with the view that the health system is challenging.  There are parts of it that are under an awful strain and pressure.  It is not really my job to get involved in the cut and thrust of this issue but there are also fantastic things happening in the health service.  There are fantastic services.  There are people being treated every day in our system who, thankfully, are treated well and leave the system happy with same.  There is another story as well, as the Deputy knows from her own experience.  It is not all negative.  It is not all doom and gloom.  There are challenges but there are also very positive aspects of the system as well.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding all of the good work that is going on in different parts of the health service, which everybody here would acknowledge, the problem is that there appears to be a budgeting system that is subject to regular massive overspends.  My understanding is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is a Department that addresses the issue of overspends.  Mr. Watt has mentioned the children's hospital and that we did not need to go back into it in detail but there is talk of further significant overruns being possible.  I mentioned to him the three maternity hospitals in Dublin but there are also maternity hospital situations in locations around the country.  The Rotunda Hospital was meant to transfer but we are now being told that we will have to, possibly, build a temporary five or six-storey building in Parnell Square and nothing is happening.  I want to get an image.  These are significant amounts of money.  Will moving the Rotunda cost &euro;300 million or &euro;500 million plus the cost of building a new maternity hospital?</p> <p>  In terms of the sister hospital on Holles Street, which is on the southside, we are now told, and have been for a while, that the Vatican must make up its mind as to whether it will have some kind of governance involvement.  In the meantime, does one ring somebody and say there is a problem?  We have an ambassador to the Vatican and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Mr. Watt has said that his Department has oversight.  Where is the problem solving, firefighting approach when these are serious issues for the staff, the patients who will use the hospital, the babies who will be born there and the master in terms of safety?  The poor master has talked about feeling that there is a level of unsafety for babies.  That is a massive thing for the master of any hospital to actually say.  It is also really worrying for women and their families who are likely to have babies there, particularly if the baby is likely to need special support.</p></speech>

Has there been a discussion?  Has Mr. Watt and the Taoiseach discussed the Vatican and its role?  The function of Mr. Watt is to be both a leader and a problem solver for other Departments and it is a function that he has carried out extremely well.  I have listed some examples and I am sure everybody here could list four or five other examples.  I shall not even discuss broadband.  We are paying gigantic money for something that we will never own and that seems extraordinary to most people.  Where are these conversations with An Taoiseach and some of the line Ministers?  I know that Mr. Watt is not a person who is accustomed to holding back his views.</p></speech>

I think the system works and should work with people like me giving their views or advice and then the political system makes the decision, and that is what happens.

We have managed to reduce two grades, a number of years ago.  We believe the system is too hierarchical and needs to be flattened.  Suppressing grades or elongating scales are very difficult industrial relations, IR, challenges to get agreement upon.  My own view is the systems are too hierarchical.</p></speech>

How sustainable does Mr. Watt believe that things are at the moment?  We have seen a huge increase again in the Civil Service, the HSE, and all areas of public expenditure.  All of these areas have defined pensions and lump sums, which comprise a huge burden on the taxpayer.  Is Mr Watt making recommendations on how the burden can be reduced in all areas as well?</p></speech>

The fiscal deficit opened up when the economy collapsed back then.  It was a big task to get that back into balance.</p> <p>  Our focus with the Minister at all times is to look at the sustainability of expenditure, of the budget, and to work with the Minister on what the appropriate increase in spending is, given the other demands.  There is the whole question of the sustainability of the public finances, to debt and the pensions issue.  On pensions, there is a big contingent liability out there, which is greater than the gross debt, which is something we are very focused on.  Many changes have been made, for example on public pensions with the single pension scheme of 2012, and changes on social welfare pensions in increasing the retirement age.  There are issues about the sustainability of the pension system, which is a big issue for society.  There are wider issues on the cost of healthcare, particularly nursing home care, and how that cost is to be met in the future.  The demographic impacts on the public finances are significant.  Every year it costs  &euro;450 million to &euro;500 million just to deal with the demographic consequences on pensions and health systems.</p></speech>

Spending cannot keep increasing at the rate we have seen unless the economy grows at 4% or 5% as it has been.  Given that we are now running out of labour since we are fully employed, and we are seeing all of the consequences of growth, the economy can only grow in future then at maybe 2% or 3%.  Spending will have to grow at a lower rate in the future.</p></speech>

We have consolidated payroll into payroll shared services.  There is a massive payroll system which we provide in three different locations.  We are responsible for providing payroll and pension services for hundreds of thousands of people.  The transactional human resources, HR, function is consolidated in PeoplePoint in Clonskeagh.  The strategic HR is managed by people in individual Departments, in partnership with Mr. Cagney who is head of HR for the Civil Service and with the people in PeoplePoint who provide the data and analytics to help them.  We have gone some of the way.</p> <p>  There was big issue in the past as to whether we should outsource all of it but we felt that we should consolidate it, improve the technology, and get many of the efficiency gains through doing that.  If we had outsourced back then, all of the gains would have gone to the outsourcing partner, so we do it in a different way.  We have an in-house solution as to all of those services.</p></speech>

All of the new agencies for the past ten, 15 or 20 years have been based in Dublin.  Mr. Watt has mentioned that he is looking at people working from home or in central hubs or hotpoints in counties outside of Dublin.</p></speech>

I read a report recently where quite a number of civil servants, up to 5,000 or 6,000, would like to transfer immediately out of Dublin.  Has he looked at that whole area?</p></speech>

Mr. Cagney and his team are working on that.  The decentralisation programme that was done before was a disaster and was ill-conceived.  I can say this because I worked with former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, I see him a great deal, would have good time for him and he will not be offended when I say this.  The notion of decentralising administrative head offices is a mistake.  It can be considered, however, when looking at other types of services.  It is a possibility.  One does not have to have all the services in one location but one needs the administrative heads and the head offices of Departments together.  It, of course, does not have to be in Dublin but historically that has been the case and I cannot see that changing any time soon.  No matter what one does, those elements need to stay together.</p> <p>  There is no reason why a whole variety of other services should be in Dublin.  One of the things that we are looking at is the whole question of digital, not hubs - I cannot think of the title we are using at the moment - but where we can have offices out on the commuter belt, people can go and log in there rather than having to come into the city centre.  We are looking at this because we are conscious of the fact that people want to move and work differently as the commuting times are so long now and this is a big factor for people and their families.</p></speech>

Storage, for instance, would be located much more cheaply throughout the country rather than to have it in the most expensive part of the country.  Has Mr. Watt looked at that area?</p></speech>

We have approximately 16,000 civil servants in the centre of the city of Dublin.  Accommodation is expensive.  This is an issue for us.  Do we need to have all of those services provided centrally in Dublin?  We have a number of buildings that we were in and which we have now vacated.  Consequently, we have demands to lease and build new offices.  This is an issue for us.</p></speech>

My question is about badly performing contractors.  Earlier this year, the construction firm, Western Building Systems, was awarded a contract to deliver the 60-bed modular extension at University Hospital Limerick but the same construction firm was found responsible for structural defects in as many as 42 new schools that have been built in recent years.  In August, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Joe McHugh, stated that structural flaws had been identified in a further 17 school buildings, which would require temporary works to be carried out in the following weeks.  Section 56(8) of the European Union (Awards of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 indicates that the contracting authority "may exclude from participation in a procurement procedure any economic operator in one or more of the following situations: ... where the economic operator has shown significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of a substantive requirement under a prior public contract, a prior contract with a contracting entity or a prior concession contract".</p> <p>  Will the witnesses give an example of a contractor, such as Western Building Systems, that has been disqualified from a public tendering process on these grounds? Is there a database in place that allows contracting authorities to score contractors on their performance and share information across Departments and authorities while disqualifying contractors or penalising them during a tendering process?</p></speech>

A number of steps need to be taken to verify the evidence necessary to exclude a party.  Under the Constitution, people have a right to earn a living and there must be a process.  It is no different from any other disciplinary procedure, some of which we discussed earlier.  There is a right to a response and a party must make a final decision.  Quite often under contracts, people may call something out and a dispute might arise as to whether that judgment or call is correct.  It will go through a determination and dispute resolution if necessary and if the contractor or consultant in some cases refuses to accept that determination.</p></speech>

I am amazed that there is no communication across Departments on this.  How can we ensure we get value for money and that we do not end up in scenarios that we have seen previously, which have cost small or indigenous businesses, along with other parties?  That worries me.</p></speech>

We are engaged in a review of how capital projects are procured and managed under contracts.  We are looking at all those aspects.  The reality is there must be consistent application of these measures.  If one contracting authority is particularly hot on one aspect and excludes a party because of that issue but nobody else is examining it or evaluating it in a different way, it leaves scope for a successful challenge to the exclusion.  The metrics must be clear.  The tools are in the contract through deduction of moneys.  Grounds for exclusion are termination, damages or comparable sanctions under the EU directive's provisions.  Unless those have been applied and upheld, if there is a challenge to them, there will be no evidence.  Whether there is a national matrix or otherwise, if the applicant is following a tender competition, it must declare whether any of those grounds for exclusion apply to it.  The database could be some sort of blacklisting system but, in reality, the system is set up so the applicant must inform us if there are any issues.</p></speech>

The review is scheduled for completion, taking 18 to 24 months overall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120300002#Q02200"><p>There is definitely an issue concerning performance management.  I am talking about a contract being managed.  It is about documenting this process and sharing information if a party is not eligible.  We must think about litigation in this regard.  If I say something did not go well, the contractor could blame me for the fact that the contract did not go well.  There could be an accusation that the design was not good enough or there were not enough specialist staff.  Even establishing the extent to which a party performed adequately can tie us up in law.  That is even before concluding a party has not performed and putting this on a register that other public bodies could use to exclude somebody.  We are very mindful of this but it is a legal minefield.</p> <p>  Much has to do with the way the directive is written.  We would like more flexibility to say that if we did not have a good experience with a contractor, it would not get the next job but we cannot do it.  We cannot exclude somebody like that.  It is very difficult but the Senator's point is a good one.  This is not straightforward.</p></speech>

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gabhann an Ard-R&uacute;na&iacute; a leithsc&eacute;al nach f&eacute;idir leis bheith anseo inniu.  Is r&uacute;na&iacute; c&uacute;nta an Rialtais m&eacute;.  In &eacute;ineacht liom t&aacute; oifigeach Gaeilge na Roinne, Sin&eacute;ad Nic Coitir.<br/><br/>Mar is eol don chomhchoiste, n&iacute; shol&aacute;thra&iacute;onn Roinn an Taoisigh m&oacute;r&aacute;n seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; d&iacute;reach do bhaill den phobal i gcompar&aacute;id, mar shampla, leis an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Fosta&iacute;ochta agus Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute;.  N&iacute;l oifig&iacute; poibl&iacute; no cuntar poibl&iacute; again.  Go formh&oacute;r tugaimid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; do, agus b&iacute;onn muid i dteagmh&aacute;il go rialta le, Ranna eile Rialtais agus brains&iacute; eile den St&aacute;t, Tithe an Oireachtais agus &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in san &aacute;ireamh.  I gcuid mhaith de riarach&aacute;n foirme&aacute;lta an St&aacute;it, &uacute;s&aacute;idimid an Ghaeilge.  Mar shampla, nuair a fhaigheann muid Bille &oacute; Chl&eacute;ireach na D&aacute;la agus &eacute; &aacute; thairiscint againn go foirme&aacute;lta chuig an Uachtar&aacute;n faoi Alt 25 den Bhunreacht, scr&iacute;obhann muid chuige i nGaeilge.  D&eacute;anann muid gach iarracht seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; mar sin a shol&aacute;thar ar ardchaighde&aacute;n.  T&aacute; roinnt mhaith dualgais fhoirme&aacute;lta mar sin, at&aacute; luaite in&aacute;r bhfreagra ar an gceistneoir, a chomhl&iacute;onann muid i nGaeilge amh&aacute;in, n&oacute; le Gaeilge mar an phr&iacute;omhtheanga in &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Is &eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist n&aacute; bar&aacute;ntais cheapach&aacute;in do bhreithi&uacute;na, oifigigh airm, litreacha creidmheasa d'ambasad&oacute;ir&iacute; agus f&oacute;gra&iacute; don <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.<br/><br/>I gc&aacute;s ceann amh&aacute;in de na dualgais fhoirme&aacute;lta is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; at&aacute; againn, glaoimid ar chabhair &oacute; na Thithe.  An mh&iacute; seo caite, chuireamar c&oacute;ip nua den Bhunreacht, leis na leasaithe ar fad a deineadh &oacute; 1999 ar aghaidh, isteach ina hiris in oifig iriseoir na C&uacute;irte Uachtara&iacute; chun Alt 25(5) den Bhunreacht a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Bh&iacute;omar ag ullmh&uacute; an ch&oacute;ip sin le tr&iacute; bliana, n&oacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute;, agus ag fanacht ar bhriseadh idir na reifrinn ar fad chun &eacute; a roll&uacute; sa Ch&uacute;irt Uachtarach.  Bh&iacute; an-chuid oibre le d&eacute;anamh chun an t&eacute;acs a ullmh&uacute; agus a dheimhni&uacute;.  Le comhairle an Ard-Aighne, agus in aont&uacute; leis an bPr&iacute;omh-Bhreitheamh, d&rsquo;athra&iacute;omar &oacute;n gcl&oacute; Gaelach chuig an gcl&oacute; r&oacute;mh&aacute;nach don eagr&aacute;n rollaithe don ch&eacute;ad uair.  N&iacute;or athraigh muid an ceartlitri&uacute;; t&aacute; s&eacute; sin d&iacute;reach mar an gc&eacute;anna is a bh&iacute; s&eacute; nuair a v&oacute;t&aacute;il na daoine air in 1937.  N&iacute; fh&eacute;adfaimid an obair sin a dh&eacute;anamh gan an chabhair mhillteanach a bhfuaireamar &oacute; Vivian U&iacute;bh Eachach agus an fhoireann i Rann&oacute;g Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in na dTithe.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas agus bu&iacute;ochas an Taoisigh agus na Roinne i leith na hoibre ar fad a rinneadar a chur ar an taifead anseo inniu.<br/><br/>T&aacute; an Roinn tiomanta a dualgais faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  Mar chuid den phr&oacute;iseas f&oacute;rsa saothair a phlean&aacute;il, t&aacute; dh&aacute; phost Gaeilge ainmnithe sa Roinn in oifig phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach an Taoisigh agus i bpreasoifig an Rialtais.  T&aacute; seachtar den fhoireann le Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa ar f&aacute;il mar teagmh&aacute;laithe chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Taca&iacute;tear le baill den fhoireann tr&iacute; ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; chl&aacute;r foghlamtha agus forbartha na Roinne.  Faoi l&aacute;thair t&aacute; ceathrar sa Roinn ag staid&eacute;ar don Teastas sa Ghaeilge Ghairmi&uacute;il.  Mar chuid den chl&aacute;r ionduchtaithe do bhaill foirne nua, tugtar eolas d&oacute;ibh ar an sc&eacute;im teanga agus b&iacute;onn seisi&uacute;n eolais don fhoireann uilig ar an sc&eacute;im mar chuid de chl&aacute;r bliant&uacute;il foghlamtha agus forbartha na Roinne.  Th&aacute;inig an sc&eacute;im teanga at&aacute; againn faoi l&aacute;thair i bhfeidhm i m&iacute; I&uacute;il na bliana seo agus beidh s&eacute; &eacute;ifeachtach go dt&iacute; I&uacute;il 2022.  T&aacute; oifigeach Gaeilge, at&aacute; anseo in &eacute;ineacht liom inniu, ainmnithe at&aacute; freagrach as monat&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh ar chur i bhfeidhm &aacute;r sc&eacute;ime teanga.  Tuairisc&iacute;onn s&iacute; go rialta chuig ceann na ngn&oacute;tha&iacute; corpar&aacute;ideacha agus chuig an l&iacute;onra Gaeilge.  I measc na ruda&iacute; a phl&eacute;itear ag cruinnithe an l&iacute;onra Gaeilge t&aacute; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, an su&iacute;omh Idirl&iacute;n, traen&aacute;il, fiosr&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus gear&aacute;in &oacute;n bpobal, an sc&eacute;im teanga oifigi&uacute;la, tuarasc&aacute;il an Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, r&oacute;l na ndaoine teagmh&aacute;la, agus araile.<br/><br/>&Oacute; thaobh foilseach&aacute;in, c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute;, comhartha&iacute; agus araile a chur ar fail tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, c&eacute; nach bhfoils&iacute;mid m&oacute;r&aacute;n bileoga eolais agus duilleoig&iacute;n&iacute;, foils&iacute;mid i nGaeilge iad.  Sampla&iacute; den saghas rud sin n&aacute; an bhileog eolais do chuairteoir&iacute; chuig Tithe an Rialtais agus na duilleoig&iacute;n&iacute; le haghaidh insealbh&uacute; an Uachtar&aacute;in agus cuairt an Ph&aacute;pa.  Idir 2016 agus 2018 d'fhoils&iacute;mid 36% de phreasr&aacute;iteas agus 13% d'&oacute;r&aacute;id&iacute; i nGaeilge.  In 2018 bh&iacute; 0.3% de ch&aacute;sanna comhfhreagras i nGaeilge, is ionann sin agus 86 litreacha as timpeall 26,000.  T&aacute; &aacute;bhar buan ar an l&aacute;ithre&aacute;n gr&eacute;as&aacute;in <i>gov.ie/taoiseach</i>ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; &aacute; thabhairt suas chun d&aacute;ta faoi l&aacute;thair ag seirbh&iacute;s eolais an Rialtais.  In 2018 agus 2019, i dteannta leis na c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; at&aacute; riachtanach le foilsi&uacute; i nGaeilge faoin Acht, d'fhoils&iacute;omar tuarasc&aacute;lacha ar &Eacute;ire dhomhanda agus ar dhul chun cinn; &quot;Do Ghn&oacute;lacht a Ullmh&uacute; do Brexit &ndash; C&eacute;imeanna Praitici&uacute;la&quot;; agus &aacute;bhar maidir leis an gCom&oacute;rtas N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Treabhd&oacute;ireachta 2019.<br/><br/>Stopfaidh m&eacute; ansin mar is fearr d&oacute;thain ama a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il do bhaill an chomhchoiste ceisteanna a chur.  D&eacute;anfaidh muid gach iarracht na ceisteanna a fhreagairt anseo inniu agus is f&eacute;idir liom scr&iacute;obh chuig an gcomhchoiste tar &eacute;is an chruinnithe le haon eolas breise, m&aacute;s cu&iacute;.

I also welcome our visitors in the Gallery, some of whom have already made presentations to this committee.  Today is our final session of four on the issue of education.  We have already listened to Ms Catherine Joyce of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group; Ms Eileen Flynn of the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum; Mr. Patrick Nevin of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project; Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in, a young Traveller who worked with me for a year in developing a programme on Traveller rights; Mr. Martin Collins of Pavee Point; Ms Shreya Chaturvedi; and Mr. Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement's Yellow Flag programme.  We have also heard from Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, a former Minister for Education and Skills and co-chair of the Traveller Oireachtas group; Dr. Teresa O&rsquo; Doherty of Marino Institute of Education; and Mr. Patrick McDonagh, who is a PhD student in medieval history at Trinity College Dublin and a Traveller.</p> <p>  A big message we have heard in these sessions is that Travellers are not so much dropping out of education as being pushed out by the actions or inaction of the system.  We learned that the practice of using reduced-hours timetables is all too common for Travellers.  This is a good example of Travellers being pushed out of education, but it is not the only one.  Ms Catherine Joyce of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group described how her son, a 14 year old boy, adopts the role of teacher to educate the settled pupils and teacher in his class about the Traveller way of life in the absence of any formal inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum.  When there is no positive reflection of Traveller life in our schools, we put enormous pressure on Traveller children and students to take up the role of teacher and representative.  That role should not fall to a schoolchild.  Children should be at school simply to learn and be educated.</p><p>We heard from Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in that it is a misconception that Travellers do not value education.  It is a myth that one often hears but it is not true.  It is a falsehood.  Bullying and discrimination are sad realities for many Traveller children, with schools and teachers often reluctant to, or ignorant as to how to, combat them.  Four in ten Traveller children say that they have been bullied at school; that is 40%.  Bright and eager learners are being pushed out of education due to ignorance and discrimination.  I will state the facts about Traveller education again, facts with which we, as a committee, should be very familiar and know by now.</p><p> According to the 2016 census conducted by the Central Statistics Office, nearly six in ten male Travellers, 57.2%, were educated to primary level at most.  Among Traveller females, just 13% were educated to upper secondary level or above, compared to almost seven in ten, 70%, of the general population.  That is an enormous gap.  A total of 167 Travellers, 0.5%, have third-level qualifications.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report, A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, found in 2017 that Travellers are over 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate in comparison with their counterparts in the non-Traveller population.  There is an enormous gulf and disparity between the outcomes for Traveller children in the education system and the settled population.  Only 8% of working-age Travellers, compared to 73% of non-Travellers, have reached leaving certificate level and fewer than one in ten Travellers aged 25 to 34 have completed second-level education compared with 86% nationally.  These are the facts on which we have to reflect.  We will be hearing about some of the welcome initiatives that are under way but we must put all those initiatives in the context of the huge disparities between the educational outcomes for Travellers and the general population.</p><p> Over the course of the sessions, we have heard a number of recommendations aimed at removing barriers to education for Travellers and they will be reflected in our final report.  What was common among the recommendations was the need to provide education support to Travellers throughout their time in education, starting with the early years, continuing right through primary, junior and senior cycles and into third level.  People need support at all stages from preschool to third level.  However, we heard that it is not good enough to only support Travellers, we also need to make our schools the welcoming and warm places they should, and must, be for Travellers because Travellers have the same right to an education as everybody else.</p><p> Representatives of the Yellow Flag programme, from whom we heard last week, showed us an example of how to do this.  They were also in the audiovisual room of the Oireachtas to award yellow flags to five primary schools and one secondary school.  Those flags mark a school's inclusivity of all cultures and ethnicity, celebration of diversity and challenge to racism and discrimination.</p><p> One young Traveller boy remarked that, before the Yellow Flag programme, he was shy of speaking about his background but, after Traveller pride day in school, he felt proud and confident of his heritage, as he should be.  All children should feel this way.  No child should have to hide parts of themselves and that includes the need for intercultural awareness and anti-discriminatory training for teachers, a recommendation that is echoed in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recent report, Ireland and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which also specifically references the teaching of Traveller culture and history in schools.</p><p> We are talking about issues affecting Travellers in Leinster House this morning but they are also under consideration in Geneva where Ireland is reporting to the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  We have much to do to put our house in order.  The ideas and recommendations that will come from this committee will help our State to put its house in order.  That is an important contribution that we, as a committee, will be making in the course of our reporting on this matter.</p><p> From the Department of Education and Skills, I welcome the Minister, Deputy McHugh, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, Mr. Enda Hughes, principal officer, and Ms Patricia Sheehan, assistant principal officer.</p><p>I also welcome: Ms Tara Farrell, chairperson of Aontas; Ms Cathleen McDonagh Clark from the Education and Training Service; Mr. Neill McDermott from the Higher Education Authority, HEA; Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ryan, head of access policy at the HEA; Ms Inez Bailey, CEO of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA; and Mr. Brian Melia, principal of Galway community college and Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind those present to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the recording systems.  I also advise our guests that any submissions or opening statements they make will be published on the committee website after this meeting.<br/><br/>Following the presentations, there will be questions from members.  We must stick to a strict five-minute rule because we have a lot of witnesses to hear from this morning and it is important that we hear all of the voices.  I now call on Mr. Hughes to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My name is Enda Hughes and I am principal officer with responsibility for equity of access in higher education.  Accompanying me is Ms Patricia Sheehan, assistant principal officer in the Department's social inclusion unit.</p> <p>  A key objective of Traveller education policy in recent years has been the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision and the inclusion of Traveller children and young people in mainstream education.  Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into the overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools.  The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports, including additional teaching posts, home school community liaison co-ordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curricular supports, priority access to continued professional development and the school excellence fund-DEIS.  The DEIS programme costs &euro;125 million per year.</p> <p>  It is acknowledged that not all Travellers attend DEIS schools.  The Department provides significant support across all schools to students with additional needs, including special education teachers, special needs assistants and school transport.  The spend in this area is &euro;1.9 billion per year, which is an increase of 52% since 2011.</p> <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, works with schools and is concerned with learning behaviour and social and emotional development.  Since 2011, sanctioned NEPS psychological numbers have increased significantly.  In addition, all children, including Traveller children, can avail of support provided by Tusla education welfare officers regarding attendance in schools.</p> <p>  The Department's commitment to improving educational outcomes for Travellers and Roma is reflected in a number of key policies and initiatives, including the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy sub-committee provides an overall focus on improving educational for Travellers and Roma, including the implementation of all education actions in the strategy, of which there are over 30.  A national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy pilot project has been established in four areas in partnership with Tusla education support services and the Departments of Justice and Equality and the Children and Youth Affairs.  This two-year pilot project will target attendance, participation and school completion in specific Traveller and Roma communities regionally in Tuam, Bunclody, Enniscorthy, Finglas, Ballymun, Coolock and Cork.  Each pilot area is being provided with one additional educational welfare officer, supplied by Tusla, one additional home school liaison co-ordinator, supplied by the Department of Education and Skills, and two additional Traveller and Roma education workers, supplied by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The teams will work together with parents, children, young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to remove the barriers impacting on Traveller and Roma children's attendance, participation and retention in education.</p><p>Expected outcomes of the pilot include improved attendance, participation and retention of Travellers and Roma in education and improved engagement with Traveller representative groups.  These pilots will inform the development of policy and innovative solutions to issues identified as barriers to participation and engagement.</p><p> A number of new initiatives to support increased participation in higher education by target groups, including Irish Travellers, are being rolled out across the higher education sector.  They include the programme for access to higher education.  In the area of higher education, the Department is seeking to ensure the implementation of the action plan to increase Traveller participation in higher education with the implementation partners, and ensure that students from the Traveller community are supported to enter and successfully participate in higher education.</p><p> While recognising the supports across the education spectrum that are in place to support Traveller participation, the purpose of the action plan is to bring a focus of attention and afford particular priority to certain actions aimed at increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  While it is evident that progress is being made, we still have work to do to increase educational outcomes overall.</p><p> My colleague and I are happy to take questions from the committee on the subject.</p></speech>

Our mission is to advocate for the right of all adults in Ireland to quality learning throughout their lives, with a particular emphasis on those who did not benefit from education when they were young or who are under-represented in learning.  We know from the various research that low participation rates of the Traveller community in education begin at an early age and continue into adulthood.</p> <p>  The purpose of our submission was first to highlight the historic policy context, which is well known by members of the committee, that is, Mr. Brian Harvey's research in 2013 on the impact of spending cuts, and the 2017 ESRI report and the 2019 Joint Committee on Education and Skills report on education inequality and disadvantage and barriers to education.</p> <p>  In terms of broader policy context, we welcomed the 2019 EUROSTAT figures, which measure Ireland's adult learning participation rate at 12.5%.  This indication of greater participation is positive but it is important to note it excludes Travellers living in Traveller-specific accommodation.</p> <p>  The committee will also be aware of the European Commission upskilling pathways initiative which seeks to provide new learning pathways for all citizens but with a focus identified by Government on building pathways to learning for marginalised groups, such as members of the Traveller community.</p> <p>  I refer to the role of community education and how it supports the equality of access to education for under-represented groups.  It is a particularly effective way of engaging learners and its supportive environment increases engagement of those who have had previous negative experiences of the formal education system.  Community education acts as a first step back to education where learners receive the wrap-around supports that allow them to participate fully in their learning journey.</p> <p>  We know the benefits of community education in terms of overcoming barriers to education and increasing well-being, and we must highlight the disproportionate cuts experienced by the sector over the last decade which curtails providers in responding effectively to the needs of their communities, particularly the Traveller community.  First, we ask the joint committee to support the recommendation in this year's report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to support community education both through increased funding, and to achieve parity of esteem with other sectors in the formal education system.</p> <p>  In the context of today and our submission, we also have a small number of recommendations: to review the impact of cuts to Traveller education; to highlight the positive role models and success stories of Travellers; to address the non-education barriers to engagement, such as housing and childcare; and to support access by Travellers to accredited adult education courses.</p> <p>  I will hand over now to my colleague, Ms McDonagh Clark.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.904" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cathleen McDonagh Clark" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019120300002#F00400"><p>I thank the committee.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I am here in my role as education and training service manager with Exchange House Ireland: National Traveller Service.  Exchange House is a member organisation of AONTAS and I thank AONTAS for also highlighting the voice of our organisation specifically, and of educators working with the Traveller community more broadly.</p> <p>  I am passionate about education.  My image of education is of keys to open doors.  Education should, and must, be about unlocking human potential.  When I say this, I do not mean that we will just unlock the potential of an individual, but that we can, must, and will unlock the potential of Ireland.  It is a win-win situation for everybody.</p> <p>  As an educator working with the Traveller community and as a member of the Traveller community, I am speaking both professionally and personally.  The challenges that this committee is exploring have been in existence for decades and yet have not been remedied - not without trying but still there is something missing.  Educational participation rates and engagement in education remain low and this continues into employment, which has other serious consequences for many of our young people.</p><p>Together we must work to ensure that the opportunities - which is the key word -  available to the rest of Ireland are available to Travellers.  There are practical solutions available that we all know about in order that we see change. </p><p> The first is that funding for education and the wrap-around supports like childcare, transportation, and housing must be increased and spent.  As mentioned by Ms Farrell, the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the barriers to education highlights that without the basic needs of a person being met, it is very hard for them to succeed in other areas.  Looking at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it is very important to be happy.</p><p> Second, we must acknowledge and address the history on our island of prejudice toward the Traveller community.  We must work, as Travellers and settled people alike, to understand each other&rsquo;s histories and place on this island.  Without understanding our histories and ongoing discrimination that is too often based in fear or ignorance, we as educators and policymakers will not be able to believe in a different reality happening that allows for positive change.  The only people that can make that reality is us and it is a win-win situation for everybody.</p><p> The third is that we must make access to education flexible and ensure that the educational opportunity is accessible and meets the needs of the communities we are serving.  If we continue a system of education like we have, which is built around what makes sense on Marlborough Street and Merrion Street, then we will not succeed.  We must build a system that unlocks doors for people and welcomes them inside and that always recognises the individual and what they can contribute to the community, society and our country. </p><p> I will finish now with a story of personal experience.  I am a woman from the Traveller community.  My parents instilled in me a passion for learning.  As I grew up, I engaged with the education system and left school early, but went back to third level and did many different courses, which I will not go into now or we will be here all day.  </p><p> Thankfully, my participation was supported financially.  Without financial support from the State, I would not be here today and could not have afforded to have done it without it.  However, the greatest barrier I faced was a system that did not see my potential.  I was asked more than once why I was there.  My greatest support were the people who did see my potential.  </p><p> To have positive change in Ireland we need to see the potential in everyone, whether Traveller, settled, migrant, or otherwise.  If we do not see and support that potential, we will do a financial and social disservice to ourselves and the country.  Let this generation make a difference.</p></speech>

The vision of that plan is to ensure that the student body participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population.  The plan identifies Irish Travellers as one of the target groups that is currently under-represented in higher education.  Improving participation rates in higher education for members of the Traveller community is, therefore, a priority goal for the HEA and the wider higher education sector. </p> <p>  In our submission to the committee, we discuss the targets set for Traveller participation in higher education and progress to date.  The progress review of the national access plan published last December showed that there were 41 Traveller students in the 2016-17 academic year.  This is disappointing, given that the baseline at the commencement of the plan was 35.  It is encouraging that there was a significant increase in 2017-18 to 61, but we are still some way off the target in the national access plan of 80 students by 2019.  There are probably more Travellers in higher education than formally recorded but determining the actual numbers is ultimately dependent on self-identification by the students concerned.  </p> <p>  Policy interventions and actions have been put in place to support the goals of the national access plan and in order to increase the participation rate of all plan target groups, including Irish Travellers. </p> <p>  As part of budgets 2016 and 2017, the Government committed &euro;16.2 million in funding over three years for the programme for access to higher education fund, PATH.  This comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education and consists of three strands.  This funding covers all target group students, which means members of the Traveller community can benefit from the range and diversity of projects funded.</p><p>PATH 1 seeks to increase the number of students from under-represented groups entering initial teacher education.  Our submission to the committee describes some of the projects funded under this strand and the impact they have had in respect of students from the Traveller community.  The committee will be aware of the PATH 1-funded project, Tobar, arising from the meeting with Marino Institute of Education last week.</p><p> PATH 2 is the 1916 bursary fund that provides financial support to students identified by clusters of higher education institutions as being most economically disadvantaged from specified target groups.  Funding of &euro;6 million has been provided over a three-year period, commencing in 2017-18.  The fund supports 200 bursaries a year with each bursary in the amount of &euro;5,000 per annum.</p><p> As noted in our submission, students from the Traveller community have been successful in applying for bursaries.  In the most recent academic year, 2018-19, 13 students from the Traveller community received bursaries from a total number of 17 who applied.</p><p> PATH 3 supports institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education by specified groups.  Funding of &euro;7.5 million will be provided over three years to the clusters of higher education institutions.  Projects with a focus on Travellers include an education programme in the mid-west cluster of institutions and a Traveller-focused work package in the south cluster.  Our written submission also outlines some of the other supports available to Traveller students in higher education such as the student assistance fund.</p><p> Through their access and student support services, higher education institutions can provide support and care for all students.  Our institutions are aware of the challenges faced by students from the Traveller community and all are committed not only to increase the number of Traveller students but also to ensure that the institution is a welcoming and supportive environment for them.</p><p> In addition to PATH and existing supports, the Department of Education and Skills published an action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education last week.  The action plan will bring coherence to initiatives and will play an important role in bringing the issue of Traveller participation higher on the higher education policy agenda and monitoring progress towards the targets set in the national action plan.</p><p> There was significant attendance from Traveller organisations at the third national access forum held in March 2019 and a Traveller student took part in a panel discussion on building partnerships and breaking down barriers.  Similarly, a student success symposium held in October saw a Traveller student take part in a student-led discussion on their college experience.  In 2020, the HEA will also conduct a study on mature student participation that as part of its terms of reference will examine the challenges and barriers faced by mature students who are members of the Traveller community.</p><p> The HEA recognises that members of the Traveller community are still subject to many forms of discrimination and that many have felt that higher education has not been a realistic option or pathway for them.  However, the HEA is committed to working with Traveller groups, the Department of Education and Skills and our higher education system to ensure that the goals and targets for Travellers in the national access plan are achieved, and that Travellers are equitably represented in the higher education student population.  The work of this committee also supports these goals and we look forward to hearing the members&rsquo; views on these important matters.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.910" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Inez Bailey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019120300002#H00300"><p>NALA is grateful to the special committee for the invitation to present on adult literacy, its impact on the Traveller community and recommendations for change.</p> <p>  NALA is a charity that advocates for improving adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills supports.  Part of our work is raising awareness of literacy and an example of this is captured in a video, the link to which was provided to members.  It features Margaret Donovan from Ennis who is a member of the Traveller community and talks about her experience of returning to learning.  NALA&rsquo;s goal is to ensure that all Travellers who want to improve their literacy, numeracy and digital skills can do so.</p> <p>  In Ireland, 520,000 adults, one in six or 18% of the population, find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult.  This means more than 500,000 adults have difficulty reading and understanding a leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions.  Similarly, one in four scored at the lowest level of numeracy.  This equates to more than 750,000 adults not being able to do basic calculations such as dividing up a bill.  For the Traveller community the literacy issue is even starker with an estimated half of Travellers having poor functional literacy.</p><p>Unmet adult literacy and numeracy needs have devastating consequences for individuals, communities and the economy.  They are a factor in social exclusion and inequality.  The World Literacy Foundation states that the people who live with literacy needs &quot;are faced with the prospect of poor health outcomes, welfare dependency, a lack of social cohesion, a higher level of crime and lack of self worth.  Poor literacy also limits a person's ability to engage in activities that require either critical thinking or a solid base of literacy and numeracy skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Low literacy is costing our society and economy in terms of poorer health, productivity, weak employment and earning potential, welfare dependency, less involvement in society as well as intergenerational disadvantage for children and families.  It is time to invest in people who have not benefited from our education system during the bust or boom.  It is time to prioritise the furthest behind first.<br/><br/>UNICEF states that Travellers are still falling between the cracks, with the vast majority of Travellers ceasing education before junior certificate level.  Pavee Point's submission to this committee highlights the grave educational disadvantages experienced by the Traveller community including the following:  Only 13% of Travellers complete secondary education in comparison to 92% of the general population; 28% of Travellers leave school before the age of 13 compared to 1% of general population; the majority of Traveller children live in families where the mother has either no formal education or primary education only; and half of Travellers have poor functional literacy. <br/><br/>Since the economic crash in 2008, specific supports for Traveller education have been withdrawn and the focus was to mainstream Travellers into the education system.  In 2016, the European Commission assessment of Ireland stated:</p><blockquote>	A mainstreamed approach is only sufficient when outcomes are identical for all components of the target groups; when evidence shows a clear gap between the situation of Roma and Travellers versus the rest of society policies should be adjusted and specific measures should also be developed. </blockquote><p>A 2017 ESRI report entitled, A Social Portrait of Irish Travellers, noted that &quot;the depth of educational disadvantage experienced by Travellers means that specific, targeted additional supports will be required<b></b>in order for them to participate in mainstream education on equal terms&quot;.  Last Tuesday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, who has responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, launched the Action Plan to Promote Traveller Participation in Higher Education.  While welcome, we also need a broader action plan for Traveller education in further education and training.  <br/><br/>The adult skills survey is entitled the programme for the international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC, which provides the most up-to-date statistics on the adult literacy and numeracy skills levels of those of working age since the most recent survey in 1997.  Back then, the poor results for Ireland propelled significant action that saw annual increases in participation and resources for the next decade.  However, since 2009, and despite the very disappointing results of PIAAC in 2013, investment and participation rates have stagnated.<br/><br/>Ireland's first national skills strategy set the target to reduce the numbers of adults with less than upper secondary education to 7% by 2020.  While its school and higher education performance targets were reached or surpassed, we failed to reach the low skills target.  The same target was rolled over into the current national skills strategy to be achieved by 2020 along with the same approach.  With 12.4% of persons aged between 15 and 64 in employment having less than upper secondary education, this target will not be reached again.  This fact alone illustrates the inadequacy of the approach and resources to tackle the scale of the adult literacy and numeracy issue in Ireland.  There remains an outdated view that this challenge will fade with time based on school attendance.  In reality, there is a crisis in the learning outcomes for many in society, in particular in the Traveller community.  We acknowledge the contribution of the Department of Education and Skills and the Educational  and Training Boards Ireland that cater for more than 60,000 participants in adult literacy services, costing less than &euro;600 per person but it is clear that we need a better resourced and co-ordinated effort by Government. <br/><br/>Currently, NALA is working bilaterally with nine Departments and their agencies on policies aimed at building literacy and numeracy competence across a number of areas, including health and finance.</p><p>This experience, along with similar recent developments to address the literacy issue in The Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and Belgium, has guided NALA to call for a whole-of-Government approach<b></b>that would bring a co-ordinated national effort to radically reducing the numbers of people with literacy and numeracy needs.  This should include an action plan for Traveller education in further education and training, in partnership with national Traveller organisations.<br/><br/>Literacy is a barometer of equality and changes lives.  Ireland can do better to give everyone a fair chance to thrive in their literacy development.  This requires investing in people who have not benefited from our education system to date.  That requires greater prioritisation within the Department of Education and Skills of adult literacy and better alignment of policies and strategies across different Departments.<br/><br/>I thank the members for listening.  Our written submission has more detail on our vision for literacy.</p></speech>

ETBs manage and operate community national schools, second-level schools, further education colleges, and a range of adult and further education centres in communities throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  ETBs have a long-standing tradition of supporting the educational development of members of the Traveller community.  As State schools, ETB schools are open to all pupils regardless of any aspect of their identity, the culture of which is underpinned by the core values of excellence in education, care, equality, community and multi-denominational.</p> <p>  In preparation, and to inform this submission to the committee, ETBI references the views and experiences of directors of schools, directors of further education and the training and ETB school management.</p> <p>  Education and training boards provide access to a range of education programmes in both the post-primary and further education and training sectors as part of its broad educational provision and prioritises delivering a responsive educational service to members of the Traveller community as a significant target group, particularly at further education level.  ETBs have a long-standing tradition of supporting the educational development of all members of the community, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.  As State schools, ETB schools are open to all pupils regardless of any aspect of their identity.</p> <p>  At post-primary level, research in the education sector has long reflected the importance of family engagement in education as a driver of improved student achievement, reduced absenteeism and raised expectations for parents and guardians.  Positive connections between family, community and school supports provide for greater engagement with formal schooling, leading to a positive impact on access and retention rates.</p> <p>  These research findings have been demonstrated in our response from schools with Traveller students, who have highlighted the perceived low status of the benefit of education and the Traveller parents' and guardians' negative experience of schools as key influencers of low participation rates.  Often challenged by the complexities of the formal school system and engaging with school authorities, parents and guardians of Traveller students frequently disengage from an environment that is more often than not perceived to be outside their comfort zone.</p> <p>  Separately, it was noted by schools in our sector that the loss of the visiting teacher for Travellers service in recent years has further compounded the communication challenges and opportunities for meaningful connections, which had been embedded and valued.  While we acknowledge the abolition may have been in line with the Department of Education and Skills policy of phasing out segregated Traveller provision, elements of the support provisions - access, participation and outcomes - remain key priority challenges.</p> <p>  While many schools, including those in the ETB sector, have access to a range of supports, including those specifically under the general allocation model for special education needs, these supports need to go beyond this model.  Supports and resources, particularly those which align to the principles and practice of inter-cultural education and subsequently extend to initial teacher education and ongoing professional learning and development, are vital.</p> <p>  At further education and training, FET, level, the delivery of education and training boards is guided by the Solas FET strategy.  Active inclusion is a key element of the strategy, with the FET sector seeking to increase levels through the provision of high-quality, more accessible and flexible education, training and skill development interventions and supports suited to the individual.</p><p>In the upskilling pathways recommendation, members of the Traveller community have been identified as a priority group, benefittng from assistance in helping members to acquire a broader set of skills.  Tuition is offered on a full-time or part-time basis, with flexible options offered in regard to time, duration and location.  At this level, tutors and support personnel involved in the provision of direct tuition and aligned support and guidance can themselves avail of ongoing professional development, including diversity training. </p><p> Our written submission refers to current figures relating to Traveller participation in ETB further education and training programmes.  While the data are based on self-disclosure of ethnicity and may not be fully reflective of all Traveller participation, they do give some indication of participation levels to date. The national programme and learner support system, PLSS, records information on learners enrolled in ETB programmes.  The data indicate that Youthreach participation, in particular, presents an attractive option for young adult members of the Traveller community. </p><p> Barriers to participation in further education and training are documented in the SOLAS report of 2017.  Some of those noted &ndash; low confidence and low self-esteem, a negative experience of education and a lack of awareness &ndash; are evident in, but not exclusive to, the Traveller community.</p><p> ETBI has noted that a revised strategy on Traveller education needs to be cognisant of the cultural, specific and organic nature of school and societal environments relating to Traveller inclusion, and we have made several proposals and recommendations aligned to these priorities in our written submission.</p><p> We thank the committee for inviting ETBI to engage with it on these issues and affording us the opportunity to reflect the varying impacts and experiences of the ETB sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.916" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019120300002#L00200"><p>I have a couple of questions, mostly for Ms Ryan, Ms Bailey and either Mr. Hughes or Ms Sheehan.  I will start with Ms Ryan.</p> <p>  I remember that there was funding available a few years ago, and colleges were only going to be able to access a particular fund based on how well they were doing in terms of their access rates.  Is there is still a tie between university funding and access?  If so, do we need to dig down further into it and have a specific funding stream for Traveller access?  Some universities get access right and some do not.  People have the idea that access is just about getting a place but that is very much not the case.  Ms McDonagh spoke about having the financial support at third level to be able to complete an education.  How do we measure access in each university?  How do we audit it?  How do we judge whether a university is actually providing access from the point of walking in the door until the point of completing a degree, including a Master&rsquo;s degree, or a PhD, such that the access heading follows the student right through the education system?  It would mean that irrespective of the supports the student needs, be they financial, emotional, familial, social or cultural, the access package should be much wider than one that just implies the granting of a place in university, which is somehow seen as an access route.</p> <p>  A few years ago, perhaps when I was on the board of Trinity College, funding was tied to access.  I cannot really remember what the path was.  Could Ms Ryan clarify that?</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Hughes or Ms Sheehan.  I remember reading the report of the committee on educational disadvantage that was set up years ago within the Department.  The report was not taken on board at the time.  I believe Ms Ann Louise Gilligan may have been the chairman of the committee, group or task force at the time.  DEIS came into existence as it was being disbanded.</p><p>Many will say I am wrong but I believe the evidence will start to come out over the next few years that DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, has failed.  The purpose of DEIS was to narrow the gap between disadvantaged and better-off communities.  Although literacy and numeracy has increased, it has increased at a national rate.  If working class and settled kids are failed by DEIS in terms of third level progression, how can we do a review of the system to ensure it can be enhanced and more robust?  If we are looking at access right from birth, do we need a DEIS system where the supports follow children and are relative to the situation of particular minority groups or families?  Do we need to get down much more to the actual individual supports of DEIS rather than only the school supports?  Sometimes DEIS supports get spread out in a such a way that the kids who most need support do not actually get it.<br/><br/>Every year I attend the Education World Forum for education ministers.  Ireland has failed to be represented at it because it does not take up the invite.  I have learned much about access to education from ministers around the world over two days.  One year I sat on a panel with Eric Hanushek who wrote <i>Education Quality and Economic Growth</i>.  As Ms Bailey said, it comes back to bad literacy rates being an indicator of inequality levels.  Eric Hanushek presented his research and showed how countries with a higher rate of GDP <i>per capita</i>also have higher literacy and numeracy rates.  Instead of looking at smaller plasters to solve problems, is the Department looking at increasing GDP <i>per capita</i>if we want to address inequality and educational disadvantage?<br/><br/>Ms Bailey gave the figures for literacy as a whole.  Has there ever been a Traveller-specific survey carried out?  Whatever funds are set aside for literacy as a whole, there is no real understanding of how much of that is targeted towards actual communities rather than just individuals struggling with literacy.</p></speech>

In that core grant, there is an extra weighting for all students who come into the institution from the national access target groups.  That would include Travellers and would be an extra 33% on the standard funding for every student.  That funding follows the student throughout his or her higher education journey, from first year to completion.  That supports the institution in putting in place the pre-entry and, most important, the post-entry supports to help the student through the system.  This ensures whatever supports, be they academic or social, are in place to enable them to complete successfully.  Access is about retention and completion too.</p> <p>  Within the national access plan, there is an objective about student success.  The completion rates for students from the target groups are somewhat lower &ndash; but only marginally lower - than completion rates more generally.  We chair a student success working group which comprises representatives and stakeholders throughout the sector.  We work closely with the national forum for teaching and learning to identify what works for student success, particularly for the target groups, identifying good practice and how can it be shared across the system and put in place in other institutions.</p> <p>  We had a student success symposium in October at which we brought together students and listened to the student voice as to what works and what initiatives are supporting students to successful completion.  Traveller students were very much part of that symposium, both in the audience and panel-led discussions.</p> <p>  In addition to the core funding and student success initiatives, all institutions would have an access infrastructure in place.</p><p>That access infrastructure also manages the financial supports as well as the other supports and the student assistance fund.  That is available to all students, particularly students from the target groups.  The path 1 bursaries are also available to students to apply for, and Traveller students have a very high success rate in securing those bursaries when they apply.  The other path funding to which I referred is an additional funding stream for institutions to put in place both pre-entry and post-entry supports such that there is a holistic perspective on access, not just getting through the door of the institution.</p></speech>

The Irish language has proved in the first year to be a barrier to moving students straight towards the teaching profession to help diversify the profession.  They are ending up having to take on, say, arts degrees instead of primary education degrees.  Are some of these issues being addressed?  There are still massive barriers for students who are in path 1 funding.  They should be seen as access students but the standard of Irish in the end-of-year test in some of the universities is posing a huge barrier.  It is an even greater standard than that which would have been required of them had they gone off their leaving certificate Irish results.  Is Ms Ryan aware of any of those complications that have come up?</p></speech>

Primary teaching has a specific Irish requirement, and that is a barrier for some students from the target groups.  A lot of the path 1 funding has been directed at putting in academic supports quite early on in the second level cycle to enable students to reach the entry standard required.  We are conducting a review of path 1.  It is now into its third year of operation and we will submit a report on its initial years to the Department early in the new year.  Some of the issues to which Senator Ruane referred may come up in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.922" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Sheehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019120300002#N00400"><p>I take on board the comments Senator Ruane made about the educational disadvantage task force but, overall, DEIS is seen to be making improvements.  We acknowledge, however, that in the area of Traveller outcomes and education we need to do an awful lot more.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Hughes, mentioned the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, pilots.  We see huge potential in those in identifying the barriers and coming up with solutions to them.  As Mr. Hughes mentioned, the pilot is in four areas and has been established in three of them.  Within the three areas we cannot say at this stage what the level of participation of Traveller students will be but it has the potential to reach more than 1,000 students.  We have 679 children enrolled in the schools in the three pilot areas established.  The one that is not established yet is Cork.  In Galway, Dublin and Wexford there are 679 students at primary level and 341 pupils at post-primary level, so the reach to those families, to the children and their parents, will be fairly substantial.</p> <p>  Regarding the scope of the project, with the teams working together, we have very firmly set guidelines on what should be done.  There is a national pilot oversight group, and in each area there will be a local pilot steering group which will identify its local needs and come up with its local plan.  It is very much a matter of developing relationships with local and Traveller communities; working with schools to address and identify the in-school barriers to attendance and participation; working with parents to support their children's participation in school; encouraging and supporting attendance in early-years services; liaising with statutory, community and voluntary services to enhance attendance, participation and retention; supporting the children in transitions from preschool to primary, post-primary and on to junior cycle and transitions into further and higher education; developing a local action plan, as I mentioned, informed by local data and identified needs; working with partner Departments to share the learning outcomes of the programme; being flexible and creative in developing innovative approaches to supporting Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and retention; and exploring and collaborating with other community and statutory initiatives that can support the programme, such as DEIS initiatives or, for example, the Yellow Flag programme.</p> <p>  Within the project, universal interventions will be available to all pupils along with target interventions for specific individual pupils or groups of pupils.  It is envisaged that the majority of Traveller and Roma children enrolled in the schools will interact with the universal interventions.</p><p>The pilot project is being evaluated.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has commissioned research.  The first strand of that is to gather baseline information on the position in these areas, very much focusing on qualitative research, interviews with parents, schools and pupils.  Part of that research will involve researchers working with local pilot teams to develop instruments for how they will measure success and monitor the project.  How does one measure engagement or a sense of belonging?  That research will inform, at an early stage, where the Department needs to provide further investment and determine what are the issues  We see it allowing for greater dialogue between schools, students and parents to try to build trust, gain an understanding of what is happening to prevent children progressing and then inform the Department when it takes policy actions to address issues.</p></speech>

Even though we see successes with more kids completing the leaving certificate, which I do not deny, we must always refocus on the fact that inequality has increased.  We need a DEIS system to narrow that gap, not one that sees it widen over the years.  That is my main point.  DEIS is failing.  We see progression to leaving certificate but it is not narrowing the gap and that is where we need to remain focused.  I welcome the pilot programme and wish it every success.</p></speech>

The most recent data we were able to find were in the Traveller health study provided by the Department of Health.  I presume, since the Department is so concerned about the health outcomes for the Traveller community that it recognises adult literacy and numeracy issues as a major barrier to better health.  We are supportive of the idea of trying to get data.  Similar to what we heard from the HEA, the data have driven the action plan for Travellers in higher education.  We think that if there were data on the levels of adult literacy among the adult Traveller community, it would be informative for an action plan for adult Travellers in further education and training.</p></speech>

There is a lot of work going into improving educational opportunities across all sectors, including disadvantaged people and the Traveller community.  If one goes back to the facts that the Chair stated at the outset, it is disappointing that we are not achieving the learning outcomes that we would like.  We need to drill down into why that is happening.  I know that some recommendations and points have been raised today about how we should address that.  The main message that I am getting is about opportunity, removal of barriers and supports.  Those are the three aspects that are needed to help the Traveller community, which we are addressing specifically today, to improve its learning outcomes.</p> <p>  I have questions for Mr. Hughes from the Department.  I acknowledge the policy of the Department whereby all educational supports have been mainstreamed for those who are disadvantaged.  I welcome the pilots that he mentioned.  Outside of those, has there been a specific evaluation to measure the impact of educational supports for Traveller children since the change was made?</p><p>It was a substantial change.  I understand why it was made and I acknowledge the supports that were provided through DEIS schools, some of which are in my own area.  The DEIS school is a kind of catch-all.  Many people benefit from being in such a school who may not need the benefit while many who are not in them fall through the net.  While the intention is good, there is a lot of space for people to fall through the net in the education system.  An evaluation of that is required because the facts and statistics speak for themselves.  People are falling through the net.  I would be interested to hear a response.</p><p> I presume the pilot schemes that were mentioned are a hybrid whereby the mainstream supports are maintained but there is a lack of learning outcomes or lack of educational attainment, and I am speaking specifically about Traveller education, and the intention is the pilot schemes would address that through additional resources.  The witnesses might clarify that point.  If it is the case, I am not sure why we need the pilot schemes because we are hearing already what the statistics are and we hearing from those like NALA and AONTAS where the problems and the barriers are.   We should do the pilots and learn from them, but the information is available, with due respect, and if it is, why are we not taking the recommendations?</p><p> I commend the Government announcement this week on access to higher education for the Traveller community.  However, there is a significant omission, which is also noted in the contributions today from the ETBs and NALA, that there is no action plan for further education and training.  I would have thought that should come first, before higher education.  With due respect to higher education, I came through the ETB system and think it is a fabulous system in every single community in the country, whereas higher education is a step further away.  Having come through the system, I went on to further education and higher education.  We should start by prioritising need, and further education and training would seem an obvious place to start to assist people in the Traveller community who may need to go on.</p><p> We are not all academics and that is a big problem.  We are funnelling all our young people into academia, when there are major opportunities in the vocational system.  I want to know from the Department why we do not have an action plan in that area.</p></speech>

That team is a significant resource in addition to what is in place.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that we know progress has not been made.  However, we need to be very clear what appropriate supports need to be put in place to make improvements.  A lot of work is ongoing on the barriers that exist and the Chairman mentioned the issue of reduced timetables.  Is it appropriate to respond to that now? </p></speech>

The issue of reduced timetables has not been reported, so we are not able to monitor use at this stage.  The first step is that the guidelines are going to address that and there will be mandatory reporting by schools to the Tusla educational support service.  We will then be able to monitor and ascertain their use and it is anticipated that it will reduce situations where it is being used inappropriately.</p> <p>  There have been consultations with stakeholders in that regard and, when they are completed, the guidelines will be finalised.  There have also been consultations with the Traveller groups on this, and a draft of the guidelines was sent for feedback.  Progress is being made on that and it is hoped it will be finalised before Christmas.</p></speech>

ETBs report to SOLAS annually on their plans for provision to identify priority cohorts, including Travellers, through the funding streams.  There are a number of initiatives and supports to try to ensure equal opportunities for Travellers in the further education strategy and in SOLAS's plans.  They include the use of a dual approach of mainstream and tailored provision for engagement of Travellers,; developing the delivery of programmes specifically tailored and targeted at identified cohorts of Travellers, for example, Traveller men or women or young Travellers; close co-operation with local Traveller representative groups and community groups, with particular success reported with regard to engagement with Traveller women groups; and using an interagency approach by collaborating with stakeholders to develop partnerships to identify needs and implement strategies to increase access opportunities for Travellers and promote awareness of further education and training in the Traveller community.</p></speech>

For this reason, we should prioritise and focus on where we can achieve maximum success.  We should have an action plan for higher education.  We need community modules.  The ETB system is in every community in the country and the ETB representative can speak for himself.  I served on a vocational board for many years. ETBs are in every community and they are standing by to assist, if given the resources to do so.  For this reason, I cannot understand why we do not have specific targeted resources for ETBs to assist in Traveller education.  Going back to the olden days when we had the group certificate, people who did not want to do the leaving certificate had a step so they could transfer to an apprenticeship or training.  We see the great work being done by the Department on apprenticeships in so many areas.  We do not have just the traditional craft apprenticeships.  The answers are here in front of us.  We just need joined-up thinking from the Department to work with the organisations and just do it.  The network is there.  The skilled people in the ETBs are there.  The Traveller community is struggling but we have the ETBs on our doorstep and we are not utilising them.  We need an action plan in this area before we start to speak about all of the other complexities.</p></speech>

With regard to the failure of DEIS, we know the graphs for adult literacy and numeracy have risen in parallel and it is not a diversion model.  While nationally we are showing good success in the increase in literacy and numeracy, DEIS schools have shown excellent success in remaining parallel with the graph.  The nail has been hit on the head with regard to individual support.  The support must follow the child regardless of what school the child goes to, DEIS or non-DEIS.  The designation of a DEIS school needs to be looked at by the Department.  I agree that DEIS supports are very good and we have run very successful schools.  My school has 135 members of the Traveller community and we are proud of them all.  We have shown very good progression but-----</p></speech>

DEIS home school liaison supports were provided to us, as previously mentioned.  The major resource we lost is 1.5 hours per student.  This means the loss of a huge number of teachers in a school such as ours who served the Traveller community and served all children equally.</p><p> There is a barrier in further education in that the person has to self-identify as a Traveller.  The work experience element is also an issue in that all students have work experience in further education.  Whether we like it or not, there is a barrier in this area and, thus, a discrimination against Travellers entering the workforce and it needs to be addressed.  It is fair to say that further education and apprenticeships are employment-led in providing employment for people.  To pursue an apprenticeship, a person must be registered for an apprenticeship scheme.  </p></speech>

As stated by Senator Ruane, we have to face the fact that we have a failed system in respect of Travellers.  The facts speak for themselves.

The education committee has done a great deal of work on the rights to education and access to education for vulnerable people, including a session on Traveller children.  Senator Ruane and I take great pride in the committee's work, which shone a light on the issue of reduced timetables.  I welcome what the Department is doing to follow up on that issue.  The engagement we had following publication of the interim report indicated that the issue would be grasped once and for all.  As mentioned, one of the key issues was the lack of monitoring of reduced timetables.  We had only anecdotal evidence in that regard but we had heard from representatives of Traveller groups about how they are negatively impacted in regard to reduced timetables.  The commentary from the witnesses in this regard is welcome news.</p> <p>  On the basics of education, in this country every child has a right to an education.  However, it must be recognised that not every child is equal before he or she starts education.  We need to put in place measures and supports to level the playing field.  We hear much about equality of opportunity.  As mentioned at a previous meeting of this committee, this is not about equality of opportunity; it is about the equality of the conditions surrounding the young person who is presenting.</p></speech>

I support the DEIS scheme.  It is a very good scheme but I believe it needs to be tweaked and there should be dedicated teachers for Travellers.  I know from my engagement with principals and teachers in schools that lost this vital service that they believe this does not serve Traveller children well.  There is need for additional supports alongside the DEIS scheme.  I do not believe one should replace the other.  Should consideration be given to having different levels of disadvantage?  It is important that the focus is not on blanket disadvantage because different groups of people and children experience different levels of disadvantage.  We also need supports for non-formal education.  Non-formal activities play as important a role as formal education in supporting vulnerable education users.</p></speech>

Major investment has gone into the new special education model for the allocation of teachers.  That commenced fully this year, but was piloted in the two years prior to that.  More than &euro;1.9 billion has been invested, which is an increase of 52% since 2011.  Many supports are going into schools and it is important that we look to see and be sure about how those supports are being utilised.  Schools need to be able to cater for the diverse cohorts of children now entering.  We are increasingly moving away from segregation and towards trying to ensure that teacher capacity exists.  Initial teacher education will focus on preparing teachers to meet the needs of all children in schools, including Traveller children.  We also want to ensure that continuous professional development, CPD, will be examined as well.</p> <p>  Touching on Senator Coffey's point regarding further education, I should have mentioned that there is an investment of approximately &euro;800 million in that sector in literacy and numeracy.  We have an education sub-committee within the national Traveller Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, which has representatives from all the different elements of the Department, from early years to further and higher education, as well the Traveller representative groups.  That education sub-committee is committed to implementing the 31 actions in NTRIS, which are across the life cycle.  A number of those actions concern further education, while some 15 or 16 others relate to primary and post-primary education.  We are going to work on that with Traveller groups in January 2020 in respect of setting indicators and on having an implementation plan.  </p> <p>  We had a meeting with the group, which brought SOLAS and the ETB in to meet the Traveller representative groups some months ago.  We will also follow up on that meeting.  Regarding a plan, all of the actions within NTRIS cover many of these issues.  They may not make specific identification, but they are broad enough to identify where there are further needs and where we need to be addressing and directing our investment.</p></speech>

To echo the point made by Senator Ruane, there is no homogeneous group of marginalised learners who all have the same access issues.  Regarding community providers, I work in a community education setting where there are a wide range of access issues.  Those can include geography, childcare, finance or a person's previous negative experiences of the formal education system.  This is where community education has a major role to play, because community education providers understand the needs within their communities.  They are, unfortunately, greatly under-resourced.</p> <p>  Picking up on the point made by Senator Coffey, let us not reinvent the wheel as many answers exist.  I referred already to the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on education inequality.  If some of those measures were implemented, that would address many of these issues.  I say that because community education providers need the resources to be able to support learners.  I will finish with a quick point.  Aontas is celebrating being in existence for 50 years this year.  We had a lifelong learning summit in Croke Park some weeks ago.  One of the key points that came out of one of our discussions was the notion of the hard-to-reach learner.  Many of our learners are telling us that they are not hard to reach, they are just not being listened to.  That is a really important point and that is where initiatives, such as the community education network, are so important to support learners in having their say and strengthening their voices.  The community education providers need to be resourced to do so.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  A number of people have identified the fact that the visiting teachers were important and played a key role in liaising with families, with getting children into school and then progressing them.  How much has the loss of those visiting teachers impacted on children from the community in the form of not attending school, dropping out early and not going past primary level?  The Department's pilot scheme deals with some of that through the school liaison office, but that is only a pilot scheme.</p><p>It is almost ten years since cuts were made to Traveller education funding.  How much has that affected Travellers?  Is there a need to reintroduce those liaison teachers?  I have another question for the Department on the issue of educational welfare officers, EWOs.  We do not have an EWO in my area of Dublin 12 because no replacement was provided when the officer went on maternity leave.  There is no officer in Lucan either.  Are there enough EWOs at present?  Are they embedded in communities?  I ask the departmental officials to tell us exactly how many EWOs are employed and where they are located.</p></speech>

The visiting teacher scheme was disbanded in line with the introduction of the mainstreaming policy but the home school community liaison officers would have taken up the role of the visiting teacher in DEIS schools.  The EWOs are under the remit of Tusla education support service, which is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am not, therefore, in a position to answer the Deputy's questions on EWOs.</p></speech>

That is a serious issue.  Does Ms Sheehan believe that this service should not have been taken out of the Department?  Does she think it should be returned?  The relationship between Tusla and many families in communities of high deprivation, particularly the Traveller community, is quite fractious.  Traveller families have had a negative experience with bodies such as Tusla and may have a more positive attitude to the EWO if it were under the remit of the Department.  Does Ms Sheehan think the decision should be revised?</p></speech>

As members can see from the detailed submission provided by the Department, several initiatives are under way to improve educational outcomes for Travellers at all levels.</p><p>Part of this process includes identifying and addressing barriers to participation and engagement by Travellers in education.  One of these barriers is the practice of operating reduced timetables.  This issue is also being discussed at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and I would like to acknowledge that committee's work on the matter.  My Department has been working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla education support service in drawing up guidelines, which will require schools to notify Tusla when a reduced timetable is proposed.  This will help to ensure that reduced timetables will be limited to those circumstances where they are appropriate. </p><p> I fully support actions to improve educational outcomes for Travellers, which include ensuring that the school setting is a more welcoming environment.  I agree with the principles underlying the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 proposed by the Chairman to provide for the inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum taught by recognised schools in the State.  Recognising and respecting Traveller culture and history ensures that we can build relationships based on trust, respect and understanding across all cultures. </p><p> Officials of my Department participate in the steering group that was established to oversee the development and implementation of the national Traveller and Roma integration strategy, NTRIS, published in 2017.  This strategy provides a framework for interventions across a range of Departments, including education, which is reflected in more than 30 education actions from early years to adult education.  We recognise that Traveller and Roma communities need more focused interventions to drive improvements in educational outcomes.  A pilot project has been established to develop innovative approaches to addressing issues that are impeding educational attainment for this reason.</p><p> In the areas of further and higher education, upon which the Minister of State will expand, through the further education strategy and the national plan for equity of access to higher education, we are working to break down the barriers for target groups to enrol in and complete their chosen area of study.  A progress review of the plan led to the recently published Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021.  As part of the annual further education and training service planning process between SOLAS and the ETBs are now required to consider the needs of a broad range of learners and disadvantaged groups, including Travellers, in their planning and delivery of further education and training.</p><p> I acknowledge that educational outcomes for Travellers fall short of what they should be but progress is being made, as evidenced in the roll-out of the NTRIS pilot projects and the progress report on the action plan for equity of access to higher education and we will continue to build upon this.  A lot of work is ongoing in the Department to address the needs of the Traveller community.  To achieve better outcomes for Traveller students, all stakeholders including parents, educators and Traveller representative groups, need to work together to overcome the barriers that limit educational achievement.  I assure the committee that my Department is taking every action necessary to improve educational outcomes for Travellers.</p></speech>

Our third national access plan for equity of access to higher education sets out our current strategy to address under-representation in higher education by groups identified in the plan.  The plan identifies Irish Travellers as one of the target groups that is currently under-represented in higher education.  Members should note that the plan runs from 2015 to 2019.</p><p>Following the publication of the current national access plan, NAP, the Department launched PATH.  This funding stream enables innovative approaches to support the delivery of targets in the national access plan.  PATH's main objective is to increase participation in higher education by our national access plan target groups, including the Traveller community.  Each of the three new PATH funding strands is expected to have a positive impact on Traveller numbers in higher education.  The three PATH funding streams will help us to better understand and address the barriers to access to higher education for Travellers.  The feedback from students supported by PATH is positive.</p><p> A progress review of the NAP published last year extended the lifetime of the plan to 2021.  This will enable us to gather data under our data plan so that we can make informed decisions regarding the next NAP.  The progress review illustrated that even though there were increases in participation of Travellers in higher education, there remains quite a task ahead to meet the access target, which is a modest target set in the plan.  The baseline of just 35 Traveller students in higher education has increased to 61 in 2017 to 2018.  This is still short of the target of 80, which we will seek to achieve before the end of the current plan in 2021.  Self-identification is the only method by which information on Traveller participation in higher education can be gathered.  In this regard, the progress review highlighted that the number of Traveller students in higher education may be higher than officially recorded, as some Traveller students have chosen not to self-identify.  That in itself shows a fear among some Travellers about declaring their membership of the Traveller community.  This is despite the fact, as I know, that they are very proud to be part of the Traveller tradition.</p><p> Arising from the progress review published in 2018, priority actions were published in the action plan for education in 2019 and a commitment was made to the development of an action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  Following a consultation process, I launched the action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education last week in Technological University Dublin.  The purpose of the action plan is to bring a particular focus of attention and afford particular priority to certain actions.  Its overall objective is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.  </p><p> Progress has been made on increasing participation in higher education by under-represented target groups.  However, we are placing a particular focus on Traveller participation in higher education to ensure we meet the NAP target for this key under-represented group by 2021.  It is intended that the various initiatives under the strands of the programme for access to higher education are aimed at increasing Traveller participation.  This will assist in the realisation of the target and enhance our understanding of the barriers that exist in respect of Traveller participation in higher education.  </p><p> I am grateful to the committee for the opportunity to address it today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-03a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019120300002#W00100"><p>Some of my questions need a small bit of context but I will do it quickly.  My questions are aimed at the Minister, Deputy McHugh, in respect of primary and secondary schools.  There was a conversation earlier where I brought up the whole issue of DEIS.  Sometimes we are afraid to talk about DEIS and the work it does, out of fear of insulting schools, principals and teachers.  Sometimes I think we are protecting something at the higher cost of failing a lot of children.  I fully believe the DEIS system is not adequate.  It has not narrowed the gap between groups but has widened it.  It has definitely widened the gap between settled and Traveller students within the school system.  There is research available, which I am happy to send on to the Department.  There was one important recommendation in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the need to set up a cross-departmental task force on education inequality.  That would take in most of the stuff the Traveller organisations have been talking about for weeks, namely, the cross-departmental impact of many different Departments on a Traveller child progressing through the education system from second to third level.  Does the Minister think it is time the Department carried out an independent review of the DEIS system, perhaps as a longitudinal study?  Were he to talk to schools and teachers privately in some of the most deprived communities, they would tell him something very different from what they say when speaking publicly.  In many schools it is becoming like crisis management, not education.  I really think it is time we acknowledge that DEIS is failing and that it is definitely failing Traveller children in terms of progression through the education system.</p></speech>

When DEIS came in, there was a fear around schools being stigmatised but that fear eroded very quickly as schools saw there was going to be extra resources and extra help.  The underlying determination of DEIS status was primarily geographical.  We have looked at this and are continuing to look at the evaluation of DEIS.  In present-day society, it is not fit for purpose.  There are other schools outside the DEIS categorisation that should be in DEIS.  We are doing the background analysis and are looking at a more targeted system.  There may be affluent geographical areas in which there are still challenges.  There could be geographical areas that have DEIS and have really benefited from it and that progression has continued.  My utterances on this, both privately and publicly, are to state that we should hold on to what we have in terms of the ring-fenced funding of &euro;120 million, of which about &euro;80 million comes from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for school meals programmes.  We will hold on to what we have and ultimately we will be looking at political decisions on funding to add to that &euro;120 million.  That is the space I am in politically but it has to be targeted.  Senator Ruane was talking about inclusion and bridging the gap between members of the Traveller community and mainstreaming in the classroom.  We want to get to a place where we have meaningful inclusion.  We have gone from segregation and exclusion.  We are in that space of inclusion but we have to get meaningful inclusion, which means participation.</p><p>We have weaknesses in achieving that inclusion for Travellers in the school system, as in society in general.  We will continue to work collaboratively with other Departments.  We are working with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs in respect of implementing guidelines on reduced timetables.</p></speech>

Some schools are a year behind on the curriculum.  Some schools are heading into the leaving certificate, including some of the DEIS schools that need more resources and support.  The students are reaching their leaving certificate, only addressing subjects three or four weeks before their mock exams.  Some other schools start them in fifth year.  That cannot continue.  As long as assessments are carried out in-house, we will not get to the crux of some of the issues in the schools that are affecting minority groups and Travellers.  An assessment independent of the Department is needed to get to the truth of what is happening as a result of lack of resources.</p></speech>

That includes Travellers but it is not exclusively about Travellers.  Our committee is looking at Travellers who are within that group.</p> <p>  We have had four weeks of hearings on education and we have heard some distressing and disturbing testimonies from people who have shared their experiences of the educational system, but also in regard to mental health and health issues as well.  Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in said that a misconception and a myth that is often repeated is that Travellers do not value education.  It is very clear that Travellers do.  Representatives of Pavee Point said that Travellers do not so much as drop out, but are pushed out.  That was a very clear statement on their part.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills has done sterling work on researching the reduced timetables, a practice that was hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>  Only 80% of Traveller children transfer from primary school to secondary school.  That is an estimate; we do not have firm figures.  One in four leaves before the age of 13.  Travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without a leaving certificate than the general population.  Only 167 Travellers have accessed third level education and wheels are now turning in respect of that.  NALA produced a new statistic today that half of Travellers have poor functional literacy, putting them at grave educational disadvantage.</p> <p>  All of the steps, including the pilots and the NITRIS, indicate that something is happening.  If it was twice as likely for a Traveller to leave school without a leaving certificate than a settled person, it would be an issue, but it is 50 times.  I asked this question of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly.  Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in education affecting Travellers and that the actions need to be viewed in that light?</p> <p>  I believe the Minister promised in the Seanad that he would take forward the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  When will that be brought before the D&aacute;il?  All the NGOs have called for a national education strategy.  We have an element of it with the higher education strategy.   Senator Coffey identified gaps in further education and we heard about gaps in community education.  We hear of great initiatives such as Tobar in Marino.  It needs to be put on a firm financial footing so that it can do its important work in encouraging teachers from the Traveller community to be nurtured and brought forward.  I understand the Yellow Flag programme is not funded by the Department of Education and Skills but by the Department of Justice and Equality, which I do not understand.  That also needs to be put on a firm financial footing.</p><p>It is about the scale of the job that needs to be done.  The pilots are welcome and what was announced last week for higher education is welcome.  However, are they anything like enough to address the disparities?</p><p> We are having the same conversations here as we are having in Geneva.  Reports will be coming back from Geneva and the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill will be a simple box to tick.  I would like responses from both Ministers.</p></speech>

Let us all accept that we have a challenge here.  My Department and I accept we have an enormous challenge here.  There is no better example to point to than prior to the introduction of DEIS.  That challenge was taken on with DEIS, which tries to use a more inclusive model leading to greater progression.  One of the outstanding features of this morning's Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results was the focus on a more equitable education system.  OECD comparisons show that there is more of a lift for young people, be it in primary or secondary school, getting a better chance of moving on to third level or to apprenticeships or moving on through the system.  We have taken on that challenge and we have much more to do there.</p> <p>  The important emphasis we place on Travellers is shown in recognising Traveller ethnicity and the Chairman's legislation going through the Seanad.  I said in the Seanad that I would be more than happy to bring it before the D&aacute;il.  We are now waiting on the report back from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.</p></speech>

God knows what might happen tonight.</p> <p>  I was present in the Seanad and participated in the debate on that legislation.  I was also part of the decision on the place of history in our junior cycle curriculum.  Part of the positive feedback I have received from history teachers relates to local history now that junior cycle has that flexibility.  There is an abundance of local history and a wealth of information on Traveller culture.  We have a great opportunity and I would like progress in that regard.</p> <p>  Functional literacy requires considerable work.  I worked on a youth project a long time ago.  One of the actions we strongly supported was providing homework clubs for young people in disadvantaged areas.  A number of young Travellers participated in a homework club.  At the time it was primarily Traveller girls and we had that difficulty of getting Traveller boys into that club.  We found other ways for them to participate in formal education, one of which was not as a segregated group but with other young lads from the estate.</p> <p>  It goes back to the Chairman's question on how to have meaningful inclusion and the capacity.  We need to upskill and train teachers to ensure that they have the capacity to deal with the literacy and numeracy challenges for all groups and not just Travellers.  That is at the heart of our system.</p><p>At the heart of my education plan when I came into this Department was the word "cumas&uacute;", meaning empowerment.  My plan aims to empower each individual.  Everyone gains from the wealth of a fully inclusive system, not just Travellers.</p></speech>

We feel that the Department is under-reacting to the scale of the challenge.  While there is a lot happening, we ask whether it is enough.  That is the abiding concern running through all the threads, including mental health, health and education.  Stuff is happening, which is good, but is it enough to address the scale of the crisis?  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, accepted that there is a crisis.  The Minister said there is an enormous challenge in education.  That is the point I wish to make.  I would like to hear from the Minister's colleague in that respect as well.</p></speech>

Members of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills will have heard this.  To reassure the committee, we get the message that there are challenges in this sector.  We hear about them from principals and teachers and we will meet them head on.  Obviously, if there is other information which can add value to that conversation, we are open to hearing it.</p></speech>

It is acknowledged throughout the Traveller community.  Last week, I launched the action plan for increasing Traveller participation in higher education.  I mentioned figures earlier but the Chair is right that there is not meaningful inclusion and in asking whether Travellers drop out or get pushed out.  It was very interesting that there were six students at the launch who were in higher education.  I launched the action plan at that event and I realised that it connected with what these young students were saying.  To give the committee an idea of that, the students said they did not even have the confidence to enter third level.  They felt excluded and that they were not welcome.  They were uncomfortable.  They were bullied and experienced the hate speech which the Chair has talked about so much.</p> <p>  They also talked about what could help them.  Three or four distinct pieces of information came through.  These are included in the action plan.  One relates to the transition from secondary school to third level.  Some do not come through secondary school but via another path.  They talked about the great importance of the access officer in the higher education institutions.  They talked about one good adult helping them to get that confidence.  That came up on numerous occasions.  They talked about having teachers from the Traveller community in the system.  This comes under our path 1 funding, which totals &euro;2.7 million over three years.  I believe the Chair was talking about the Tobar project earlier.</p></speech>

I believe it is on a firm footing.  We aware of the importance of that programme.  One of my most senior colleagues, who is an assistant secretary, was at the meeting and he heard exactly what the students were saying.  We read documents and meet different adults but it was good to hear what the students themselves had to say.</p><p> Other information that was discussed was the schools and universities of sanctuary.  I have visited schools of sanctuary in Galway.  There are six institutions in the higher education universities and institutes of sanctuary.  Again, it is to give students confidence and to welcome them.  It is not just academia.  There is more to education and more going on.  We are trying to understand what prevents students from the Traveller community from going forward. </p></speech>

We have had a very long session but we have had long meetings on other important topics.  We have held three meetings on mental health, two on health, four on education and we will have four meetings on employment.  We are having these meetings because all of these elements are interconnected.  Accommodation will be the final module that we will consider.  We will tell how it is but we will make very direct recommendations while acknowledging that some positive things are happening.  It is the scale of the challenge and of all of those areas that is arresting.  All of us, as committee members, have been shocked anew by the level of disparity between the settled community and Travellers access to education and health, the impact of mental ill health, and employment.  It is shocking that there is an 80% unemployment rate among Travellers at a time we, as an economy, enjoy full employment.  All of these issues must be addressed and taken seriously.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I also thank the representatives of the Department, AONTAS, the ETBs, the HEA and NALA for their attendance.  </p></speech>
