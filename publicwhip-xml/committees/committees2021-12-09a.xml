Deputy Devlin has advised that he will be delayed, as has the Chairman, Deputy Stanley.  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning, we will be engaging with officials from the Department of Social Protection to examine the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 37 - Social Protection, and the Social Insurance Fund.  From the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 report on the accounts of the public services, we will be examining chapter 9, on the regularity of social welfare payments; chapter 10, on the management of social welfare appeals; and chapter 11, regarding controls over the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.</p> <p>  Following last week&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, we also requested an update on the implementation of recommendations contained in chapter 20 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services from 2017, which concerned PRSI contributions, as well as an update on the implementation of a recommendation of the last Committee of Public Accounts arising from its examination of that chapter.  I thank the Secretary General for providing that information at short notice, as well as the information provided in relation to a parliamentary question tabled by me concerning expenditure by the Department in recent years on lighting and heating.</p> <p>  We are joined by the following officials from the Department of Social Protection: Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary for finance; Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary for control; Ms Joan Gordon, chief appeals officer; and Ms Philomena McShane, chief accountant.  We are also joined remotely by Ms Jasmina Behan, principal officer, and Ms Ivana McGarr, assistant principal in the social protection Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, one of today&rsquo;s witnesses is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  The witness has been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist the Broadcasting Unit and the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state their name the first time they contribute.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#B00100"><p>As members will be aware, the Department of Social Protection operates a wide range of income support, welfare and labour activation schemes.  Expenditure on the schemes is divided between two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues, while the Social Insurance Fund is funded mainly from pay related social Insurance contributions.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2020 totalled nearly &euro;30 billion.  This represented an increase of 48% on 2019 scheme expenditure, and included just over &euro;9 billion incurred in 2020 across three new Covid-19 related schemes: the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, scheme; the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS; and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Department&rsquo;s expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;635 million.</p> <p>  At the end of 2019, the accumulated reserves in the Social Insurance Fund were &euro;3.9 billion.  During 2020, receipts into the fund totalled &euro;11.4 billion, while expenditure totalled &euro;14.8 billion.  The result was a deficit for the year of &euro;3.5 billion, and the accumulated reserves had fallen to &euro;453 million at the end of 2020.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2020.  However, I drew attention in my report on the Vote account to a material level of non-compliance with procurement rules as disclosed in the statement on internal financial control.</p> <p>  I will now turn to chapter 9: regularity of social welfare payments.  For a variety of reasons, some welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled, or that exceed their entitlements.  These are classified as "irregular payments".  The Department conducts periodic control surveys of scheme payments to understand the level and causes of the excess payments that occur.  The results of the surveys point to a material incidence of payments in excess of entitlements under many welfare schemes.  As has been the case for several years, I have drawn attention to this in both audit certificates.</p> <p>  Chapter 10 covers management of social welfare appeals.  When a person is refused a social welfare payment by the Department, he or she can, in most cases, appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.  Overall, the rate of appeal of the Department&rsquo;s decisions on applicants&rsquo; claims is low.  In 2020, appeals lodged represented around 1.3% of the approximately two million decisions that were made in respect of claims for income support and other benefits.  However, the rate of appeal varies between schemes.  For example, more than 40% of the appeals received in 2020 related to just two schemes: disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  In 2020, just under 26,000 appeal decisions were finalised.  In more than half of the finalised cases, the appeals were successful from the perspective of the claimant.</p> <p>  As part of the examination, we analysed a sample of successful appeals in respect of three schemes, to identify why they succeeded.  This indicated that in 70% of the cases examined, material new evidence had been supplied as part of the appeal.  We found in the majority of these cases that the additional information provided at appeal augmented information provided at the original application stage, and that the appeals might have been avoided if the additional information had been provided or elicited earlier.</p> <p>  Chapter 11 examines controls over the Covid-19 PUP scheme.  As members will be aware, the scheme was devised and implemented in a very short period, at the same time as the Department had to adopt significantly restricted work practices.  I am happy to acknowledge that delivery of the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement.  Given the volume of claims that were expected, and the potential loss of staff due to Covid-19, the Department implemented reduced take-on controls over PUP scheme claims when compared to other income support schemes, and recognised at the outset that the risk of overpayments would be higher than normal.  The Department deemed this to be necessary and appropriate, and in the public interest.  I do not disagree with that assessment.  However, the examination found that there was scope subsequently for the Department to make more timely use of opportunities to confirm eligibility for ongoing PUP payments.  The examination reviewed a random sample of claims from employees on the basis they were out of work due to Covid restrictions.  Such employee claimants accounted for 80% of the scheme expenditure in 2020.  We found evidence in records available to the Department that more than 9% of the claims reviewed were not eligible for the payments received on the dates tested.  This suggests there may have been a material level of irregular payments of employee claimants under the PUP scheme.  However, more extensive testing would be required to reach a precise estimate of the level of excess payment for the scheme.</p> <p>  The examination also reviewed a random sample of self-employed PUP claims.  We found that it was not possible to conclude on the eligibility of these claimants, due to the absence of evidence about the level of loss of business turnover due to Covid-19. </p></speech>

Before I call Mr. McKeon, it is important to note that the committee very much appreciates that some of what we will examine today will have happened due to the pandemic.  That is the introduction of the PUP scheme at very short notice.  The amount of work and effort that went into getting the scheme up and running very quickly was a significant factor in avoiding distress for many people.  I thank the officials in the Department for the huge effort.  I acknowledge the point made by the Comptroller and Auditor General that this was a major achievement.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. McKeon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the appropriation account for Vote 37, and chapter 9 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor for the year ending 2020 relating to the regularity of welfare payments, chapter 10 relating to appeals and chapter 11 on the PUP.  I also understand that the committee would like to review the accounts of the Social Insurance Fund and I will be pleased to respond to any questions that members may have on these accounts.</p> <p>  I am joined today by Ms Joan Gordon, chief appeals officer, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary with responsibility for finance, Ms Philomena McShane, the Department&rsquo;s chief accountant, and Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary with responsibility for control policy.  I may, with the Vice Chairman's permission, rely on assistance from my colleagues in addressing some of the questions that members may raise.  I am particularly mindful of the notice given by the Vice Chairman at the beginning of this meeting.  I am a witness outside the curtilage, and I am self-isolating at the moment.</p> <p>  I arranged for an advance copy of this statement together with briefing material on the accounts and the chapters under review, the annual report of the Department, the annual statistics report and other relevant information to be provided to the committee secretariat.  I hope that members found this material to be of use.</p> <p>  I would like to commence by breaking precedent.  Normally, Accounting Officers conclude their statements at this meeting by acknowledging the work of their staff.  I hope that members will agree that, in the context of the 21 months just past, it is appropriate to place my appreciation and my pride in the Department&rsquo;s staff to the forefront of my comments.  The committee may think that this is due to the unprecedented response to Covid-19 crisis, and it is true that the measures taken to flatten the curve in the health domain resulted in an unprecedented peak in demand for income supports and other welfare services.  Over the period, the Department has built not just one but two new IT systems to process approximately 1.8 million claims for the PUP, equivalent to approximately nine years' worth of jobseeker's claims.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s staff processed more than 212,000 claims for the special Covid-19 illness payment, introduced a new enterprise support grant, implemented new flexible arrangements for rent supplement, rolled out online and telephone-based services for the General Register Office, GRO, appeals, medical assessments and employment services and developed new IT functionality to provide attributed or full social insurance contributions to people who were laid off during the Covid pandemic.  We also implemented a new protocol for victims of domestic abuse.  All of this was Covid-related and I could go on.  The Department has now distributed or funded some &euro;17.4 billion in expenditure on Covid-related supports.  Just as we thought we were making progress in transitioning back to normal operations, staff again worked over the past weekend to put a new PUP scheme in place and are already processing claims into payment for next week.</p><p> However, the past 21 months have not all been about Covid-19.  Having made substantial improvements in processing performance across most of our schemes and in the appeals service over the previous year, we were determined to protect these improvements.  In fact, across most scheme areas, processing performance continued to improve as more online options were implemented and staff adapted to new processes and to working remotely from the office.  To take just one example, carer's allowance claims, which took on average 14 weeks to process in 2019, are now being processed in about four weeks.</p><p> In parallel, staff of the Department rolled out new services including the benefit payment for 65-year-olds.  They developed new services and expanded others as part of the pathways to work strategy, established and supported the work of the Pensions Commission and enhanced our IT security and energy management capabilities.  Again, I could go on.</p><p> The efforts of staff have been recognised in a number of independent awards for customer communications and for professionalism in procurement.  In addition, in a world where cybersecurity and energy management are key concerns, the Department has also, over the past year, been awarded International Organization for Standardization, ISO, certification for information systems security management and for energy management conservation.  Ours is among the first Civil Service Departments to achieve these certifications.</p><p> I will say no more on this subject except for two things.  First, it is not uncommon to hear and see bandwagon criticism of the civil and public service as being cosseted, of not being innovative, of being inefficient or of lacking customer focus.  It may be a vain hope, but I hope that the evidence, not just in my Department but across the public service over the pandemic period, will help dispel these lazy caricatures.  Second, I am hugely proud to be associated with the work of the Department&rsquo;s staff and the 350 other public servants who worked with us on occasions over the past period.  I say "associated" because it is not my work but theirs and I hope the committee will join me in acknowledging that work and offering a heartfelt appreciation.</p><p> The committee will note, from the 2020 accounts, that total expenditure on Vote 37 services and administration, before appropriations-in-aid, amounted to &euro;16.5 billion.  This was &euro;5.6 billion higher than 2019 Vote expenditure of &euro;10.9 billion.  Out of this increase, &euro;5.4 billion related to expenditure on Covid income and employer supports.  Excluding this expenditure, the additional expenditure represented a small increase of 1.9% compared with 2019 spending.  If Covid-related expenditure is excluded from the comparisons, the expenditure for the year amounted to &euro;11.1 billion, an increase of &euro;200 million or 1.9% compared with 2019.</p><p> Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund services amounted to &euro;14.1 billion.  This was an increase of &euro;4.1 billion on the 2019 outturn.  Again, if Covid-related expenditure is excluded, the adjusted figures for 2020 show expenditure of &euro;10.4 billion, an increase of &euro;400 million or 3.7%.  Combined expenditure of &euro;30.5 billion across the spending period represents approximately 15% of modified gross national income for the year.</p><p> It is clear that there are a number of key drivers of this change, with &euro;265 million additional expenditure related to pensions, of which demographics account for &euro;218 million and &euro;47 million is related to pension budget measures.  Similarly, illness and invalidity payments increased by &euro;263 million.  As previously discussed at this committee, these demographic trends are likely to continue with significant implications for expenditure.  This issue was at the heart of the deliberations of the Pensions Commission and members will be aware the commission has made a number of proposals both with regard to mitigating the cost impact and generating the necessary revenue to fund the inevitable increases in expenditure.  These proposals are now being considered by the Government and have also been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  Taking account of inputs from these bodies, it is expected that the Government will provide its response by the end of March 2022.</p><p> Chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report is concerned with control over welfare payments.  Chapter 11 is specifically concerned with control of the PUP.  Chapter 9 makes no recommendations but chapter 11 makes a number of recommendations with respect to PUP payments.</p><p> I have said at this committee before that one of the challenges faced by the  Department is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, designing and managing large-scale service processes that are reliable, efficient and effective for the overwhelming majority of people who use our services and, on the other, implementing controls and checks to assure payment and service integrity.  However, we are mindful in doing this that our primary purpose is to support people who need support and that we cannot pursue the elimination of error or fraud at the cost of unreasonably denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.  This is always a key consideration and never more so than when implementing the PUP.</p><p> Given the volume of claims to be processed, the level of public anxiety arising from the truly dystopian images we witnessed in other countries, the need to ensure people who lost employment due to Government-mandated measures were supported and the imperative to buttress public acceptance of those measures, I believe it was correct, when designing PUP within an incredibly short time period, to accept a higher level of risk and to favour prompt processing over very tight control.  That is not to say that there was no control.  In fact, there was a range of take-on and in-payment controls and while they may not have been as extensive as for normal jobseeker payments, their impact is reflected in the fact that about 500,000 of the claims processed were not awarded.  In addition, in-payment control reviews are associated with about a further 143,000 claim closures.</p><p> It is also notable that although the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report identifies control improvements that could be made, the gross level of overpayment estimated based on a sample of claims reviewed was 9.4%.  In making this estimate the report notes the Department&rsquo;s observation that the figure is arguably inflated by the inclusion in the sample of periods when there was a high level of churn on the scheme.  Excluding these periods, the estimated overpayment level would be about 6%, a figure consistent with data from the work we have since concluded in awarding accredited social insurance contributions.  These estimated figures need to be seen in the context where overpayment levels in welfare administrations, not just in Ireland but around the world, tend to average between 3% and 5%, with high churn schemes such as jobseeker payments having somewhat higher rates.</p><p> It would have been untenable to impose the normal level of control checks and frustrate prompt access to payments during the period of a global pandemic in order to achieve a marginal percentage reduction in overpayment levels.  It is also to be borne in mind that the Department can and will in the coming months review claims paid and, for example, using data matching with Revenue records, identify and pursue recovery of overpayments made.  Any overpayments made will of course be followed up in a reasonable and proportionate manner.  Having said this, I accept that the level of overpayment is material and that it is always possible to do better.  I accept the recommendations in the report are appropriate.  We have accepted them and I can confirm they are being actioned.</p><p> Chapter 10 reviews the approach to management of appeals and contains a number of recommendations.  By way of background, the appeals services, headed by the chief appeals officer, although part of the Department, has statutory independence in the performance of its functions.  Each year it receives and processes about 23,000 appeals, representing about 1.4% of all claims.  As part of the appeals process, it forwards all appeals received to the Department providing the Department with an opportunity to review the decision made based on the appeal submissions of the appellant.  Typically, about 20% of appeals result in revised decisions being made by the Department.  The balance fall to be determined by an appeals officer.</p><p> Overall, taking Department reviews and appeals decisions together, over 50% of appeals, or about 0.7% of first instance decisions, result in a favourable outcome for the appellant.  It is important in saying this to point out that the success rate varies by scheme and, generally speaking, the schemes with higher success rates tend to be schemes that rely on medical evidence as to a person&rsquo;s capacity for work or requirement for care.  While not the only factor at play, it is often the case that appellants submit additional medical information that was not available to the Department.  In order to address this issue, the Department has worked with advocacy groups to revise its application forms and new disability allowance and invalidity forms will be launched in the first half of 2022.</p><p> In terms of processing performance, the appeals process can be quasi-judicial in nature, with all parties to an appeal being provided with the opportunity to submit information and state their case.  This necessarily results in a lengthy process.  Nevertheless, increases in the number of appeals officers in recent years are now bearing some fruit and appeals processing times have improved.  The approach to considering appeals and in particular to interaction between the appeals office and the Department to reduce transaction times is also being reviewed.  It is hoped that this, together with the implementation of a new IT system starting in 2022, will lead to further improvements.  In addition, in order to improve overall management capacity within the office, including quality assurance recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Minister is bringing forward legislation in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill to enable the appointment of more than one deputy chief appeals officer.</p><p> I understand committee members have expressed an interest in discussing issues related to false self-employment and the contracting of public employment services.  Both of these topics were the subject of detailed discussion at this and other committees in recent years, including in response to reports presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>The issue of false self-employment was also the subject of a recent report by the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands.  In order to assist the committee, I have provided additional material in response to questions submitted to the Department last week.  Rather than go into these matters further in this opening statement, I will be pleased to respond to any questions members may have.</p><p> I will conclude, as I have previously, by saying that we, as a Department, although we try to do our best, are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  We pride ourselves on being, and hope we are, open to challenge, criticism and suggestions for improvements.  The process today plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose and helping us to identify areas for improvement and learn from our mistakes. It is through such a process that we hope to improve.  I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

In the context of the Department processing the best part of 700,000 or 800,000 PUP applications in five weeks and Mr. McKeon's attending this meeting while being somewhat unwell, some people might say I should go a little easy on him.  We appreciate him being here.  I know he was feeling unwell.  There are three areas I wish to cover.  They can be divided into questions relating to what is a very unusual period and the PUP, and those that might be asked in a normal period.</p> <p>  I will focus first on non-compliant procurement.  I refer to the list of 92 contracts provided to the committee.  Almost all of those fall into what we might call the provision of local employment service contracts.  Many public representatives and members of the public will be quite surprised to learn that household names in their local constituency that provide valuable local employment services are considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General to have non-compliant procurement.  I suspect that is not a reflection on any of the services those organisations provide but, rather, the procurement process.  I ask Mr. McKeon to address why the Comptroller and Auditor General considers those contracts to be non-compliant.</p></speech>

As a Department, we value local employment services.  I am very aware of and sensitive to the uncertainty the local employment services are currently experiencing.  The situation arises on foot of legal advice the Department received several years ago from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.   That advice was subsequently confirmed by the Attorney General.  We did query it.  Senator Higgins previously provided material and we had that material queried as well.  The clear and unambiguous legal advice is that the process that commenced more than 25 years ago of awarding annual contracts without a competitive procurement process is not compliant with EU procurement rules.  In spite of what some people may think, that is not necessarily advice that we particularly welcomed, but it is the advice we received and we have to respect it and act on it.  As Accounting Officer, I have to make sure I act on it because my statutory function is to try to ensure our procurement is legal.  That is the background to it.  I do not want to make too big a deal out of this but, even leaving aside the legal advice, renewing or rolling over contracts for 25 years without any kind of competitive process is not exactly good governance.  You do get into the classic governance principle in respect of relationships.  The Minister put her position on this issue on the record very clearly in the D&aacute;il last week.  Even apart from the legal advice, it is probably something we might have had to consider anyway.</p></speech>

We have not seen the detailed legal advice obtained by the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, which I think is the entity to which the Deputy is referring.  It is a valuable advocacy group and representative body.  We have not seen the detailed legal advice but we have seen a summary.  It reflects what Senator Higgins previously brought to our attention, and that certainly was discussed with the legal advisers.  The view is that the situation is clear.  There are a couple of points I wish to make on it.  I do not want to get into the detail of what I understand it to be, partly because I am outside the curtilage of Leinster House.  Just because a service is social in nature does not mean it is not also of financial or economic interest.  Those are the two streams within the EU procurement rules.  In a situation where there are other providers available in the market - this is not just the Irish market; it is the EU market - that could provide similar services, then the services have to be tendered.  Effectively, that is the situation.  We did consider that advice but there is no way of getting around this, as far as we can see.  That is certainly the advice of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

Does he accept that although the tendering process may be required, decisions on the number of lots, to move the service from a local employment service to a regional employment service or in respect of the terms of that contract, such as whether walk-ins will be permitted, are decisions of the Department?  I do not wish to discuss the contract, but does Mr. McKeon agree that the conditions of any new contract are decisions of the Department and that, in directing it to have compliant procurement, the Comptroller and Auditor General is not instructing the Department in any way in respect of the issues I have mentioned, such as lot sizes, the number of lots and the conditions of the contracts?</p></speech>

Although I do not wish to speak for the Comptroller and Auditor General, I think it is fair to say that he is not directing us; he is observing that the procurement to date is not compliant.  It is a matter then for the Department to respond on that.</p> <p>  As regards the tender design, part of the process we took when we first became aware several years ago of the obligation to tender these documents was to take a deliberate and careful approach to how we go about it.  We commissioned Indecon to prepare two reports on local employment services and jobs clubs.  We then commissioned the Institute of Economic Studies and Social Finance International to carry out another study.   They have all come to the conclusion, for good reasons, that there is an opportunity in the procurement to deliver a more integrated service.  That is what it is really about.  It is in the interests of jobseekers.  At the moment, across the various job club and local employment services, we have approximately 66 different providers.  We also have JobPath providers and our own service.  It is a bit of a confused landscape for jobseekers.  The advice we got clearly in all those reports was to try to bring it together and integrate it.  The other advice we got that the different services such as ourselves as Intreo, JobPath, the local employment services and job clubs are all broadly involved across different cohorts of jobseekers.  The advice we got was to try to focus each different service provision on particular cohorts.  That kind of advice meant that we had to change things.</p></speech>

I will give an example.  In Donegal, which, as the Deputy is aware, is one of the four regions where we tried it out and are taking the lessons from that, the Donegal and Inishowen providers came together to put in a collaborative bid.  A similar situation pertained in Sligo and Leitrim.  Although it is one lot where there were previously two providers, the two providers are still involved in Donegal and in Sligo and Leitrim.  That can continue.</p><p>What we are trying to do within particular geographic areas is to make sure there is congruity.  That does not necessarily mean the bodies within those areas are-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#E00200"><p>I accept that.  The difficulty many people in the sector and many people committed to the principle of partnership see is that as we continue to treat each of these policy tools and their administration as services, it restricts the ability of local communities to come together in partnership to respond to local needs.  Mr. McKeon said this is a contract that goes back 25 years.  Communities like mine in Ballymun and Finglas and many others had pockets of disadvantage and still have, and many of the partnerships were established to bring agencies together to move away from a national focus to allow a local response.  The difficulty with the SICAP being tendered as a contract, the local employment services being tendered as a single contract and the T&uacute;s scheme and community employment scheme being more under the control of the Department is that they make sense if we were replying to the Comptroller and Auditor General and analysing this as an accounting exercise but they remove the local focus.  For example, if there was a significant job loss in Dublin Port, the local employment service that covers the north inner city would be equipped to handle that and to put in place local solutions.  Equally, the same would apply if there was a significant drop in employment, as happened in Ballymun in 2010 and 2011 where we did not have many of the new unemployed that many of the other services had but rather had people who had been successfully placed in employment who then returned to the services and those people required a different response from, for example, people in Glasnevin and Drumcondra who might have been experiencing unemployment for the first time.  If we move from a local to regional approach we remove the local focus and the ability of local communities to respond.  This is about bringing all the stakeholders in an area together.  Many people are asking whether the Department is committed to the principle of partnership in the way it would have championed it in the mid-1990s.</p></speech>

The Indecon report and the study carried out by the Institute of Economic Studies and Social Finance Foundation recommended that it be done in 15 lots.  One of my colleagues might correct me if I am wrong on that as I do not have the papers in front of me.  We are going with considerably more than that.  We have not finalised it but it will be considerably more than that.  It will be a regional approach but not regional in the sense of it being at that level because we have taken on board the feedback.</p> <p>  The existing providers, which are sitting tenants, so to speak, are well positioned.  There is no reason they cannot get together, as they did in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, and be successful in this process and when they are successful they will be on the ground and can respond locally.  I take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point about when something happens.  The loss of jobs for the Debenhams workers was another case in point last year.  The Department often takes the lead and organises in such cases.  If the Deputy were to speak to SIPTU officials, they would be very positive about the way the Department engaged and worked not only with its staff but with local employment service and other service providers.  The Department will continue to co-ordinate and support in that respect.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the Department championing partnership, we like partnership but we have to operate within the rules.  The rules are that we have to procure this in a way that is open, transparent and competitive.</p></speech>

I will finish by making this point.  In the past, the State made a decision to make sure the rules focused on the local community.  I ask Mr. McKeon to ensure the Department continues to do that in the way it implements the solutions to comply with the procurement process and the others reasons for which it is implementing this.</p></speech>

I do not want to dwell on it because extraordinary work was done over that period.  I thought it was worth bringing to the committee&rsquo;s attention, and there may be follow-up questions on this, the results of the testing sample for the PUP period.  Some 411 claims were processed, of which 329 were employees and 82 were self-employed.  While the irregular payments made to employees was approximately 9%, which is a little but not substantially higher than the irregular payments under other schemes, it is interesting it was not possible for the 82% or 100% of those who were self-employed to identify whether they were eligible.  In short time Mr. McKeon has available to respond to me and other speakers, will he outline why the measures adopted in August were not adopted earlier and whether that was even possible?  Why did the Department not make better use of the data made available by the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#E00700"><p>Briefly, real-time data information is made available in respect of employees by the Revenue Commissioners and I will return to that point.  That data information is not available for the self-employed.  We are only now getting in the self-employed returns for 2020; we only got them in November.  We will go back and review all self-employed claims against those records to identify overpayments.  We have approximately 200 staff who are currently engaged on maintaining the PUP.  The detail may be online but a great deal of manual processing is involved.  As the scheme transitions, we will keep those staff in place and they will be involved in a control project to identify overpayments that happen.  We will follow up on those and pay particular attention to the self- employed group.</p> <p>  Regarding the employee group, there were some difficulties at the start of the process using the real-time look-up information facility in the way it was suggested, which is the way we are using it now.  The first issue was that IT system we developed, which we did in four days, did not have direct links to Revenue, which it could not have had.  We subsequently rebuilt it on our core platforms and that took a period of time.  The second issue was that the real-time look-up agreement we had with Revenue prior to the pandemic was a single case by case look-up facility for data minimisation reasons.  An officer had to manually type in a PPSN and get feedback on it.  There was no mass or batch look-up facility.  We had to put in place a new data sharing agreement with Revenue.  The third constraint with our getting to grips with it was that it was a relatively new system at that stage.  The terms and conditions for being eligible for the PUP was that a person had to be unemployed in the week prior to 13 March as the scheme was rolled out.  When employers submit returns even with the real-time information facility, let me put it this way, they are not necessarily 100% accurate.</p></speech>

Employers pay people in advance, in arrears, weekly, fortnightly or monthly and having submitted returns they then submit corrections.  Relying on those and for an employer to deny people a PUP payment where there may have been a data issue with the real-time look-up information would have been problematic.  We have ironed out all these matters and we now do that now in real time.  We not only do that when awarding claims we also do weekly checks.</p></speech>

Three groups or bodies are responsible for determining employment status for different purposes.  We determine it in respect of social insurance.  The Revenue Commissioners determine it in respect of whether somebody is a schedule E taxpayer or a self-employed taxpayer.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, determines it in the case of employment and unemployment rights.  Linked to that, as the legislation currently is, we each have to decide in our own areas.  Neither I nor my staff can decide on behalf of the WRC or on behalf of the Revenue and that can be where the confusion lies.</p></speech>

I asked whether his Department carries out test cases and his response was "No".  This issue has been addressed in several D&aacute;il replies.  The Minister for Social Protection has stated a number of test cases were considered and that the chief appeals officer had advised a number of test cases were considered in the 1990s.  In 2016, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, stated, &ldquo;A number of test cases in relation to the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) Contract Meter Readers were investigated by Scope in recent years.&rdquo;  In January 2019, the Social Welfare Appeals Office stated, &ldquo;On occasion over the years an approach of having 'test cases' has been taken ... by the Social Welfare Appeals Office.&rdquo;  In 2000, the then Secretary General of the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs stated that in order to resolve the matter, a number of representative test cases had been selected.  Mr. McKeon, however, has said that is not true.</p></speech>

A suggestion has been made the Department took a test case with regard to a particular sector and, on the basis of that test case, then determined that everybody in a sector fell within a particular category.  As I said, we did not do that.  What the Department did - this is going back to the 1990s, long before my time - was to have a look at a number of cases to try to determine what criteria could be used, applying the common law handed down by the courts, to classify somebody as employed or self-employed.  It came up with five tests, which are to do with mutuality of obligation, integration, ability to control, enterprise tests and so on, and those tests are now applied to every case individually.  If the Deputy wants to say we took a test case to establish the criteria, then that is what we did, but those criteria are applied individually to each worker.</p> <p>  The chief appeals officer can probably comment on this.  On rare occasions, particularly in the appeals space, if all the employees and an employer agree to have a group of workers who are in a similar position with the same employer, evaluated based on taking a sample, that may happen, but it is very rare.  All the individual workers have to agree, the employer has to agree and each worker gets a separate, independent determination, which he or she can then appeal.  That is not the same as people saying one can do a test case and what comes out of that case determines all subsequent cases.  That is not what happens.</p></speech>

The staff of some of the big courier companies, such as An Post, are not self-employed.  It is nonsense to suggest everybody who works in the courier industry is classified as self-employed.

In terms of social insurance classification, we treat every case on its own merits.

I have to say, this brick of information has defeated me somewhat.

I suppose this comes to the nub of the issue I want to ask about.  I would be very appreciative if somebody could perhaps furnish me with that number afterwards.</p> <p>  Let us work on the basis that it is vaguely similar year-on-year and we are dealing with a number that is in and around 20,000, and we have an appeals process, let us say, in the disability allowance of between 6,000 and 7,000 on average.  What would the rate for success be in terms of having a revised appeal in the disability allowance, for example?</p></speech>

That is to be expected given the nature of the questions that are to be determined, which by definition require a high level of judgment, for example, on the impact of the disability and the appellant's capacity to engage in work.</p></speech>

There are a number of options at that point open to a person who gets a negative decision.  They can ask the Department to conduct a review and they can submit an appeal.

Do we know as a percentage how many people are refused?  Let us say, there are approximately 20,000 applications.  If there is a 50% refusal rate, that is 10,000 people.  Therefore, there is a shortfall of 3,000 people who do not appeal.  Would it be fair to say that figure is in the ballpark?</p></speech>

A percentage will come to us on appeal.  There will, therefore, be a cohort of people who do not either pursue an appeal or a review and they accept the decision.</p></speech>

I thank the Department very much for the case studies in the briefing it sent us.  The case studies are very helpful but what stood out to me in many of the case studies was the simple fact that people did not supply the correct information or enough information.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#G02000"><p>I think that is the case.  Routinely at the appeal stage, and again I am going to speak about the appeal process, appellants submit additional evidence that they have not provided to the Department.  There is probably some anecdotal evidence that appellants feel the need to hold back some medical evidence, or any evidence, for the appeal process in order to have something at the appeal stage.  Both the Department and I, in my role with the decisions advisory office, will work with the advocacy groups to ensure that people submit the information.</p></speech>

In terms of the cost to the Department, has it done any kind of review on the unit costing of the service that an appeals officer provides as opposed to an ordinary staff member who is reviewing an application?  Is the issue that there simply is not enough information?  As somebody who has gone through the process of applying for carer's allowance, to get a refusal would, I can imagine, be quite distressing.  If the issue is simply that there is not enough information, is there a cost to the Department insofar as moving it up a grade to the appeals process rather than the original staff member saying that the Department needs more information from a person?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#G02200"><p>Perhaps I will come in on that.  To go back to the Deputy's earlier question, I have managed to check the number of applications on the disability allowance.  Last year, 21,000 claims for disability allowance were registered.  Therefore, approximately 4,000 appeals, approximately one fifth of them, were registered.  Of that-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#G02300"><p>I am sorry.  Of the 21,000 applications, how many were refused?</p></speech>

Of the 21,000 claims that were received and processed, we subsequently got 4,000 appeals or thereabouts.  That is approximately one fifth of those cases.  Roughly 60% of those are passed on appeal and, in most cases, on review.  To get to the Deputy's point, we are looking at 60% of 20%.  Therefore, we are looking at roughly 12%.  That is, therefore, an overhead in roughly around 12% of the cases.  Many of those would have been done by the same staff member in the Department.  The difference is that an appeals officer is generally an assistant principal grade and our deciding officers are generally clerical officer or executive officer grade.  There is, therefore, a cost differential if I can put it in those terms.</p></speech>

The staff who look at them are familiar with the law.  They are very highly trained on the law and how the law applies to scheme criteria.  On medical schemes, for example, it is a subjective judgment on what constitutes a significant level of care or what constitutes a significant incapacity-----</p></speech>

I know some of the case studies the Department gave us were quite complex around the interaction with different jurisdictions or the UK or whatever.  Where the issue is simply insufficient information, it seems that a review of the unit costing of the appeals process as opposed to simply asking people for more information instead of refusing their application would perhaps be better value for money.</p></speech>

One of the issues is that generally speaking when people fall ill or they have a care requirement, and this is something we are considering, they submit a claim because the date from which they will be paid is the date of the claim.</p><p>Even while they are awaiting a report from a consultant or doctor, the advice that advocacy groups give them is to get the claim in first.  For this exact reason in disability and carer's allowance schemes we also allow people to come back and ask for a review of the decision instead of going to the appeals office.  It is dealt with in order that people are given that opportunity.  That is what I think drives this behaviour.</p></speech>

It has been an extremely difficult time for everyone.  I thank them for the supports provided on very short notice.  I want to touch on the issue the Acting Chair, Deputy McAuliffe, raised about local employment services procurement.  One of the concerns raised by some of the people working in the area is that someone working in the service for more than 20 years might be on a high salary scale while another group tendering might have people with two or three years' experience who would be on a lower pay grade.  How will this be dealt with when processing applications?  Will Mr. McKeon outline what are the consequences for not following the legal advice?  What penalties can be imposed if we do not follow the legal advice about going through the tendering process?  Has the Department engaged, and what level of engagement has there been, with the local employment schemes over recent months on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#H00300"><p>There has been quite extensive engagement on this with local employment services dating back to 2018 and 2019.  When we received the advice we did not rush into it.  We took a very slow and deliberate approach.   There were three separate independent consultant reports.  In all cases the consultants engaged with local employment services.  The Department has had 140 separate engagements with the sector over this period, including meetings with every chief executive of every local employment service and every job club and dealings with unions.  There has been quite a lot of engagement and I will detail some of it.  All of the CEOs of the local development companies were briefed in 2018 on what we were doing and what had to happen.  In 2019, Indecon briefed all of the local employment services and job clubs together with the Department.  All of the local employment services and job clubs were visited by the Department individually in 2019.  The Institute of Employment Studies consulted with all of them in 2020.  The Minister and the Department meet representatives of the Irish Local Development Network regularly.  With regard to the trade unions, we have had six meetings with them going back as far as 2019.  On 9 November, we held a detailed briefing session on the outcome of the first phase of the tender and sought feedback on the design of the next phase.  There has been quite extensive consultation.  I know one of the issues, and this is not just with regard to local employment services, is that sometimes people say we were there but we did not listen to them.  There is a limit to what we can change as a consequence.  We have listened and we try to take on board all of the feedback we can, to the extent that we can within the law.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on what would happen if we did not do it, the Government cannot knowingly break the law.  I will put it that way.  Once we know it we cannot unknow it.  The Government could not knowingly break the law.  The Government is meant to stand up and apply the law.  I do not think that is an option.  We would be open to suit by other potential providers.  The European Commission could take enforcement proceedings of its own volition.  There would be quite serious consequences.</p> <p>  With regard to the point made on the various pay rates, various providers and various costs, after careful deliberation we have taken an approach in our tender that the marks for price are as low as we can make them.  Normally, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can confirm this, the marks awarded in any tender process for price are typically 40% or even higher in some cases.  In the tenders we issued in the four phases where we did the first phase recruitment, price accounted for 25%.  Service quality and, in particular, community and social connections accounted for the remaining 75%.  A lot of the marks are awarded to recognise exactly the point the Deputy has made on the value of experience in social connections.  We prize the marks towards these.  Many of the providers have been described as moving towards a profit-based model.  Other providers that are entitled to compete will compete, and if they get through the process they will be awarded fairly.  If we think about it logically, if some providers have to add a profit margin on top of their costs while others do not so there is some equalisation there.  We cannot release the report of the Institute of Employment Studies in full because it gives us its views on what appropriate costs would be.  We have set a minimum price, which is very rare, below which any tender is not accepted.</p></speech>

There is a particular case I want to highlight as an issue.  A person has been diagnosed with MS and can no longer work.  I have been dealing with the Department on this case for more than 12 months.  The issue is that the person has a mortgage of &euro;1,000 a month.  In order for this to be paid the person has let out rooms.  All of the rent is going towards the mortgage but the Department is treating it as income.  The person is now in receipt of &euro;50 per week.  Everyone knows MS is not an easy condition to manage.  I am surprised by the way the Department is assessing it and not taking into account the mortgage.  This person would not qualify for a local authority house.  If the person sells the house and goes on the market to rent it would cost &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 a month.  The person has been very careful about managing these affairs but the Department is taking the rent for the letting of rooms as an income.  People who are working and earning &euro;50,000 a year and earning &euro;14,000 from letting rooms would not be taxed on it.   We have gone to the other extreme in dealing with social welfare.</p></speech>

Referrals were impacted by the pandemic.  We have extended the duration for which current participants can stay on the scheme until next year to try to manage this issue.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, are personally engaged with this and I expect proposals to deal with it fairly shortly.  One slightly disappointing thing I encourage employment organisations to look at is that they only accept one in five, on average, of the people we refer to them.  That is an issue we have to look at as well.  The majority of the people we refer to the T&uacute;s organisations, by comparison, are taken into their schemes.  Community employment schemes tend to be a bit more selective, for whatever reason.</p></speech>

I thank staff in the Department of Social Protection, in particular, for all of the work they have done in processing the huge number of claims in recent years.  I have also had the chance to observe over time the responsiveness of the Department on day-to-day issues.  It is set apart from every other Department, in my experience as a Deputy.  I get a response and a representation number and matters are followed up without the need to issue a reminder.  The Department is exceptionally responsive and I thank all of the staff, through Mr. McKeon.  Being able to get back to people is very much appreciated.  That is my experience.  I thank him again for coming in as I know he has not been well.</p> <p>  The PUP was an extraordinary piece of work.  Mr. McKeon spoke about the different information systems that have been built up.  This week, the system has been reopened.  For people who have been able to apply, it has been a great system, but I will go into some of the concerns about fraud.  What are Mr. McKeon's concerns about the scale of potentially fraudulent PUP claims?  What is the Department doing to prevent that this time around?  What are Mr. McKeon's thoughts about people who have made a PUP claim and did not have a PRSI background with the Department?  We have some other questions on the eligibility of the self-employed.  How easy was it to distinguish how and whether somebody was self-employed?  One of the great successes of the PUP is how well it worked.  One of the concerns people have is how it may have been manipulated by some.</p></speech>

Talking about fraud is always difficult.  We do not subscribe, as I said previously, to the skiver or striver stuff in some of the red-top newspapers from time to time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#J00500"><p>I know from previous engagements that the Deputy does not subscribe to it either.  However, I want to say that for our observers because we are about to discuss fraud which can get the headlines.  In reality, the overwhelming majority of people who use this are absolutely entitled to payment and it is a valid payment.  We must always balance trying to control against fraud and overpayments due to our own error against not frustrating people's entitlement.  It will never be got right.  Especially with the pandemic unemployment payment, if that balance had to be tipped one way or the other, our judgment was to tip it towards the presumption of honesty rather than dishonesty.  That is how we would generally try to operate anyway.</p> <p>  In terms of the level of incorrect payment, if I could call it that, our own estimate, which may change, is that it is approximately 6%.  This information was not available to the Comptroller and Auditor General when his team was in but the Deputy will be aware the Government took a decision to give full contributions, rather than credited contributions, to people who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  We have done an exercise, using the Revenue records and our own records, of matching when people were on PUP and when they were in employment and then filling in the gaps.  From that, it looks like the figure is approximately 6%.</p> <p>  The question is how much of that is fraud and how much of it is for some other reason.  When the pandemic unemployment payment was introduced, there was no social insurance conditionality to it.  We spoke to the Minister at the time, and the Deputy may remember there were certain sectors of the economy which were very concerned that they were excluded, such as those in the informal economy who would normally go to our community welfare service but because of social distancing, restrictions and so on, they could not have access to that in the normal way.</p> <p>  Sex workers would be one such group.  There were religious confraternities as well, across Christian and non-Christian faiths, such as mendicant orders which would not have been social insurance contributors and suddenly had no weekly collection and were on their uppers.  In those situations, our choice was to tell them they should not be travelling and our offices were closed or to give them the payment.  A decision was taken to give them the payment and then subsequently go back over it.  There were those kind of cases, which are not fraud.  They may be irregular payments but they are not fraud.</p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy was raised was self-employment.  Self-employment is a difficulty because the returns are made annually and when they are made they are made on a whole-year basis.  The Revenue returns are, therefore, for the entire year, rather than week by week throughout the year.  We are setting up a project to do this, as recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have to look and compare the income of the people who declared themselves as self-employed for the 2019 year and for the 2020 year and make an assessment as to which of those it looks as though their income was sustained, even though they were claiming the PUP and go back and review each of those cases on an individual basis.  That is what we intend to do.</p></speech>

Will Mr. McKeon tell us about the analysis that will be done?  When will it be done?</p></speech>

We have a particular pandemic unemployment payment control board, which is headed by our deputy secretary.  Planning is well under way.  We would have intended to start in January, except the pandemic unemployment payment has been reintroduced.  As I mentioned, the Department has some 200 staff managing that scheme for us.  If the scheme were to unwind and transition out of payment at the end of January or into February, as planned, those staff would then be directed to this activity.  That may still be the case but it will be dependent on developments between now and then.</p></speech>

Can we identify that group as potentially needing support in the future?  How would we do that, having become aware of them and having had a formal contact with the Department?  What does Mr. McKeon envisage that this body of learning will mean later?</p></speech>

In the context of the pandemic, that processing capacity or capability was not there.  We will probably still rely on a supplementary welfare allowance scheme for those cases.</p></speech>

What safeguards does it have?  The office seems to be quite intertwined with the Department.  The chief appeals officer sits on the management board.

Many of the deciding officers in the Department think it is far too independent.  The office exercises its independence.  It is a statutory function.  On the couple of occasions cases have gone to court, the courts have always commented positively on its independence.  I will ask the chief appeals officer to say something on that.</p></speech>

There is no sustained or concerted criticism relating to the independence of the office, me or the appeals officers and we are required to carry out our statutory functions independently.  Having a relationship with the Department and my being on the management board does not tarnish that independence.</p><p>The fact we have a relationship and that I am on the management board does not tarnish that independence.  As the Secretary General has said, there are many in the Department who think we are far too independent.  If evidence was needed, it is to be found in the high number of successful appeals.

I note the Comptroller and Auditor General has commented on the oral hearings and written procedures and the level of discretion available in that regard.  As I understand it, oral hearings are held essentially at the discretion of the appeals officer.  There is no written policy I am aware of as to why they should be called.  It is just left up to the appeals officer.  That is not the sort of procedure that gives confidence in the independence of a structure to those on the outside.  Has the Department carried out any analysis of how and when oral hearings are carried out?  Has it done anything since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's analysis?</p></speech>

We have conferences, and had more in the past when it was possible for us to meet in person, at which we discuss issues regarding when an oral hearing might be required.  It is difficult to set out broad guidelines but we have now put some up on our website.  These oral hearings are usually held where there are unresolved conflicts in the evidence, some dispute as to the facts or differing opinions, whether medical opinions or other professional opinions, which require teasing out.  I am not sure this matter impinges on our independence.  We have not been challenged and there has been no evidence of a lack of independence.  I am confident we are independent and that we carry out our functions independently, as we and the deciding officers in the Department are required to under the legislation.</p></speech>

I wish everybody a good morning and thank them for attending.  I will concentrate on the Department's decision to introduce Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  This will, in effect, abolish local employment services so that we can be in line with EU procurement regulations.  I have had extensive engagement with local employment services, which have helped thousands of people find gainful employment since the 1990s.  They are basically left with two choices.  They can either tender to be part of the future arrangements or they can choose not to tender.  There are a number of factors involved in making those choices.  The new scheme, Pathways to Work, sets impossible timelines.  Even though the Minister tells me there was extensive engagement with stakeholders in developing the document, if the local employment services that currently deliver these programmes, which have local knowledge and experience, say the timelines are impossible, I have to question how they came about.  They say they cannot provide the service within their budget because the whole service is front-loaded.  That makes it financially unsustainable for the existing local employment services to tender.  This means all of their staff will be made redundant.  I presume the Secretary General has heard the term "stuck between a rock and a hard place".  That is where the employees in the local employment services, LESs, find themselves.</p> <p>  The new scheme allows for a maximum of 438 clients per year for the entire county of Wexford.  Some 1,350 people availed of the services of the LES in the county in the last year.  That does not include walk-ins.  The Department's proposal is to reduce that number by 900.  That is very concerning.  How was that figure arrived at?</p> <p>  Where will the LES workers find themselves in the case of redundancy?  How does the Department propose to deal with their future?  Will they be made redundant or employed by the successful tenderer?  Will there be a transfer of undertakings and so on for existing employees of the LESs?</p></speech>

With regard to the timelines, there has been extensive consultation.  I will not go back into that because I am conscious of time but this has been in the offing for quite a few years now.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right.  The existing providers of local employment services will have a choice as to whether to tender.  I hope they all will and that they will collaborate in doing so.  They are the sitting tenants and are well positioned.  There may be competition from other providers and it will be an open and fair competition but the existing providers are well positioned.  With regard to the evidence for this, as I have said, the approach we took was to start tendering in four areas where there was not currently a local employment service.  In two out of the three areas for which they tendered, the partnerships, the local development companies, were successful, so I believe they can succeed.</p><p>We will be giving an extended tender period to enable all providers to put together a good tender response and to enable them to figure out collaboration locally.</p><p> The numbers who will be referred to the service are ultimately determined by the number of people who are unemployed.  There is no set number.  I am not sure where the number of 438 came from.  It  may be from one of the consultant's reports.  I do not have the papers in front of me.</p></speech>

The figure may vary from county to county but certainly that is per employee how it has been worked out and I will explain.  Approximately there is a caseload currently of 150 with nine guidance officers and their workload currently is 1,350 and under the new scheme they have worked it out to be 438.  Yes, it would be different for each county.</p></speech>

The numbers that will be referred, and we will give it and part of the tender will be a guaranteed minimum referral level which will be set at a rate so that it will make the service sustainable.  We will not be looking for people to commit.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the upfront payment.  We are in this model and 90% of the payments will be paid when people are referred and the personal progression plan is registered.  So it will be an upfront payment, predominantly, at 90%.  We will also, as part of the model, be frontloading payments to support cashflow.  We have taken those feedbacks and we will be doing that.  I honestly believe that they will be in a good position.</p></speech>

People think that there are difficulties.  I jotted down the numbers during the break.  We have currently 256,000 people in receipt of income supports around the State.  We have about 300,000 people on the employment wage subsidy scheme some of whom, unfortunately, will end up.  Of the 256,000, about 170,000 of those are long-term unemployed.  At a caseload for long-term unemployed, which is internationally recognised, of about 125:1, we probably need about 1,300 employment advisers.  Between ourselves, the local employment services and JobPath at the moment we have about 1,000.  There is more than enough work to go around.  Under the Pathways to Work strategy, the Government has committed to extending the offer of employment services to lone parents on a voluntary basis, to people with disabilities and to qualified adults.  There is more than enough work to go around.  I do not think the volume of referrals will be a problem honestly.</p></speech>

I must go to the D&aacute;il Chamber to discuss, during Leaders' Questions, what we call a home care support package.  Again, somebody in the Department decided that they would give 1.5 million extra hours towards the home care support package.  That is brilliant except when one gets a letter to say that one has been granted the home care support package but there is a line that says the service cannot be delivered.  That is my concern here.  The Department has engaged with the stakeholders but I am very concerned that it appears to be a box ticking exercise because it will not be delivered.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McKeon and his colleagues for being here.</p> <p>  I have a brief question on the public services card.  I note that at the time the Data Protection Commission published its renowned report that the cost up until 2019 were declared as being &euro;67.8 million within the ten years existence of the card.  However, the recent cost benefit analysis of the project sets the cost at &euro;98.4 million.  Is there a reason for the substantial jump of over &euro;30 million? </p></speech>

It is not quite like with like and I will explain that.  The first is the 2019 figure, which was previously used, was I think up to that point June 2019 as opposed to full year 2019 so there is a time gap.<br/><br/>The second issue, the figure that was previously given was the net cost to the Government, excluding VAT, because the Government pays VAT to itself.  For the purpose of the cost benefit analysis a conservative approach was taken of factoring in the VAT as a cost even though, from a Government perspective, it is not actually a cost.  <br/><br/>The third element is that the cost, which was published in the cost benefit analysis, also included the online <i>myGov.ie</i>service.  It was not just a public services card.  It was the combined public services card and the <i>myGov.ie</i>service.</p></speech>

This matter is being challenged through the courts so I will not say anything that will prejudice the case.  In the event that the Data Protection Commissioner's decision was upheld, would an additional cost be attributable to the Department to destroy the associated records?</p></speech>

Deputy Verona Murphy mentioned the report of a committee.  In fact two committees of this House, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands have launched reports which have recommended the retention of job clubs and of the local employment services model.  The D&aacute;il, by unanimous resolution last week, also adopted such a resolution.  Is it the Department&rsquo;s position that it is rejecting all of those outcomes?</p></speech>

The issue arose when the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, was tendered for in 2014, as the Deputy may recall.  Shortly after that, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office identified that the services that we were providing for local employment services and job clubs seemed to meet the criteria that they should be tendered for as well.  We had an engagement with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office at that stage and subsequently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, which confirmed that position.  We then set about a process of rectifying the situation which involved two and a half to three years of consultations before we went ahead.</p></speech>

Many of the concerns expressed then about the consequences and the inability of partnership companies, and so on, to engage and what that would mean for them, were exactly the same ones that are being expressed now.  I hope that this will give comfort to the firms involved that the fears they had about SICAP turned out to be largely unfounded.</p></speech>

The way we are doing this is informed, as I said to some of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues earlier, by trying to come up with an administrative structure which gives transparency and aligns the services in geographic areas that make sense, rather than having 26 LES and 40 job clubs in particular areas and------</p></speech>

If I may finish on this.  One of the big issues that came out in the consultancy was that the customer journey between the LES, the job clubs, Intreo and ourselves was not very well integrated.  One then has to have a look at how one allocates.</p> <p>  The other point I made to some of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues earlier is that we have not finalised the lot sizes.  The consultants either recommended 15 or 17.  It will be more than that but equally, and as a Border Deputy he will be familiar with this, it does not mean that the existing service providers have to change their own geographic focus.  What has happened, for example, in Donegal and in Sligo-Leitrim is that the various job clubs providers in those areas got together and put in a collaborative bid and I hope that other providers would do the same as well.</p></speech>

The Department has certainly delivered.  I commend Mr. McKeon who outlined in his opening statement on the manner in which it has built two IT systems.  This has shown the level of delivery within the system and other Government Departments - the HSE comes to mind - might learn from Mr. McKeon&rsquo;s Department in respect of implementation of IT systems.</p><p>The area I want to focus on first is the Department's compliance and anti-fraud strategy.  Would the Department consider returning responsibility for all PUP and jobseeker payments to the post office network?  We have a crazy situation at present regarding the viability of the post office network, especially in rural Ireland.   At a recent meeting, An Post was looking for clarity on this matter.  Surely, if someone has to present in person as opposed to having money paid into his or her bank account this would, in theory, help to combat fraud.  During the pandemic, we have heard stories of people being abroad and claiming PUP.  We have also heard that moving payments back to the post office network is something the postmasters have called for.  It is a move that I would support, particularly for many rural communities.  I would like to hear Mr. McKeon's thoughts on this.</p></speech>

We deviated from that during the pandemic, mainly for social distancing reasons, to give the jobseekers that option because people were being told to stay at home and not travel.  Quite often, because jobseekers are paid on Thursday mornings, we see long queues outside the post offices.  I have seen that outside my own local post office.  We did not think that would make sense so we gave them the option of having their payment made directly to their bank accounts.  We will review this as we come out of the pandemic, with a view, potentially, to reverting to payment in-person at the post office.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is looking at that very closely.  Whether we will be able to do it in respect of people who are currently on the payment and it is being paid into their bank accounts or for new applicants only is an open question.  I can assure Deputies that these things are being examined at the moment.  On foot of having responsibility for rural, community development and the islands, the Minister is particularly conscious of the role of post offices in rural communities.  This is something that is being actively considered.</p></speech>

I would ask that this matter be addressed in a speedy manner.  I have reviewed the Department's documents in terms of its compliance.  The strategy outlines four key pillars, namely, prevent, detect, deter and account.  As PUP is reopening, will the Department now be asking applicants to present to Intreo offices to confirm their identity?  Is that something the Department proposes to do over the next couple of weeks?</p></speech>

We have already started that process, taking the learnings from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As is normal with other jobseekers, we will ask people to present to their local Intreo centres to certify their ongoing entitlement.  We did this remotely in 2020 and thus far in 2021.  On the assumption that the situation with the pandemic is stabilising and, hopefully, improving, we will ask people to present at offices to sign and also to engage with job advisers, job coaches and so on.</p></speech>

Since we got the second ICT system built and put the data sharing agreement in place we have been using it much more regularly.  We have been using it much more regularly since the summer of this year, but at the moment all claims of PUP are being checked against the real-time look-up system and all claims that are in payment that are being checked against it on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

We will be looking at extending it.  I explained some of the difficulties in terms of reconciling different payment frequencies in that some people are paid in advance, others are paid in arrears and so on.  We are getting to grips with all of that now.  One of the issues which people may not have noticed the Government has asked us to consider, which is in the pathways to work strategy, is that we move jobseeker payments onto a working family payment type model.  Rather that having the casual system which we have at the moment, which some people will be familiar with is about days on work and days off work, we would use the Revenue real-time system to give us information on a person's earnings, which we would then top-up.  A person with no earnings would get the full payment, a person with some earnings might get a reduced payment and so on.  It is a bit like the working family payment, which, at the moment, is only available to families.  That is something we are looking at, but it is not without its challenges.  That would be a good way to use it, I think.</p></speech>

Some of them would be working remotely on a full-time basis.  In other offices, we have staff rotating in and out under the so-called hybrid or blended working model.  At one level, it has not had an impact.  As I said earlier, we have managed to protect and improve service performance on claim processing and so on.  At another level, we would generally have hotlines for Deputies in all of our scheme areas.  In one of our scheme areas, the performance has slipped a little because that has to be staffed physically in the office.  As we have only a limited number of staff in the office, we have been prioritising customer calls.  There have been some impacts, but I do not think they have been significant.</p></speech>

In effect, we have had a real-life trial for the past 21 months and it has shown that it works.  At a Civil Service level, there is engagement between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions about how we might structure that on a more formal basis.  In terms of our staff locations, we are regionally structured in terms of the Intreo centres, which are grouped into eight regions.  We also have the biggest distribution of staff of any Department in terms of our headquarters function.  Our largest headquarters office is in Sligo, where there are 600 staff.  There are approximately 450 staff in Longford, 200-plus in Carrick-on-Shannon and between Buncrana and Letterkenny, there are approximately 400 staff as well.

There are some proposals under consideration.  It is a policy issue.  I do not want to say much more than that it is actively under consideration.  I mentioned earlier that there is one thing that disappoints me a little, something we have to get to the heart of, that is, that the community employment schemes, compared with the T&uacute;s schemes, tend to reject more of the people we refer.  That is something we need to understand.  I am not saying that it is wrong, but we need to understand why it is the case.</p></speech>

I do not have a host of issues to raise but it is important to acknowledge that, since the outset of the pandemic, their Department has been under a heavier burden than most.  Many people appreciate that work, as do I as a public representative.  Suffice it to say, though, we have questions to ask.  The gross expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund was in excess of &euro;17.3 billion in 2020.</p> <p>  We will be looking at precarious circumstances in the year ahead thanks to Covid-19, which might have an impact on many employees across the country.  Will Mr. McKeon guide us through the Department's work in trying to get ready financially for the challenges that we may have to overcome in the coming months?  How is the Department planning to be in a position financially to deal with challenges that may arise from new variants and further lockdowns and restrictions?  The cruel lesson we have learned over the past two or three months is that the Covid-19 pandemic is far from gone and we may face additional hurdles in the coming months.</p></speech>

He is head of our finance function and can probably give the committee more details than I.</p> <p>  In terms of our finances, we are a demand-led Department.  People have entitlements to payments and services under the law if they experience certain contingencies, for example, unemployment, disability, etc.  If extra financing is required that is not provided for in the Estimates, the Department will typically bring forward a Supplementary Estimate because it is not an option not to pay people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question relating to Covid-19, its variants and so on.  The Government takes decisions, as it did recently to reopen the PUP, based on the situation and the Department always stands ready to deliver on the Government's decisions.  The Covid illness scheme is still in place.  This recognises the impact of the current infection rate even if the impact of Covid is not as severe on people because of vaccines.  For example, I am self-isolating at the moment and can still work.  Last week, we received approximately 8,000 claims for the Covid illness payment.  Once people are certified, they get the payment.</p> <p>  Regarding the general financial situation, does Mr. Lawler wish to discuss this year's Supplementary Estimate and the Estimate for next year?</p></speech>

We are aware from the details provided to us that this accounted for approximately &euro;18 million in 2019.  The pandemic has naturally increased the amount of support that people have needed and it was correct for the Government to provide as many supports as possible.  In terms of fraud over the past 18 months, what details is Mr. McKeon able to provide us regarding people who were in receipt of financial support from the Department when they should not have been?  An issue has been flagged with me by people a number of times and it would be no harm for Mr. McKeon to put the matter to bed today.  It has to do with people leaving the country who were in receipt of the PUP and other payments.  Has Mr. McKeon detailed information on this matter?  It would be no harm to get an insight into it.  We have all heard of cases of people who were in receipt of payments when they should not have been.  I would like some clarity on the position.</p></speech>

Last year, the Department reported &euro;99 million in overpayments, of which approximately &euro;20 million related to fraud.  To put that in context, it was a year with in or around &euro;30 billion in payments.  In the year to date, we are estimating that there has been &euro;102 million in overpayments, of which &euro;16 million relates to fraud.  I do not want to overstate the level of fraud.  So far, we have raised debts of between &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million in terms of the PUP and have recovered &euro;10 million to &euro;11 million of that.  We have yet to implement some of the measures that we indicated we would and that the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to whereby we would review all of the claims and payments and try to match instances where people were working while also claiming PUP.  Many of those instances would be genuine and not fraudulent.  One of the issues that we as a Department need to face is that, under the law, people are meant to sign off a payment the first day they return to work.  Often, though, they do not get their first pay cheques for four weeks.  In the past, they may have sought the supplementary welfare allowance for that period.  In such situations where there is a detected level of fraud because people are working and claiming, we must net off the amount they would have got from the supplementary welfare payment.  This is something to be aware of.</p> <p>  I am afraid that we do not have figures on the international dimension.  To a certain extent, it is a case of us not knowing what we do not know.  We are not aware of a large amount of it, although it has undoubtedly happened.  We took some control measures last year that resulted in approximately 9,000 claims &ndash; Mr. Conlon might correct me on that if I am wrong &ndash; being stopped where we identified that people were abroad.  We have some data analytics.  I do not want to describe them because I do not want to provide a rogue&rsquo;s charter, but in many cases we have ways and means of detecting whether a payment is going abroad.</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon referred to 9,000 cases.  Was there a strong mixture of multiple reasons for stopping those claims?  I suppose there were some people moving to other jurisdictions to live or did it have more to do with holidays?  Will Mr. McKeon give us an insight into the figure of 9,000 cases?</p></speech>

We in politics have a habit of bashing civil servants on many issues but it has to be acknowledged that the Department has done a considerable amount of work to help many people who were badly in need during the pandemic.  It has not been easy and there were many teething issues as well as problems that we still have to overcome.  Generally speaking, the Department has had to undertake a major task.  The increase in its budget has been eye-watering but that was a necessary response to the situation in which we found ourselves.</p> <p>  Mr. McKeon might provide me with a detailed note on the cases of fraud.  It would be no harm for me to have a look at the issue because it has been raised with me multiple times and having transparency would be important.</p></speech>

He is not getting to share the burden with the other witnesses even though doing so would have been beneficial this morning.</p><p>I wish to discuss the reply about energy use.  Mr. McKeon acknowledged an increase in expenditure on energy which was reflected in the reply to the parliamentary question I tabled.  I want to go through some of the reasons that accounted for it.  Mr. McKeon said there was a significant increase in gas and electricity prices.  The cost increased between 2019 and 2021.  However, 2020 was quite different in that prices plummeted in that year.  While that might be the case in 2021, there was a fluctuation but some of that fluctuation was also downwards.  I accept some of the points Mr. McKeon made about shift working, the extra accommodation the Department required and some of the other reasons.  He also stated that the Department met the target reduction between 2009 and 2020, which I acknowledge.<br/><br/>Mr. McKeon stated:</p><blockquote>	Even though 50% of staff worked onsite, remote access was required to facilitate the remaining staff working off site.  For security and other reasons, a remote access protocol was used which required desktop PCs to be maintained in a powered on position (remote PCs were simply used as a screen rather than having access to data and systems directly).  The Department is currently rolling out secure laptops to staff to eliminate this requirement. </blockquote><p>Would that be a clear demonstration of a risk or a weakness?  I know that blended working was very much accelerated by the arrival of Covid.  The fact that that is being done now, would that have been on the risk register, for example?  We saw the cyberattack on the HSE in 2021.</p></speech>

So, the protocol we put in place was a particular form of remote access where all the data are still in the Department's premises and, as the Deputy described it, the local PC in the person's home is just literally a screen.  No data transfer between the machine in the office and the machine at home.  That was the protocol we set up.  We have since got the secure laptops which will do away with the need to keep the-----</p></speech>

There are still some to be distributed.  The Department takes information security incredibly seriously.  I think we were probably the first Department to get information security, cybersecurity, accreditation from the ISO.  We had a number of very serious cyberattacks during the year which we successfully repelled.  They did not make the news because we take it so seriously.  That was the approach we took.  The approach of using that remote access protocol was, to use one of the terms of the moment, an abundance of caution.  The risk was actually probably very low in truth, but we do not tolerate, to the extent we can, any risk around access to data.</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon spoke about the services that are already contracted out - T&uacute;s, JobBridge and Job Clubs I believe.  At previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts I have outlined to Mr. McKeon my unhappiness with some of the offerings regarding JobBridge.  I know that is at an end or coming to an end.  It does not reassure me that because they have been contracted out in the past, we will do it again in terms of the interaction claimants and people who are on welfare have.  I have direct experience with my own local employment service, which I have found very good and pretty much centred on the individual.  I have seen people ending up in work which is what we all want to achieve as a consequence of that kind of one-to-one interaction.  I share Deputy McAuliffe's concerns about that local dimension being lost with what is happening.  There is a potential loss of some of the practices that have built up over the years.  To what extent has that aspect been looked at?  I know there have been reports, including the Indecon report.</p></speech>

That is what we are trying to do.  I know people are concerned about it.  Any process of change, particularly when people have been <i>in situ</i>for 25 years, is always unsettling.  What we are trying to do is secure exactly what the Deputy mentioned in terms of that local and community linkage.  I am optimistic that we will do so.  I point to the experience of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, where very similar concerns were expressed in 2014.  We have shown what can be done.  I think the experience in the first phase in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim shows it can be done.  We are taking the learnings on board.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned JobBridge; I think she meant JobPath.</p></speech>

My job is to be objective and to look at the data.  I would have to say that our customer research, which is independent, gives very good results for JobPath.  An interesting report was done by Michael McGann of Maynooth University of a street level bureaucrat view.  I think it was funded by the OECD or the European Commission.  What he found was that there are definite differences in terms of attitude and values between JobPath and local employment services, but they are not very significant.  In fact, some of them might be in the reverse direction from what one might expect.  While I do not want to put words in his mouth, I think the overall conclusion, if I remember, was that it has not resulted in the type of experience that people thought it might, based on, for example, the experience in the UK.  I say to the Deputy that she should have a look at the data and have a look at the results.  I think it has been a reasonably good service.  We are changing it.  There will be a national employment service as well as the regional, which we will tender out.  Obviously, the JobPath providers might or might not tender for that and they might or might not succeed if they do, but that is fine.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that some people are satisfied, but the level of dissatisfaction was something that, as a public representative, I could not ignore.  That is why I continue to raise it.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the scope section of the Department of Social Protection and about the possibility of bogus self-employment.  Does the scope section look at an individual or a sector?  Does it match an individual with a sector?  I know Deputy Munster raised this earlier.  I find it very difficult to join the dots on exactly who makes the decision or where the decision is made about who is employed and who is self-employed.  Revenue is telling us one thing and Mr. McKeon is telling us something different.  I do not know where the decision is actually made.</p></speech>

I recommend that people read it.  I do not agree with everything in the report, but it is a very good and comprehensive report.  It dealt with many of the points the Deputy raised.</p><p>It points out, as I pointed out earlier, that under law, the Department makes decisions about employment status for social insurance purposes.  We make those decisions independently of Revenue.  Revenue makes decisions in respect of tax, which are made independently of us.  The Workplace Relations Commission makes decisions in respect of employment rights, which are also made independently.  The report from the other committee recommended that it should be centralised in one body, which would be the Workplace Relations Commission.  I think it is not a bad recommendation and we probably need to look at whether it should be centralised in one area.</p><p> The Deputy asked about whether we would look at individuals or status.  I am aware that this is disputed.  From my experience, direct inquiries and direct discussions with people in the Department, we make decisions based on individuals.  Individuals are assessed for social insurance purposes based on the circumstances of their particular case.  We use criteria which are set out in the code of conduct for the determination of employment status, which we developed jointly with Ibec, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Revenue, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in the early 2000s.  That was recently updated.  We use the five criteria in that code of conduct to make the assessment.  Each assessment is individual.</p></speech>

It is a unit that we set up specifically to take a proactive view rather than waiting for people to come to us with an inquiry.  Where we have become aware of concerns about a particular sector or circumstances, we send our employment status investigations unit to look at it.  It would look at workers who may currently be on a contract for service when they could be deemed to be on a contract of service.

Where it is found that workers were wrongly classified, the implication is that they would not have had the correct employer's PRSI paid for up to 20 years.  In that case, is it the Department's position that those workers should retrospectively have those proper PRSI credits, class A credits, for example, reinstated?</p></speech>

In every case where we determine that a worker should have been properly classified as employed rather than self-employed, the worker will automatically get the class A contributions, and we will separately pursue the employer to recover the underpaid employer contributions.</p></speech>

We would raise and pursue it.  The circumstances of each case would determine how fast we would pursue it.  I do not think this will arise in a self-employment status case but, for example, if an employer avails of a redundancy and insolvency scheme because of an inability to pay redundancy, we will raise a debt for the employer, but we are cautious about the speed with which we pursue that debt.  If an employer is letting go ten people out of 20 and cannot afford to pay the redundancy debt, we will raise the debt, but pursuing the debt means it will have to lay off the second ten people, which is not in anyone's interests.  We take those considerations into account.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the midlands region was in the first phase.  I cannot answer that but the intention is that there will be more lots than the consultants recommended.  I emphasise that I have spoken personally with a number of different local employment service and jobs club providers, and I encourage them to collaborate.

I know that Mr. McKeon is probably aware of this and has probably had it quoted to him over the past few weeks.  There is a legal opinion that states that in layman's terms, if the contract was in place before 2014 and is not altered substantially, there is nothing to stop the Department from continuing with that.  Many of these services have been in place for a decade or two and have not changed substantially.  What would Mr. McKeon say to that?</p></speech>

From one perspective, this would be seen as unfortunate.  There is no "get out of jail" card on that basis.  The contracts we give are new contracts each year.  They are not contracts of indefinite duration.  They have termination clauses so they can be terminated with three months' notice by either party.  We have had cases where local employment service providers have terminated contracts themselves.  We have had cases where there have been governance issues and they have had to terminate contracts as a result.  Leaving aside the legal issue, which makes it absolutely unavoidable, there are also governance concerns about simply rolling things on and on.  There have been cases with significant governance issues, even involving Garda investigations, which some members may be aware of.  We have to take the issue of governance and proper procurement very seriously.</p></speech>

It said it was the fault of the Department of Social Protection because of the test cases and the poor criteria set out.  The Department of Social Protection said there were no test cases, then there were test cases.  A letter in the Department's correspondence to the Committee of Public Accounts from Mr. McKeon's predecessor states that test cases were selected for detailed investigation.  This process resulted in a decision by the appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office on 12 June 1995, who decided that a courier was self-employed if he provided his own vehicle and equipment, was responsible for all expenses, including tax and insurance and payment was made on the basis of rate per job plus mileage and allowance.  It went on to say that the appeal officer's decision established the criteria in relation to the employment status of couriers that has since been generally accepted throughout the industry and also by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  That coincides with what the Revenue Commissioners told us last week, that it was a single precedent set by the Department of Social Protection that led to all couriers being deemed to be self-employed.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I am deeply unsatisfied with the responses from both bodies.  The only step we can take now is to commission an independent investigation into the background to this deal.  I am sure the Secretary General of the Department would support that.  Would his Department agree to commission an independent investigation from someone outside the State?  I am sure he would support that in the interests of transparency and to clear all this up.</p></speech>

We apply those criteria to each case on its individual merits.  We do not and have not determined that all employees of a particular sector are one status or another.  On that basis, I do not agree with the Deputy's proposition and I do not think there is a need for an investigation.</p></speech>

How does that align with employment law?  Once a person is two years and nine months on a temporary contract, he or she is entitled to a permanent contract.  How can a local employment service stay within the law for some of its employees with that kind of arrangement?  Will that be the kind of arrangement if the service is contracted out?</p></speech>

It is three years or potentially five years.  At that point it would have to be tendered again.  It will not be in any way an indefinite duration.  There is a difference, as the Deputy is aware, between contract law and employment law.  There are more protections in employment law.  That would explain the difference.  Those issues do not arise in contract law.</p></speech>

As I say, I strongly encourage them to tender and to work together collaboratively to do so.  It will provide greater security and greater flexibility for the service providers who are successful.  It will entail far less bureaucracy as well.  We tend to talk about the disadvantages in this, but there are significant benefits for security of tenure, for greater flexibility, for guaranteed levels of income and referrals and for an integrated service for the client.  The client, instead of having an Intreo service to go to, can go to a local employment service.  In between, they might go to a job club.  By merging the two of those, there will be an integrated service.  It puts the service on a sound legal footing with better governance.  They are all the positives.  I do not think we should lose sight of those.  As I said before, I have no doubt that people are unsettled.  Any process of change will cause people to feel unsettled.  I encourage them to look at the positives in this and to see what Donegal and Sligo-Leitrim have done.  It can be done.</p></speech>

Could Mr. McKeon briefly outline the measures his Department employed to provide reassurance in those areas and to recoup any money that was incorrectly paid?</p></speech>

In the first instance, we had to introduce the scheme quickly.  We had to work on the presumption of honesty.  That created the risk of extra payments.  I formally recorded and communicated that fact to the Minister and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I copied that to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the time.  However, it was decided to accept that risk, given the greater good of supporting people during what was an unprecedented time.  At this point, all payments of the pandemic unemployment payment are checked against the Revenue Commissioners, both at claim stage and during an ongoing payment stage.  Throughout the past year and bit, or 21 months, we have undertaken a number of control activities.  Our special investigations unit has undertaken a number of control reviews.  We have run certification programmes and projects.  We have had the employer reporting line and we have had recertification.  As a consequence of those checks, we stopped approximately 140,000 claims in payment.  On the take on checks, we received approximately 1.8 million claims and we only paid 1.3 million claims.  To give people reassurance, there was already a check there.  On the next steps, as I said, our staff are currently supporting this system and the scheme.  They will be diverted to review all claims that were paid to see if there were any overlaps between payment and employment, particularly on the self-employment side.  This will happen over the coming year to raise any over-payments that are necessary to raise and to recover those payments.</p></speech>

Correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department in 2000 shows that there was a test case.  In that correspondence, the Secretary General of the Department of Social Welfare, as it was then called in 2000, said that in order to resolve the matter, a number of representative test cases were selected in 1993 and 1994 for detailed investigation and that the process resulted in a decision by an appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office on 12 June 1996, who decided that a courier was self-employed.  He went on to outline three grounds.  The chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners in August of the same year stated, &ldquo;I enclose copies of our letters of 7 March 1997 and 3 April 1997 to Messers K. Ryan and company".  They represented courier firms at the discussions in the Gresham Hotel.  The letters outlined the agreement reached for tax purposes.  They state that for the purpose of insurability under social welfare law a motorcycle courier was found to be self-employed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs tribunal some years ago and that the decision was not challenged further through the High Court on a point of law and consequently would stand for social insurance purposes.</p> <p>  A number of factors were set out.  The Chief State Solicitor at the time, Mr. Mark Connaughton, said the classification, or certain issues that would identify somebody as being self-employed "cannot of itself justify a conclusion that the claimant [the courier in this case] is in business on his own account". </p> <p>  In 2021, the current code of practice states that &ldquo;the provision of tools or equipment will not have a significant bearing on reaching a conclusion about which employment status is appropriate&rdquo;.  That is a change.  That is the reason I read out the 2021 code of practice.  I do not want to hammer home the point or anything, but it is clear in the number of direct quotations and correspondence that we have seen to date, that a deal was done to classify couriers as a group.  In the documents even for this meeting today, it is clear that the Department moved away from that practice approximately three or four years ago.  If I recall correctly, last year there were only three companies using that.  Now there are two companies using that, according to correspondence from the Department.  Is it correct that there has been a move away from that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#T00900"><p>None of that, in terms of interpretation of it, is reflective of the practice.  The Chair is quoting correspondence to me dating back 21 years, from a time when I was not even in the Department.  That was a long time ago.  For as long as I have been in the Department, which is since 2010, a person got their social insurance status, as required by law, based on the circumstances of their particular case, and I have been assured by my predecessors that that has always been the practice.</p> <p>  The Chair's first quote identified a number of criteria.  As I said, part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the early noughties resulted in the code of conduct for determination of employment and self-employment status.  That identified five criteria.  If memory serves me well, the line about ownership of tools and so on was in that code of conduct.  I am not 100% certain of that but I am pretty sure it was.  It is, therefore, not a move.  I am not aware of any deal that people are talking about.  If somebody could show me the deal, I would be interested to see it.  I am not aware of any deal.  People use the language of a deal.</p><p>I do not know whether they think we are trying to do something to help courier companies at the expense of courier staff.  That is simply not the case.  That is not the ethos or values of the Department.  It simply is not the case.  There is no reason why we would ever do that.  We try to determine cases based on the facts put before us.</p></speech>

The concern is that this practice would then be taken up in other sectors, such as construction.  I do not want that to take up this morning.  The point here is that it is clear from the documentation we have seen in the past year that there was a deal in operation and that it did operate.  It was scaled down in more recent years to the point where it is nearly non-existent now but, for a 20-year period, it did operate in a way that meant there would have been workers misclassified under that deal.  We know from the courier sector that not everybody wanted to be categorised as self-employed.  Some people who were doing it did not even know they were self-employed.</p> <p>  There are two problems.  One is the potential loss to the State of the revenue that needs to go into the Social Insurance Fund.  The second is the loss to the workers, particularly for pension entitlements and other entitlements.  That is the point.  I do not want to labour it today.</p></speech>

We will deal with it now.  We will look back at the circumstances that pertained and we will assess it now.  That is always open to workers.  We apply the criteria, as I said.  I am not aware of any deal.  I am assured there was no deal.  Even the quote the Chairman gave from the Revenue Commissioners, and I cannot speak for the Revenue Commissioners, referred to one case of one individual.</p></speech>

I am not familiar with the correspondence the Chairman is speaking to in regard to Revenue and I am sure the head of Revenue will speak for it.  The situation is that people get a determination and have always done based on the circumstances of their own case.  There are standard criteria that are applied.  There were cases, if the Chairman wants to call them test cases, that were used to establish those criteria but not to determine the outcome of the application of those criteria.  I think that is where the confusion arises.  If any worker wants to come to the Department now and have us look at their employment status at whatever time, they can do so.</p></speech>

If they say &ldquo;Boo&rdquo;, there is somebody else waiting to take their position.  There is a vulnerability there for workers.  I make the point that the Department needs to be aware of that in terms of the classification.  It is very difficult for a worker who is a cycle courier or a motorcycle courier to take a case.  Their employer will straightaway, in most cases, move to make life difficult for them.  I ask the Department to be aware of that.</p></speech>

I would encourage the committee members to look at the report from the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  The issue the Chairman is talking about is not an issue for the Department; it is an issue for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is about anti-victimisation or anti-penalisation provisions, on which there was some commentary.  As I said, there was a suggestion that, in fact, many of those issues are proper to the WRC.  We would be aware of those issues but our interest is solely in the social insurance classification.</p></speech>

We will then go into private session before adjourning.</p> <p>  The minutes of our meeting on 2 December have been circulated to members.  Do they wish to raise any issues relating to them?  Okay.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The next matter is accounts and financial statements, 11 of which were laid before the D&aacute;il between 26 November and 3 December.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to any members who wish to comment. </p></speech>

The first concerns the regulator of the national lottery.  That gets a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to note 9, which discloses the reasons accumulated pension liabilities totalling &euro;3 million have not been recognised in the financial statements.  The note also discloses that the regulator is awaiting a decision of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about pension proposals that were submitted in 2015.  The second set of financial statements relates to the national lottery fund for 2020.  There is a clear audit opinion on that.  Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board and Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board received clear audit opinions.  The Charities Regulatory Authority received a clear audit opinion.  Associated with that, a charities fund account for 2020 received a clear audit opinion.  The State property miscellaneous deposits account received a clear audit opinion.  The Travellers Protection Fund Investment Account received a clear audit opinion.  The Ireland-United States Educational Fund received a clear audit opinion.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation received a clear audit opinion.  The National Disability Authority received a clear audit opinion.  </p></speech>

If the Deputy has the document, she can click on the link and it will bring her to the statement in the accounts.  It is actually &euro;2.7 million, excluding VAT.  The note in the financial statements gives a fairly comprehensive breakdown of the types of procurement that were involved and the reasons the procurement was non-compliant.</p></speech>

Agreed.

As previously agreed, items that have not been flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence will be recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee's web page.  Eight items of correspondence have been flagged under category B, which is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, relating to follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  No. 910B is correspondence from Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive of Tusla, dated 22 November, which provides further information requested at our committee meeting with Tusla on 21 October.  We held this item over from last week's meeting because it was flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy, who was not in attendance due to commitments in the D&aacute;il.  This is a comprehensive response to 22 requests for information arising from that meeting, including a number of supporting documents.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the item?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 922B is correspondence from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, with whom we engaged this morning.  It is dated 25 November this year and provides information requested by the committee regarding the Department's investigations into contractors engaged by RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General states that due to the scale of the investigation, it is not possible to provide a specific timeline for its completion but it could continue into 2023.  While the Department is receiving good co-operation from RT&Eacute;, this investigation is being conducted alongside all other employment status investigations in other sectors.  The Secretary General goes on to detail the appeals process for such investigations.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item of correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p>This has been flagged by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not want to retrace this morning's steps but we followed up on the issue with Mr. McKeon and there are a number of questions there.  I suggest that we write to the Secretary General and ask to be kept informed of developments with that investigation.  It is a serious matter.  It seems to be of significant scale.  He refers in the letter to the scale of the investigation, so it is presumably very widespread or large.  We will ask to be kept apprised of the different developments and any significant findings on an ongoing basis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p> No. 927B is also from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection.  It is dated 26 November 2021 and provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement.  This and the next five items of correspondence are examples of responses to the requests we issue to bodies where the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to material instances of non-compliant procurement.  In 2020, the Department of Social Protection did not comply with procurement guidelines in relation to 92 contracts.  The Secretary General has asked that due to the commercial sensitivity of the contract value information it be treated in confidence so I ask members to bear that in mind.  We will note and publish this item, which was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p><p> No. 932B is correspondence from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, dated 29 November 2021, also providing information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement.  The explanations provided in relation to the Prison Service&rsquo;s non-compliant procurement are less informative.  While I welcome the fact that contracts are now in place in 11 of the 16 cases referred to, it is proposed to request further details on the reasons for each instance of non-compliance with procurement guidelines in the Prison Service.  This item was also flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy but I do not think she is present.</p><p> No. 937B is from Ms Jacqui McCrum, Secretary General of the Department of Defence, dated 29 November 2021.  It is a detailed response to the committee&rsquo;s request for information on non-compliant procurement.  It is proposed to note and publish this item. Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  There is a short letter and a table giving more details.</p><p> No. 939B is from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, dated 29 November 2021.  The non-compliant procurement for the Department in 2020 totalled over &euro;91 million.  With the exception of two, this concerned contracts that moved to the Department as part of the transfer of functions from the Department of Justice that occurred in 2020.  All 151 of these contracts related to the provision of accommodation services for international protection applicants.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  It was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021120900002#AA00200"><p>This is a point of particular interest as it relates to contracts pertaining to direct provision that were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  According to the Secretary General, Mr. Fergal Lynch, the previous Department, namely, the Department of Justice, had a view that the contracts were competitive and not applicable for inclusion in the return under circular 40/2002, but this Accounting Officer took a different view.  This indicates a difference in interpretation across the board, given that one Department can take a diametrically different view from another about the same contract, and it therefore raises broader questions about different contracts.  Could Mr. McCarthy comment on whether there are varying levels of compliance issues across Departments?  This correspondence affirms that there is a subjective view to all of this.</p> <p>  The committee should accept the offer of a more detailed breakdown being provided on a confidential basis.  That would be useful to our deliberations.  We are going to be discussing the report on direct provision, following on from our consideration of the Department of Justice's report.  Before we finally sign off on that, it would be good if we could get a briefing from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of the progress to date on its commitment to dismantle the direct provision system.</p></speech>

They are not the standard thing.  If they related to a more direct procurement of goods and services, it would be clearer as to whether the procurement was compliant or non-compliant.  The previous Department, which was the Department of Justice, considered that the procurement was compliant on the basis that the requirement for the accommodation for asylum seekers had been publicly advertised in national and local newspapers but the new Accounting Officer re-examined the matter.  I do not know whether he took legal advice on it but he certainly formed the view that it was not compliant.  When I reported previously on this, I drew attention to the fact that it was not competitively procured.  That was about four or five years ago.  There was some advertising after that and we had a discussion with the Department of Justice at the time on whether it was a compliant procurement.  There is certainly an arguable case, although this is probably a more difficult one to call than many others.  There would not be the same level of ambiguity with most of what is pointed out.</p></speech>

Before we move on, I wish to note an oversight on my part.  No. 927B from the Department of Social Protection was provided in confidence.  I stated incorrectly that we would note and publish it.  I should have said that we would note it but not publish it because of the nature of its contents.</p><p>I ask members to respect that.</p></speech>

It provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement.  The scale of the expenditure here is significant.  In its 2020 accounts, the HSE declared 91% of expenditure that was subject to procurement rules to be compliant, representing a value of over &euro;1.7 billion, with 9% declared to be non-compliant, representing a value of over &euro;184 million.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed.  It was flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p> <p>  Is Deputy Carthy indicating he wants to contribute again?</p></speech>

We had a hearing with representatives of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications at which we discussed the national broadband plan, among other issues.  With respect to the national broadband plan, there has been an extensive series of articles in <i>The Currency</i>that have a number of very worrying aspects in terms of the beneficial ownership of the consortium and, critically, in terms of investors having been paid substantial sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money in 2020 before a single home was even connected under the plan.  I believe we proposed that representatives of the Department appear before the committee alongside representatives associated with the national broadband plan so as to expedite this matter as quickly as possible in the new year.  If that could be accommodated by the members, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

It is an important issue.</p> <p>  No. 943B is related to what Deputy Carthy has just mentioned.  It is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, and dated 1 December 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement.  It concerns two contracts, totalling under &euro;1 million and excluding VAT.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed?  It was also flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p> <p>  The next category of correspondence is category C, which contains correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 947C is from a PhD candidate with the Royal College of Surgeons and dated 1 December 2021.  It is a submission to the committee raising concerns about governance arrangements for payments from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare organisations and healthcare professionals.  The correspondence states the evidence is that the receipt of pharmaceutical company payments is associated with higher prescribing rates, higher prescribing costs and lower prescribing quality.</p> <p>  Given that public funds are expended on prescription medication, it is important that robust and effective governance arrangements be in place.  While a wider examination of this issue might be more appropriate to the health committee, I propose in the first instance to request the correspondent's consent to forward the correspondence to the Department of Health to request a response to the matters raised.</p> <p>  This correspondence has been flagged for discussion by me and Deputy Catherine Murphy who is not present.  The issue is the negative influence in respect of the prescribing of medication.  Undue influence could be exerted by big pharmaceutical companies, which have a lot of clout, to promote a particular brand or quantity of a drug.  That is of concern.  As the student pointed out, the State alone spent &euro;2.3 billion on pharmaceuticals in 2020.  It rose from &euro;1.3 billion in 2012, so it is a substantial amount of money.</p></speech>

I know this is the Committee of Public Accounts but I believe this matter is one of undue influence, particularly interference with what might be prescribed.  How do we verify what is the case in this regard?  The letter states there is evidence, but how do we know?</p></speech>

I have read a few times the summary of what he sent us.  I propose that, in the first instance, we seek the correspondent&rsquo;s permission to forward the correspondence to the Department of Health.  It is open to us to request, following that Department&rsquo;s response, further information or evidence from the correspondent.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is serious if there is an allegation that someone is in breach of contract, which he or she technically would be in the circumstances described.  On what evidence is the allegation based?  The evidence is very much anecdotal rather than factual.  I agree with the Chairman that we should send the correspondence to the Department of Health and that it should come back to us with a detailed response, but I would like to ascertain where we should go to try to establish evidence for what is alleged to be occurring.</p></speech>

The links contain information to back up his case.  We are not in a position to adjudicate on the strength of the information.  The Deputy is correct that it is a very serious matter.  That is the reason I flagged it for discussion.  On the point raised by Deputy Verona Murphy on the well-being of patients if overprescribing were happening, it would not be a healthy situation &mdash; pardon the pun.  If certain drug companies have undue influence on medical practitioners or services generally in this country, it is very worrying.  Deputy Colm Burke is correct about contracts.  The best thing to do is to request the correspondent&rsquo;s permission to send the correspondence to the Department for its response in the first instance.</p><p>We could also ask that if the correspondent has any further evidence, he would forward that to the committee or the Department of Health, if that is acceptable.  </p></speech>

The Department of Health determines the format and disclosures that are required in the financial statements so the Department is in the best position to give a view on those governance matters.  It is a bigger thing to make an allegation of bias as a result of that because there are identifiable doctors on a website mentioned in the article who receive funding.  It could be in the form of sponsorship for events, research funding and so on.  It would be impossible to conclude that every doctor who receives such funding would be compromised or that it would have negatively affected their prescribing.  There are professional standards regulators who would be better equipped to address that aspect.  The issue from the committee's point of view is around how this funding is accounted for and how transparent it is in the financial statements.</p></speech>

We can ask in that letter that if the correspondent has further evidence of this happening, it be forwarded to the committee or the Department of Health.</p> <p>  The last correspondence in this group is No. R0929.  It is from the clerk to the Joint Committee on Petitions requesting observations on proposals to amend the committee's order of reference.  If members want to make a submission on this, they should contact the clerk to the committee.  Members have the item in front of them.</p> <p>  Next is No. 4, work programme.  Next Thursday, 16 December we will engage with the Department of Health on the 2020 appropriation accounts and Vote 38 - Health.  As discussed last week, the Department has been made aware that the committee wishes to discuss two outstanding reports.  The first concerns a detailed review of the progress on the national children's hospital.  That was submitted to the Department earlier this year.  The second concerns the value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme.  Both are long overdue.  Last week, we agreed to write to the Department to request further information on these reports and that information was requested by tomorrow, 10 December.</p> <p>  On 25 November, we agreed our work programme for early in the new year and will continue to revisit that programme each week.  RT&Eacute; is the first sitting in January.  That concludes our consideration of that programme for today.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Senator Craughwell.  I welcome Deputy Clarke from Longford Westmeath.</p> <p>  The Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach have appealed to all in the parliamentary community to continue to follow public health advice, wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  The Ceann Comhairle has asked that only the committee Chairs and required service staff should be present in committee rooms.  All members should therefore attend committee meetings remotely from their offices within the Leinster House campus unless they are required to attend in person for voting in committee.  Witnesses should not be requested to attend the committee room and should be facilitated in giving evidence remotely from within the precincts or from outside Leinster House subject to being advised that privilege may not apply to evidence given from outside the precincts.  This will help to mitigate the risk of Covid-19, including the Delta and Omicron variants, spreading among the parliamentary community.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should always be worn during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  I propose that we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings that took place on 24 and 25 November.  The minutes were already agreed during our private session but we must agree them again now for procedural reasons.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regard references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements made are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Mr. Forde Kelly cannot be with us.  I am glad to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Barrett who is accompanied by Mr. Jack O'Sullivan, an experienced environmental scientist, and Mr. Conor Dowling-Linehan.</p> <p>  This committee considers petitions on matters of public concern or interest in relation to the Houses legislative powers or issues of public policy.  As these petitions deal with local or regional matters, or matters that are more appropriate to a regulatory public body or body established for the purpose of redress, the committee is to be sure that the petitioners have used all available avenues of appeal or redress.  However, it would not be necessary for petitioners to go into great detail about what happened.</p> <p>  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements and submissions on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I suggest that our witnesses should make their opening statement for approximately ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have five minutes.  Members may speak more than once.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Barrett to make his opening statement.  He will be followed by Mr. Jack O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

The petition relates to the unfairness of unauthorised development on the River Shannon and its lakes and the potential damage it can do to the environment.</p><p>My presentation seeks to explain all the documents and photographs that I have submitted to the committee.  What I want the committee to investigate is how some could people be allowed to develop over a period of years, some in recent times, without any planning permission on property owned and governed by Waterways Ireland in a special protection area, SPA, and a special area of conservation, SAC.  It has done so without contributing anything to the owners of the property, who at the end of the day are the citizens of Ireland.  Everybody owns part of that property because it is State property.  Furthermore, how could these people have received grant aid while they were the subject of an enforcement order and investigation by Waterways Ireland?  In its application form for the grant aid, it clearly states that it is for expansion of existing activities.  Waterways Ireland, therefore, received State money to expand an unauthorized development and business.</p><p> I am delighted to be before this committee and fully confident I will get a fair hearing.  I hope that any injustices that have occurred will be made good.  I will hand members over to Mr. O'Sullivan in a moment.  He is an environmental consultant and scientist with many years of experience dealing with issues like this.  Before I hand him over to members I want to go through some photographs that will give them an idea of the areas and developments we are talking about.  Do members see the photo in the background?</p></speech>

The red line is the Waterways Ireland jurisdiction line.  We had that measured by a cartographer who had worked in Ordnance Survey Ireland all his life and was highly qualified.  He drew this up for us and we submitted it to both Westmeath County Council and Waterways Ireland and to date nobody has come back and contradicted it so we have to assume it is accurate and correct.  Members also have his original statements.  This marina has been built over many years but the southern end was built in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  It came to our attention in 2012 that it was an unauthorised development and we brought it to the attention of Waterways Ireland, Westmeath County Council and the then Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources.  This part of the marina was well within the seven-year rule at this time so both Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council could have done something about it.  Westmeath County Council took four and a half years before it brought an enforcement order against it.  It went before the District Court judge who ruled it inadmissible on technical grounds because of the wording of the summons, not on the rights or wrongs of the development or the fact that the marina was legal or illegal.  The county council has not come back to do anything about the enforcement of this area of the marina, which it could have done within the seven-year rule.</p> <p>  The rest of the marina has been built over a long period but it has clearly been built on Waterways Ireland property as anything outside of the jurisdiction line is Waterways Ireland property.  Waterways Ireland has done nothing whatsoever about the marina even though it admits it is on its property.  Why is Waterways Ireland not doing anything?  Why is it not protecting the property of the people of Ireland?  Why is it allowing an unauthorised marina to have been developed and run, generating a large amount of money, without doing anything about it?  I would like to put another question to members of the committee, Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  Planning legislation was used to take an enforcement order.  Environmental legislation, which is very strong and does not have any statutory limitations, has not been used.  Why?  It is still an SAC and an SPA to this day under Irish and European law.  Why has environmental law not been used to take prosecutions and to do something about it?</p> <p>  I want to introduce a series of Ordnance Survey Ireland photographs to members, which give a timeline for the marina.  The first photograph is from a long way back; Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan will remember that time but some of the rest of us will not.  This photo from 1973 shows where the marina is built today.  This was a full ten years after planning legislation was introduced in this country.  Some ten years after planning legislation was introduced there was a small dock here and nothing going out into the lake.  It was completely clear and the lake bed and reed banks had no development whatsoever.  The next photograph is an Ordnance Survey Ireland photograph that was taken in 2005.  If members observe the southern side of the marina nothing was present and that is the area that has since been developed.  I will now introduce a photograph from 2007 to members.  Members can see the quayside wall on the southern side of the marina, which is about 120 ft.  Thousands of tonnes of rock, armour rock and various other materials had been introduced by 2007.  The next photograph is from 2009.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time that is being taken up showing pictures.</p></speech>

Ordnance Survey Ireland photographs will clearly show that in 2007 and 2008 there was no marina whatsoever here.  We brought it to attention in 2012, well within the seven years required.  The first Ordnance Survey Ireland photograph shows that ten years after planning permission was introduced in this country, nothing was there, and there is a full-blown development there today.  I will now hand members over to Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan, environmental consultant, who will discuss the environmental issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021120900002#B00600"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this brief statement on behalf of Mr. Barrett.  I am an environmental scientist and I have been practising independently since 1977.  Mr. Barrett referred to how long I have been around and that is it.  I was a science policy analyst with the National Science Council before that.  Much of my work in those years was on the interface between planning and environment.  I have undertaken environmental impact statements and evaluated them and done screening reports, and I have always stressed to my clients the need for strict compliance with planning and environmental legislation.  Mr. Barrett has given members a very good account and I will follow on with a brief blow-by-blow account of the environmental and legal issues.</p> <p>  The fact that the marina was unauthorised was confirmed to us, both by Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  On behalf of Mr. Barrett we initially sought to find out if it was authorised or not and Westmeath County Council said it had no planning permission.  That development, as shown by Mr. Barrett, has taken place within and adjacent to the Lough Ree SAC and the Lough Ree SPA for wildlife, both of which are important conservation sites of European community interest.  An environmental impact assessment report, EIAR, and a screening report for appropriate assessment should have been completed for that development but they were not.  No EIAR was completed and a screening report for appropriate assessment was prepared by the developer much later in 2014.</p> <p>  It would have been possible for the marina owner and operator to apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for leave to make an application for what was then termed &ldquo;substitute consent&rdquo;, which was akin to retention permission.  This could have been done provided that the application was accompanied by a remedial environmental impact statement, or a remedial Natura impact statement, or both.  Unfortunately, the marina owner did not do so.</p><p>He made an application to Westmeath County Council for retention of the marina.  Since that backward-looking, substitute consent can only be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the council had no option but to declare that the planning application was invalid.<br/><br/>At that time, Waterways Ireland also stated that the encroachment of the marina into navigable water under its control could not be regularised by issuing a lease until the planning issue had been resolved.  Waterways Ireland stated that it could not issue a lease unless the planners were happy with the marina, but the planners were not happy.  Even if Westmeath County Council had the legal authority to consider a planning application - it did not, as that authority was given to An Bord Plean&aacute;la - the applicant could not legally have sought planning permission because the development of the marina was on land that he did not own and was not under his control.  The only agency that could have given permission for the applicant to seek planning permission was Waterways Ireland, which owned the site.<br/><br/>To make matters even more complicated, the Supreme Court delivered a judgment in July 2020 that had the effect of removing the legislation under which An Bord Plean&aacute;la was empowered to grant substitute consent for a development that had already taken place.  That consent was only allowed for in exceptional circumstances.  A judge in another case said that these circumstances were not exceptional.  The same legislation, which was an amendment to the Planning Act, was struck down for the additional reason that it failed to make provision for public participation at the leave application stage for substitute consent.  The court found that this provision, which allowed the applicant to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la directly without any public consultation, was inconsistent with the right to public participation in environmental decision making enshrined in or conferred by the EIA directive and the Aarhus Convention.<br/><br/>The fact that the applicant did not initially attempt to seek planning permission from Westmeath County Council or to obtain a lease from Waterways Ireland has had a series of consequences that are now difficult to resolve satisfactorily in compliance with the current legislation and the relevant EU directives.  The marina in question, if it were to be a proposed new development on a greenfield site, would require planning permission, the production of an EIA report, a Natura impact statement because it will affect an SPA and an SAC, and a lease from Waterways Ireland.  However, as Mr. Barrett has shown, the marina has been in existence for a number of years, it has expanded in size and none of the planning and environmental requirements have been met, nor is there any legislation allowing the marina to become authorised and Waterways Ireland cannot consider granting a lease until the planning issues have been resolved.<br/><br/>Two options for addressing this problem might be considered by the committee, if it wishes to do so.  Both options are difficult and neither is perfect in any way.  First, the unauthorised marina may be left <i>in situ</i>, but this gives a clear message to the public that undertaking development without seeking the necessary consents may, in the long run, be a successful strategy.  This solution weakens planning legislation and brings planning and development control into disrepute.  Second, the unauthorised marina, or those sections of it constructed since 2007, should be removed with as little ecological disturbance as possible.  While this might be legally correct, the financial consequences for the marina operator would be severe and the removal of some of the marina would be likely to cause some ecological disturbance with only minor ecological benefits.  Considering these options and others that have not occurred to me is something that the committee may wish to discuss after taking what evidence it wishes to hear from Waterways Ireland, Westmeath County Council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department and other witnesses.</p></speech>

What the witnesses have told us is interesting and I imagine that members have many questions.  They might indicate via the "raise hand" button but I will kick things off.  I have read back over some of these statements and previous petitions.  Was this matter brought to Westmeath County Council's attention while the marina was being built between 2006 and 2009 or before 2012?  Did Mr. Barrett bring it to the attention of the authorities then?</p></speech>

It only came to my attention that it was an unauthorised development as a result of an accident at the marina.  I was asked to go out, recover a damaged boat and do the repair work by the insurers.  It became apparent then that it was an unauthorised development with no planning permission.  I brought the matter to the attention of Westmeath County Council in 2012.  The council issued its first warning letter on 3 May 2012 and its first enforcement notice in January 2013.</p></speech>

I brought it to their attention in 2012, which was well within the seven-year Statute of Limitations on unauthorised developments.  It took them a further four and a half years to bring the case to court, which was in 2016.  That case was dismissed on technical grounds relating to the wording of the summons.  They described the southern end of the marina as a slip but it is clearly moorings and a quayside.  The judge told the authorities that they could reapply but that the summons was not correct on technical grounds.</p> <p>  In 2014, during that process, the Portaneena marina made a request to the council as a result of an enforcement order for an extension of one month to allow it to remove the unauthorised structures.  The family that owned the marina confirmed that the unauthorised structures and jetties would be removed by the end of November of that year should permission be granted.  I am showing the relevant document now.  Westmeath County Council granted one month's extension.  Eight or nine years later, the development is still there and nothing has been done about it.  Despite entering into a written agreement with the council to remove what the family themselves described as unauthorised jetties, nothing has happened and the council has made no effort to make anything happen.</p></speech>

The first warning letter was in 2012 and the first enforcement letter was in January 2013.  On 26 July 2013, it got LEADER funding.  I am showing its application for LEADER funding.  Question No. 2 on the application asked what the funding was for, the reply to which was the expansion of existing activities.  This means that, while the company was the subject of an enforcement order and being investigated by Waterways Ireland for developing on the latter's land, it got State funding to run an unauthorised development and expand its unauthorised activities.</p></speech>

I have a development and a business that I run on the lake.</p><p>I am pro-development.  We have some beautiful developments in Lough Ree and all over the Shannon.  Any development done in an environmentally friendly fashion and with planning permission is beneficial to the local area and its people and businesses, including the pubs, restaurants and shops.  I brought this petition because people cannot develop willy-nilly with complete disregard for planning permission.  They also cannot develop on property they do not own.  We have a situation where a development is generating large amounts of money.  It is not in compliance with environmental or planning law.  It is built on property owned by Waterways Ireland.  That is to say, it is built on property owned by the members, me and by everybody else.  That is what I am against.  I am totally in favour of authorised development.  I would like to see authorised development.  I would like to see the two premises that I have mentioned getting planning permission, developing in an environmentally friendly way, and being beneficial to the local community.</p></speech>

Both of these developments will be very beneficial to the area.  One is only being developed at the moment and could be retained.  Should it be developed in an environmentally friendly fashion and with planning permission, it will bring hundreds of people to this area and will be beneficial in every way.  All I want is for both the developments to be regularised.  Planning permissions should be obtained.  If they are built on property that those involved do not own or that is owned by the State, the State should either grant them a licence or work out some way to hand the property over to them.  I do not want them to be demolished.  I want them to go ahead, but I want it to be with planning permission.</p></speech>

It is great to be here talking about this.  God knows this is surely not a one-off situation, although I hope it is.  A substantial amount of information was provided to the committee about this.  There were nearly 200 pages of evidence.  Going back to what Mr. Barrett was saying regarding 2012 and the enforcement notice in 2013, Westmeath County Council clearly states in its affidavit that there was no planning permission for the marina and that the marina was an unauthorised development.  A case brought to court in 2016, as Mr. Barrett said, was dismissed on a technicality.  I find that strange because it was already called an unauthorised development and a marina, but I am not the judge on this.  Is there still an enforcement notice against that development?  It was still within the seven-year period.  Did the council or anybody bring a case under the planning law or under any environmental legislation?  That is my first question.  Can the witnesses expand on that?  It is stated that planning permission was never granted and yet this development could proceed.  I have had incidents where little sheds for motorbikes were taken down because those involved did not apply for permission for the solid base necessary for a metal shed.  Will Mr. Barrett elaborate on that?  I will have a second question later, if possible.</p></speech>

He did not nullify the enforcement order.  As far as I am concerned, the enforcement order is still in place today.  Since the case, as far as I can see, having looked up all public records, Westmeath County Council has done nothing about this.  Waterways Ireland has done nothing about it.  Neither of the two statutory bodies has considered prosecuting under environmental law, which is not subject to a statute of limitations and which is fairly strong.  As the committee can see, the whole marina is built in a special protection area and special area of conservation, so I would have thought that environmental law should come into force and that there would be prosecutions under that law.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief with my second question.  Mr. Barrett referred to the Portaneena Marina belonging to Waterways Ireland.  Waterways Ireland is paid money by the State, so those are public funds, if I am correct.  There is nothing wrong with the marina or its location.  It is beneficial in every way to society once, as Mr. Barrett says, everything is done right.  The marina was developed on property belonging to Waterways Ireland.  Who had the responsibility?  Was it the responsibility of the developer, Waterways Ireland, Westmeath County Council or all three to make sure that all of these planning regulations, special protection area considerations and environmental impact studies were adhered to?  Should they have been responsible for those?  Were they carried out or was it done on the quiet?  I am being very blunt.  Was it done on the quiet since it was tucked into a nice little area and nobody would cop on to it, so it would be fine?  Who benefits in the long run or the short term?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021120900002#D00900"><p>I will help to answer that.  Like all of these things, there is never just one issue.  There is always a whole series of issues.  The first problem arose when the developer did not seek planning permission before he started constructing the marina.  The county council did the correct thing in issuing a notification.  The developer did not attempt to seek planning permission for retention, which he could have done at the time.  To do so required, under the legislation at the time, going not to the county council but to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  He did not do that.  He attempted to seek retention permission by making an application to the county council.  Westmeath County Council quite correctly stated that it was not something it could deal with.  The applicant did not go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the terms of legislation that was in place.  When that legislation was struck down by the High Court, there seems to be nowhere to go.  The appalling thing is that there is no legislation permitting the developer to regularise the situation.  Waterways Ireland clearly stated that it cannot regularise it by issuing a lease until the planning permission is okay.  The whole thing seems to have got caught in a trap because people did not think through exactly what they should have done to comply under the law.  It is not easy.  I know these things are complex, but the rules are there.  If you get someone to advise you on what to do, and then do that, this kind of situation should not happen.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

As far as I know, none of those was completed in this development.  There is an environmental aspect as well as it being Government property and there being a lack of planning permission from a local authority.  There are a few areas which could set a bad precedent for environmental protection along the River Shannon.  It is concerning to anyone who makes a living from the river.</p></speech>

He went ahead willy-nilly without any regard for property rights or ownership of property.  The property is owned by Waterways Ireland.  That was completely disregarded.  He built on property owned by Waterways Ireland, disregarding planning, and none of the authorities seems to be doing anything about it.</p><p>That accident went before a District Court in Athlone.  Two young people who had the accident prosecuted and the judge ruled that it was an unauthorised development.  Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council both gave evidence stating that it was an unauthorised development.  There has been another very serious accident since then, which is in the process of going to court, but who has the liability for these accidents?

I am saying that this is part of an abrogation.  People are on the lake on property owned by Waterways Ireland and developed without planning permission.  Who has the liability?  The taxpayer is already being punished because his or her property has been taken and legal funding, which is paid by the taxpayer, was granted to an unauthorised development.  The taxpayer will be further punished if the development is not insured and Waterways Ireland or the people of Ireland are liable.  The liability, and the question of who is responsible for accidents and even moorings, is a serious issue.</p> <p>  It is very important to state that good decent people who are boat owners are paying large amounts of money to be moored there.  They are moored on property without planning permission that is owned by Waterways Ireland.  If a member of the public has an accident involving one of those boats, who gets prosecuted?  Who is liable?  Those unsuspecting boat owners may be liable.  I do not know, but it is a question that has to be answered.   </p></speech>

Before I bring in someone else, I have just gone through the 2019 petition, which Mr. Forde Kelly probably submitted.  It states that this situation was brought to the attention of Waterways Ireland, Westmeath County Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It did not involve the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage at that stage but a different Department.  For all the Departments that have been identified and all these large commercial developments that have been built within a short distance of each other, it seems that planning and the ownership of the property has just been ignored in all cases, as have all the Irish and European environmental laws.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan or Mr. Barrett shed any light on that?  Have all these bodies and laws been ignored, in their opinion?</p></speech>

Several developments, two of which I mentioned, have been built on property owned by Waterways Ireland without permission from that body.  They have been built without any planning permission whatsoever or any regard for environmental laws.  Basically, they have been built without any regard for anything.  When it was brought to the attention of the local statutory bodies, in this case Westmeath County Council, Waterways Ireland and the Department of the Environment, they seemed to be very slow and very hesitant to do anything about it.  In fact, to a certain extent, they seemed to encourage it.</p></speech>

Even on ordnance survey maps, boundaries have been adjusted to put the property within the company's property until that was revoked and changed back.

I hope Senator Murphy may be able to get in as well.  I thank the witnesses for their work, for being very proactive citizens on this issue and for bringing it all the way to Leinster House.  It is important that we hear from Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  I know the solutions are not easy.  There is no perfect solution to this.  Leaving the development <i>in situ</i>creates a bit of a mockery of the planning process, but if we are worried about the environment we all know about the environmental impact of demolition and construction waste, which Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned.  Fines and penalties are probably somewhere in between.  Is there a precedent for that?  Is any of the witnesses aware of a precedent for fines for these kinds of private developments that did not have permission, while leaving them <i>in situ</i>?  We should hear from Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  I thank our guests.</p></speech>

If we take a more general broad view of why these kinds of things happen, there are possibly two causes that may be within the purview of this committee and more within that of the Government.  First, after the fall of the Celtic tiger, let us put it like that, many of our local authorities were almost emasculated and lots of staff were cut.  I have a certain degree of sympathy with our local authorities - not 100% but I understand what they are trying to do and their planners and other staff are overstretched all the time.</p> <p>  A second difficulty they face is that there is a culture in Ireland, and I am not saying this is true of any particular county but I have seen this happen in my county of Westmeath, not in relation to this case, but others, where a general view is held among people who might be members of the public or landowners that they have a right to develop and planners are standing in their way.  That is not a nice culture to have.  It eventually leads to corruption of the planning laws and so on.</p> <p>  Finally, I know of a number of situations, including in Westmeath, where the county council has felt unable, for whatever reason, to act or move against a developer who has flagrantly transgressed the planning laws.  I find that very unfortunate.  I spoke to a chief planner in Westmeath County Council quite a long time ago about one particular development, which I will not name, unless the Chairman wants me to. </p></speech>

His answer to me very simply was, and I still remember his words, that he had a word with the council's law agent about it and that agent said it could be a question of costs.  To me, that was a coded message saying that the county council, as a planning authority, was reluctant or fearful of going against this very wealthy set of companies because it might lose.  The companies had very deep pockets and very well-heeled barristers.  The council was afraid to take a risk because if it did it would do so with public money.  If it lost a case against that developer, it was sure that all hell would break loose and county councillors would attack the executive for taking such a risk.  It is very hard to uphold the planning legislation in that kind of climate.  That is why I have a certain degree of sympathy for county councils.  This is really a matter for the Government to deal with as well.</p></speech>

I also thank members of the committee for allowing me to ask questions.  Their hospitality is most welcome.</p><p>I am somewhat familiar with this situation, having been a member of Westmeath County Council for a term.  I recall looking at some of the files pertaining to this, under the watchful eyes of one of the executives of Westmeath County Council.  The sheer quantity of paperwork and records on file then was mind-boggling.  I have a couple of observations.  I am beyond concerned that we have this scale of development on State-owned land and it has been going on now for almost ten years.  Mr. Barrett is correct that there needs to be development along our lakeshores but it needs to be appropriate and compliant with the regulations we have in place.  The economic benefit for the area will be phenomenal if it is done properly through tourism and an increase in appropriate lakeshore activities.  That said, not just in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath and certainly not just in this case, we are seeing an almost creeping of development along lakeshores.  This has the potential for a scale of negative impact that we simply will not come back from on the ecology of the lakes and the reduction of access to the lakes for the general public.</p><p> What strikes me very strongly is how our State bodies do not interact with each other and do not work in a collaborative way.  This is a failure and in my opinion it is one that cannot be allowed to continue.  With due respect, I suggest the committee takes on board Mr. O'Sullivan's suggestion to bring before it the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Westmeath County Council, Waterways Ireland and the Department.  What we have today is the potential to form the important recommendations needed to change the legislation.  The legislation needs to change.  A number of months ago, I asked a parliamentary question on whether the seven-year rule is paused when a local authority issues an enforcement notice regarding an unauthorised development.  In its opening sentence the reply from the Minister stated enforcement of unauthorised development is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission.  Nothing in the reply tells me there is a requirement on the local authority to take the appropriate action, only that it can do so, as if it were an option to do so.  I do not believe there is an option.  In Mr. O'Sullivan's professional experience, and he has given us quite a track record of his professional experience, how many of these developments does he believe are in existence?  How prevalent is the sidestepping of regulations when it comes to lakeshore or waterfront development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021120900002#F00200"><p>To be honest, I do not know.  Everywhere I have looked in almost every county where I have worked, and I have worked in a lot of counties on different plans, there always seems to have been a number of developments that have not gone through the system but have ended up - I will not say permitted but that they have continued without permission.  The only situation I know of where an unauthorised development was permitted, and there is only one example, is in County Wicklow where a woman, I believe her name was Ms Fortune, built a small house in a fairly remote area not visible from the road.  Wicklow County Council took a case against her to get the house demolished.  There was a court hearing.  Mr. Justice Hogan said there is a constitutional right to a house and that it was not doing any harm to anybody so he did not give Wicklow County Council the order it wanted.  This caused consternation among planners because a judge effectively stated a constitutional right to a house was more important than abiding by the planning law.  The judge had to come back and give another ruling that stated it only applied to that particular case and the judgment was not to be taken as a generality.  This was a very rare case.</p> <p>  In most cases I am familiar with there is no excuse whatsoever as to why the law should not be enforced against developers who flout it and who do not seek planning permission.  The only problem as I see it is the one I referred to earlier, whereby a planning authority is ill-prepared because it does not have the staff.  Exactly as Deputy Clarke has said, the amount of paperwork is unbelievable.  I have to wade through 300 or 400 page environmental impact assessment reports.  Planners might have two or three of these on their desks.  It is a tough job.  I suggest one of the things that might be looked at nationally, and this might be within the purview of the committee, is whether we are staffing our local authorities with enough people.  We have planners and engineers.  Do we have environmental scientists on our planning authorities?  I do not ask this because I am an environmental scientist.  I ask because I believe they are needed.  I know of only one planning authority, which is in Cork, that has a county architect.  She spoke to me the other day and said she was agitating to get a landscape architect.  There is a problem nationally and I believe it is more widespread than I know of personally.  It would not surprise me if there were more examples of this type which are not generally hitting the headlines but only thanks to someone such as Mr. Barrett they have reached the stage of being heard before an Oireachtas committee.</p></speech>

Under section 157(4)(aa) of the relevant planning Act enforcement action may be taken against unauthorised quarrying and unauthorised peat extraction at any time.  Is there merit in examining the widening of this to include our lakeshores and unauthorised development that could ultimately have a very profound negative impact on special areas of protection or special areas of conservation?</p></speech>

There is scope for widening the legislation.  Another problem to which I have not referred is that we are under scrutiny by the European Commission, and rightly so, and we do not have the greatest record among member states.  There are others worse than us and I have to admit this.  With regard to proper management of special areas of protection for wildlife and special areas of conservation we could be doing better.  If the committee were to bring before it the National Parks and Wildlife Service it might be very good.  For my part I have much sympathy for people working in the service.  This branch of our State service has been kicked from one Department to another since the 1960s and 1970s.  It has never really been given the degree of support it needs.  It is better than it was.  I remember the 1970s and 1980s when it did not know where it was.  It is much better now.  It could still do with a lot of strengthening.  I remember visiting a national park in Lithuania in 1995 when I worked for the Lithuanian Government.  I asked how many people worked in that national park and I nearly took a step backwards when the director told me there were approximately 200 staff.  I said that was more than we had in the whole of Ireland in the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  We could be doing better at government level.  I know there is a shortage of money but it is very important for us at this time to take care of our national parks from the point of view of biodiversity and climate.  I hope this answers Deputy Clarke.  If I have gone on too long I beg forgiveness.</p></speech>

If anything, with the recent mica and pyrite scandals we have seen the need for tough legislation on how constructions are built.  If a development is built without planning permission we do not know what run-off is going into the water or what environment is destroyed because essentially there are no regulations.  Under the current situation, if people go through the process of getting appropriate assessments and environmental impact assessments there will be an extra three to four years without the business there would have been with the development.</p><p>Therefore, they are losing a lot.  If it is seen to be more beneficial not to bother with the planning enforcements, not follow any regulations and essentially get away with it, that would create a culture where this happens along the length of the river.  The River Shannon has experienced pollution in many other areas before and it is under considerable threat.  From an environmental standpoint allowing developers to build without planning permission with run-off or damage to the riverbed could have enormous effects on the Shannon and for everybody who lives adjacent to the Shannon.</p><p> So many different local authorities and statutory bodies have management over the Shannon that essentially we do not know how common this is along the length of the river.  It is not about stopping people developing.  It is not even about stopping this particular development.  It is just about stopping future developments from flouting environmental laws and building without planning permission with unknown damage being done to the river as a result.  It is also unfair on people who follow the regulations.</p></speech>

It is unbelievable that in this case the planning seems to have been completely ignored.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Sullivan to clarify something in his statement.  Is he saying that the responsibility should be with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to legislate for this with the responsibility taken away from local authorities and other organisations?  Would introducing legislation help in these situations?</p></speech>

I believe the closer decisions are made to where they are going to be enforced or where they affect people the better.  Even with the current Office of the Planning Regulator and with Irish Water, for example, local authorities have lost much of their power compared with the powers that similar local authorities have in other EU member states.  The Department should look carefully at the legislation.  When that section of the planning Act which allowed a retrospective application to be made was shut down, it resulted in a gap in the legislation.</p> <p>  What is the appropriate way of dealing with a development like the one in question today which has taken place without planning permission?  It cannot obtain retrospective permission because that legislation has gone.  To leave it there sends a bad message to people.  To remove it would do ecological damage.  It has already damaged part of the shoreline.  This is something that legislators need to look at.  It would be no harm to query the Department on the adequacy of the legislation.  Why did we pass legislation in the first place which was later shut down by the High Court?  Did we not think through that legislation properly before we did so?  These are questions the committee members might put to departmental officials.</p></speech>

It is crazy that extensions have continued to take place without someone stopping it.  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned damage to the shoreline.  Has damage been done to the lake as a result of the encroachment onto Waterways Ireland's property?</p></speech>

The lake, itself, would not be significantly damaged by the nature of the development.  It is not the kind of development that would have a large wastewater discharge into the lake.  Nevertheless, by allowing an increase in the number of boats in that area we need to ask how those boats' toilets are being pumped out?  What are the systems that maintain the water quality in that area?  Increasing the number of boats gives rise to the possibility of oil pollution.  The boats always seem to leak oil.  Is all the toilet waste brought ashore?  All these kinds of things should be dealt with at a point in time by means of environmental impact assessment and by appropriate assessment including a Natura impact statement if necessary before the thing got planning permission.  That is where damage could take place.  There has been definite damage to the shoreline, including loss of habitat, for example.  Interfering with a special area of conservation is contrary to European law and brings Ireland into disrepute.</p></speech>

I will not say much about this because apparently another case in that area is ongoing in the courts.  I acknowledge the presentation by Mr. Barrett and the other witnesses.  As I understand it, all he wants is for this to be regularised, put through the proper planning process and made safe.  That is to his credit and that is how I understand it.  We should ask representatives of Westmeath County Council and Waterways Ireland to appear before the committee.  Has Mr. O'Sullivan or Mr. Barrett had recent contact with Westmeath County Council or Waterways Ireland?  I will leave that for today because obviously we will have another day on this.</p></speech>

The only way I could bring this to the fore was to bring it to this committee today to try to expose it and have it discussed that way.  In recent years, I had plenty of contact with both bodies and with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the early stages and up to 2017 or 2018.  However, in recent years no doors have been open to me to go there.</p></speech>

I have not had any direct contact on this case with Westmeath County Council or the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Early on I did.  In 2012, I was in touch with the regional manager or regional director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but since then I have not.  I have plenty of contact with Westmeath County Council on other issues.  I am a member of the public participation network and the strategic policy committee here in County Westmeath, things I value greatly as enabling me to be stakeholder within the process, to see how the local authority operates and understand what it has to deal with.</p></speech>

He spoke about bringing this issue to this committee.  This reinforces the importance of the Committee on Public Petitions.  Where members of the public run into repeated barriers or difficulties with State bodies, local authorities or whatever the case may be, there is an avenue for them to bring petitions before the committee.</p> <p>  Given the nature of this and given the protracted timeframe involved, has Mr. Barrett ever tried to calculate the financial cost to him or the cost in terms of time he has put in to get this issue to the Committee on Public Petitions today?  I understand that it also came before the Committee on Public Petitions in the last D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Regarding what it has cost me, as can be seen I have engaged environmental consultants and have been paying planners.  It has cost me a lot of money.  I could not tell the Deputy the exact sum.  I think it would be in the region of &euro;50,000 including costs for court cases, solicitors and so forth.</p><p>I am spending money to see if something can be done about unauthorised development.  The unauthorised part of this development is generating in the region of &euro;500,000 a year, potentially.  I have with me the rates and tariffs in question.  As members can see, it is stated that for any boat that is 40 ft or more, &euro;2,900 a year must be paid.  Members can do the maths.  There is turnover of approximately &euro;500,000 there on State property.</p><p> In the early part of this, when I was dealing with Westmeath County Council, a councillor who has since lost his seat was very sympathetic to me and did not fully agree with the unauthorised development.  Several planning meetings were held between Westmeath County Council and the developers of the marina.  The councillor who was sympathetic to my plea relating to the unauthorised development was not invited to any of those meetings.  However, another councillor was invited and attended several of the meetings.  Indeed, I have produced documentation to the committee today showing that he was invited or, at least, attended the meetings.  I presume he was representing the Portaneena company because I do not think he was representing the council.  That councillor, luckily for him, went on to be elected as a Deputy and went on to be a Minister in the previous Government.  However, he lost his seat in the most recent election and, shortly thereafter, had an article in a national newspaper-----</p></speech>

Let us forget about that.  There is a certain amount of passive support for this development.  In other words, it is being approached with a nod and a wink.  People say that it will be all right and we should let them develop away.  They ask what harm it is doing to anybody.  That should be looked into.  Politicians and other public representatives should be very careful in the statements they make or even their use of a place such as that.  Public representatives using a place like that gives it a certain amount of legality.  It gives the impression that it is okay because they would not be using it otherwise.  Basically, I am making that point as a result of a particular person using it and going public about doing so.  People have come back to me several times since then, asking me what I am doing.  I have been asked that if it is all right for a Minister to use it, is it not all right for everybody else to use it?</p></speech>

As far as we are concerned, that property is owned by the State and governed by Waterways Ireland.  Has the State benefited in any way from that development through the years?</p></speech>

If anything, the State has lost money, between sending out various people from Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council to do various investigations into it and all that, and even going to court and having cases dismissed on technicalities and all that.  It has cost the State money through the years.  To the best of my knowledge, the State has not benefited by a single penny.  Any money that has been generated has been generated for private enterprise.</p></speech>

I was well aware of this issue because I sat on the previous Committee on Public Petitions.  It is not easy.  I commend all those who gave evidence today.  This issue is bigger than I had realised.  There are many questions to be asked.  The issue of State money being used but not recouped sounds very strange.  As I stated in my previous contribution, this is bigger than a box of frogs.  I am starting to get lost for words that this can go on and there is zero accountability or joined-up thinking and it has taken ten to 12 years of very hard work to get it before the Committee on Public Petitions.  I wish our guests the best of luck.  I hope the issue will be resolved.  It is a lesson for everybody involved, including the State and us as ordinary people.  I am not 100% sure where it will go from here but I commend our guests on their determination and patience on this issue.</p></speech>

As was stated, they seem to be doing it for the good of the region.  I have questions for Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Barrett before we finish.  Mr. O'Sullivan cited concerns previously expressed by Waterways Ireland at the unauthorised nature of some of the development in the vicinity.  Those concerns date back to 2017 yet only this year the business in question has applied for planning retention and submitted an application for future development.  In his experience of dealing with county councils, is this level of delay in pursuing an instance of unauthorised development, whether on ecological or other grounds, typical in cases of this nature?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.480" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021120900002#H00900"><p>This delay is unusually long.  There are several similar cases where there have been very long delays but, normally, those are cases that involve a degree of legal complexity as well as environmental problems.  In this case, the county council is stuck in this situation.  It can no longer grant planning permission retrospectively because that legislation was struck down, so the problem it faces relates to how it can deal with the issue.  The committee may wish to bring in a witness from Westmeath County Council.  This raises the question as to why the Department or the Minister, as a legislator, has not acted to change the legislation.  I do not want the legislation to be changed to make it easy to get retrospective development or retrospective consent.  That would not be right.  The legislation that was in place was struck down because it was only supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances.  It was struck down in a case relating to a quarry in respect of which there were no exceptional circumstances at all yet An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted permission for the quarry using that legislation.  We need to change the legislation quite seriously and look at it in a way that is more thoughtful in the sense that it conforms to the European requirements and does not drive a coach and horses through the appropriate assessment requirement of the habitats directive, the birds directive or the environmental impact assessment directive or, very importantly, the Aarhus Convention, which guarantees that every citizen has the right to public information and public participation in environmental decision-making and to environmental justice.  Local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la do not give enough information to members of the public and that is where things start to go wrong.  When Sean and Mary citizen find out that certain decisions have been made but they do not know why and cannot get the information, a kind of unwillingness or fear or, at least, a lack of trust creeps in.  Although we in Ireland generally trust our Government more than some people in other member states do, we are not as trusting as the Nordic states, for example, are of their governments.  Having far more openness and transparency is another issue that needs to be examined.   That would help this kind of thing to happen.</p> <p>  A member made a very important point that I notice quite often, which is that some of the State agencies do not work together.  For example, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency should work together.  In name, they do so.  They actually have a memorandum of understanding.  However, if one looks at a planning application that involves both a licence from the EPA and planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and how those bodies talk to one another, one will see that they do not actually say anything to one another.</p><p>I find that is not good.  I would far prefer to see a much greater level of collaboration between them.  While I am aware that this may not be part of our present discussion, I would love to see an oral hearing with two chairpersons &mdash; one from the EPA and one from An Bord Plean&aacute;la &mdash; rather than two separate oral hearings six months or a year apart.  I would like to see a single oral hearing.  That would save a lot of money for the developer in addition to those opposing the development.  We made a recommendation in this regard in 2009 when several us were asked by a Minister responsible for the environment to examine the EPA.  The Department did not like it for various reasons, so it fell.  Those are my few thoughts in response to the question.</p></speech>

In Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s opinion, who should have the overall say?  Should it be the Department or a county council?  Where four or five bodies are involved in respect of these kinds of developments, it is too easy to pass the buck.  No one takes responsibility and it just keeps going around in circles, with the result that one ends up at a committee like this five or six years down the road when all the developments are completed.  If a State body or county council took overall responsibility, it could be dealt with much faster and there would be no great expense.  Where there are four or five bodies that send responsibility around in a circle, we finish up discussing the matter at a committee like this four or five years down the road.  While that is no harm considering what has gone on, who in Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s opinion should have the overall say regarding these developments?</p></speech>

I am just thinking on my feet.  Clearly, it involves the Minister &mdash; that is the key point &mdash; but the Minister has appointed a Planning Regulator whose job is to guide local authorities regarding their planning functions.  I do not see that happening very much, except in one case, which applies to several local authorities.  I am referring to where county councils changed their development plans to have further restrictions regarding the location of wind turbines close to, or within a certain distance of, dwelling houses.  Since this did not conform to Government policy, the Planning Regulator asked the local authorities to remove the policy.  Therefore, the regulator is acting very much in a way that makes sure county councils, as planning authorities, conform to what he believes is Government policy.  I am not referring to doing the task that the Chairman suggested, which is a very necessary task.  In a planning situation, the different agencies of the State can work together.  That is a key issue that needs to be addressed.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to respond.</p></speech>

As has been said throughout, the correspondence Mr. Barrett has sent in on the dealings with the various bodies has been considerable.  What has communication been like?  What have the responses from the various bodies been like?</p></speech>

They seemed to have been passing information and so on.  They also seemed to be passing the buck.  Waterways Ireland was saying it was a problem for Westmeath County Council, and Westmeath County Council was saying it was a problem for Waterways Ireland.  We all say Westmeath County Council is in a bit of a mess now because of the legislation and where it has landed itself.  The matter was brought to the attention of Westmeath County Council in 2012.  If it had taken appropriate enforcement action at that stage, it would have been well within the seven years and a result would most likely have been got.  However, it took a full four and a half years before it got into court.  I think that was intentional.  I think it was kicked out so it would be outside the seven years, solving the problem for everybody.  Waterways Ireland owns the property.  I am told, on very good advice from senior counsel, that squatter's rights &mdash; that is how we know them as, but the legal term is &ldquo;adverse possession of property&rdquo; &mdash; apply to individuals after either seven or 12 years.  In other words, if somebody takes over a property, he or she can claim squatter's rights after seven or 12 years, but it is 30 years in the case of a State body.  Therefore, there is nothing at all to stop Waterways Ireland from trying to recover its property.</p> <p>  We are all forgetting environmental law.  We have all agreed today that the property is in a very sensitive area.  It is an area covered by two directives from Europe &mdash; the SAC and SPA directives &mdash; but nobody has considered prosecution under environmental law.  That is not subject to a statute of limitations and is very strong.  For those reasons, both Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council have been woefully inadequate in the sense that it has taken them so long to bring the prosecution.  They brought the prosecution under planning law.  In the case in Athlone, the District Court judge dismissed the case on technical grounds.  I do not believe a competent body like a council, which employs engineers and has access to environmental consultants and all sorts of advisers, would bring a case worded as badly as it was.  I find it very hard to believe a competent body would be that inadequate.  I have my own ideas about it.  I would say there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, and that needs to be investigated as well.</p></speech>

Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to his experience working all over the country with the EPA and planning authorities.  Is it possible that there are other jetties around the country that do not have planning permission but which are charging money, be they in the possession of either private or public bodies?</p></speech>

To me, a quarry is utilising a resource owned by the people of Ireland, that is, our soil and rock.  Whatever Constitution we have &mdash; I like our Constitution &mdash; it should be stronger in connection with the fact that the soil and rock of Ireland are owned by the people of Ireland, held in trust for us, the people, by the State.  If somebody can dig up rock and gather a lot of money by doing that, while not paying anything to the State and not having planning permission, it constitutes a very similar situation to the one in question.</p> <p>  Another quite similar situation, which comprises an important issue in the midlands, involves a number of companies &mdash; I will not name them for obvious reasons &mdash; that have been removing peat in huge quantities over many years without planning permission from the planning authority or a licence from the EPA.  In so doing, they are polluting a river.  I will not name the river because that would give too much away.  In the case I am referring to, the EPA attempted to take a court case against one or more of the companies and failed to do so.  Something went wrong.  I do not know how because I was not part of the case.  I sometimes wish the EPA would ask people outside it for assistance.  We would happily give it to it.  In the case in question, all I know is that the court case failed.  That was a pity because the pollution continues.</p> <p>  We heard about the county council going after a particular developer.  In the pleadings, motion or description of the development, some very simple mistakes were made and, as a result, the case fell.  I know from writing these kinds of things that one has to be absolutely correct.  If there is a word wrong, a barrister on the other side will jump in and the case might be lost over it.  We call it a technicality but, very simply, it means a mistake.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Barrett and Mr. O'Sullivan for their input and invite them to make a final comment.</p><p>We have proved conclusively here today that a number of developments on Lough Ree are unauthorised and illegal and that the council has not been proactive in doing what it should.  Furthermore, Waterways Ireland has done absolutely nothing to protect the property under its control.  Waterways Ireland received this property under the terms of what is known as the Good Friday Agreement.  Under that agreement, Waterways Ireland was set up as a North-South body and is responsible for any properties it inherited as a result.  I do not believe it has done an audit of its properties.  It does not know what it actually owns and has not made any effort to do so.  Deputy Buckley asked if this could be happening all over the country and I can guarantee that it is.  I hope that through the work of this committee Waterways Ireland will endeavour to recover property that has basically been stolen from it.  I hope that Westmeath County Council and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will do something about unauthorised development.</p></speech>

There is very little I can add except to say that this committee has the power and responsibility to look not only at the particular case which Mr. Barrett has put forward so eloquently and in such detail and at my own short paper, which provides some footnotes and other detail, but also at the context of the case.  Why are these kinds of things happening <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>planning?  It may be that the wider context is something that not many Oireachtas committees can look at but this committee has the power to do so.  The committee could call witnesses from the NPWS, the Department and Westmeath County Council to see the wider picture and possibly make some recommendations that would close the loopholes and bring into the public arena a discussion on why these kinds of things are happening and how they can be, if not completely eliminated, at least decreased in number or prevented in the future to some extent.  If the committee could do that, it would be a great service to the environment and to the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

We cannot allow that unsubstantiated claim to stand.  We will bring in witnesses from Waterways Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Westmeath County Council and these questions can be put to them.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions today.  The committee secretariat will be in touch with them as the investigation progresses further with the other relevant bodies.  On behalf of the committee I thank them for coming here today.  We will consider the matter further with the other relevant bodies and we hope that at some stage down the line, the witnesses will appear before us again in person rather than over Zoom.  I urge them to stay safe, and hopefully we will talk to them again in the near future.</p></speech>

If members do not have any views on this, I will take it that it is agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is No. 42/2021.  It is concerned with saving the services of the Owenacurra centre in Midleton, County Cork and the petitioner is Ms Joanne Curtis.  The recommendation is that the correspondence from the HSE be forwarded to Ms Curtis for comment.  Do members have any views on this?  We discussed in private session the fact that this particular issue is being dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health at the moment.  The recommendation was that we would allow that committee to investigate the matter and we would revisit it in the new year.  Does Deputy Buckley wish to make a comment?</p></speech>

The centre is actually based in my area and I am very familiar with the case.  I agree with the recommendation.  A lot of work has already been done on this issue by the Joint Committee on Health and the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and it will be discussed again by the former committee next Tuesday.

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss aligning disability services with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, future systems and innovation, and service providers.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the following: Mr. Peter Broadhead of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme; Dr. Simon Walsh and Ms Fiona Walsh; Ms Louise Loughlin and Ms Joanne Condon from the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities; and Ms Aoife O'Toole.</p> <p>  I must remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are within the confines of Leinster House.  In this regard, if members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm they are on the grounds of Leinster House before they make a contribution to the meeting.  For anybody who is watching the meeting online, the witnesses are joining us remotely, not just from Ireland but from across the world, and if there are any unprecedented circumstances, I ask everybody to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on that issue and, of course, persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they should respect that direction.  </p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not to comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p> <p>  I call on Mr. Broadhead to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Australia has a population of 25.7 million people of whom 4.4 million have some form of disability, ranging from mild to profound.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates in 2018 about 400,000 people aged zero to 64 had a severe or profound disability.<br/><br/>The Australian Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing disability is framed through Australia&rsquo;s Disability Strategy 2021-2031, a ten-year plan launched last Friday on the International Day of People with Disability.  The strategy addresses the things people with disability said need to improve in order to achieve the vision for an inclusive Australian society that ensures people with disability can fulfil their potential as equal members of the community.<br/><br/>The convention was a key driver in the development of the strategy<b></b>and the preceding National Disability Strategy 2010-2020.  The strategy plays an important role in protecting, promoting and fulfilling the human rights of people with disability in Australia.  It is Australia&rsquo;s overarching policy framework for all levels of government to improve the lives of people with disability because, of course, we are a federation.  The new strategy was developed by Australian, state, territory and local governments through more than two years of extensive engagement with people with disability, their families, carers and representatives.  In delivering on what people with disability have said they need, the strategy will play an important role in protecting, promoting and realising the human rights of people with disability.  This aligns with a number of commitments under the convention.  It includes an intensive focus to drive practical changes through the development and implementation of targeted action plans, under which all governments in the Australian federation have committed to specific actions.  The first five focus on employment, community attitudes, early childhood, safety and emergency management.<br/><br/>Within the strategy&rsquo;s framework sits the centrepiece of Australia&rsquo;s support for people with significant and permanent disability, the national disability insurance scheme, NDIS.  The NDIS is a tax-funded social insurance scheme that delivers funding to eligible persons with significant and permanent disabilities, known as participants, to purchase the disability supports they need.  It is a major change to the way people with significant disability are supported in Australia.  At its core, the NDIS takes an individualised and rights-based approach to disability support, empowering eligible participants to exercise choice and control in accessing support.  It provides access to individualised funding to help participants realise their aspirations and to participate in the social and economic life of the community.  The NDIS is not means tested and provides its participants with funding for supports to help them live an ordinary life.  The NDIS does not provide income support, which for those who require it is provided though a separate tax-funded social security system.<br/><br/>Eligibility for the NDIS is based on being under the age of 65 when applying, being a citizen or permanent resident and whether a person with disability has one or more impairments that are significant and permanent, or are likely to be permanent.  Eligibility is not based on a person&rsquo;s diagnosis or specific medical details, rather the scheme focuses on how a person&rsquo;s functional capacity to undertake the activities of daily living is affected by their disability.  <br/><br/>The NDIS is not limited to supporting individuals with a physical disability.  It also provides support to eligible people with intellectual, sensory, cognitive and psychosocial impairments.  Early intervention supports are also provided for eligible people with disability and children with significant developmental delay.  The design of NDIS eligibility recognises that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and the environmental barriers that hinder their participation in society, which is also a key component of the convention.  The NDIS has grown rapidly and is close to reaching 500,000 active participants, having grown from around 30,000 participants in 2016.  As best we can tell, half of participants are receiving specialised disability supports for the first time.  <br/><br/>Prior to the NDIS, combined Commonwealth, state and territory funding for services to support people with disability was around AUS$7.9 billion in 2019-20, or about &euro;4.9 billion.  The 2021-22 Commonwealth budget estimates that AUS$26.5 billion, or &euro;16.6 billion, will be spent on participant supports this financial year, increasing to over AUS$31 billion, or &euro;19.5 billion, in 2024-25.<br/><br/>Importantly, the level of funding attributed to participants for their supports is individualised according to each person&rsquo;s reasonable and necessary needs.  There is no minimum or maximum cap on the level of funding a participant can receive.  Rather, a participant receives a NDIS plan and associated funding developed through assessment of what supports are reasonable and necessary given a person&rsquo;s level of functional capacity and circumstances, and his or her current access to formal and informal supports.  Included in each person&rsquo;s plan is the person's statement of his or her goals.  It is not told to them by anybody else.  This individualised approach is central to the scheme and has been aligned with the overlaying themes of the CRPD, which are to respect the inherent dignity and individual autonomy of people with disability and their need to participate fully and effectively in society. <br/><br/>Examples of the supports included in plans which people can purchase with the funds provided to them are: therapy; home and vehicle modifications; assistive technology devices and equipment; assistance with household tasks, personal care and transport; and assistance for family and carers.  Funds can be included for capacity building supports and supports for community participation.  <br/><br/>The articles of the convention were built into the design of the scheme from the outset.  The first object of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, a Commonwealth Act, is to, in conjunction with other laws, give effect to the convention.  The objects and principles also include giving persons with a disability choice and control over the care and support they receive, protect and prevent them from experiencing harm arising from unsafe supports, promote the provision of high quality and innovative supports, and raise community awareness of the issues that affect social and economic participation of people with a disability.</p><p>A relevant example of a principle in the Act is where it states that people with a disability should be supported to exercise choice, including in relation to taking reasonable risks, in the pursuit of their goals and the planning and delivery of their supports.  The general principles of the convention reflect the need to respect the inherent dignity and individual autonomy of people with a disability as well as their rights to participate fully and effectively and be included in society.</p><p> The NDIS sets out to support people with a disability to exercise the same rights as other members of Australian society to realise their potential for physical, social, emotional and intellectual development, to live independently and to be included in the community as fully participating citizens.  The NDIS provides Australians who have a significant and permanent disability with the reasonable and necessary supports they need to live an ordinary life.  It is the realisation of an insurance scheme that takes a lifetime approach, investing in people with disability early to improve their outcomes later in life.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions the joint committee may have on Australia&rsquo;s disability programmes and its commitment to the rights of people with disability, and to answer them as best I can.  I thank the committee for its time and for letting me speak today.</p></speech>

Families are getting ready for a day at the beach.  They pack a picnic, sandwiches, juice and treats.  We look out the bedroom window at the neighbours packing their cars with parasols and buckets and spades.  Happy children are strapped into the car.  Zo&euml; has not slept for 72 hours.  She is crying constantly.  She is six years old and non-verbal so we do not know whether it is hunger, thirst, pain or tiredness.  It could be multiple other things but these are the things we address first.  We flush a tube going into her stomach with water and pain medication and we try to feed her.  We give her daily anti-epileptic medication and we carry her around - she weighs 18 kg - because she gets distraught if we put her down.  We apologise to our eight year old daughter that we cannot do the day trip we had planned because Zo&euml; did not sleep, and one or other of us has been up with her overnight, again.  Thankfully we do not need a trip to the hospital.  We have been through this before, all too frequently.  I am a consultant in emergency medicine so we do not have the worries of other parents about whether this could be appendicitis or another medical emergency.</p> <p>  We have pleaded for overnight help from the HSE but we do not meet the requirements.  We have figured out over the years that a drive might calm her.  We take turns driving around County Cork to give the other parent a break from the constant background noise.  Should we use this time to clean the house, because we have not had an opportunity for three days, or should we try to spend time with the other two kids?  I am not working today so we have two pairs of hands.  When I am working I may be gone for up to 16 hours or even overnight.  Our families live in different counties.  They are helpful but they have their own lives.</p> <p>  Zo&euml; has a severe disability due to a condition called CDKL5 deficiency disorder.  There are seven people with her condition in Ireland, all girls.  She only learned to walk one year ago.  She does not talk.  She has epilepsy and she requires medication through a tube into her stomach twice a day.  We have had to pay privately for physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and carers because none of these services is available to us publicly in Cork.  This is because of a non-functional system.  We have had to pay for equipment too.  Nothing has been funded in Cork.</p> <p>  We moved from Australia to Galway three and a half years ago so have had the benefit of experiencing disability services in three places.  Australia was in the process of introducing the national disability insurance scheme Mr. Broadhead spoke about.  Through this scheme funding is provided to families to try to reduce costs in the future by achieving a child's potential with early, personalised intervention, guided by the parents and the therapists.  We are dual citizens of Ireland and Australia and could have stayed in Australia but with Zo&euml; being unable to make 25-hour flights in the future and the thought of never seeing our elderly parents again we made the hard decision to move back to Ireland where we knew the health system was not as mature.  We spoke to a paediatrician in Galway who advised us there were better services there than in other regions in Ireland and we made the decision to come back.</p> <p>  Galway had early intervention, including regular physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and even respite.  Despite all this, we still felt that family support was closer in Cork and after two years in Galway we reluctantly made the move, during the pandemic, with a third child on the way.  A friend in Australia whose child has the same condition gets two hours of occupational therapy, one hour of physiotherapy, one hour of speech therapy and one hour of vision therapy per week plus every three months gets an intensive therapy period of three weeks which involves three hours per day, Monday to Friday.  This child also gets a carer for nine hours per week and there is funding for equipment.</p> <p>  The financial burden of having a child like Zo&euml; has a great impact on families.  Fiona is not entitled to the carer's allowance because it is means tested, so despite being a full-time carer she is not entitled to an income.  She is a radiographer by profession but is unable to return to the workforce.  If therapy was available in schools, she would not have to spend time driving the family around to appointments.</p> <p>  We knew after researching that the services in Cork would not be as good as in Galway.  Covid-19 has obviously had an impact but what we have found in Cork is a completely underresourced and underfunded system from the perspective of both health and special education.  We regularly think of packing up and moving back to Australia.  This is not acceptable.  Zo&euml; should have the same opportunities as all other Irish children to reach her potential and we should have the opportunity to live as normal a life as we can.  The current system does not allow Zo&euml; or children like her to take their place in the world by developing their skills and abilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and committee members.  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities provides representative advocacy to adults with disabilities throughout Ireland.  We ensure that their will and preferences are heard in decisions that affect their lives.  In 2020 we provided more than 3,700 advocacy interventions.  We host the patient advocacy service, which was commissioned by the Department of Health.  It provides independent, free and confidential advocacy for people who wish to make complaints about patient safety incidents in HSE-funded public acute hospitals or nursing homes.  This will play an integral role in protecting the rights of people in receipt of healthcare into the future.</p> <p>  Advocacy services are vital to the future of disability service provision.  Advocacy ensures that a person's will and preferences are heard.  Advocacy acknowledges the lived experiences of people with disabilities and works to uphold people&rsquo;s rights.  Covid-19 coincided with a notable drop in inquiries to our services from mid-February 2020 to May 2020.  During pandemics and their associated restrictions there is a greater risk of human rights violations.  Access to advocacy services must continue to be promoted in future service design to safeguard human rights.</p> <p>  The disability capacity review published earlier this year highlighted that the demographics of our population are changing.  By 2032 there will be more people in Ireland living with disabilities.  We welcome the recent investments in disability services in the national budget.  However, as Dr. Walsh has highlighted, much of this is not focused on the needs of people with disabilities.  A total of 65% of this funding went to residential care.  More funding should be invested in community-based services.  An issue we have recently identified is the commissioning of residential placements for people far away from their communities and families.  This is linked to the lack of suitable housing in urban areas due to the ongoing housing crisis.</p> <p>  More investment in community-based services would also facilitate the acceleration of decongregation, which is the Government's policy to close residential services for ten or more people.  We strongly support the commitment in the programme for government to decongregation.  We also recognise the various State initiatives in place to support it.  Ongoing decongregation is vital to align future service provision with Article 19 of the UNCRPD.  Its completion will improve the lives of people living in unsuitable placements.</p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s 2020 annual report stated that of the 9,166 residential places registered by the end of 2020, 31%, or 2,841 places, continued to be located in congregated settings.  In 2020, only 75 people moved out of congregated settings.  We have worked with many people who have moved to community-based living and have seen its positive impact.  However, if the current rate of decongregation continues it could take up to 20 years for all those living in congregated settings to move to the community.</p><p>The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, when fully commenced, will bring a legislative underpinning to the rights of people with disabilities to have their will and preference heard.  It will also help to align Irish disability services with Article 12 of the UNCRPD, on supporting capacity and decision-making.  Based on our experience, a focus should be placed on eradicating the practice of next-of-kin consent.  There is no legal basis for next-of-kin decision-making, except under legal instruments such as ward of court or enduring power of attorney.  Unfortunately, we continue to encounter poor practice regarding consent matters in healthcare settings, social care services and financial institutions.  This severely impacts on a person's fundamental right to make decisions for themselves.  The HSE human rights and equality office has carried out valuable work on this issue, and this work should continue to address the issue in all sectors.</p><p> The role of nursing homes in disability service provision is a barrier to the alignment of disability services in Ireland to the UNCRPD.  People under the age of 65 being cared for in nursing homes is particularly serious.  We provide advocacy to residents in almost 21% of private and 13% of public nursing homes.  A total of 90% of people living in nursing homes whom we support are under the age of 65.  As of 30 June 2020, 1,320 people under 65 were living in nursing homes supported by the nursing home support scheme.  We welcome the HSE's ongoing pilots that are moving people outside of nursing homes and the announcement of more funding for this project in 2022.  However, only 18 placements have been funded this year.  We request this committee to support an increase in funding to expedite a swifter relocation of people under 65 out of nursing homes and into more suitable community-based placements.</p><p> The Ombudsman's Wasted Lives: Time for a Better Future for Younger People in Nursing Homes report, published earlier this year, examined the issue.  It highlighted that the needs of people under 65 are often quite different from those of older people.  It recommended ensuring informed consent is obtained from those entering nursing homes, in line with the HSE's consent policy.  We recently published a report that illustrated the experiences of people living in nursing homes during the pandemic.  We found many issues highlighted in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report had been compounded by the pandemic and the associated restrictions.</p><p> Last year, a nursing home expert panel report that was published acknowledged the central role advocacy plays in combating powerlessness and loneliness in the face of these issues.  Residents' rights, particularly concerning dignity, freedom, choice and equality, must be respected.  They need to be at the forefront of policy development and advocacy is a critical component of this.  We are also a strong supporter of personalised budgets, which are an effective method of providing flexible funding for a person's care and help address some of the issues Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh highlighted.  They offer people greater independence to choose services that suit their needs.  We look forward to seeing the outcome of the HSE's current pilot programmes with this model.  We also support HIQA's ongoing work in the regulation of home supports.  Regulation should be extended to personal assistance services in order that people will receive the supports they need at the time they need them.</p><p> Personal finances and banking constitute another important issue in the future of disability service provision.  Equality legislation and the Central Bank code of practice offer people certain rights in this area.  Despite this, however, we work with many people who do not have full control over their money.  Better access to banking supports is essential to ensuring people with disabilities can have control over their finances.</p><p> We thank all the members of the committee for their commitment to implementing the UNCRPD and to disability matters.  We thank them for their invitation and welcome any further questions.</p></speech>

It is very encouraging to see the work of this committee, which demonstrates a new approach for governments throughout the world in monitoring the implementation of the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  I have worked in disability services in Ireland and Australia for more than 30 years.  The question I asked when I began, and still ask now, is why people's lives are so different just because they have a disability.  The UNCRPD exists because people with a disability are still experiencing inequality and discrimination.  Today, in 2021, there is still a prevailing narrative of people with a disability as objects of pity, objects of charity and as a burden to their families and the State.  The Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il in October 2020 that the system needs to change and reform.  The HSE has also committed to the reform of disability services in its 2021-2024 corporate plan.  From my perspective, reform is not enough; we need a transformation of the system and within society.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, I have been researching systems change, systems thinking, social innovation and the use of technology to drive transformation.  I was really curious about the approaches other sectors use to transform successfully and achieve value for all.  This was a fascinating journey and it led me to ask what if we could make more use of the tools and technologies that work in other industries to transform the disability sector and, in doing so, improve the lives of people.</p> <p>  I will share three matters that can help in this transformation.  The first is a change of mindset.  All lives matter.  Just like the Black Lives Matter movement, which addresses the unconscious bias against and inequality experienced by black people, we need a movement to do the same in Irish society in the context of disability.  It is not a person's disability that limits his or her life but rather the cumulative impact of how society sees, treats, devalues and discriminates against people.</p> <p>  Transformation begins when we change the narrative and see people as whole, just as they are.  The reform of disability services in Australia, which Mr. Broadhead mentioned, is very instructive for us.  It was propelled by the actions of people with a disability and their families in the &ldquo;Every Australian Counts&rdquo; campaign.  This campaign fought for the introduction of the national disability insurance scheme, NDIS, and won.  It was a call to action that gave all Australians a reason to care about disability through the sharing of stories on the impact of living with a disability.  In line with Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the UNCRPD, I urge the committee to use its influence to invest in a social movement campaign that shifts mindsets and makes equality the new normal and not the exception.</p> <p>  Second, we cannot support people to lead a good life if they are not part of creating their own solutions.  Article 4.3 of the UNCRPD is such a wonderful asset to guide us in the reform process.  Partnering with people with a disability and their families will drive innovative solutions and shared value.  The demonstration project on personalised budgets, which Ms Loughlin mentioned, is one of the ways the system can learn how to do this.  People with a disability and their families, in partnership with services and community, are designing the supports that work best for them.  They are doing this with the support of small agencies such as PossibilitiesPlus and the AT Network.  The demonstration project and the research into the resource allocation tools place Ireland in a position to have the potential to transform, similar to what was outlined in regard to the NDIS.  Individualised funding is already happening in Ireland, and there are wonderful, compelling examples of co-creation, collaboration and good lives being realised by individuals and their families throughout the country.  I suggest we invest more in these opportunities.  They remain very fragile.</p> <p>  What is also exciting and may not be widely known is that a new ecosystem is emerging in Ireland, where social enterprises, networks, entrepreneurs, coaches, mentors and new alliances have formed.  These entities are partnering with people with a disability and their families and achieving the kinds of change, support and outcomes people want.  These initiatives include the Inclusive Living Network; Positive Pathways and the In Conversation series; Blossom Ireland; In Charge; Humankind Coaching; Future Solutions; and Codie: Communities Driving Ireland, to name a few.  Like many start-ups, they have the potential to scale, solve problems and open the marketplace, but only if they are invested in.</p> <p>  The third area concerns how digitisation can positively support the transformation of disability services.  The pandemic has altered life as we know it and digitisation is transforming so many aspects of our lives, from how we shop to how we connect and work.  A deliberately different and innovative approach to transformation is needed, and there are many ways digitisation can make people's lives better.  For example, it is helping many companies throughout the world to be more efficient and effective by creating digital end-to-end processes and automated workflows, such as rosters, timesheets, payroll, purchases and payments.  Another example is learning platforms, where people with a disability and their families and staff can build their confidence and capacity in new approaches.</p><p>A third example of digitalisation are online platforms that can help with the challenges in recruiting and retaining staff, which is highly problematic at the moment.  These platforms enable people with a disability and support workers to connect based on needs, interests and location, and offer choice of who to work with, which is a win-win for all.  The platforms also have the potential to connect people with other supports, such as community co-ordinators, mentors and natural supports in the community.  They work successfully in other countries and are starting to emerge in Ireland. </p><p> I urge the committee to consider three things.  First, investing in a social movement campaign that shifts mindsets and can bring about the societal change needed to achieve equality and non-discrimination.  Second, investing in how we grow and scale approaches in designing and delivering services in partnership with people and their families.  Third, investing in the digital transformation of disability services in a way that keeps relationships at the heart of what we do.</p><p> I believe we are on the cusp of this transformation, especially with the transfer of disability out of the Department of Health, the ratification of the UNCRPD and the knowledge and expertise that exists in Ireland when we harness the benefits of partnering with people and their families.  If we make the right investments now, we have a pretty good chance of achieving equality.  Can members imagine a time when people with a disability can be where they want to be in their day, their life and their community?  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it. </p></speech>

It has been interesting.  This has been a big week in Ireland with the publication of the Indecon report, which is long overdue but is a comprehensive document of 200 pages looking at the nitty-gritty of the extra costs incurred by disabled people.  Most of the speakers referred to the cost of disability and it is something the committee is extremely focused on.  Creative solutions are welcome.  That is why it was a pleasure to hear from Mr. Broadhead on the comparative analysis between what is happening there and what is happening here.  I was interested to hear Australia is responding to the challenges posed by implementing the UNCRPD and about the whole-of-system response he referred to in mechanisms such as the NDIS.</p> <p>  I have questions for Ms O'Toole and Mr. Broadhead first.  How difficult was it to get to a place where the Government was in a position to introduce the NDIS?  What social, economic and political factors provided the impetus to introduce something so progressive?  Was it the UNCRPD?</p> <p>  The NDIS is across impairment provision.  My question concerns equality between disabilities.  Based on the witnesses' experience and critical observation, is there any subgroup or people with a specific type of impairment who have struggled to access or benefit from the scheme to the same extent as others?</p> <p>  On the differentiation between the disability representative organisations and disabled people's organisations, distinguishing between the two of them in terms of consultation, funding, etc. has been an ongoing challenge in this State.  </p> <p>  Decentralised funding comes up against a lot of resistance to the idea that an extra responsibility or burden would fall on the disabled person.  Will the witnesses speak about how that was overcome in the Australian context?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Walsh and Dr. Walsh for their honest and open statement.  It is glaring and stark to hear the differences they have experienced in terms of access to services and supports between Galway and Cork and between Ireland and Australia.  Even more striking is detail of how much more support Zo&euml;'s peer in Australia received.  It is disappointing to hear that is the case in Ireland.  They mentioned precise access to support provision.  That has been pretty non-existent since they relocated to Cork.  I wanted to come back on that and ask how that has impacted them as a family, in terms of going forward, hope and all that kind of stuff that comes with dealing with despair on a daily basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Broadhead" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#E00400"><p>Deputy Wynne will have to remind me of a couple of her questions because I did not take notes quickly enough.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked first about how the change happened at the level of Government.  That is difficult to describe but it was driven by the UN convention.  In 2007, we had a Government that signed up to the UN convention and it was ratified in 2008.  The carry-through of that into the scheme involves a definite relationship.  As a federation, previously the disability services people mostly think of, including the kind of support for people Dr. and Ms Walsh mentioned, was provided by our state governments and some additional funding was provided by our federal Government to those state governments to do that.  It was done by funding providers on a block-funding basis, giving them a grant and so on to meet their costs.  That was the principal approach.</p> <p>  Somebody said there was a deal of organisation by people with disabilities and that is true.  It was our civil society and non-governmental organisations who mounted a campaign but it is also true that at the time there was a wish to do something more than had been done in the past.  The Act creating the scheme was passed in 2013, following the 2008 ratification.  The scheme was set up as a series of trials.  There were seven trials around the country to see how this different approach would work.  That was it for the first three years.  From 2013 to 2016, it operated as a series of islands of doing things differently in different parts of the country.  In 2016, it rolled into a period of transition.  By this time, there had been a change in federal Government.  I have not kept track of all the state territory governments coming and going.  The Act was passed with multiparty support so when the new Government came in, there was a commitment to carry on with the scheme.  We went through this period of transition from a series of trials to progressively rolling it out across the country, which meant transferring people out of the old arrangements into the new.</p> <p>  I do not have the time and neither does the committee to go through the whole process but it was not straightforward and in some ways it is not over yet, despite the fact we are in 2021, eight years later.  The ambition was to do it in such a way that the thing was stood up in full by 2019 or 2020 but it turned out to take a bit longer.</p> <p>  The federal Government had commissioned our Productivity Commission, which is a sort of independent government entity that provides advice on economic and social issues when asked to do so by the Government.  That commission did a report which led to the creation of the scheme.  It was invited to do so.  It gets its terms of reference from our treasurer.  It was asked to do an investigation into disability care in Australia and that report set out the shape of arrangements that were then introduced by the Act.  That report came out in 2011 and can be found on the Productivity Commission's website.  There was an organised push and an acceptance by the Government of the day of the need to do something.  There was a commissioning of a report.  That was handed down in 2011 and led to the Act in 2013 and on to the scheme.</p><p> One of the questions concerned inequality by disability type, as I would characterise it.  There is unevenness in the way the scheme is rolled out because everybody is different.  As we moved from the previous system, our eight states and territories did not do things exactly the same and did not take the same approach to bringing people in and the level of change required.  There was concern in the early years of the scheme that people with psychosocial disabilities were struggling to get in.  There was an anticipated level of participation that was not met.  It began at 8% and is now at 11%.  Perhaps the position in our country is different from this country.  Groups we particularly struggle to reach, engage and include our First Nations people such as people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island backgrounds.  Most of them live in our cities but a disproportionate number live in remote areas.  Simon and Fiona, who lived in Alice Springs, will be aware of this.  Reaching those people has been a challenge for us.  It is a challenge for us in a range of ways outside disability but also for members of that community who have disabilities - not by disability type but for other reasons.  </p><p> We have had much larger involvement of people with autism than we expected.  That was not anticipated, in particular, the numbers of children with autism who are now participating in the scheme.  The others might take a different view and, of course, different groups advocating for people with different types of disabilities may have a view but, overall, I would say the scheme is fairly inclusive across the board because it only focuses on functional impairment.  It does not distinguish by diagnosis.  </p><p> The one area that is contentious is the fact that due to the way the scheme was developed, the assumption was made that people aged 65 and over would go towards our age care system rather than the disability system.  For this reason, people must be under 65 to apply for the scheme.  A person who ages in the scheme can remain in it or choose to go to our age care system at some point but a person over 65 cannot get into the scheme.  There has been a fair bit of pressure on that.</p></speech>

Covid-19 has obviously had a big impact on that.  Our daughter is in a special needs school in Cork.  We have seen a physiotherapist publicly twice in a year and a half.  On both occasions, that was just to assess her, make sure her back was still in alignment and determine whether she needed shoes or specialised equipment.  We saw an occupational therapist.  When our daughter joined the school, I highlighted that she did not have correct seating, sent seven or eight emails forward and backwards and was told that they would get to her at some stage.  That stage came a day after she fell out of the seating she had been given, which had been taken out of a storeroom in the school and was not appropriate for her to use.  The first time we saw an occupational therapist was after an incident.  An occupational therapist has visited her once this year - also in the school.  We have not had any public speech and language therapy for a year and a half since we came to Cork.</p> <p>  In contrast, when she was in an early intervention preschool in Galway, there was a physiotherapist, speech and language therapist and occupational therapist in the grounds of the school.  They would be there a couple of days a week.  We had plans where we worked with her.  In contrast to here, she was doing five days a week there.  I am not sure how many hours it was per day.</p></speech>

Since then, the preschool in question has shut down.  There is no early intervention preschool for a child like Zoe in Cork.  There is no support for us in the public system.  We have not seen it anyway.  I have just gone through the process of completing her individualised family service plan.  We were told to pick three areas we would like to work on.  This is a child who can walk very short distances, cannot talk and spends hours crying because she is frustrated and cannot communicate.  She has issues with her diet and medical issues.  When it comes to picking three areas, where do you start?</p> <p>  We pay for therapy ourselves.  We are very fortunate to be in a position to do that so we have to take her out of school several days a week to drive her to physiotherapy and occupational therapy, which we do in the house.  We had been doing speech and language therapy online.  That was not really appropriate for Zoe because she does not look at a screen.  She has a condition called cortical visual impairment, CVI, so she is effectively blind.  Looking at a screen does not work.  The cost of that every week is &euro;80 for physiotherapy and &euro;80 for occupational therapy.  When we were doing the speech and language therapy, that cost was &euro;130.  We will be doing intensive therapy next September with a group that comes over from the NAPA Center in Boston and that will cost &euro;10,000.  We have travelled to Boston, which probably cost us &euro;15,000 between accommodation, the therapy and flights.  We are able to do that.  We are very lucky.</p> <p>  I look at other children going into Zoe's school in wheelchairs and I think they should not be in wheelchairs.  They could be walking, they could be toilet trained and they could be self-feeding.  Zoe does not use a toilet at the moment.  If she had an individual SNA, we might be able to work towards that but she does not have one.  They have too many children to look after.  Walking is such a basic right for children.  One of the major things Zoe can do now is take a couple of steps around our house.  When she is hungry, she will walk to the kitchen.  That is her communication.  I feel that the job of an occupational therapist now is to decide which wheelchair to put a child in, rather than to work on helping Zoe feed or on her sensory issues or do timed toileting with her.  It seems more like facilitating the child to be disabled rather than helping the child to progress as much as he or she can.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about hope.  I do not have much hope with the current system.  Hopefully, we will get to 90 years old and Zoe will still be living with us.  If the system remains as it is, we will be changing a 40-year-old's nappies.  She will not be able to tell us when she is hungry.  She will be crying because she is tired and we will not know whether it is tiredness.  We will be going for drives with her to try to relax her.</p> <p>  Regarding speech and language therapy in the school, we have worked with companies from England and tried assistive technology with her but that needs to be done every day in school.  They need more staff to be able to do that.  They need the specialist speech and language therapist within that setting to be able to do that but none is provided.  Some day, down the track, we will not be able to do this.  What happens to Zoe then?  I do not have hope.  I do not want my other children to have to look after Zoe when she is older.  I want her to be as independent as she can be.  I want her to be able to walk around the house, pick up a spoon or tell me she is hungry.  I want her to be able to go to bed when she wants to go to bed.</p></speech>

It is the same for the medical profession.  The system in Australia and the US is so far advanced compared with what we have here.  The reason many consultants who have gone overseas to do fellowships will not come back is that they would not get the same job satisfaction here.</p><p>If we can make our schools and our facilities for therapists more attractive, more people will come home.  They are highly trained and want to come home.</p></speech>

Three elements underpinned the reform in Australia.  Those were public support, political will and bureaucratic backing.  Regarding public support, in every Australian campaign that was run, families told their stories just like Ms Walsh did, but they told them in a way that resonated with the Australian population.  The public were not aware of the lived reality and they were quite shocked by it to the extent that 80% of the population voted for a 0.5% increase in their taxes in order that a system could be developed that was fair and equitable. The other feature that underpinned the reform was that it began with honesty.  The productivity commission's report that Mr. Broadhead mentioned stated the system was broken, fragmented, unfair, crisis-driven, underfunded and inadequate.  There was agreement and unity about the system being problematic but we are not seeing that in Ireland.  That is very important.  In terms of the DPOs and the disability organisations working together, they were quite fractured just as they are in Ireland, but they developed an inclusive and collective leadership and created an alliance.  The agencies came together and worked on what they were in agreement with, which was that the system was broken, it needed to change, they needed to speak with one voice and they needed to work together to do that.</p></speech>

I was tied up at another meeting but I got here for the first round of questions.  I had read the presentations and made some notes.  We are at a stage here where our system is fractured.  It is under-resourced and it is crisis-only solutions we try to bring forward.  The system is fragmented.</p> <p>  I listened to what Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh said.  In terms of getting the whole process up and running in a proper way, reference was made to public support, political will and overcoming the bureaucracy involved when a system is being publicly funded.  Our committee is one avenue by which we can inform the public in order that they can support what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  I have a question for whoever would like to answer it or give an opinion on it.  The Indecon report published this week probably sets out much of what we all think about the sector, but it brought it together in terms of the cost involved with respect to the disability sector.</p> <p>  Ms Walsh spoke about the services she could get in Galway that were not available in Cork.  Other services are probably available in Cork and not available in Galway.  We do not seem to have a level playing field and ours is a small island.  We have different levels of services in different places.</p> <p>  We are trying to move responsibility for the disability sector from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and that in itself involves bureaucratic trauma.  I feel frustrated sometimes listening to people tell stories of their lived experience and put into a few sentences what needs to be done.  As politicians we need to stop talking about the issues and put the processes in place to change things.</p> <p>  To return to the assets we have in terms of people with expertise who are not here but in other countries around the world, I would have experienced that on a professionally and have thought if only we could get these people home and how we could bring them home.  We need to get to a stage where we can give these experts confidence they would be coming back to a system in which they could enjoy working and have a sense of fulfilment in their job rather than having to deal with issues on a crisis basis.  Mr. Broadhead might give us some insight on that.  Is it all about money at the end of the day?  I have been long-winded in making these points and the witnesses might have some thoughts on them.</p> <p>  I feel frustrated when constituents call to my clinics with issues concerning their children.  They are caught like a rabbit in the headlights in that they do not know where to turn and there is no clear pathway for them.  They fight for something and get an appointment and that is that.  Then they have to start fighting again the next day for the next step.  There does not seem to be a co-ordinated pattern as to how parents can go down a pathway to improve their child's life.  That is a fundamental issue.  We can talk politically about ratifying treaties, and all of that is great.  People will say money will be targeted at this, that and the other, but we do not seem to be getting it to where it is needed or to be getting the required expertise in to deal with the children.</p> <p>  Mr. Broadhead and any of the other witnesses who wish to contribute might comment on those points.</p></speech>

The report that was done in 2011 made clear the scope of people who were expected to be supported through a scheme, as proposed, and made clear what it expected the cost of that to be.  It involved taking all the money that was previously spent in the area and adding more on top of that.  That was part of the commitment.  Arguments were put forward in that report about the economic benefits down the track and so on.  It is fair to say the scheme that was stood up through the Act is not identical to the scheme that was recommended in the 2011 report, but there was a recognition all along that it would cost more to do what was proposed than had been spent in the past, which is proving to be true.</p> <p>  We have a Medicare levy, which is an identified tax.  It is not hypothecated but it is identified.  It has a label on it that was introduced when we moved to publicly funding some parts of our health system.  That was introduced to meet the additional cost of that.  That was increased, as was mentioned.  The revenue from that is not sufficient to meet the additional cost of the scheme.  The additional cost goes well beyond that.  A decision was made by the government of the day that in the end that would be funded primarily out of general taxation rather than out of an identified levy, although that extra increase is still there and is still distributed back to the state governments that contribute.  Approximately AU$11 billion to AU$&euro;12 billion is allocated to the scheme by our state governments.  It is not purely funded by the federal government, rather the balance is funded by the federal government.  That was a decision taken at the time.</p> <p>  Reference was made to public support, the idea that the scheme should support people with disabilities and that this was the right thing to do.  Various groups take surveys from time to time and there is still clear support for it.  There are still many teething problems in the scheme and there are various views on the rights and wrongs of it and if it is doing everything as it should be done.  We are not past all that and probably never will be but, nevertheless, the major features of the scheme are understood, accepted and in place.</p></speech>

I suppose what we would consider from an advocacy prospective when we look across the range of issues that emerge for us is this is not only about healthcare or social care.  The costs for families and people with disabilities go much wider.  Ms Fiona Walsh spoke eloquently there about the educational situation.  As well as the impact now for children in the system, there is a future impact in terms of what they are not being provided with.  Another issue that comes up for us is housing and accommodation and we know from the disability capacity review what the increased demand will be.  It is about money but it is also about where that money is going and how that is joined up.  It is probably more about trying to pull the threads of that together into something more coherent and saying that we need this across different Departments.  There is probably a need for political drive to bring that around.  It probably also is about going back to the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare and about devolving decision-making to communities and looking at it that way rather than having centralised decision-making around these types of issues.</p> <p>  Those are the issues.  Where there was more a focus there at political level, it might get to this Holy Grail we are all after more quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#H00200"><p>One of the other things that underpinned what happened in Australia was acknowledgement that government alone is not fully responsible to support people to have good lives.  Good lives come from having loving family and friends around you, but also having sufficient funding.  One of the things they did was invest in capacity-building strategies to support families and people with disabilities.  The change process has taken many years in Australia and it will take many years in Ireland.  Families continually telling their stories is quite distressing and they work when those stories translate into action.  Putting more money into doing the same thing will not cut it anymore in Ireland.  We really need to think differently.  Money does not think; it is people who do.  We need to get people around the table and use some of those design-thinking processes that will help us to create something different, and invest in families and people with disabilities themselves to be part of those solutions.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Tully to ask her questions.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  It has been informative and moving and has given me much to think about.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with Ms O'Toole.  There is a substantial budget for disability services here.  Although not enough, it is not only about the money; it is about how it is distributed.  It is not getting to the people who need it.</p> <p>  We are ten years behind Australia in ratifying the UNCRPD, and it will take time to make the changes that are required.  We cannot let time pass.  This has to be done with a sense of urgency, and that is not happening.  Persons with a disability must play an integral part in determining how the UNCRPD is implemented and how they would be allowed to live a fully independent life, and that cannot be done without a properly funded and functional advocacy service.</p> <p>  I am struck by what Dr. Simon Walsh and Ms Fiona Walsh have talked about here.  Ms Walsh stated they do not qualify for overnight support.  I cannot understand why they would not.  Ms Walsh talked about the lack of supports that they receive for Zoe's care.  Unfortunately, that is indicative of what we are hearing on the ground from many parents.  The needs sometimes vary and they certainly might not be as much as Zoe needs, but we are hearing about parents who are waiting for assessment of need.  When they get an assessment of need, they are put on another waiting list for early intervention.  Their concern, as pointed out to me, is that the longer they have to wait for early intervention, the more it will cost down the line to deal with the different issues and it is not cost effective.  It has been suggested to me that to deal with the existing backlog perhaps there should be a scheme such as the National Treatment Purchase Fund to clear the backlog and start afresh with a proper service.</p> <p>  We are being told that the progressing disability service model is the new model that is supposed to deliver all a child's needs in one place and I am anxious to hear what Ms Fiona Walsh's interpretation of that is.  She mentioned the difference in services in Galway and Cork.  That is what we are hearing on the ground.  The services differ from place to place.  That is not good enough.  I would be interested to hear Ms Walsh's thoughts on the disability service.</p> <p>  Dr. Simon Walsh talked about how we have a wealth of experience in other countries, such as Irish people who are qualified therapists or even medical personnel, who would like to come back here.  He stated it is not attractive for them to do so.  What would make it attractive for them?  Is it better pay or is it pay and conditions?  How would we attract people back?  We need them.  We are hearing there is a shortage of therapists in all our disability services.  There is a shortage of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and psychologists.  Across the board, we need the people here if we are to provide a proper service.</p> <p>  The model we should aspire to is what is happening in Australia.  Was the optional protocol ratified at the same time as the UNCRPD or afterwards in Australia, and has that made much of a difference?  I am also wondering how people are assessed for the supports they receive in Australia.  Do they apply and are they then assessed?  Are there waiting lists for those assessments or how was that overcome?  Were additional personnel put in?</p> <p>  We have many service providers who provide service for people, especially post secondary school.  They may go into a service.  Many of the services are of the one-size-fits-all type.  There is very little around what the person needs.  Some of the services are good but some are not.  It is basically take what you get or there is nothing else on offer there.  I wonder was there a structure in Australia.  What happened to those service providers?  What options are there for people post education?  Are there other opportunities for training and education and for work as well?</p></speech>

I guess it has just transitioned over to that here in Cork.  As I said earlier, I was told to pick three things that I would like to work on.  That is just not practical.  I got a lovely type-out of what those three things are maybe two months ago and nothing has been done since then.  I do not call it progressing disabilities; it is regressing disabilities.</p> <p>  I have no therapist.  I spoke to somebody on a Zoom call such as this and that is my only access so far to the progressing disability services, PDS.  That is not good enough.  I want somebody to come and do practical things with my daughter.  I do not want it on paper; I want it in person.  I am baffled by what the progressing disabilities is meant to be achieving because I am not seeing any results from it here.  I am part of a Cork mum's Facebook group and there has been no positive feedback about it.  I understand much of that is down to staffing.</p> <p>  There is one physiotherapist who works part time for 800 children under the foundation that our daughter is with.  Obviously, he will never be able to see all our children.  We should be getting weekly physiotherapy.  He has 800 children to see.  In a part-time role, how is that possible?  Maybe it looks okay on paper.  I have seen the videos and thought that this could be a step forward.  It has not been.</p> <p>  In Australia, the way it works is you do not go to somebody and be assessed.  You say that your goals for this year would be, for example, for us this year if I lived in Australia, that I would love for Zoe to be able to put her clothes on in the morning and the NDIS would fund a carer to come in in the morning and work on that with Zoe.  I would say the carer might be there for an hour in the morning helping Zoe get dressed and feeding her breakfast, not like I am while looking after two other kids but focusing on getting her to use a spoon or to pick up a cup and drink herself, and trying to make Zoe's life better and try to give her autonomy.</p><p>She needs physiotherapy because she needs to walk up steps.  We live in a two-storey house and her parents cannot lift her up and down the stairs forever, so the physiotherapy goal might be walking up steps for the year.  Then, we talk about occupational therapy.  We would say that Zoe needs sensory breaks and needs a sensory room, so we might put a light in, and the occupational therapist would work on different strategies with us.  We would have weekly sessions with the therapist whereas my CDKL5 family in Sydney have two hours of OT per week.</p><p> On speech and language, we would be working on different strategies with them but we would get to pick the therapist that we think works for us.  It would not be that this is the one person available and this is who we get because of where we live.  My daughter&rsquo;s needs are very different from what that person has trained in, so I might want to go to see another therapist.  We have the choice to do that, we are given the budget and we have control of the budget.  We then pick out where our goals lie and work on that for the year, and it is reassessed at the end of that year.</p><p> It is so far away from this PDS, where we pick three things to work on.  It is chalk and cheese.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#J00200"><p>With regard to getting specialists home from a medical perspective, I have worked in Australia as a doctor for ten years.  The quality of life there is much better, the services are much better and the system works much better.  People do not leave work stressed or anxious about the stuff that has happened during the day and they are not attending meetings all the time to try to get things fixed.  Their focus is patients and they are able to help patients.</p> <p>  The problem in regard to being with Zoe, with her special needs, was our being so far from family and with parents getting older, so we made the decision we were going to go back to a system that is less functional, and pay did not really come into it.  It is about coming home to family and wanting to come home to a system that works.  There are a lot of young people out there who do not have the same desire to get back to Ireland.  However, we need to make a system that has a better work-life balance so people are not working every hour in the week, and where work is enjoyable because the place people are going into is not a building that is 150 years old and has not been painted.  Little things like that make a workplace more attractive.  In Galway, my office for two years was in a prefab and the whole department was essentially a prefab.  I know they have funding in place to get a new department but that does not happen in Australia, where there are new hospitals.  It is little things like that that make people happy to work in a place, and it is the same for all of those specialists and therapists.  If they come back and they are stuck in a room with no windows for 40 hours a week, that is not as attractive as a situation where there are people to help with the job, and they are able to work together and have meetings to strategise about how to help these families and children.  As Ms Walsh said, someone who is working half-time to see 800 kids cannot see them because those kids are on waiting lists and that does not work.  There should be three or four physios.  It is just about funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.539" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#J00300"><p>I want to pick up on the Deputy's comments on the resourcing of advocacy.  We know from the disability capacity review the increase that is coming in the population of people with disabilities.  In that context, the role of independent advocacy is essential.  It is essential that it should be adequately resourced and essential it should be adequately promoted and facilitated right across the spectrum of supports and services that are being discussed today.</p> <p>  With regard to the people we support, particularly those who may not be able to voice their own experiences, we have a remit to work with those who may lack natural supports or may not be able to verbally share their own lived experiences.  Advocacy plays a particularly significant role in representing the lived experience of those people who are still living in congregated settings or inappropriate placements, such as nursing homes for those who are under 65.  It is essential to highlight the role of the assisted decision-making legislation, particularly around supported decision-making supports for such people.  It is not only advocacy that will play a significant role in giving voice to those people's experiences and the lack of quality of life, the lack of access to community and the lack of access to appropriate therapeutic supports that many of those people experience, and the impact it has on their life, but also the support that people will need once options become available, such as personalised budgets and options within the community.  Many of the people who have lived in institutional settings for up to 30 or 40 years have never experienced choice and have never experienced options.  They need to be given appropriate supports in line with the supported decision-making set out in the UNCRPD and the assisted decision-making Act to be empowered to be able to make informed decisions of their own free will by sampling and by being afforded appropriate time.  It is very important to recognise, in the context of all of the discussion we are having about the future of services, the important role of hearing the voices of those who often do not get heard.</p></speech>

There are many more families who are affected like Zoe&rsquo;s.  Many of the questions I want to ask have been asked.  Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh were in Australia and had the services there, and they then came to Galway and Cork.  Do they see the failings within the HSE?  We have nine community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  Within the CHOs for the different areas, do they feel we could make changes?  There seems to be a lack of communication, a lack of services and a lack of awareness.  While Covid has affected everyone's life, the past two years have been particularly hard on families who have a family member with a disability.  Where do they see the failings within the HSE?  The CHO will play the biggest part.  Do we need a full change there?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Broadhead on the NDIS.  Is there any other model like that around the world?  If he had to pick an action plan on the basis that there are a certain number of actions that Ireland needs to take, where does he feel the actions should be?</p> <p>  It is not right that we are here listening to this story and I know there are many others.  We need to make sure that we make change now but how do we begin that change?  Where do we start?  We need to start.  Ms O&rsquo;Toole said that we need to change our mindset but we also have to be practical.  Funding is one of the biggest issues facing all of the health sector, as we can see ourselves.  Ms Loughlin spoke about the national advocacy service and while she did get extra funding and we welcome that, some 65% of that funding went to residential care.  We need to expand our other services.  I want to know what we need to do to start the plan.  How do we start it?  How do we, as Oireachtas Members, commit today to working towards and supporting the actions?</p> <p>  We need to talk to the Minister, and I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, on this because it is important.  She tried to attend this morning but she had other meetings, although I told her this meeting was important.  As in other areas, she is trying to give funding across all of the sectors of disability.  What do we need to do to start going forward?  What groups need to meet?  What areas do Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh feel we need to prioritise?  In fairness to them, they are so professional about what road we need to take.  As a doctor, where does Dr. Walsh think the start needs to come?</p></speech>

For the South/South West Hospital Group in Cork and Kerry, where I work, the problem is that its budget is for the hospital and all of the community hospitals in the area, and disability services as well.</p><p>They are being pulled in many different directions.  The hospitals are underfunded and understaffed.  Most people see the need for a major hospital and the trauma network that is coming in.  Considerable funding is going to that.  Disabled people represent a small proportion of people who require funding meaning there is less of a draw for the head of the South/South West Hospital Group to provide funding for that.  In Galway, the Brothers of Charity and the Department of Education came together and both fund the disability services, whereas in Cork it is all done through Cope Foundation.  It is just underfunded.</p><p> Do the people at the top need to be diverting more money towards disability?  That is an easy thing to say but then money is being pulled from elsewhere, for example, from the emergency department.  If there was a big bucket of money and it was possible to do that, they would rebuild all the buildings and get all the therapists in, but we just cannot do that because there is pull from every direction.  Everybody wants money in their direction.  It would be great if we got money in the disability direction, but money is needed everywhere.</p></speech>

Someone might identify a speech and language therapist who is a specialist in eye-gaze technology and decide to see that speech and language therapist rather than one in the local area.  That person can then decide that from their budget &euro;130 a week will go towards that speech and language therapist.  I do not know if that model could be used here.  The only access to services we have is to go privately, which was part of the consideration in moving to Cork where there are private services.  There is a great market for them because access to public services is so poor.  Much of that is down to the population here.  It is a big city and everything is oversubscribed, including the waiting lists for schools.  There are many kids with disabilities but we just do not see them very often because like us they are hidden in the home much of the time.</p></speech>

The most radical part of introducing the NDIS in Australia was moving away from funding providers to funding people with disability.  That was the transformation in a nutshell.  That was not easily done.  You can imagine how it was received by the organisations that had been funded to provide services.  It was very painful for organisations, all full of good intentions and good people.  They had to change from an organisation that had certainty of funding to provide a level of services to as many people as they could with that funding to actually having to compete to get payment from the people with disability for the services they provided.  Many made the transformation successfully; some did not.  That is still something that is working out in the way we have created a market for provision of services rather than a block-funded set of arrangements.</p> <p>  The phrase I hear most often repeated by the government for which I work is "fully funded and demand driven".  It is a repeated statement because people doubt that this thing will be fully funded and demand driven and yet that is the commitment that has been made.  The cost has now reached a higher level than was expected, but the government of the day has said it is committed to fully funding it and it is demand driven.</p> <p>  The Act sets the criteria for assessment and then for the funding people receive.  It is not formulaic; it is individualised.  Simon and Fiona Walsh probably know more about it through direct experience.  A plan is prepared taking account of the reports and information a person or his or her family brings to a planning meeting and that is what determines the level of funding provided to a person.  The application is based on significant and permanent disability.  Any person with significant and permanent disability is eligible for the scheme assuming they meet the permanent residence, citizenship and age requirements.  The plan is then done, the person receives a sum of money and purchases services in a market with various providers.</p> <p>  There are difficulties in Australia, as Simon and Fiona Walsh will know.  It is a very big country with a small population for the area of land.  Therefore, we have difficulties getting out to remote areas.  We do not have hot and cold running therapists in the remote parts of the country.  We have had our problems and challenges in doing this.  A market model is quite difficult to make work in those circumstances.  However, considerable work has being put into expanding the workforce.  We still need another 83,000 people to join the workforce in the coming years and that is after already increasing it by a significant number.  Much of that is not high-level therapy, but personal care and those sorts of workers.  However, throughout there has been a political commitment by governments to it and the journey goes on.</p> <p>  Somebody asked if there is another one like it in the world.  I am not aware that there is, but that is not to say there are not some that are similar.  In the early days of what people call client-directed care in the UK, we looked at that years ago as interesting experiments again where people were given sums of money to use how they thought suited them best.  This was not completely new in the world, but I do not know of another scheme that has rolled it out on this scale, in this way and in this timeframe.  I would not claim to know what each of the 190 countries around the globe does.</p></speech>

The point I was making was that the funding for disability generally, not just for our service, is still very focused on residential services.  Some 65% of the HSE's budget goes to residential services.  That feeds into something that Mr. Broadhead highlighted.  We have many very big providers.  There is considerable interest in disability service provision.  It is still driven by a model of people having to fit into the service and it is not individualised.  We need to harness things such as the pilot programmes on individualised budgets, which are due to be completed next year as I understand it.</p> <p>  We also have the transition of responsibility for disability away from the Department of Health into the new Department.  While I know that is quite controversial, it grounds disability in equality and not in healthcare.  Disability is not just about healthcare; it is about a whole-of-life approach.  Some good things are happening but we need to work out how to harness that to get to the next level.  To get a model similar to what Mr. Broadhead has described it is about building an alliance in civil society and at governmental level.  It also requires looking at legislative provisions.  People do not have access to services as a legislative right here.  It is not a justiciable right to say I need access to speech and language therapy or that my child does.  There is no law underpinning it.  There are other pieces we could also look at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#K00900"><p>I wish to add to what Ms Loughlin said.  We are already on the journey to offer some hope.  The demonstration project on personalised budgets is one of those ways we can learn to do things differently.  We need to invest in it because families are on that journey alone.  They are not connected and are not sharing their learning with each other.  The HSE is developing its action plan.  We could insert into that supporting new and innovative ways of working.  We could set some targets and look at partnering differently with social enterprises and some of the emerging entities that can deliver services in a different and perhaps better way while we are still trying to fix the system.</p><p> Take the example of Covid-19.  The HSE did not develop the Covid tracker app; it partnered with other industry experts that use technology and digitalisation.  They got together and looked at the problem, what the options were and how it could be fixed.  They decided to create a minimum viable product, get it out and test it.  Those methods are ways that can help us in the disability area and offer some hope.  We are on that path.  There is a huge amount of expertise in Ireland because there was massive investment from 2010 to 2020 whereby we learned from other countries.  There are family bodies that have been on this journey and that know how to do what is different.  There are new organisations in the marketplace now.  We are there, but we cannot be risk averse and the system has to support that.  When I was working in services, trying to do something different was very difficult.  If anything, the system pulls and sucks one back into its way of working because that is what systems do.  We have to be brave and courageous and use the mechanisms we have now, invest in the projects and other things we are testing and share the stories of what is possible, as well as hearing about all of what is not broken.  There are many things that are working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#L00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending the committee meeting today.  It has been both informative and infuriating to hear from the different witnesses.  I am particularly struck by the statement of Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh.  Being a Cork Deputy, I can attest to that.  There is nothing my office is contacted about more than the absolute absence of support services in the area.  They spoke about the absence of kindergarten services in Cork city.  In all of Cork South-West, south of the city, there is not one special school.  It is a constant issue and one this committee has heard about continually.  Dr. Walsh mentioned that they are fortunate enough to be able to pay.  We speak to many families who just cannot pay and their children are not getting the services they need.  The early intervention is so important.  We are talking about how to do this, and asking questions and scratching our heads as to how we go about it, but we need to call a spade a spade as well.  Dr. Walsh clearly mentioned that progressing disability services is a failure.  I said that straight out to representatives of the HSE at one of our meetings - I think it was last week.  People are not getting the services they need.</p> <p>  If we want to look at how we should go about addressing this issue, there is an obvious first step, which is funding it.  The Department's capacity review stated that &euro;350 million is needed to meet the unmet needs of people with disabilities in this country.  There was an additional &euro;65 million in the budget, so there is no actual intention.  Mr. Broadhead spoke about how Australia ratified the UNCRPD a year after it was introduced.  It took Ireland ten years to do so, which is disgraceful, and we still have not ratified the optional protocol which obliges the state to allow people to exercise their rights.  We have to be more upfront about the reality of the situation here.  It comes down to political will, and that must change.  Mr. Broadhead spoke about creating awareness in Australia and the public wanting it.  The public in Ireland absolutely want it.  One can see that by virtue of the fact that where the State abdicates responsibility one sees the general public often swooping in with fundraisers and not-for-profit organisations trying to support families and individuals.  There is certainly the public will; we just need the political will and the funding.  The country can afford it.</p> <p>  The comparison between Cork and Galway is stark.  Even more stark is the comparison between Australia and Ireland.  Having worked abroad in disability support services, I have to say that it is not just Australia.  When I was working in Malta the service I was working with had daily access to speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, equine therapy, hydrotherapy and art therapy.  The list goes on.  It is about encouraging people to live independently, but here one cannot even get an hour of speech and language therapy.  I am sorry for going on, Chairman.</p> <p>  As to my questions, because of the ones addressed by previous speakers I will direct my questions mainly to the representatives of the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities.  I hear many positive reports about the service it provides and it would be useful for the committee to learn a little more about that.  Perhaps the witnesses could give us a sense of its work.  One of the clearest and most worrying points raised before this committee is that individuals and families have to fight repeatedly for basic health, education, transport and care services.  As well as it being simply wrong that people have to do that, it also implies that people have the capacity and means to struggle for services.  It would be useful for the committee to understand the vital service provided by the National Advocacy Service, the issues it helps individuals with and how long it can take to resolve those cases.  Ms Loughlin mentioned in her opening statement the reality that there will be more people living with disabilities in the future.  How will the service be able to cater for the accompanying increased demand?  How many advocates are there nationally?  Is there an estimate of how many more will be needed to reach international best practice?</p> <p>  Ms Loughlin also highlighted eradicating the practice of next-of-kin consent.  It has no legal basis except in certain circumstances, yet NAS advocates encounter it in different settings.  Can she elaborate on that for the committee so we can have a better understanding?</p> <p>  Finally, Ms Loughlin specifically discussed the disgraceful situation of over 1,300 people under 65 years old who are forced to live in nursing homes because the State is not providing independent supported living.  I am aware of situations in my constituency where people are forced to be in a psychiatric ward because there is no opportunity for any type of independent supported living.  Can Ms Loughlin describe the issues advocates have encountered and the rights they have helped individuals fight for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#L00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I will reply and bring in Ms Condon later.  I will tell the committee a little more about our service.  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities is funded by the Citizens Information Board, which is funded by the Department of Social Protection.  It has a particular remit to support people who are isolated in their communities, living in residential services and who communicate differently.  Our service is only for adults so we do not provide support to children, although we see people when they age out of our education services and come into adult services.  That is where we see the future impact of the issues and situations that Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh have so eloquently highlighted.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's question about the types of issues that arise for us, they are very wide-ranging.  Housing is a major one.  When we describe housing we mean the broadest range in terms of accommodation.  We are talking about people who might be living in residential services, an old-style institutional setting, who no longer want to be there.  It can take a very long time to support people to transition out of that into independent living.  It can also mean people, particularly on the autism spectrum, who can find themselves on the cusp of homelessness or homeless.  That can be an issue, especially in Dublin.<br/><br/>One of our main areas of work is supporting people to build their own capacity in decision-making and to be involved in decisions.  Ms Condon highlighted in one of her earlier remarks the fact that when many disabled people are given the opportunity to make decisions or exercise choice they find it extremely challenging due to the disempowerment they experience from quite a young age in terms of not being supported to live their lives to their full capacity.  They require a lot of support to get to that point.  Much of our work is on building people's confidence and autonomy to even voice their concerns about decisions that are being made for them and about them in respect of quite fundamental basic rights regarding where one lives and how one spends one's time.<br/><br/>The other area in which we are involved is access to justice.  Some of the issues in respect of next-of-kin and ward of court are a particular theme of our work.<br/><br/>We have not done a projection <i>per se</i>with regard to what has emerged from the capacity review in terms of the longer term growth in the number of disabled people.  We currently have approximately 28 advocates around the country and eight senior advocates, with a very small management and support team for that.  We have waiting lists, and they have been growing.  We will be seeking an increase in resources to support us to fully deliver those services because it takes us a long time to support people to achieve the outcomes that they want to achieve.</p><p>We anticipate that when the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is commenced next year, there will be an increased demand for advocacy there, as people seek to implement the provisions of the Act in terms of their own decision-making.  I might refer to Ms Condon to talk about next-of-kin, some of the case work, how long it can take and the complexity of it, some of the issues that Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh have highlighted that we see on the adult side, how complex they can be and why advocacy is so critical. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.556" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021120900002#M00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  As Ms Loughlin has mentioned, the work of advocates can span across all of the areas that Ms Loughlin mentioned in terms of the issues involved.  The Deputy asked a question on the length of our case work.  I guess it depends on the complexity and the number of issues involved.  For many of those we work with, they are facing not just one or two single issues; there can be multiple issues.  A person may have lived in an institution for many years and he or she may have a poor quality of life, limited natural supports, limited access to appropriate therapeutic supports and limited access to his or her community.  That can be further compounded by the likes of next-of-kin consent issues.  For example, we do a lot of work around issues such as Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders, where individuals' own wishes are not being sought should they be facing end-of-life or emergency decision-making.  Their decisions around treatment choices as to whether they should be accessing healthcare services are often ignored to the detriment of seeking families' wishes as to how they want their loved one to be cared for.  Obviously, for an adult with a disability in the context of discussions around the UNCRPD and rights and people living ordinary self-determined lives, it is essential that people's voices are heard and they have the opportunity to make those decisions for themselves.  We do a huge amount of work in upholding rights in pointing to the HSE's consent policy, which very often is not understood or implemented across many divisions of healthcare services.  There is a prevalence of next-of-kin forms that exist within our healthcare services that seek the consent of third parties, which has absolutely no legitimate basis without proper legal authority to do so.  That is a huge area of our work.</p> <p>  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we have also seen much next-of-kin decision-making with regard to Covid vaccines.  Again, people's own wishes around whether they chose to receive or refuse vaccinations were ignored and family members were asked to make decisions.  At a very basic level, rights are not being respected in day-to-day decision-making, never mind the fight with regard to access to services that we have already heard so well described by the previous speakers.  We also work with those who are most marginalised, wards of court and those whose voices often do not get heard in decision-making forums.  We work to represent those voices and ensure that they are heard so that people can have a say in what happens to them, where they live and the decisions that others are taking.  We very much welcome the abolishment of that system as we move towards full implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act .  </p> <p>  With regard to other areas, such as employment and parenting with a disability, we also provide quite complex support to those who are navigating the social care system when their children may be taken into care, they are attending court and there are care proceedings.  We support people's access to justice, ensuring equal opportunity and fair process, ensuring that people understand and have support.  Significant improvement can be made in the area of accessibility and access to services.  There is a distinct issue in how Ireland currently defines disability with regard to HSE service provision.  We need to move more towards the definition of disability with regard to how people access services.  It is really encouraging to hear Mr. Broadhead explain that in the Australian system, the definition of advocacy that applies in terms of accessing services is that broader piece, and it is not based on assessment that we see here in HSE services, with the distinction between mild and moderate disability defining whether individuals can access services.  There are so many obstacles that people face on a day-to-day basis to access their basic rights and services, to have their voices heard and to live quality lives.  We must come back to the fact that it is not just about receiving a service; it is about having a good life.  Everything that the advocacy service does right across all of those issues that we have just described is about supporting people to live lives of their choosing where it matters, with access to home supports, PA support and community services, and ensuring that they can build capacity and have the opportunities that everybody else has.  There is a big gap there still.  </p></speech>

I have been listening with huge interest.  This has been a most interesting discussion today.  I think it has been particularly useful to get the international dynamic from Mr. Broadhead.  My sister-in-law is Australian and her family are quite familiar with the new system over there.  She raves about it to me all the time.  It is interesting to hear Dr. Walsh's and Ms Walsh's experience of Zoe's counterpart.  It is interesting to hear that they can see like for like, and the Australian system is outperforming our system and is meeting the needs much better than we are, unfortunately.  In respect of my own background, before I became a Deputy I worked for a multinational corporation.  When we worked on projects, we used to always identify successful projects and things that worked in certain countries or areas of the business.  People were tasked with coming up with a play book that could effectively be given to other arms of the business to show them how to do it and what success looked like and to provide them with all of the tips and tricks to get there.  Obviously, even in that situation, national laws were sometimes an impediment and national resources had to be looked at.  It was key that there was such a focus on sharing that information in cases where something worked and was successful, and trying to bring people up a level.  I value the contributions of all the witnesses, but it is really valuable to hear the Australian perspective today.  We have a lot to learn from it.  I am pleased that Mr. Broadhead has taken the time to talk us through it.  I hope that we can further collaborate, because that is how we can improve the Irish system.</p> <p>  The funding model, in particular, that Mr. Broadhead spoke about is quite interesting, where funding is allocated to an individual or a family and they acquire the services that they need themselves.  I was not expecting that to be working so well, given that quite often we hear from witnesses at this committee who may have been given funding for a PA-type service and cannot acquire it.   They have the money, but cannot access the service and it is of no use to them.  I would like to ask some questions around the practicalities of that in the hope that we could learn and put in place systems that could help the likes of Dr. Walsh, Ms Walsh and Zoe and all of the organisations that are represented here today.</p> <p>  I am wondering what happens from a human resources perspective.  Are there enough professionals in the area?  Were there enough already when the new scheme started out, or was investment in recruitment strategies required?  Did the Australian Government have to invest in courses so that people could qualify in an area to be recruited?  Are there geographical issues?  Obviously, Australia covers a massive area.  Mr. Broadhead referenced Alice Springs, where there may be a higher prevalence of demand, but it obviously has quite a small population.  How does it work in situations like that?  I would be particularly interested in hearing any lessons learned from the recruitment aspect.  A number of my colleagues referenced Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is quite similar to the strategy that Mr. Broadhead spoke about in that it continues no matter who is in power or government.  It is an initiative that is cross-party and that everybody signed up to.  I believe there is a lot in that that we need to continue, but we also need to ensure that it adequately addresses this entire area.  As we set out to do that, I wonder if there are particular lessons that the Australian Government has learned or challenges that it has had to overcome on the human resources side, in particular.  I would appreciate any information on that.  </p> <p>  All the participants have brought unique perspectives to the meeting and I really value them.  It is important that we have these kind of discussions.  They put these issues on the agenda nationally.  That is what we have to do if we are to make a change.</p></speech>

We are lucky that we have got a reasonable workforce.  The biggest expansion has been in personal care workers - people providing assistance with activities of daily living.  The Chairman mentioned geography.  We have some shortages in some types of therapies here and there depending on which part of the country one is in.  In Australia we have always had a challenge in any form of provision when we get out into our remote areas.  That is a continuing challenge.  We have a phrase, "thin markets", which basically means that people do not have sufficient choice of providers in those areas.  We have thin market strategies where we try to encourage people into those areas.  Fortunately, we have some large-scale providers that will take steps to move their workforce into areas that are underserved.  It is still a continuing challenge, partly because it has been such a big expansion.  If we had only taken what we did before and re-engineered it and provided the same level, the workforce would be there but it has been a significant expansion.</p> <p>  A website was built that modelled small local areas.  We took data from people who were participating that anticipated the funding we were giving and the kind of services they would require.  The website can map small areas and predict how many workers we can expect to be required in that area.  Because it is a market-based model, it is about trying to give service providers sight of where they have opportunities to expand.  Because it has been expanding for some years, there is some gearing up, workforce training and so on.  The training institutions in our country see this as an opportunity.  People see it as an opportunity to get work.  There is a lag and there are challenges but over time the workforce is expanding.  I mentioned earlier that we still need to bring in another 83,000 workers to meet what we expect to be the level of demand going forward.</p></speech>

Many aspects relate to ratifying the optional protocol, which we did in July 2008.  I did not mention that earlier.  I will have to have a reboot enforced by our IT department.  That is the best I can answer that question.</p> <p>  We have a history in our health service in Australia of applying insurance models to the supports.  If I go to a GP I get a reimbursement from the government towards the fee but I pay when I go there.  Social insurance was included in the terms of reference of the review of how disability care should be provided.  I was specifically asked to look at the notion that this should operate as an insurance model.  The associate commissioner at the productivity commission, who was one of the key people in writing that report, had a lot of history in workers' compensation schemes.  We have government-based workers' compensation and transport accident schemes at state level.  They brought that expertise and world view to some of the questions in the terms of reference.  Does that address the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

We lived in the outback while we were in Australia.  Simon was a flying doctor.  Zoe had medical emergencies while we lived there and we had to go to hospital in Adelaide.  I was flown down there with Zoe.  I have a friend who lives in Alice Springs whose son has disabilities.  She travels to Brisbane and Sidney for therapy.  Therapists also fly in and out from there.  They might do two weeks on and two weeks off.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we are lucky in that if I have to go to Limerick for a specialist appointment, I can hop in the car.  We go to Boston to specialists so that would not be a big deal for me.  Recently myself and six other mums came together and approached the therapists in Boston.  The name of the group is Neurological and Physical Abilitation, NAPA, Center.  We put a proposal to them to come to Ireland and work with the kids here.  They are coming here for six weeks next year.  These are world-renowned experts absolutely at the top of their field.  Unfortunately, they are coming here for six weeks only.  They do three-week sessions.  There were more than 500 applications and only 18 places in the six weeks.  The demand is massive.  NAPA Center is a business.  They can see that.  For myself and other mums, our hope is that they will see how much of a need there is for this service here.  They have locations in Australia and all around America.  Our hope is that they would make Ireland their European base.  If the funding is there, the specialists will come.  </p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was before the committee as was the UN special rapporteur.  They both said that Ireland can ratify the optional protocol in the morning.  There is no good reason for delaying any further.  We consistently hear from the Department that it needs measures such as the assisted decision-making Act to be in place beforehand and that it needs all these other things.  It keeps shifting the goalposts and putting something else in the way that means we cannot apparently ratify.  To alleviate some of the worry about ratification that seems to be blown out of all proportion here, did Australia encounter any disasters after it ratified the optional protocol?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their honesty.  We are intercontinental this morning in more ways than one, with witnesses contributing remotely from abroad and describing their lived experiences in Australia as well.  Throughout our committee work we have spoken about the lived experience of people with disabilities and their families.</p><p>It has been very powerful to hear Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh and to hear of the advocacy groups' work behind the scenes.  I know the effort that goes into trying to fight for facilities and rights.  It is a never-ending issue.  I thank Mr. Broadhead for joining us from Australia.</p><p> There is an ingrained attitude within some systems, and that attitude needs to change fundamentally to ensure adequate funding.  We will follow up on the optional protocol and do whatever we can to ensure it is implemented as soon as possible rather than listening to any further excuses.  I was struck by Dr. Walsh's and Ms Walsh's commentary on Galway versus Cork.  Ireland is a small State yet we cannot have universal delivery within the country.  We need to look at that.  We have to challenge the CHOs individually to see why there is not conformity throughout the country in the delivery of the services.  I deal with one of the service providers that span one of the CHOs, the south west and the mid-west, and they tell me there is a different attitude between the two.  That is simply unacceptable.</p><p> The witnesses have been very honest about being able to provide the therapies privately because of their position.  We need to challenge the HSE.  I have heard of several cases in which people have left the private sector for a job in the HSE.  They get frustrated by the HSE and go back to the private sector.  I am talking about occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  People working in those fields say that if they go into the public sector, they have secure employment, but they have gone there, been at the coalface and experienced huge frustration and then they have left the sector and joined the private sector again because they get more job satisfaction and a sense that they are doing something with their training.  We have to look at that and challenge it.</p><p> At this point in time do we have to see whether the HSE can buy the services of the private providers?  A large number of private providers have set up play, speech and language and occupational therapy services.  Is it a question of how we need to look at the HSE contract for those services?  I do not see another solution in the short term.  I see families coming to my office, as other members have said, looking for help, guidance and support, and I do not know what it is.  I do not normally ask questions because I believe it is for the members to keep the ebb and flow of meetings but I will put one point to Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh.  They are getting services from private providers, and many of them are excellent and dedicated to their job beyond words.  Is this something that should be looked at?  It is only a commentary.  I am thinking of Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh as having the lived experience and being at the coalface of trying to deliver services for their daughter.</p></speech>

Every parent will decide how much therapy his or her child needs.  No one wants to overburden their child, and some parents will be much keener to get more therapy for their children because they think it might make them better, but after a while people find a happy medium.  We have recently cut back on the physiotherapy we provide because it was a lot of work for us to be travelling around the county every week.  We have cut it back to fortnightly.  If we were able to submit the bills to the HSE and get reimbursed, that would be amazing.  That is only one small thing.  Wheelchairs, high chairs and little things like that come out of our mortgage budget.  Other people are not able to fund them.  If we were able to submit those bills to somebody, it would be a huge step.</p></speech>

A lot of that goes through private providers.  Additionally, the HSE and the traditional section 38 and section 39 services we have are using private providers to provide residential placements.  That can be welcome, but I would add a note of caution that the positive experience Dr. Walsh and Ms Walsh have described is not reflected across the board.  Sometimes there can be providers coming in and going out of Ireland quite quickly for different reasons, and that can lead to a lot of inconsistency in services.  While we have regulation around residential service providers, it does not always look at the quality-of-life issues.  HIQA is focused on what is in its regulations.  Our experience of quality of life and some of the issues Ms Condon has described is that the variety of provision is huge when we look at traditional providers and private providers.  Another experience we have had is that many private providers in the residential space are using properties that are very far from people's home locations or their bases of interest, that is, their families and communities.</p> <p>  We all love the hybrid models these days.  We need to think a bit differently about this and look at private providers.  We really have to look at the values and ethos of those services as well and make sure they have the commitment the Chair described such that it is not just an in-and-out, money-making exercise.  They have to have certain standards to which they operate.  Again, it has to go back to a person-centred service.  It cannot just be the provision of a bungalow for six adults with intellectual disabilities.  It has to be tailored to those individuals.  That is the critical piece if we want to bring in private providers.  Private providers should not be used just for a quick fix; it should be ensured that the design of what they are delivering meets the needs of the people the service is for.</p></speech>

It gives them that option to look at what they need most and they have the fund to be able to pay for that.  We are on the journey towards getting to where Australia is at with the national disability insurance scheme, NDIS.  It is here in Ireland and we need to invest in it and protect it.  That would be very helpful for families into the future.</p></speech>

The minutes were agreed and dealt with at our private meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I refer to the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.  Members are aware of the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that Mr. Ger Deering was selected as the candidate to be nominated as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner following the retirement of Mr. Peter Tyndall.  Formal notification of the motion to nominate Mr. Deering was referred to the joint committee, which is required to report to both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad before 14 December 2021.  I welcome Mr. Deering to the meeting, congratulate him and wish him well.  I thank Mr. Tyndall for his period of office.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the role Mr. Deering is now taking up and his ambitions for that role.  We are delighted to have him with us to outline that.</p> <p>  I remind members and our witness of the note on privilege.  As long as they are here in Leinster House, they are covered by privilege.

I am pleased to have been invited to engage with the committee. I am honoured to have been selected as the Government&rsquo;s nominee for appointment by the President as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, following the competition run by the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p>  An effective democracy requires that the Government and public administrators are held accountable for their actions.  The Ombudsman and Information Commissioner plays a vital role in monitoring administrative accountability so that public service activities are carried out in a spirit of openness and accountability and in a proper and fair manner.  The Ombudsman is an important element of the checks and balances within the State and acts as a positive influence on the delivery of services and the management of complaints by providers of public services in Ireland.  In addition, the role of the Information Commissioner is key in developing a culture of maximum access to information held by public bodies.</p> <p>  At the outset, I commend public bodies the length and breadth of the country on the work they do on a daily basis.  Society simply could not function without them.  Most of the time, the majority of these organisations and their staff provide an excellent service.  I particularly commend public sector employees and their leaders for the flexibility, professionalism and commitment many of them have demonstrated during the pandemic.  We have experienced some remarkable examples of their responsiveness and the quality of their work during the pandemic.</p> <p>  That said, public services are not always as good as they could or should be, mistakes are made and information is not always furnished when it should be.  The role of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner is to deal with such situations and to promote learning and improvements when and where required.  In addition to delivering a robust and timely complaints management process, the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner has an important role in encouraging, assisting and requiring public bodies to improve the quality of the information they provide, the services they deliver and how they deal with complaints.  This is achieved through ongoing sharing and learning based on the work of the Office of the Ombudsman and through the provision of guidance and appropriate collaboration and by demonstrating the benefits of listening to service users through feedback and complaints mechanisms.  Among my key priorities will be fostering early and better resolution of complaints and ensuring timely meaningful engagement with the Office of the Ombudsman by providers.  I will also continue to focus on the need to listen to people and emphasise the benefits of resolving issues in a non-adversarial way that is fair to everyone.</p> <p>  The Office of the Information Commissioner and the Office of the Commissioner for Environmental Information have a key role in delivering greater access to information held by public bodies.  The offices also have a key role in promoting the benefits of open data and delivering cultural change in respect of access to information.  I want to achieve maximum transparency in the management and dissemination of information by public bodies.  I believe that much of the information currently obtained using freedom of information, FOI, and access to environmental information, AIE, should be made available as a matter of course, thereby reducing the need for FOI and AIE requests to these bodies.  Furthermore, it is critical that FOI and AIE bodies have appropriate and efficient mechanisms in place for dealing with requests from the public and for responding to the Office of the Information Commissioner and the Office of the Commissioner for Environmental Information.</p> <p>  Empowering service users by making them aware of what they are entitled to expect and their options when things go wrong is also important.  Furthermore, it is essential that all public services, including the services of the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, are easily and readily accessible.  People must have the option to engage in the manner most suited to them, whether that is online, in person when circumstances allow, or by telephone.  In that regard, I note the Office of the Ombudsman continues to work on developing its technology and digital portals but, as it does so, it remains committed to maintaining accessibility and human contact for those who prefer these options.  This is important to ensure maximum access.</p> <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman has a strong tradition of engaging in outreach activity.</p><p>This has, unfortunately, been curtailed by the pandemic.  Facilities have been put in place to conduct outreach by methods other than face to face.  It may be necessary to adopt a hybrid model of outreach to continue to connect with service users in the future.</p><p> An important feature of the work of the Ombudsman is the power to undertake own initiative investigations.  The Ombudsman can identify areas that merit investigation irrespective of whether a complaint has been made about the particular issue or service.  This is a power that has been used to great effect by the current and previous holders of the Office of Ombudsman.  I will continue the use of this power in a targeted and effective manner with a strong focus on ensuring the voices of people which might otherwise be missed are heard and responded to.  This involves not only responding to complaints received but also proactively engaging with advocacy groups, marginalised groups and individuals through outreach and own initiative investigations and reports.  I propose to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of previous Ombudsman reports and to conduct future investigations and issue further reports.</p><p> It is my intention to keep a focus on access to transport for those living with a disability.  This has been an ongoing priority for the office for almost ten years now and was championed by both Emily O'Reilly and Peter Tyndall.  I also propose to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in reports published by Peter Tyndall, including A Good Death, dealing with the very sensitive issue of end-of-life care; Learning to Get Better, which deals with health complaints; Opportunity Lost, relating to the Magdalen redress scheme; and Wasted Lives, the most recent report, which looked at the appropriateness of the placement of people under 65 years of age in nursing homes designed for older people.  The improved management information systems recently developed by the office will facilitate the identification of areas that should be considered for own initiative investigations in the future.  I will be happy to work with the Oireachtas, this committee and any other Oireachtas committee to maintain momentum in the implementation of the recommendations contained in these reports.</p><p> I believe a society should be judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable members.  Often in this country we look back with shame on events that happened in the past.  It is important we acknowledge the past and rectify and redress what we can.  We must also learn from these experiences.  Equally, we must focus purposefully on the services we are delivering or ought to be delivering today.  We need to ensure future generations will not be forced to look back with shame on events that should not have happened or actions that should have been taken on our watch.</p><p> I welcome that jurisdiction over complaints from people living in direct provision was eventually given to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  I am glad to note that since this jurisdiction was given, it has formed an important area of work for the office.  I also welcome the fact that progress has been made on bringing complaints from prisoners within the jurisdiction of the office.  However, further progress is required in this area.</p><p> I am pleased there is a commitment to bring the administration of the asylum and immigration process within the jurisdiction of the office.  This commitment must be delivered as a priority.  It is essential the services of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office are available to all who live in our country and not just to citizens.  There is no justification for excluding any public service from the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  This is especially so when the services are delivered to the most vulnerable in society.</p><p> I welcome that a review of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 is under way to strengthen and modernise the legislation.  I also welcome that a review of ethics legislation is under way to ensure we have an easy to understand ethical framework that contributes to the quality and effectiveness of public administration.  A similar review of the legislation underpinning the office of the Ombudsman would be beneficial.  Such a review should be informed by the work of the office over the past 40 years, the changing needs of service users and the constant evolution in the delivery of public services.  The review should also seek to incorporate the Venice principles, the global standard for public service Ombudsman institutions adopted by the United Nations in December 2020.  It was positive that Ireland was a co-sponsor of the motion when the principles were adopted.  We should now adopt and implement these principles ourselves.</p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman will receive a significant new role relating to the receipt of disclosures under the protected disclosures (amendment) Bill, which will transpose the EU whistleblowing directive and strengthen protections for whistleblowers.  This will be an important opportunity to promote a culture in the country of speaking up when wrongdoing is detected and providing support and assurance to those who call out wrongdoing.</p><p> We use various tools, such as GDP, to measure the success of our economy, but society is much more than an economy.  The more important question for me is how we measure societal success.  I believe we should measure our success as a people by the level of openness, inclusion and access to services and opportunities enjoyed by all.  We have made great progress as a nation in these areas in recent years.  However, it is still the case that some people, whether born here or newly arrived, are less able to access information, services and entitlements.  They need support and understanding to overcome barriers.  Ultimately, we must identify and remove any barriers that exist and design our services in a way that makes them universally accessible.</p><p> We should rightly acknowledge and celebrate the many improvements we have made as a nation, particularly in recent years, in a whole range of areas.  However, we should not be complacent.  We still have a way to go.  We should also guard against any possible regression relating to people&rsquo;s rights.  We can see that, internationally, there are attempts to row back on people&rsquo;s fundamental human rights, even in parts of the EU.  We must ensure there is no dilution of the rights of individuals or groups in our society to access information and services.  We must, therefore, forge ahead and redouble our efforts to ensure every member of society has his or her rights protected irrespective of his or her background, race, gender, ability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or civil status.  We must ensure people are given autonomy and treated fairly and equally and with respect and dignity.  People are entitled to be treated in this manner, whether they are accessing or delivering services.</p><p> I believe all the roles assigned to the post for which I have been nominated, including Ombudsman, Information Commissioner, Commissioner for Environmental Information, member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, member of the Commission for Public Service Appointments and member of any referendum commission established, are key elements in ensuring a fair and just society where a human rights based approach is adopted in the delivery of high quality and accessible public services.</p><p> A considerable body of work has been done by the Office of the Ombudsman and its various incumbents over its 40 years of existence.  I pay tribute to those who have held the post in the past, in particular to Peter Tyndall for the work he has done and the excellent legacy he leaves.  He will be a hard act to follow.</p><p> It is evident the office is well served by a committed management and staff, and I welcome the prospect of working with the director general, the management team and all the staff of the office as we continue to make a real and positive difference in the lives of citizens and people living in Ireland by working together with all stakeholders to ensure public services are delivered to a high standard in an accessible, transparent, accountable and fair manner.</p><p> I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee members for this opportunity to engage with them.  I am happy to hear any comments or deal with any questions they have.</p></speech>

I wish him every success in the years ahead.  I also commend the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on ensuring Mr. Deering was nominated on foot of an open recruitment process.  Mr. Deering's position is greatly strengthened in the political and public realms because he comes before both having been selected as a result of an independent, transparent and objective process.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Deering who said at the outset of his comments, and I commend him on it, that we are lucky in this country because we have a good public service.  We have excellent services that are provided but they can always be improved.  There are areas within the public service that need to be improved.  I am conscious and appreciate that he recognises his role is to try to assist the public by improving the quality of information and services provided by the public service.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Deering some questions in respect of what he stated in his opening statement.  He made some comments that I thought interesting and of use to the political realm.  In his report, he mentioned he believes that much of the information currently obtained using freedom of information and access to environmental information should be made available as a matter of course.  That would mean individuals would not have to select documents they think exist but that the documents would be, in general, available.  It may be the case, in fact, that certain documents would be withheld and they are the ones that would be subject to application.  I ask Mr. Deering to elaborate on that point.  How does he think it could operate?</p><p>What improvements would that result in?</p></speech>

One area is public information generally and the other is personal data.  Obviously personal data are something that should always have to be applied for by the person themselves.  In some institutions up to 60% of the information that is sought under FOI is in fact public information.  I would believe, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, that if it is necessary to redact certain pieces of this information, then that would be acceptable.  A lot of information is released under FOI, so my thinking is that if it can be released under FOI, why not put it up on the website in the first place.  Almost all public bodies have very good websites with a lot of information, and I will outline what I would like to see as they develop in this area.  In fact, many bodies put up on their websites the information they grant under FOI.</p> <p>  I appreciate that for many organisations they consider requests under FOI to be an administrative burden, but people are entitled to this information and we must resource the area.  If we put the information up on the website in the first place, a considerable number of people can then access it and will not need to submit an FOI request.  If people measured the amount of time it takes to deal with an FOI request as opposed to deciding to put the information up on their website, they would find that in the long run there would be an efficiency.  As well as doing the right thing it could also help in terms of efficiency for the organisations and save on resources.</p></speech>

It will always be up to each body as to what they put on their website.  Many organisations put minutes of their management meetings, boards and so on, and within Departments they put up those kinds of minutes.  The maximum amount of that information that is put there will both reduce the administrative burden for the body and, more importantly, give better access to the public.</p></speech>

One of the things we suffer from sometimes is we take legislation as being the maximum we can do.  It usually is the minimum we are required to do but in the vast majority of areas people can go beyond what the legislation actually requires them to do.</p></speech>

What principles would guide him if he is trying to decide whether to establish an information of his own initiative?  Is he going to be swayed by what is in the media?  How can people interpret how he comes to his own initiative?</p></speech>

For example, one would consider the statistics within the office itself such as whether we were receiving a lot of complaints from a particular area.  It would also be the impact.  It would not necessarily be the number of complaints.  One might see that, even with a small number of complaints or an individual complaint, the impact for this person and, more significantly, the impact beyond that individual for groups of people could be very significant.  Certainly it would be about collecting information and data from any source, whether that is public representatives, the media or the office itself.  The key thing is to do the research and know the extent of the difficulty or the problem people are encountering, whether it actually requires an investigation or if it is something that could be solved by dealing directly with an individual body.</p> <p>  One of the areas from which I would like to see more information come is the complaints mechanisms of the public bodies themselves.  If a body receives quite a number of complaints in a particular category or from a particular group of people, then there must be an issue.  It could be an issue as small as or as simple as the information that is available is not clear or as good as it should be, or it might be something more systemic and difficult.  I would adopt a risk-based approach where one collects the information, puts it together and sees the possible detriment in this area and, equally, the advantages and what we can achieve by doing an investigation.</p> <p>  I might just comment on some of the own initiative investigations that have been done, particularly most recently by Mr. Peter Tyndall.  Let us consider the ones I have listed.  I have seen on the ground the impact of some of those around people being decongregated from collective or institutional settings.  That is very impactful on people's lives for the rest of their lives.  What is interesting about a report like this is that one does not necessarily see or meet the people who benefit from it.  The people who benefit from it themselves do not necessarily know they benefit from it because some investigation was done by the Ombudsman.  I do not think it matters where the credit goes or who claims they have made something happen.  The key thing is the person on the ground gets the benefit of this action or activity.</p></speech>

The primary legislation dates from 1980 and we had an amending Act in 2012.  In what way does he think the Oireachtas could improve the legislation for the benefit of his office?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.598" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#C01000"><p>A review would look at that.  For example, I mentioned the Venice Principles.  Indeed, the Deputy mentioned the fact my post was advertised and went through the Public Appointments Service.  That would be one of the Venice Principles.  Like the Deputy, I commend the Minister and the Department because they are applying the Venice Principles and, indeed, the office is applying the principles, which are a set of 25 principles around transparency, independence, fairness and all of the things an ombudsman office should hold.</p> <p>  It might be said we do not need the legislation because we are already doing these things.  While that is not a problem, there is an issue, which I mentioned and I hope we do not ever see it in Ireland, in that in some parts of the world and in the EU there is a rowing back in those situations.  It is always good to have something as fundamental and as important as these principles enshrined in legislation so that it does not depend on the Minister or Ombudsman of the day to ensure these things happen.  It is always best to have these kinds of important principles enshrined in the legislation.</p></speech>

I heard and read his opening statement with real interest because I am interested in this subject myself.</p> <p>  Mr. Deering said that "public services are not always as good as they could or should be ... and information is not always furnished".  Does he think that is due to an internal culture or is it due to a lack of information in respect of the requirements?</p> <p>  We have heard from the Minister and from what Mr. Deering has said here himself that we need to reduce the need for FOI requests.  We have heard about a life after FOI and that things should be made available.  That is what we all want but we are very from that.  Anybody who has lodged an FOI request will know how frustrating it is to have half the information is redacted.  We have also seen that senior people are not aware of their FOI obligations.  Indeed, there is an FOI review under way and the whole process was announced in the summer, but we saw that senior members of the Government were not even aware the review was happening until it became a news issue.  I am quite concerned about the level of information and knowledge people have about FOI.</p> <p>  In terms of public bodies, does Mr. Deering think this is as a result of a culture?  Is culture one aspect?  Does he think it is because there is a lack of information?  Mr. Deering made the fair point that some people see FOI requests as an administrative burden.  Could that view be linked to the culture?  How does he see us having a life beyond FOI?  I ask because it is often mentioned in the debate that you cannot compete with that because, of course, that is the dream everybody wants, but we are nowhere near that at the moment.  How does he see that happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#C01300"><p>In terms of culture, I do not think the quality of service or where there is a poor quality of service is a cultural issue because, as has already been stated here today, there are excellent examples of really good services being provided by the public service.  We saw that during Covid but we, in fact, see it many times.  I think it is something a bit more basic in the sense that it really depends on people having champions and having an open mind.</p><p>It also depends upon the fact that when people design a service, it is designed from the outside in and not from the inside out.  It is very tempting if one is working in an organisation to design one&rsquo;s service, not necessarily to suit oneself, but where one is not thinking outwardly.  In some countries there are actual designers where when a new public service is being designed, these people almost represent the consumer, that is, the person who is going to use that service.  </p><p> Many public bodies have started asking what the public wants from their website and not what these bodies themselves want to achieve from it.  Until all organisations consult with their consumers and customers and the people who use their service, listen to them and then design their service to suit them, we will have these problems with quality.</p><p> The reason I am saying that it is not cultural because if it was cultural, it would be across the public service.  We probably have more examples of good service now than of poor service, which allows us perhaps to focus better on the areas where service needs to be developed.  </p><p> Another reason services are not as good as they could be is that we often tend to tack on things.  This happens by virtue of legislation.  An example I mentioned in my presentation is that the Office of the Ombudsman is about to get a significant new role in respect of people being able to make protected disclosures.  I am perhaps going to make a pitch here but the office needs to have the resources to do that.  Sometimes we give additional functions to an office without thinking about the resources that are needed.  One cannot just keep tacking on services and sometimes one needs to do a very fundamental review of the services being provided.  If something is going to be added on, perhaps one needs to step back to ask that if one is designing this today, would one just add that piece or would one just do something fundamentally different?</p><p> I would say that this is more about leadership than culture.  There is a great culture of innovation in many parts of the public service and I know that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is trying to drive a culture of innovation.  </p><p> The other thing that we must link to that also is that we need to be careful about a culture of blame.  By that I mean that if one is going to work in the public service and be innovative, that involves taking risks.  When people take genuine risks, have measured the risks and have genuinely tried to make an improvement and it goes wrong, we need to be very careful not to demonise people when things do not go as they should do.  There will be mistakes and problems in any walk of life.  For me, the important part is that people learn from any mistakes like that, learn from any developments and improve their services accordingly.</p><p> On reaching the utopia in respect of FOI, where people put information up, I believe we are going to have to persuade such people from a very practical point of view.  There are two elements to this.  One is the ideal of what we should do and the culture of openness and transparency, which we have got to keep promoting.  We also have to take, however, a very practical approach and persuade people that not giving this information is not in their best interest or the most efficient way to run their business.  There are two approaches to this.  It is the cultural thing of doing this because it is the right thing to do but there is also the idea of doing it because it is the practical thing to do and if we can demonstrate - and I believe we can - the amount of time that goes into dealing with a FOI request.  We can ask the person who has now released all of that documentation under FOI to one person or requester, what was to stop the person who has received that request putting that information up on the website the day that that document became a document or was created, or whatever the case may be?  I fully accept that there are areas such as tendering where there are measurable sensitivities and that not everything can be put on a website or made publicly available, but if it can be given out on FOI then it could have been put on the website in the first instance.  I come back to the fact that I will concentrate on the areas where it is public and not obviously personal information that people are seeking under FOI.  </p><p> The position is different in different bodies.  FOI is around for a long time, as am I, unfortunately, and I remember when it was introduced where people saw it as a kind of intrusion into the work of that body.  We have moved passed that and I certainly hope that we have.  We need to get rid of any last vestiges of the notion that people asking a public body for public information is somehow an intrusion.  It is not but is an entitlement, is good governance and is how we should go.</p></speech>

I will not name these but this is something that is very much seen as a given.</p> <p>  One other thing that Mr. Deering said there is that there is the culture of champions championing the importance of FOIs, which is something that people go above and beyond in their own work to ensure that is the case.  How will Mr. Deering, in a practical sense, try to move away from that culture of relying on individual champions towards it being something that people realise is very important and want to assist with?  This is my first question.</p> <p>  My other question on the FOI issue is that Mr. Deering welcomes and was glad in respect of the eventual giving of jurisdiction to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office over complaints from people living in direct provision and that this will form an important area of work for the office.  Does he have the data on how many complaints were received by this office by people in direct provision, which would be of some interest and is very important?  </p> <p>  He stated that he wants to have a strong focus on ensuring that the voices of people who might otherwise be missed or not heard are responded to.  How is he hoping to do that in a practical sense?  </p> <p>  I have one further question on the protected disclosures Bill, also, Chairman, if I may also have time to come in on that, please.</p></speech>

I do not have these numbers because I am still part of the nomination process and do not have any such internal information on the office itself at this stage and, therefore, cannot answer that question.</p> <p>  On the question of how we move from champions to making this a daily reality, I might take a slightly different approach by saying to the Deputy that I would want to make the Secretary General of the Department, the chief executive of the council or the head of the body the champion.  That is what I need to do.  I will be engaging at the highest level with all of these organisations.  We need to convince those people, not the FOI officer.  The Deputy may be referring to the FOI officer who is the champion already and who is trying to fight this battle alone.  I will be engaging at a more senior level to deal with the leaders of these organisations.  I do not believe it will be solely just a matter of winning hearts and minds.  If it was that easy, we would have done it already and the Deputy alluded to that earlier.  It is also about providing hard evidence to these organisations, showing them the benefits and demonstrating to them that not alone is this the right thing to do but that it is also the sensible and practical thing to do.</p> <p> There are two elements to the giving of a voice to those who do not have one already.  One is the outreach that is done by the office.  I mentioned in my presentation that the office has a very good track record of doing outreach and the office used to go to many places around the country.  Sadly, that has not been possible in the past two years.  When it did do this, that included going into the direct provision centres and such areas.  Hopefully, there will be life after Covid-19 and we will be able to resume that.  I know that the office has plans in place at the moment to do a hybrid version and outreach is one part of that.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s office's own initiative investigations are also a key part of this.  We should recognise that many of the people who do not currently have access to the office, for example, people going through the asylum system, even if they are given access to the office may not automatically engage because many of them will have come from a part of the world where they cannot trust the public bodies or the formal structures they deal with.  We will need to be able to engage directly with those people and go to where they are rather than hope that they come to us.  We will also use investigations and produce reports in this regard.  </p> <p>  The real thing here is if we can put in place investigations and reports that benefit hundreds or perhaps thousands of people rather than just deal with an individual complaint that solves the problem for just that person or four or five other people.</p></speech>

I have heard concerns from whistleblowers and academics and from transparency campaigning organisations that certain provisions in the Bill on public service disclosures could lower existing standards and that by introducing that stepped procedure for disclosure and restrictive conditionality for allowing a worker to make a disclosure to the Minister is regressive.  As the Ombudsman will be aware, protected disclosures cases can take years and take a real toll on people.  Going to the Minister was one way that could add pressure, raise awareness and speed up the process.  That will now be much more difficult.  Does the Ombudsman agree that that is a retrograde step and if he does not agree, can he outline why he thinks it is not a retrograde step?  I thank Mr. Deering.</p></speech>

As a nation, we have, unfortunately, a history of thinking that somehow speaking up is wrong.  The new Bill and processes and procedures that are being put in place are an opportunity to develop a better culture of speaking up, and will comfort people, give them support and let them know that it is the wrongdoing that is wrong.  It is right and okay to speak up when people see wrongdoing.  From that point of view, it is a positive development.  I do not have a firm view on the question the Deputy asked at this stage.  I would like to think about it.  I believe the processes that are being put in place and the additional step are positive developments.</p></speech>

My concern is that we are adding to the hoops that people who are making protected disclosures have to jump through.  They cannot go directly to a Minister.  I appreciate that Mr. Deering wants us to have a think about it but I wanted to add my concerns so that they can be included in the thought process.</p></speech>

I have no doubt he will give the role his best.  He mentioned direct and indirect discrimination and the housing given to refugees the day they arrived in the country.  There was an attempt to settle a number of families on a semi long-term basis.  There were objections to that on the basis that, presumably, they were not welcome in an area.  How do we deal with that?  I assume from the Ombudsman's opening remarks that he intends to deal with those kinds of issues.  I strongly agree with him.  We should expect to be able to treat those who come here to seek help in the same way that we would like to have been treated when we had to go in the opposite direction.</p></speech>

The first answer to his question is that it is extremely important that people in the asylum process are brought within the remit of the Ombudsman.  That has not happened yet.  There is a commitment to it, but it is something that needs to be addressed.  If they are not within the remit of the Ombudsman, there is very little the office can actually do.  I fully agree with the sentiment the Deputy expressed.  The Irish diaspora comprises something like 80 million people all over the world.  We need to be able to accept people.</p> <p>  This morning we heard about a judge from Afghanistan who came to this country.  She expressed her delight at being treated well here.  She would prefer to be a judge back in her own country.  It is important that we understand that when people come to us to seek refuge they have very often come through a very difficult situation and background.  We need to be welcoming towards those people.  The only way the issue to which the Deputy referred could be dealt with is by giving that remit to the Ombudsman so that my office can examine complaints into area.  That is the solution.</p></speech>

In recent years, there has been an increase in the numbers of people sleeping rough on the streets, which is a terrible blight on our society and a reflection of the way we deal with people in difficulty.  It is not a reflection on any individual or institution.  Rather, things have drifted in that direction through a variety of circumstances.  When people are found to be in that situation a method needs to be found to ensure that ample provision is made for them.  We cannot force people off the streets, but we can encourage them and provide them with their own keys to their own hall doors, which is something they want anyway.  There are ways and means of providing facilities to support those in such circumstances while, at the same time, society is seen to address an issue.  To my mind, things that are happening are a reflection on society.  Some will say this is not our business but we believe it is our business and we need to do something about it.  I suspect the Ombudsman thinks likewise.</p></speech>

I fully agree that how every citizen and person living in the country is treated is our collective business.  I am careful to talk about citizens and people living in the country because I am conscious that there are probably half a million people living here who are not citizens and are entitled to the same rights.  I agree with the Deputy that, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we will be judged in the future by how we deal with those who are less fortunate in society.  I do not want to come here and pretend that, as Ombudsman, I will address all of the very difficult problems that have been there for some time.  I hope to deal with individuals in those areas and, if necessary, examine whether our own investigative reports are required in the area and encourage public bodies to do all that they can to deliver for those people.</p></speech>

Our economy has grown remarkably over the past 50 years.  We are probably the only country in Europe to have achieved such an increase in population and economic development.  That creates new openings.  It also creates a better way for Irish people to consider the global situation.  We live in a global economy and environment.  The right to travel throughout the European Union is sacrosanct.  Unfortunately, as the Ombudsman noted, that right is not entirely observed in the true letter and spirit across all European states at the current time.  We need to impress upon our European colleagues in every way that we need to apply the rules as they should be applied and not as people would like to apply them in particular situations.</p></speech>

I begin by acknowledging his predecessor, Mr. Tyndall.  I also sit on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and we recently had a strong engagement with Mr. Tyndall in respect of his report on those aged under 65 being placed in nursing homes and the very incremental movement on that.  I would like Mr. Deering to elaborate on that.  He expressed an interest in following up on the recommendations that have been made, and I would love to know what form that would take.  I will let him address that and then look forward to new areas.</p></speech>

In terms of the follow-up, I am conscious that a lot of what I am talking about here is work that is ongoing in the office and is not something new that I will introduce.  I am very conscious that staff in the office follow up.  For example, they work with people in the HSE.  We are all conscious of the situation the HSE finds itself in at the moment.  Staff will follow up with the HSE on the work being done to deal with sensitive areas where people are at the end of their lives.</p><p>We know from the report that in the past conditions were not optimal in hospitals and places like that.  It is reassuring that quite a few hospitals and similar organisations have put in place a number of steps so that people can have the dignity they need at such a difficult time.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the report on people aged under 65 living in institutional settings.  I am involved in a charity where there was a congregated setting of people.  We had been working very hard to try to get those people out into the community but the impetus required just was not there.  All of those people have recently taken up their own homes.  There was no reason for the vast majority of them to be in a congregated setting other than this is what happened traditionally over the years.  It is about engagement.  My office will constantly engage.  I will endorse and support that.  We will not let them go off the boil, for want of a better way of putting it.  We will be seeking reports from those public sector bodies as to what they are doing to implement these reports.</p></speech>

I would like to speak to a number of the cross-cutting areas and then I will finish with a number of specific issues I hope Mr. Deering might consider.  I am sure there are many issues coming his way.  A concern I have heard a lot from very different areas and places is in regard to the information component of Mr. Deering's role, including that in the move to <i>gov.ie</i>a lot of information has been vanishing.  In parallel with some Departments moving over to <i>gov.ie</i>, sources of information, documents, explainers and so on that were previously available are vanishing such that people, in particular civil society, and individuals are finding it much harder to source documents.  They are getting only an oversimplified summary.  Finding out where something is coming from, the policy on it, what it tracks back to or the meeting where this or that happened is becoming harder.  This relates to a general issue around the digitalisation of the archiving as a public information source and right in terms of accountability of Government and departmental information.  That is a cross-cutting piece, but a really serious concern.  I hope Mr. Deering can address it.</p><p>Related to that, I want to highlight another issue.  We have talked about hoping to move past the point of always having to use freedom of information.  FOI will always be needed, but we might not need it as much.  Another area where people are having to use a long, cumbersome process, unnecessarily, is in regard to data subject access requests.  This is about the difficulties that people are facing in accessing their own information.  I will not go into the detail of GDPR.  I am aware of the existence of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Data subject access requests are tools under that data protection process.  It strikes me that in respect of a lot of those issues, there is a pattern of people having to use this methodology to access this information they should be able to freely access on request and, as such, not overburden the Data Protection Commission, which we know is under pressure at EU level.  That strikes me as another area of concern.  There are two areas where I can see that as being very relevant, that is, in the engagement with Tusla in regard to the 1989 directives that are superseded by GDPR and in regard to the autism files in respect of families with autism that were held in the HSE.  That damaged a lot of trust.</p><p>I ask Mr. Deering to address those two cross-cutting issues and then I will come to my final questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#F00300"><p>As the Senator has rightly identified, a number of the areas she has spoken about are in regard to data and access.  As such, they are matters for the Data Protection Commissioner, but there is an overlap.  Individuals can also get some of their personal information under FOI.  This is a bit like an issue we discussed earlier.  There is a need for a cultural change, but also a practical change in terms of realising that this is information that people are entitled to.  The more difficult one makes it for them to get that information, the more difficult one makes it for the public body and the more resources everybody will expend on the area.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall openness, I am glad to note that there is some work happening on OpenGov and that a new consultative group is being created in that regard.  I welcome that.  I would be very willing and happy to work with that group.  The Ombudsman and Information Commissioner has a very real role, as does the Commissioner for Environmental Information, in deciding what can and cannot or should or should not be released.  I take the Senator's point that we are almost losing when we are getting to that stage.  Bodies should not have to be dragged through that in order to get them to release information that should be released.  To return to what I was talking about earlier, I believe there is a body of work that we can do around persuading public bodies that have that information of the benefits of releasing it.  They need to do it because it is what they are supposed to do, but there are benefits to them in the long run in doing that.  As I mentioned, I will be engaging with the heads of the various bodies to try to achieve that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#F00400"><p>The area of <i>gov.ie</i>is one that might need work in terms of that argument.  Mr. Deering mentioned that he will be focusing on information that will be public information.  However, I believe that in his role as Ombudsman there is other information that he should or might need to have access to, including in regard to tendering and commercial sensitives.  I am conscious that there are areas, for example, in regard to direct provision, where access to financial information might be important in terms of the Ombudsman properly exercising his role.  Is Mr. Deering confident that as Ombudsman he will be sufficiently empowered to access that information, when it is relevant?  That leads to a wider question on procurement.  Mr. Deering mentioned public bodies.  We know that the public duty on equality and human rights applies to procurement and to those who are delegated or given a contract to perform and deliver public services.  As Ombudsman, Mr. Deering's access in those situations is really important.  I ask him to elaborate on whether that right of access is sufficient.  Does it need to be strengthened or is it about exercising it in a very strong way?</p><p>I mentioned direct provision.  I want to highlight a particular area.  Mr. Deering mentioned asylum seeking and that process.  An issue that has been coming to my attention a lot recently, and in respect of which there have been a lot of publicised cases, is that of LGBT asylum seekers who are facing impossible burdens of proof.  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has rightly said that the expression of sexual identify is not homogenous.  People are being told that because they did not attend a gay club in a country in which to be gay is a criminal offence they have not demonstrated their sexuality.  That is a pattern.  I ask Mr. Deering to comment on his role in, for example, those areas where we are seeing very poor practice not only for individuals but poor practice of support in terms of appropriate and inappropriate burden of proof.  LGBT is one area that has come to the fore in that regard.  I had many more issues I wanted to highlight, but that is probably enough for now.  </p><p>I welcome that Mr. Deering will be working with those harder to reach groups.  Prisons and homelessness services, as highlighted by Deputy Durkan, are areas where investigation can be really important because the power dynamics can be significant.  I add my voice to the calls for greater resources to ensure that protected disclosures move rapidly through the Ombudsman's office.  I concur with the concern expressed.  I agree that the ministerial route should still be available because those are situations wherein when somebody has made a disclosure he or she is not in a neutral position after doing so.  That person can be in a vulnerable position and so a delay in action is not simply a delay in the positive; it creates a negative potential space.</p></speech>

In terms of the access to the information as in the Ombudsman or the Information Commissioner having access, the legislation provides that the information must be given to the Ombudsman.  It would not be sufficient for a body to say to the Ombudsman that particular information is sensitive commercial data.  It would be for the Information Commissioner to decide that.  That information would have to be furnished and the Information Commissioner can decide whether it is commercially sensitive and whether it should be released beyond that.  This is a matter which, if the legislation was being reviewed, I would be happy to consider further and to offer further comments on.  I am satisfied that power is there at the moment.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned asylum seekers and, in particular, LGBTQ asylum seekers.</p><p>It is important to point out that even when those areas come within the remit of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman cannot substitute his or her decision for that of the Minister or the competent authority.  The areas the Senator describes are grey areas.  They may fall within the competence of the Ombudsman or they may fall within the decision.  I take the Senator's point that it is not realistic to have a list of requirements that are very easily achieved in this country for somebody who lives in a regime where something that is perfectly legal, right, moral and acceptable in this country is deemed, for some reason, to be illegal in another country.  You cannot expect people to have the same evidence or documents.  The reality is that people living in some of these countries have to hide whatever the issue is that causes them to leave the country.  It is therefore very difficult to have documentation to prove that.  That is an area you would have to look at carefully to see if it is part of the decision-making process or maybe maladministration.  I will give the Senator an on the one hand and on the other hand answer to that.</p></speech>

I want to stress that there is a whole legal framework around procurement and there are challenges people can take in that area.  Maladministration is a broad concept.  It is not, as of itself, ruled out under certain circumstances.</p></speech>

We are used to Mr. Deering being a guest of our committee, but today he is with a different hat on, and I look forward to working with him in that new capacity.  I take this opportunity to thank him for the engagement we have had during his role as the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, particularly in the passage of my legislation where we got rid of the seven-year rule and allowed people to access the office of the ombudsman, be that in regard to insurance or other financial banking products.  That was a successful engagement and good legislation that has had a good effect since.  I thank him for his personal engagement and the engagement of the office.</p> <p>  A lot of ground has been covered.  I have some specific questions to ask Mr. Deering and then I will make a more general point.  We have a situation where public bodies often cite the low level of appeals in freedom of information, FOI, cases and they signpost that this suggests the regime is working well.  All too often, when appeals are taken to the Information Commissioner, as Mr. Deering will be aware, those decisions are overturned, and this would indicate the regime is not working as properly, in the first step, as it should.  In the event that an appeal is successful, should the application fee be refunded to the applicant?  Should the Department or public body be required to publish information on FOI appeal refunds?  This would bring more light to the fact that a certain body that is refusing FOI requests is having them subsequently overturned.  It would also be an incentive to individuals to take an appeal if they believed the fee would be refunded by the Department.</p></speech>

I agree that we cannot necessarily make assumptions about the low level of appeals.  It comes back to some of what we talked about earlier.  We have to try to get these bodies to put the information on their website in the first instance.  I agree with more information being available and there being more transparency in the number of decisions refused and the reason for that.  All that information needs to be available.  When I take up office, I hope to be looking at whether there are trends and bodies that are refusing more than others, as the Deputy referred to.  The office will have a lot of information and detail in that regard that we can examine and see where the problems are.  Honestly, I am not informed enough to give the Deputy specific answers to those particular points until I get my feet under the desk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#G00600"><p>That is fair enough.  I am signalling an area at which we would like Mr. Deering to look.  I welcome his comments that he will take that matter under consideration.  It also seems strange to me that public bodies go to great lengths to gather data.  They get those data, collate them, clean them and prepare them in a publishable format, but often they do not maximise this by bringing all the different data sets together.  It is fine if a person knows where to look and where to go and all the rest, but we do not have joined-up data in this State.  A concrete example of this would be the public procurement data on <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>.  If these data were connected to other publicly available data, for example, company information contained in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, ownership data in the register of beneficial ownership, court data such as judgements, bankruptcy, and data published by the Central Bank on disqualified directors, it would make it far more accessible to the public in relation to information.</p><p>We have a new data sharing service Act that was passed but has not yet been enacted.  We know the Government got money from the recovery and resilience fund from the EU that will go towards a shared government data service centre.  Many companies in the private sector are already creating this service for individuals.  They are using the public data sets that are available in different places and doing as I suggested.  Should the State not also be doing this kind thing?  It does the heavy lifting but does not reap the benefit.  We got frustrated in Leinster House.  We could not access <i>kildarestreet.com</i>.  I do not know if the site was down or if it was blocked here or whatever.  The Oireachtas has its own website, but most Deputies use <i>kildarestreet.com</i>because it is more user-friendly, and it is not publicly funded.  The point is that the information is available but it needs to be collected, joined together and presented and made available to the public in an easy to use way.  Is this something that Mr. Deering, as the Information Commissioner, would look at not just in making the data sets available but joining them and, crucially, making them available in an easy to use format that is searchable and accessible to the public and that you do not need a masters degree to figure your way around it.</p></speech>

The problem we suffer from is that so many different organisations have grown up with different systems and legacy systems.  There is a world of difference between where some public bodies are in terms of the IT and data management systems they have.  It would be ideal if all those systems would talk to each other.  It is a big project.  Everybody will know that any IT project undertaken will be a big project.  There have been developments in recent times with central management of information.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform now has an information officer for the entire Civil Service and public service generally.  There are moves in that area and there are major projects.</p> <p>  The simple answer to the Deputy's question is that I would like to see it happen.  In practical terms, a lot of work needs to be done, but we need to agree that is where we need to go.  Anybody developing a new system or doing work in the area of information management can aspire to move into that space.  The issue is a bit like what I talked about at the start regarding the quality of services people deliver sometimes.  It is not necessarily always a cultural thing.  It is to do with when that service was developed and whether it was added to piecemeal.  Part of the problem with the public service and some of the private sector as well is that they are dealing with legacy systems that cannot talk to each other.  It will take a considerable amount of investment, but that does not mean we should not be aspiring, planning and aiming to get there.</p></speech>

It can be a big project.  I also know from the commentary of those behind<i>kildarestreet.com</i>that they are not doing it at a huge cost.  There are fundraising efforts and all of the rest of it.  The Oireachtas website has improved in the last period, but it would be interesting to know for how many Deputies the Oireachtas website is their first port of call as opposed to <i>kildarestreet.com</i>.</p><p>This is about the information that is already there and joining the dots.  There has to be a starting point.</p><p> Just to tie this up, I put in FOI requests quite regularly.  I would usually send in one each week.  There is no doubt that there has been a change in terms of FOI requests over the last period.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, talked about the frustration in terms of getting documents back that have been redacted.  The most frustrating thing is when you have to wait six weeks, maybe an extension of time, and then you just get blacked-out sheets back, which is just taking the piss to tell you the God's honest truth.  If they are not releasing any information because it has not been provided, then they should tell you straight away and indicated that there are other ways to pursue the information.</p><p> There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  This is not a Covid issue because it was happening before Covid.  I do not have any data and am just going on the basis of my own situation in this regard.  It is very rare that FOI requests are dealt with within the original timeframe.  Extensions of time are usually applied in respect of requests.  In some cases, they are being extended over and over again.  That is extremely frustrating.  What can be done in this regard?</p><p> I wish to refer to a particular case and I am only raising it because it was a public issue.  I refer to when FOI requests went to a certain Minister looking for a particular document that we knew said Minister had because it related to the leaking of documents by the T&aacute;naiste in respect of the GP contract.  The reply stated that the document did not exist.  We then had the situation where, in a separate scenario, a request was submitted and the relevant Deputy got a response back saying that the document did not exist.  It was a reasonable request looking for information on mobile phone communications.  After details of the matter were put on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the Minister in question released the document two days later.</p><p> There is a big issue regarding public documents.  This is my big concern.  There is a back channel operating in the State.  We have FOI in respect of documents that are controlled by the Department.  That is fine.  We know that documents and communications between Ministers on mobile phones are subject to FOI.  The reality is, however, that they are not being sent on to the Department as they are supposed to be.  If officials are able to communicate with whomever without forwarding that communication to the Department, this means that a horse and cart has been driven through the freedom of information legislation.  Whether the communication is for good or bad, it does not matter.  The public has a right to know.  If they have that kind of channel, which is outside of their official Oireachtas or ministerial communications through Departments' official email systems, it can be an issue.</p><p> Now, we can send direct messages via Twitter, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  I do not know if you can send messages on TikTok.  God knows how many other ways people have of communicating.  If these messages are not being captured by the relevant Department, then there is a back channel that means that the public, even when requests for information are made, will never have access to the communications between a senior lobbyist for X, Y or Z and a senior Minister.  How can that be dealt with?  There are already guidelines in place that are supposed to capture this information.  However, when we ask the Department, basically it has no robust ways of actually collecting that information, which is not personal information.  If the information were in an email, it would be subject to FOI.</p></speech>

He will probably appreciate that I will not comment on any individual case because it is something that could come before me that I might have to make a decision on at a later stage.  I will talk in general terms.  The issues the Deputy raised are linked.  They revolve around resources and taking the FOI function seriously within an organisation.  One can measure an organisation's seriously, as it were, about a function by the resources it puts into it.  If there is a very large Department and a person spends half their time dealing with FOI, one will probably not get the output and outcome one needs.  More than that, the training and the information that are provided within that organisation will determine the quality of the way the information is presented and made available and the way it is actually made available under an FOI request.</p> <p>  The important that I can do as Information Commissioner is to draw attention to any areas where I believe that bodies are not properly resourcing, are not reacting properly and are not dealing requests in time.  Then, obviously, there is the appeal process, where it will ultimately be decided whether something that was not released should have been.  It is not a coincidence that area of most litigation involving the office is where the Information Commissioner would have determined that information should be released.  Then we find that the matter was ultimately appealed to the High Court for decision.</p> <p>  The Deputy rightly pointed out that FOI was designed in a different time.  It started with documents and technical documents that were created in soft copy.  We also had hard copy at that time.  However, we have moved on so much now.  The communication methods that we are dealing with have moved on light years from that.  The legislation being reviewed gives an opportunity to tighten up the areas that the Deputy talked about.  It is a double-barrelled approach.  It may be that there is a need to tighten the legislation and the requirements relating to it - in addition to the role of the Information Commissioner - and ensuring that everything is  adhered to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.633" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021120900002#H00300"><p>Forget about any individual case.  Hypothetically speaking, let us say there is communication by text message - which has been around for many years - between a Minister and a fracking company that is lobbying about a licence to frack.  That is an official document of the Department and it should be passed on.  All Ministers are aware of that.  The problem is that we have FOI requests going in and we get the answer back to the effect that after reasonably conducting a search of all of the various documents, the Department in question has found that no document exists.  What will the Mr. Deering do in a hypothetical scenario such as that, particularly in circumstances where that a Minister then produces the relevant document after public pressure or we find out that it actually exists?  What can the Information Commissioner do?  That is the issue.</p> <p>  I can appreciate the large amount of communication that people are getting and then perhaps not knowing what to send on, what not to send on and all of that.  How can that be tightened up?  As I said, not everybody communicates by email anymore.  There is also the situation where it is just a phone call and you are never going to be able to record that.  How will the Information Commissioner be able to capture that?</p> <p>  It is four weeks for a response, is it not?  However, I do not think I have ever gotten a response sooner than four weeks.  Four weeks should not be the target, as in, at four weeks exactly a Department will give a response.  If the information is readily accessible within the Department, it should be provided within a couple of days.</p> <p>  We are seeing a good example in the Houses of the Oireachtas at the moment on foot of emails we received in recent days regarding information that was previously provided under FOI.  A good example of this relates to former office holders and ministerial pensions.  This matter has been well played out in the public domain and the information relating to it has always been made available.  I have tabled parliamentary questions in respect of this matter in the past and I received the relevant information.  That information was also made available through FOI.  However, now it is not being made available anymore.  We are in a situation where instead of improving transparency, we are in a rearguard action trying to fight for the existing level of access that we had but that we cannot get anymore.</p></speech>

Society includes Government as well.  Government has a duty of care to its people, which it does not exercise very well.  That brings me to culture.  Mr. Deering stated that he does not believe it is an issue solely to do with culture.</p><p>I happen to disagree with that.  I will start on that point.  I believe there is a serious problem with culture in the Civil Service and public service.  Quite frankly, it shocks me.  It is a culture in which the person or individual is easily disposed of in the most awful of ways.  I will give the examples of former garda sergeant, Maurice McCabe; Julie Grace, who worked in local government; the Grace case in the HSE; Sean O'Brien and Noel McGree in the Prison Service; the former garda, John Wilson; Jonathan Sugarman and Shane Kavanagh, who worked in financial services; the females in the Defence Forces; and, most recently, the legacy case in Cork Institute Technology, CIT.  The new president of Munster Technological University, MTU, has refused to meet two Members of these Houses to discuss an issue relating to protected disclosures.  I can name all of those people because these cases are in the public domain.  All of those people represent lost opportunities.  In each of those cases, the individual is no longer with the Department, agency or organisation they complained about.  That reflects awfully on the apparatus of the country, the Government and the Civil Service.  <br/><br/>Let us look at the cases involving the HSE, including the Grace case.  Mr. Deering will be familiar with that scandal.  There are good people in the HSE.  There are good people within all of the organisations I have mentioned.  However, there seems to be an ability to trample over the rights of individuals at the cost of their mental health, lives and so forth.  There is very little being done about it.  I do not want Mr. Deering to comment on these individual cases but I want to outline what I have learned from them.  There was a commission of inquiry in the case of Maurice McCabe.  Julie Grace's case is ongoing in local government.  She is being stonewalled.  The answers to parliamentary questions and her efforts to get at the truth and get a decision have been nothing short of deplorable.  Sean O'Brien's case with the Prison Service again involves a family and individual destroyed by the inaction of the State.  It is the same for Noel McGree.  He won his case but the Department has refused to honour the outcome.  John Wilson was destroyed within the Garda.  Jonathan Sugarman never worked in financial services again after coming forward in line with legislation.  The legacy case I mentioned involving CIT, and now MTU, again involves another career that was absolutely destroyed.  All of these people and more made use of the legislation on protected disclosures.  <br/><br/>I believe that to be a culture.  Anyone rocking the boat is resented and those involved will do anything to protect the <i>status quo</i>.  That is the culture Mr. Deering is up against.  The chairman of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, and Dr. Eddie Molloy have written about this extensively.  Dr. Molloy holds the same position but the chairman has now changed his.  It is also interesting that all of this continues.  Is Mr. Deering confident that he can deal with the culture that has caused all of these lives to be absolutely ruined?</p></speech>

The question I was asked was about the quality of services and whether variance in this quality and poor services were down to culture.  I made the point that, with regard to the delivery of services, I did not believe the issue was entirely cultural because I believe that leadership is also an issue.  I said that the quality of service delivery varies.  I took a different approach with regard to protected disclosures.  I direct the committee to page 6 of my presentation where I said that the changes that are happening "will be an important opportunity to promote a culture, in the Country, of speaking up when wrongdoing is detected and provide support and assurance to those who call out wrongdoing."  In answer to a question, I said that we unfortunately have a culture in this country of thinking that it is wrong to call out wrongdoing.  I believe this has to do with our history.  I made the point that it is actually right to call out wrongdoing.  The organisation I am running before moving to this job was one of the first to introduce an external confidential system and service for people who wanted to call out or identify wrongdoing in the organisation.  We will not get where we want to be until people are able to call out wrongdoing and to be seen as doing something positive when they do so.</p> <p>  I spent considerable time in various different organisations in the public service and I agree that there is and has been a problem but I do not subscribe to the idea that it is endemic and everywhere.  There are really good people across the public service.  Things have been done wrong and we need to deal with that.  We certainly need to nurture people who are willing to call that out as wrong.  I welcome the fact that the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner has been given a role in respect of protected disclosures.  As the Chairman will probably know, I have a background in employment rights.  It is absolutely correct for employees who point out wrongdoing to be protected.  Lest I give the impression that I was saying that this is not an issue, it is.  The Chairman has mentioned high-profile cases in which it has been an issue.  It is wrong for anyone to be in any way disadvantaged for doing the right thing and pointing out wrongdoing.  We should actually thank these people because they solve a lot of problems.  If we listen to them, engage and hear what they are saying at an early stage, it can be of great benefit to an organisation in avoiding serious detriment arising from wrongdoing.</p></speech>

It will be a comfort to those listening in today to know that at least someone recognises this.  I hope that those within the service that inflict pain on and disrupt these people's lives will recognise that change is absolutely needed and is being encouraged.  In Mr. Deering, we have someone who will champion the change that is necessary to bring about a situation in which these people are acknowledged as being helpful rather than obstructive.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  In terms of resources, while I know Mr. Deering is not in the job yet, I am sure he has examined the issue.  I have followed his career.  He is thorough and forensic in what he does.  I admired him in his previous position because he showed great humanity and compassion and was willing to go the extra mile.  People know that about him.  With regard to his leadership role, looking at the Office of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and all of the other responsibilities attached to it, does he believe he has sufficient resources?  In restructuring the office, will he be able to live within what he has?  Given the new additional responsibilities, increased investment in the office may be needed.</p></speech>

Looking at it, it is a very broad office, with not many staff at the moment.  We will have to look at resources, particularly now given the new responsibility the Chairman just mentioned in respect of protected disclosures.  I mentioned that we cannot keep giving responsibilities to organisations that are already stretched and hope they can do more with the same resources.  People have come through a very difficult time when there were cutbacks, which were necessary and essential, but if we want quality we are going to have to resource it.  It will take me a little time to figure out what the proper resourcing level is.</p></speech>

I have seen another case where the family came to Ireland in 2000 and all the family members now have naturalisation certificates and are Irish citizens, except the father, after 21 years.  Somebody said something about him.  Nobody will tell him what was said about him, so there is a lack of information in terms of that individual trying to deal with his case.  That is wrong.  If there is something there, individuals like him should be told.  He or she should be given the information so that at least he or she can prove it to be wrong, or accept it and move on, but to leave somebody in limbo with the statement "I know something about you" is truly the wrong way to do business and is a reflection on the state that we are in.  I hope that in dealing with that area, Mr. Deering will deal with the most vulnerable cases, the ones that are outstanding and need to be checked on.</p> <p>  To return to a question that Deputy Doherty asked, it is a question of the Ombudsman's office being able to hold to account on issues Secretaries General and Ministers who are heads of their Departments.  I encourage Mr. Deering to be fearless in that.  He is at a point in his career where he can be fearless.  He has built up a degree of respect that I do not think anybody will challenge.  There are times when individuals such as him have an even greater contribution to make to the State because of the length of time he has been around.  That is a positive.  He knows where the graveyards are, where the bodies are and the attitudes of people, and if any one man knows what needs to be done it is his good self.  With those few comments I want to end on a positive note and repeat that his work on financial services is noteworthy and has been very positive for many people.  He has been a breath of fresh air in that area.  He is bringing a new dynamic to this particular office.  In line with his opening statement and the discussion we have had, he will certainly be supported in the course of his duties, but be not afraid.</p></speech>

The Chairman awakened some memories that I forgot to whinge about first time around.  I could write books about the number of cases where refugees have been put on the long finger and tagged along with bits of information here and there.  I have a particular gripe about one issue and that is GDPR insofar as it applies to directly elected Members of Parliament.  I objected to it on the first day it was announced and introduced.  I have no problem with people who are not elected Members of Parliament,  For instance many of the parliaments throughout Europe have members who are appointed to parliament, and that is fine.  However, I object to people who go before the electorate and get directly elected by the public, who then find themselves questioned as to whether they have the permission of the constituent to ask the question.  I reject that out of hand.  The sooner we can do something about it, the better, because we got the global permission of the public on the day of the election to ask any question we like.  In actual fact, to show how ridiculous the situation is, if I wanted to write to complain about somebody, would I have to go back to the person concerned and ask permission to make representation against him or her?  I find it frustrating and annoying on a regular basis.  It was not supposed to happen in regard to Departments but occasionally it pops its head up there as well.  It is not at all unusual to be questioned, in the very first instance that you make the call, as to whether you have the permission of the individual concerned to raise this question.  I answer that by saying I do not need the permission, nor does any other publicly elected representative.  I hope Mr. Deering will bear that in mind.  It happens to be my gripe.</p> <p>  Another issue the Chairman referred to is officials within the system who actually watch parliamentary questions when they come in and say we will give that Member the old long-haul dragged out reply that is not answered.  I will regale Mr. Deering some other time, when we have more time, with some of those.  It infuriates some of us who know that within the system is a pot of information that an official will not give out and will not respond under any circumstances to the question being raised.  That is my gripe; I do not require an answer.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>The business today is engagement with representatives from the WAVE Trauma Centre.  We visited the centre recently and met its chief executive officer, Ms Sandra Peake, and a number of participants in its activities.  We were profoundly impressed by the evidence they gave, the very strong human suffering they have suffered, the need to get closure and the need for all of us to ensure that at least they can bury their loved ones.  Everybody is entitled to that human treatment.  I welcome Ms Peake along with Ms Anne Morgan, Mr. Oliver McVeigh, Ms Dympna Kerr and Ms Maria Lynskey.  I understand that Mr. Michael McConville, a member of the family of Jean McConville, is also present.  </p><p> Before I ask Ms Peake to make her opening statement, I remind witnesses that the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precinct are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precinct and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not neither criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person or entity's good name.</p><p> I now invite Ms Peake to make her opening statement.

We appreciate that there are many challenges regarding Covid.  While we would have much preferred to have met with members face to face, we know the importance of remaining safe so we thank the committee for agreeing to have this online session with us today.</p> <p>  WAVE has been in existence for 30 years and I have worked in the organisation for the past 26 years.  During this time, I have been privileged to have worked with the families of the disappeared - those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried as a result of the Troubles.  The experience of having a loved one disappeared has been harrowing for the families.  They have faced many challenges since the abductions and, above all, their wish is to see their loved ones brought home for a Christian burial.  I am delighted today to be accompanied by several of the families.  I am accompanied by Maria Lynskey, whose uncle, Joe Lynskey, was disappeared in August 1972 and whose body has not been recovered.  I am also joined by Dympna Kerr and Oliver McVeigh, whose brother, Columba McVeigh, was abducted from Dublin in October 1975.  It is believed he was brought to Bragan bog, County Monaghan and despite searches there by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains, ICLVR, he sadly has not as yet been recovered.  We are also joined by Anne Morgan, the sister of Seamus Ruddy.  Seamus was disappeared in France in 1985.  His body was recovered in May 2017 following a number of searches.  Finally, we are joined by Michael McConville.</p><p>His mother, Jean, disappeared in 1972 and she was recovered in August 2003.  <br/><br/>One of the most powerful aspects of the work with the families of the disappeared is the solidarity of the families in supporting each other.  Even when their own loved ones have been found they continue to support those who still wait and still yearn.  I am going to hand over to the families shortly but before I do I will make some general comments on legacy due to the current situation in which many individuals bereaved and-or injured find themselves in today.<br/><br/>One of the most challenging issues currently affecting those bereaved is the question of legacy and the direction of travel of the British Government.  This has retraumatised, it has brought heartache to families and it has raised key issues around worth.  For example, why is my loved one's death not being addressed, why is the state saying that his or her death no longer matters, and why are they telling those who perpetrated my loss that they are no longer of interest to the state?<br/><br/>Over my time in WAVE, I have engaged with families whose loved one's deaths were being investigated by the RUC, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Ombudsman, the legacy unit in PSNI and specialist investigative teams such as Operation Kenova.  It is important to state what the bereaved have been asked to make concessions in support of the Good Friday Agreement, including the early release of prisoners; a limit to a two-year sentence; and an <i>ad hoc</i>process to address the legacy of the past.  It is clear that at times the priorities that were adopted in legacy were politically driven.  Now, once again, there is a proposal that the bereaved will have to make concessions again if this goes through.  The effect on those bereaved has been colossal.  Many have spoken about feeling that they have been rewounded and that their loved ones have died all over again.  The expected direction of travel is both morally and ethically wrong.<br/><br/>Legacy can be addressed.  We have seen that in our work with families engaging with the Operation Kenova that is led by Jon Boutcher.  The Secretary of State keeps stating that there is no alternative to the statue of limitations but that is simply untrue.  There is an alternative but the Tory Government needs to find a process that provides an amnesty and protections for a number of soldiers, and refuse to accept the processes that work today for families.  We need the international community to stand with us on this.  The US Administration was a firm supporter of the peace process.  The Irish Government also needs to hold firm.  I urge all members to fully address the deaths that also happened in their jurisdiction.  It would be beneficial if a legacy process operated across Ireland given the cross-jurisdictional issues that arise.<br/><br/>The second point I want noted today is support for the injured.  The injured pension has been made available for those who were injured in the Troubles who live within the United Kingdom.  Those who were injured in the South of Ireland but who are not UK citizens are not eligible to apply.  We urge the Irish Government to address this issue and ensure parity.<br/><br/>I will return to the issue of the disappeared and why we are here today.  Disappearing individuals is quite simply one of the cruelest acts anyone can commit against families.  It is  the families who continue to suffer, yearning and longing for the return of their loved one&rsquo;s bodies each day.<br/><br/>The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains, ICLVR, appeared before this committee a month ago.  The commission does sterling work and its people are amazing.  However, the ICLVR relies on information.  We urge anyone who has the information regarding the whereabouts of any of the disappeared to provide it to the ICLVR through the channels available or go to someone they trust so that the information can be passed on.<br/><br/>The ICLVR and the parameters around its work is one of the success stories of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is one of the processes that has worked.  However, it is information led and that is what is required.  The ICLVR has the specialists, equipment and funding but need information.  The families of Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Lisa Dorrian need to be able to bury their loved ones and lay them to rest.<br/><br/>On behalf of all of us, I thank the members of the committee for inviting us to join them this afternoon.  I am now going to hand over to the families.  First, Ms Lynskey will say a few words and she will be followed by Ms Kerr, Mr. McVeigh, Ms Morgan, and Mr. McConville.</p></speech>

We, universally, support her and the families in this regard.</p><p>We will call the witnesses in the order suggested by Ms Peake.  We want to listen empathetically.  If the witnesses have questions, each party will then respond.  We rotate members' speaking slots at every committee meeting.  Today, the speaking order is as follows: Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, SDLP, the Green Party, Labour, Independents and Aont&uacute;.  I want the witnesses to feel confident they will have an appropriate hearing and to reassure them that they will have the opportunity to ask questions.

I am the niece of Joe Lynskey.  My uncle disappeared in 1972.  He was in his late 30s or early 40s; I am not too sure of his age.  For 38 years, we have known that he is one of the disappeared.  His mother and sisters died and my father died.  He has one sister left, who is now 86.  I would love to have the opportunity to tell her that her brother is coming home.  The past 11 years have been a nightmare for us.  We knew other families, who lived close beside us, who had family members disappeared.  We knew the anguish they were going through, but we did not realise we would go through it ourselves.</p> <p>  There is not a lot more that I can say.  The members already know the story.  I am asking for some sort of information so that all the families can get closure on this.  I hear politicians saying all victims need to know the truth.  Our truth is very easy; all we need is the location.  The information can be handed over to the commission.  We need know nothing about it and nobody will be prosecuted.  What more can we do?  That is all I can say.</p></speech>

I quite understand how she feels.  Obviously, her family and relatives have been through a trauma.  If we can help in any way, we will.  All the parties in the South, and most of the parties in the North, who are members of the British Parliament, are represented on the committee.  I will move on to Ms Kerr, followed by Mr. McVeigh, Ms Morgan and Mr. McConville.  After that, we can go round the different groups, if that is all right.  I invite Ms Kerr to make her statement.  She is welcome.</p></speech>

Columba was a young man of 19 years of age when he was disappeared.  He was one of my younger brothers and the apple of my mum's eye.  I can cope with the fact that Columba has died.  Like everybody else, we cope with death.  The part I cannot cope with is his remains are lying in a bog and have been there for the past 46 years.  We do appeal after appeal for information.  The right people are not listening to us.  We really need help in getting it out there to the people who know the answers so that they can pass the answers on to the independent commission and let it do its job.  We know the commission has a good success rate.  If it gets the proper information, they will find Columba.  The only thing that we want now for Columba is to give him a Christian burial and to put him in the grave beside our parents.</p></speech>

The last time we met, I maybe got a bit carried away but maybe not.  I spoke from the heart.  We are all waiting and I feel the same way as my sister sometimes.  We talk about parties who can help, and the committee can help.  We appreciate every bit of help but it all leads back to one party and one group, that is, Sinn F&eacute;in, the provisional movement and the republican movement, who can garner this information and make an effort to get it.  Talk is cheap and we can talk all day but we do not need talk.  We need actions.  It needs to be brought to the highest possible level in Sinn F&eacute;in.</p> <p>  It is never spoken about by Deputy McDonald in the D&aacute;il.  I never hear it mentioned and have never heard any reports.  A question was put to the deputy First Minister during time with Justin McNulty from the SDLP and she fudged it.  She probably knows me personally but fudged the question and did not want to answer it.  She talked about it in a roundabout way.  It has never, I presume, been brought up at the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis.  If it is such a blight on their future and on the past, why can they not go to the efforts to make sure all the disappeared are found and get it out of their hair?  We will not stop until we find the other bodies.  We just want a Christian burial.  We want to bring them home and bury them like everybody else has the right to do.</p> <p>  I urge members to keep pressure on the right people.  The information that comes through, if there is any, from when I have been talking to the commission members on and off is that they need direct involvement with the people giving information rather than through an interlocutor, which is what is happening.  That is like Chinese whispers.  I tell someone and someone tells someone else.  They will come on quicker and better with information if they get it directly from the people.  These people have nothing to fear.  They can be totally anonymous.  We do not need or want to know them.  If the bodies are found, we will be the first people to thank them.  That might sound silly, but we will be the first people to thank them.  As Ms Kerr said, we can come to terms with the death, but we cannot come to terms with not putting them in the grave.</p></speech>

I am a sister of Seamus Ruddy.  Seamus had been disappeared in France in 1985.  We waited 32 years before we found out where he was.  On 6 May 2017, I was in France and Seamus's body was found.</p><p>His remains were in a forest.  We had been to the location on two previous occasions.</p><p> Since the forensic team was put in place in 2005, we had a more professional way of searching for the disappeared.  When I came home after the 2008 search, when his body was not discovered, I knew that, in forensic terms, the team had done so much to try to find him.  I came away content in one respect because I knew the team members had forensically searched for him, but to no avail.  They were very close when they searched in 2008.  They were only three feet or four feet away from him when they finished their search.  The search in France lasted four days.  We did not have a very long time to look for him because there were many technical issues in the context of the French authorities.  On our last search in 2017, the whole team came over.  All the men and excavators were there.  We had a sniffer dog and as much forensic equipment as we needed to find him.  On Saturday, 6 May 2017, he was found.</p><p> In one way, it is very bittersweet because you are celebrating the death of a person, which is very unusual, and also celebrating that he has been found.  My heart goes out to the families who are still waiting because I know what it is like to get word that the remains had been found and he was on his way home.  That is what happened.  He returned to Ireland and was buried with my mother and father.</p><p> What is important is that while I was trying to get information, I spoke to men who were not directly involved in his killing but who were in the organisation that killed him, namely, the INLA.  I contacted them directly, went to meetings with them, discussed what I knew about it and they told me what they knew.  I found that aspect extremely beneficial.  I could look straight into their eyes and say "Please help me".  I knew then that those men would help me, and that is what they did.  They put their heart and soul into it.  That process went on for about two years.  I met them here in Newry - out in the open in the lobby of a local hotel.  It was not a private meeting or anything.  That helped me an awful lot because I knew those men would try their best and that is what they did.  Direct contact with those who may have been involved or who were around at the time or who knew people who were around at the time would bring this forward.  Initially, there was a reluctance on the part of the people to whom I was talking to engage with the commission.  If contact could be made through another type of intermediary so that people could talk to them, that could benefit the families.</p><p> It has been great to be able to go to the grave and know that he is in it.  For the first few months after finding him, I used to go to the graveyard.  I was very worried because I thought that someone would take him away.  It sounds a bit daft, but I was under the illusion that I might lose him again.  Having spent 32 years trying to find him, I did not want that to happen.  I tried my best anyway.  He is here and I am only getting used to that now.  It is a slow process accepting that I have now found him.  The work of the commission has helped me a million times over.  Its cost does not even get close to the price you would put on what it does.  I do not believe it has a price.</p><p> The Irish Government has stood by the families of the disappeared.  It has looked after us.  It is the one we should be congratulating and letting know that we have benefited.  The other families that are still waiting will benefit from this.  We just have to keep on asking for information.  By coming to this committee, it means that we are keeping this part of the Good Friday Agreement alive.  If possible, we will be with the committee again and, hopefully, we will have found the others.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

She received hope by communicating with people who may have been closely linked with those who murdered Seamus.  She can never find happiness, but she can find closure, and the respect shown to her and her family is important.  Our job as politicians is to make sure that we can assist her as much as possible in getting that closure.  While it is impossible for us to put ourselves in her place because we are not in her situation, we understand as best we can not only her pain and suffering, but also the closure she has got by the finding of his remains and their return and burial in a place that is sacred to her and her family.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. McConville to address us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael McConville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021120900002#H00300"><p>I am the son of Jean McConville.  My mother was taken away in 1972.  I was only 11 years of age at the time.  I witnessed my mother being taken away.  I know the importance of getting the body back.  I would like to see the remaining bodies coming back to their loved ones.  It is nice to have a grave to go to to visit your loved one.  It is the right of everyone to have a Christian burial, not to be put in a bog or anywhere else.  It is important that all of the others get their loved ones' bodies back.</p> <p>  The 31 years of a nightmare that we had as children and as we grew up into adults not knowing where our mother was buried or where she was and all the stories that we were told by different people saying that she had run off with people and so on were the things that we had to live with.  It was thrown in our faces.</p><p>It is important that the Irish and British Governments do all they can to get the rest of these bodies back.  When it first happened to us, I thought we were the only people it had happened to.  Then I started meeting different families at WAVE and realised that we were not the only people it had happened to and that our mother was not the only person this had happened to.  It is very important that everybody else gets their loved ones' bodies back.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

Those contributions have been very emotional for me to have heard for the first time at this committee.  I cannot begin to understand the pain and trauma that they and many families have had to endure over the years.  Of course, the pain and suffering are further compounded by the fact that they have not been able to locate the bodies of their loved ones in three of those cases - four including Lisa Dorrian.  The issue of those who were abducted and secretly buried is a terrible legacy of the conflict.  This generation of republicans are trying to undo the wrong that was done.  As a result, 13 of the 16 people killed by republicans have been recovered.  However, as we know, there are three remains that still have not been recovered, including Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac, as well as Lisa Dorrian.  I would use the platform of this committee to urge anyone out there who has any information to bring that forward and make it known.  That would be the consensus of everyone in the committee today.  If anyone has information they should come forward and make sure it is known.</p> <p>  I also take this opportunity to commend WAVE, under the leadership of Ms Peake.  She has been remarkable and over the past 30 years the organisation has provided group support and care for many families that have been bereaved or are victims of the conflict.  I note her remarks about the British Government's command paper in respect of the amnesty proposals.  It is striking that there is united opposition from victims, survivors and political parties right across this island.  I do not have many questions but what impact does Ms Peake feel these proposals will have on the overall process of reconciliation?  I thank the families for giving up their time to be with us today.  This is an opportunity to highlight the cases and encourage anybody with information to make it known and to come forward.</p></speech>

The committee will hear the bell in the background, so I apologise because I will have to go to the Chamber.  When Columba McVeigh was killed in 1975, I was a young child growing up in Mayo.  I heard the pain and distress when we went to the WAVE centre.</p><p>I thank Ms Peake for hosting us at the WAVE centre.  That was a valuable discussion.  We heard at first hand from the witnesses.  I commend the witnesses and the work that they have done over the years.  This is a good opportunity, albeit painful, for the witnesses to reach out again to ask once more.  All the mechanisms are in place to resolve the situation regarding the three remains that have not yet been recovered.  We must do everything that we can.  Every individual at this meeting today will do that from here on.  I know great efforts have been made over the years.  I appeal to anybody who has information, however significant it might be, to bring it forward to the commission.</p><p> We heard from Ms Anne Morgan about the relief that meeting directly with members of the INLA and people who could give that information brought.  That should prompt anyone who would deny that to one of the three families who are waiting to question him or herself.  The witnesses are not asking for anybody to be prosecuted or for anything other than the remains of their loved ones.  We all know how important funerals are.  I was at two family funerals last weekend, in London and in Birmingham.  To have to wait 50 years to bury your loved ones is not right.  I think that everybody will come out of this meeting with a renewed focus on what we can all do, whether it is in Mayo, Cork, or any other part of the country, to try to bring some kind of relief to the three families who are still waiting.  I hear what Ms Maria Lynskey said about her sister being 86 years old.  Time is not on her side in this matter.  I want to give the witnesses an opportunity to come back in.  I thank them all for being here today and giving their contributions.  We can never understand but meetings like this maybe help us to understand a little better than we do.</p></speech>

Let them bring this to the top table and take the lead on this.  It is okay for people to come to this meeting to urge people to bring forward information.  We need this to come from the top, from Mary-Lou McDonald and from Michelle O'Neill.  I urge Ms Begley to go back to do that.  Talk is cheap.  I am sure Ms Begley has this at heart.

There is a detrimental impact for families, which we see today, with rising referrals of the bereaved coming into WAVE and people who have never tapped into services before coming in for the first time.  They are distraught.  They include, in particular, those whose loved ones were killed between 1986 and the Good Friday Agreement.  Those cases were never looked at by the Historical Enquiries Team, HET.</p><p>Some people were happy with the Historical Enquiries Team, other people were unhappy and others were left with questions arising from the process.  Those whose loved ones' deaths had never been re-looked at between 1986, which is when the Historical Enquiries Team ended its work, and the Good Friday Agreement is the group I see is particularly struggling through the processes currently.</p><p> There are three other points in relation to this.  The first is that we are handing it to the next generation.  I used to deal with the parents.  I used to deal with Vera McVeigh, if you want even to think of the families of the disappeared.  It is now Dympha and Oliver who are taking this forward.  Sadly, many of the parents in WAVE have died.  We have buried five people in the last two weeks alone.  Patsy McAteer, Ann's sister, was buried two weeks ago and a month ago, Michael's older brother, Archie McConville, died.  That is indicative of what we are seeing.  We are seeing many families losing their loved ones and it is the next generation who are taking it on.  We are merely handing the trauma of the past to the next generation but without an understanding of what the context was like at that time.  People who lived at that time know how manic it was and know what the systems were at that time whereas young people are looking at it devoid of that.  They are looking at it solely on the facts and that is an entirely different relationship.  I can see that in the transgenerational link.</p><p> It is fair to say there are still paramilitaries operating.  We are still seeing families affected by paramilitaries, whether it is on the loyalist side or the dissident republican side.  Quite simply, this will embolden paramilitaries to say that they will get away with this and they will not be held to account.  It is a damaging message for our society moving forward.  Nobody wants that for their children.  They want to move forward in a process of peace and they do not want to be held back.  The recent report yesterday of paramilitaries shows the problems of that when we look at the independent reporting mechanism.  There is a clear issue about emboldening paramilitaries.</p><p> The third point is it undermines the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to remember that many families voted in favour of this.  Fundamentally, it undermines the basis of that if we are now saying to families, once again, we are removing this from the table.  You are taking away the small glimmer of hope that families had.  We do not have wholesale families here expecting prosecutions but we expect them to know that the rule of law stands and that there should be a proper Article 2 compliant investigation into their deaths.</p></speech>

It has been said by Sinn F&eacute;in that, through its assistance, the remains of a significant number of people were recovered, of the 16 who were murdered.  Does Sinn F&eacute;in have any view as to what should happen now?  Is there more Sinn F&eacute;in can do, in terms of the IRA, to get this information?  I accept it was a long time ago but there are people alive who must know about it.  You might want to move on in terms of time but families cannot move on until the remains of the deceased are recovered.  If it is a reasonable question, what is the answer to it?  What more can we all do, but particularly Sinn F&eacute;in in terms of the IRA and the people who murdered these people?  I do not know if anybody in Sinn F&eacute;in would like to answer that.  There is nobody answering that, is there?</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to compliment Ms Peake and all her colleagues in WAVE on the outstanding work they have done during the past 25 to 30 years.  They have a great record of advocacy on behalf of people who have suffered and continue to suffer so much.  The presentations made by the family members who have suffered and will continue to suffer so much through the loss of loved ones were powerful and dignified.  Their words encapsulated so well the heartbreak and suffering of families that we cannot even begin to imagine.  On every occasion I have had the opportunity  to engage with family members who have lost loved ones in the most horrific of circumstances, they have always said they want to get the truth and a Christian burial for their loves ones.  The clear message we heard today from each of the representatives who spoke is the importance of having a Christian burial and to know, for example, that a brother or an uncle is laid to rest in a family grave.  It is important for all of us, particularly from the Christian community and other communities, to have a Christian burial and to have the opportunity to go to a grave and say a prayer or lay a flower.  It is part of our make-up and our being.  We cannot comprehend how difficult it must be for a family knowing that a loved one was abducted, murdered and secretly buried.</p> <p>  Mr. Oliver McVeigh and other guests spoke about needing information.  As I did on the day we had commissioners from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains appeared before the committee, I stated that one of the stand-out quotes from the first report that the victims' commission in July 1999 was that anyone with the slightest shred of information on the possible location of bodies should make this known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains.  There are people who have information and it may be more than the slightest shred of information.  As we did on the day the commissioners were with us, we appeal again and endorse every call that has been made for people who have any information to make sure it is brought forward.  </p> <p>  That goes back to Ms Peake's excellent presentation in which she outlined the work of the WAVE Trauma Centre.  Three themes that came through in her presentation were the solidarity of the families of the disappeared and of families whose loved ones' bodies have been recovered who still work and act in solidarity with the families who are still awaiting the return of their loved ones.  It is very heartening to know of that solidarity.  Ms Peake described the proposed amnesty by the British as a re-wounding of families who suffered so much.  It definitely is that.  It is reprehensible any Government could propose an amnesty for the perpetrators of heinous crimes.  I spoke in the D&aacute;il on this issue on Tuesday and the Taoiseach gave a clear response that the Irish Government is absolutely opposed to the British Government advancing such a proposal.  A framework in the form of the Stormont House Agreement has been in place for a number of years to deal with legacy issues and we need to see it implemented.</p><p>Ms Peake spoke about the need to ensure that where there is support for victims, it is adequate, generous and effective.  We will support advocacy groups such as WAVE in their requests to the British Government and other authorities to ensure that proper support is given to victims.</p><p> It was clear from her presentation and the presentation of our other guests that there is a need for information.  The ICLVR outlined clearly to us that since its establishment shortly after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and the appointment of Irish commissioners, successive Governments have provided all the resources and support that the independent commission needed.  Ms Peake reinforced that particular point.  They have the know-how and resources.  Information is the missing ingredient.  Sadly, that information is with some people and whoever has it needs to come forward.</p><p> Ms Peake also made a point about the loss of family members in recent weeks.  Many of the crimes we talk about in the context of legacy issues go back at least half a century.  As time goes on, memories and information will not improve.  The matter was always urgent but the necessity for information to get passed on becomes more urgent as time goes by so that meaningful, comprehensive and adequate investigations can be carried out.</p><p> The British proposal of an amnesty is deplorable.  That would cut off all avenues to getting to the truth with regard to crimes and would put an end to investigations and criminal prosecutions.  It is unbelievable that this type of proposal would be made by a British government.  It is rewounding families who have suffered so much over the decades.  </p><p> I reassure WAVE and the families with whom our guests work that we are anxious to do everything we can to support them.  When we spoke in Belfast, we discussed the possibility of a commemoration in Dublin, a specific day on which we would highlight the fact there are still people who were disappeared and whose bodies have not been recovered.  We discussed the possibility of a day in Dublin that would emphasise that, in particular.   I suggest the committee meets representatives of WAVE at least once a year, if not more often.  We sincerely hope that if bodies are recovered, we will deal with other legacy issues that the centre deals with.  The committee should engage with representatives of the centre and their family members at least once a year to reassure them of our continued support and to get the message out to the public that, unfortunately, there are families who have lost loved ones, whose bodies have not been recovered for more than 40 years.  All I can do is to compliment our guests on their excellent and dignified presentations.  They are making a simple appeal to try to get information and the truth, and to try to recover those bodies in order to afford families the Christian burial they wish for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sandra Peake" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021120900002#N00200"><p>The Deputy made the important point that memories do not improve.  We know that those who were involved in these cases in their teens or 20s are now coming towards the age of 70, in some cases.  Next year will mark 50 years since Ms Lynskey's uncle disappeared.</p><p>If you were in your 20s then, you will now be in your 70s now.  That is where there is a real urgency on this.  This is not something we have time to spend on.  In ten years, the committee will not be coming back to talk to us about it.  Time is of the essence.  Sometimes it is felt that it is only when the families jostle and highlight this that we get a flurry of activity.  We need this to be addressed now because people are getting older, dying or becoming ill - all the various things that happen in life - and we need to find the mechanisms.</p><p> I go back to the point Ms Morgan made.  We urge those involved in this to go back to the start of these cases, assume nothing, look at it as if they are looking at it for the first time and engage directly with the commission.  In Columba's case, they need to go back to the start of what they knew.  In Joe's case, they also need to go back to what they know.  There was a very limited search for Joe in Wilkinstown.  I do not know whether members know this, but Maria was on her way to the search site, believing he had been recovered, when she got a call just outside Dundalk to tell her it was not one body but two bodies and that, therefore, it was unlikely to be Joe and more likely to be Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright.  What a journey to make only to be told that halfway down the road.  However, for Philomena McKee and the Wright family, it was a good day, if we can say that, because their loved ones were returned.</p><p> We have to go back to the start to look at these cases.  There has been limited information on Joe and the searches too have been limited.  As for Columba, wherever he is, he is not where the indications suggested he was on Bragan Bog.  Bragan Bog is one of the most horrific places you can go.  It is four miles up a lane, remote, with no sign of life, cold and barren, with a feeling of true isolation.  We need people to go back to the start and consider this and we need people to engage directly with the independent commission.  I have been involved in these cases for 25 years.  I have sat with families who the commission told nothing more could be done because the people involved were dead, yet they were not dead and information came.  I urge them to go back to the start again and work step by step through the commission.  As Ms Morgan described, she had to make a move and highlight the issue again.  For many people, Columba is just a name, but he was a beloved son and brother and he had all sorts of things he liked and an impish personality.  He annoyed his older sister and his younger brother.  Joe, too, had his own qualities.  I urge those involved to go back to the start, look at these cases from the beginning and engage with the commission directly.  People are not getting any younger and time is of the essence.</p></speech>

If there is any way those of us on the committee can be of assistance as Government representatives, they should please let us know.  We will only be delighted to help their cause.</p> <p>  We have treaded gently around this issue.  This is not to have a go at Sinn F&eacute;in but, in a way, I will be having a go at Sinn F&eacute;in here.  We treaded lightly on the day we met Ms Peake at the WAVE Trauma Centre and we heard the traumatic stories from Mr. McVeigh and others on the day we were there.  Having listened to the harrowing testimonies during this meeting, I have found it somewhat sickening to the see the response from Sinn F&eacute;in since, which was nil.  It is disgusting.</p><p>Any party that calls itself republican, if it truly wants to be a republican party known as republicans, should take that meaning to the very core and deal with these people in a republican matter.  If it wants to be a party that is in government North or South, then it should start taking responsibility where it can.  It should start with its two leaders.  All representatives from Sinn F&eacute;in should go and talk to their leaders and ask them to come out and address this.  It must be addressed.  I do not think members of any other party in the State could sit with their consciences and sleep at night knowing and hearing the harrowing testimonies we have had today.  I ask all parliamentary party members of Sinn F&eacute;in, North and South, to go, for God's sake, and talk to their leaders.  Let us have a proper response to these families who are waiting to find their loved ones.  It is beyond time.</p><p> On the injuries pension, I ask that we call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to perhaps do a question and answer session with us on this.  We might begin that process with a letter to him, ask for a response and maybe invite him before the committee as well, to see if we can deal with the issue from a Southern perspective.</p></speech>

I wish to reflect on the disappointing attendance by Sinn F&eacute;in today.  Normally, we have many more Sinn F&eacute;in attendees at this meeting.  It calls itself an all-island party but it actually has two slots on this committee.  Its members did not use all their time in the first segment and there have been three attendees.  That needs to be pointed out.  If this was such a priority you would think there would be more Sinn F&eacute;in members here.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Michael McConville and Ms Maria Lynskey.  Most especially, I must state that my family is linked to that of Mr. Oliver McVeigh and Ms Dympna Kerr.  My parents knew their family so well.  There were many cups of tea in our kitchen.  One of the last conversations I had with my father before he died this day a month ago was about any opportunity I had to bring attention to their family and bringing Columba home.  Columba is never far from out thoughts and was never far from his thoughts.  As Oliver and Dympna know, he was part of the eulogy at Daddy's funeral.  I ask them how it feels when the leaders of a party that is so opposed to the amnesty and who talk the talk about truth and justice are holding back the information Oliver and Dympna need.  Those leaders have the power to provide that information and they are not giving it.  How does it feel when they say members of the IRA were not criminals, honour the horrors of the past and justify the past?  I also want to know whether our guests feel there is still a culture of <i>omerta</i>, silence and coercive control within that organisation and if that is a barrier to getting the truth.  I ask the Sinn F&eacute;in members who are here what they personally are going to do about it, if the information is not forthcoming.</p></speech>

When it comes to debates about nationalist victims, Ireland's future or Border polls, Sinn F&eacute;in members are here in force.</p><p>They are organised, professional, they have their questions ready with the order of speakers and they fill both slots.  Sinn F&eacute;in has two slots whereas the rest of us might get a second slot if time comes around.  Today, however, Sinn F&eacute;in is not here.  I remember sitting beside John Finucane MP on 18 November at a similar meeting with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, and it was the same thing.  Mr. Finucane spoke for four minutes and left the rest of the two slots vacant.  As I was listening to &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley today, it was interesting that she used the exact same words.  I would invite anybody to go back and look at that.  This generation of republicans wants to do something different, 13 of 16 people have been recovered and there are three that remain.  They then move on to the next issue about legacy and then are happy to move on.  It is deeply disappointing and cynical that this is the approach taken when, as members of the committee, we see the alternative approach that is taken by Sinn F&eacute;in on so many other occasions.  I do not have any difficulty in saying that it has to be observed.</p><p> It was such a privilege to attend the Wave Trauma Centre and to listen to its members, including people who are not here today, for example, David Clements whose father was in the RUC and was murdered and Alan McBride who suffered deeply as a result of the Shankill bombing.  It is a privilege to have representatives of the centre appear before the committee.</p><p> I have a simple question to ask.  In their contact with republicans over the years, privately or in any way that they want to disclose, what do they say to the witnesses when they ask for help?  What is their experience?</p></speech>

I thought at the time that they were trying their best to help me but it got to the stage where, at one of the last meetings, the person I was meeting more or less wanted to fight with me.  That was the reason why they shut the meetings down that I was having with people.  I wanted the IRA to turn around and admit that they were wrong in murdering our mother.  They were blaming our mother for being an informant, which she was not.  It was proved that she was not an informant.  She was a widowed mother of ten children.  What would she know?  She never went out anywhere to find out information about these people.  I found out that most of the stuff they told me was lies.</p></speech>

At the time, Charlie Armstrong's body had not been found and Gerry Evans's body was not found.  Their loved ones were scared to speak out about this.  I spoke out about it and this person turned around to me at the start and said "You think that the IRA knows everything that happens in Crossmaglen and you are blaming us for taking Gerry Evans and Charlie Armstrong away and murdering them."  I said that there were no other paramilitaries down there only the IRA.  I said it was they who murdered them.  I said they could deny it all they wanted and it broke out from there, nearly into a row.</p></speech>

It seems as though we are having a go at Sinn F&eacute;in.  The young Sinn F&eacute;in members seem to be toeing the same party line, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill rightly says.  If it comes when it suits them, they will do it but if it does not suit them they will not be there and they will not put the effort into finding these bodies.  We need them to take the lead.  They cannot be called, as Senator Blaney has said, true republican people.  This is not a blight.  We do not suffer in the same way as other victims of the Troubles.  We are the unusual victims of the Troubles because we are still suffering.  We are going through a 46-year wake, because we are the families of those who have not been recovered yet.  It should be brought to the top table by Sinn F&eacute;in.  They should go and do it and bring it to the table and talk about it openly, not as though it is a blight on their character.  Please get these people to come forward.  Time is not on our side.  We need to do it now.  This is why I greatly appreciate everybody keeping the pressure on now.  We need to keep it on.  We need to keep - for want of a better term and this is a bit crude - our foot on their necks.  </p></speech>

He and my brother spoke to Sinn F&eacute;in and they probably spoke to members of the IRA.  They told us that they knew nothing about Joe and that Joe probably was in England or America.  We actually believed that.  My brother actually called his house &ldquo;the yellow brick road&rdquo;.  We will come back to you; we never heard from them again.  They had plenty of opportunities in 38 years even to let us know that he was deceased.  We lived believing that he was in America.  My brother went to America for a holiday one time and was told he had just missed him and that he had given a speech for the Irish Northern Aid Committee, NORAID.  We were told all these things through the years and then, 11 years ago, Ed Moloney came and told us the truth.  Believe you me, I have had enough of talking to Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>

We think it would be good for people to hear about the number of people involved and, therefore, the information that could be out there.  Things that may have been seen that may not seem important or that people may have buried away themselves could be the key to unlocking the information that is needed.  This is not about bringing someone to justice; it is about bringing people home.</p></speech>

You will never meet anybody who is not involved in politics like myself.  However, the only thing I could say to Sinn F&eacute;in is that Sinn F&eacute;in will come out and call out the British Government about wanting to sweep everything under the carpet.  I have never met anybody from Sinn F&eacute;in.  I am not interested in meeting them.  I am not interested in any apology from them for what they have done to my brother.  However, surely they can see that they are doing the exact same thing to the families of the disappeared that the British Government is doing and they are the first ones to condemn them.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

There are two minutes left in Fine Gael&rsquo;s slot.  May I just say one thing?</p><p>I feel profoundly that everybody wants the families to get closure.  Perhaps through Ms Peake, we might invite members of Sinn F&eacute;in to meet with the families' group in an appropriate setting similar to the one in which we meet them.  Would that be helpful?  We need a plan that is constructive and engages.  Even when this meeting is over, we might enumerate some of the actions we might carry out that would try to bring closure to the families.  That is the key.  </p><p> From a personal point of view, I had an uncle who was killed in the Second World War.  I never even knew him.  He was killed on the last day of the war and fought with the RAF and was shot down off Denmark after the ceasefire and his body was never found.  That had a profound impact, particularly on my mother for all of her life.  The only relief of pain that she could get was going to the Runnymede Memorial in London for the bodies of those who were never found and to put her hand on his name.  That was a long time ago and is a memory from my own family.  There are people alive of my age who were around in those times and I know from the republican movement in County Louth and in other counties who the members of this movement were.  People know what happened and we cannot allow these people not to say what they know.  I say this because I feel so strongly about it.  Our hearts go out to these families because we know how they feel, forgetting the politics but thinking of the humanity of the situation.  </p><p> I also mention Captain Robert Nairac who was, I believe, murdered in my own county.  I do not agree with everything these people might have done but he was a human being, like everyone else, and is entitled to that decent burial and to that basic form of humanity which is the entitlement of everyone.  No one can hide from that fact or should be allowed to continue to hide from it.  My apologies for my emotion here.</p><p> I believe Claire Hanna and the Alliance Party are the next group to contribute.</p></speech>

I can see on the Chairman&rsquo;s screen in miniature but it is coming through fine on mine.</p> <p>  I visited the WAVE Trauma Centre a number of weeks ago and when I left I thought about the whole day.  We heard from three separate victims and families of victims what compounded their hurt each time.  One was the phenomenon that justice is not arriving to people because the people who perpetrated the crime are not choosing to give up the information, which is as true of paramilitaries as it is of the UK Government.  It is also the fact that people&rsquo;s characters are besmirched.  We heard from the Ballymurphy families that they have been painted and pegged as gunmen and women for decades.  We heard from the McVeigh family of people being told that Columba was an informer.  We heard from Paul Gallagher that the man who shot him wrote in his book that he only ever shot paramilitaries and then, by extension, besmirched his character.</p><p>It is that second way of demeaning and degrading victims by undermining who they were and retrospectively creating a false narrative for why killings were carried out.  That is fundamentally worrying.</p><p> We do not have confidence that victim makers will have the good grace to leave victims in peace and not use the blank cheque of an amnesty to justify their own action.  I do not have any questions, other than what other colleagues have asked about how we can support victims and what we can best do in terms of how they want us to bring forward the campaign.  I thank the witnesses.  There is unanimity in the committee on trying to amplify the campaign and generally, to the extent that we can, tackle the legacy issues.  Do the witnesses have any questions for us?</p></speech>

They murdered them, but the likes of me and my brothers and sisters and all the rest of the families of the disappeared did nothing on them.  For 31 years they tortured me and my brothers and sisters on the whereabouts of our mother and what they did to her.  We did not know what she went through before she died or anything else.  Every day of my life, that suffering is all I have.</p></speech>

They ripped our family apart.  I had to be in a home for five years of my life, not knowing my brothers or sisters beside me.  I grew up not knowing them.  They took everything away from me.  My children are suffering because they had no grandmother or anything else.  These people need to know the heartache they caused everyone.</p> <p>  Going back to Robert Nairac again, his sisters and family did nothing to these people.  That says a lot about what they did.  If they were decent people, they should be haunted by the bodies of Robert Nairac, Columba McVeigh and Joe Lynskey, and other people they have not claimed but who they killed and secretly buried.  They need to come to terms with that, admit the truth and do the right thing if there is any decency in them whatsoever.</p></speech>

I echo what other speakers have said and pay tribute to them for their dignity and determination over many decades in trying to bring closure to their beloved family members, find out the truth of what happened to them and give them a proper burial and a place where the families can gather over the years to reflect and remember them.</p><p>I have no doubt whatsoever that there are people on the island of Ireland today who have information that will lead to the recovery of remains.  As others have said and I will stress, those people have a moral duty to come forward with that information and not go to their graves without revealing what they know.</p><p> I will use my time to highlight a couple of other points.  I will reference in particular the case of Lisa Dorrian, which was referred to in Ms Peake's opening statement and to which others have also alluded.  Lisa, because of the time of her disappearance, does not fall under the timeframe of the terms of reference of the commission.  Her circumstances are very similar to those of others.  Her family has also fought a very determined campaign to keep her case alive.  There have been a number of false dawns, including in the past year, when trying to find her remains and discover what happened to her.  The same point about people with information applies to her.  In most of the cases we are talking about the IRA.  In Lisa Dorrian's case we are talking about one of the various loyalist factions in Northern Ireland, but the pain is just the same.</p><p> It is also worth referencing a development in UK law, namely, Charlotte's law.  I appreciate that this may not have any direct relevance to WAVE's cases, but it perhaps shows how thinking is evolving on this issue.  Charlotte's law concerns a situation where somebody is convicted of a murder but the remains have not been found.  That person would not be eligible for release from prison until he or she was fully forthcoming with information.  I appreciate that in the absence of suspects and a criminal process, that type of law will not come into play in WAVE's cases, but it is something worth referencing for the future.</p><p> I appreciate it is not the direct source of our discussions today, but I will stress the absolute importance of ensuring we retain a rule of law and human rights-driven process around legacy.  We have that with the Stormont House Agreement.  The notion of an amnesty or a statute of limitations is not something we should consider.  It is very important that we make clear that there is a very clear distinction between the very limited immunities that relate to the passage of information relevant to the location of remains compared with the forgoing of prosecutions.  The UK Government, in particular, will often use that type of intervention to almost justify or rationalise what it is now proposing as just being one further step along the spectrum of interventions and that what has happened with the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains somehow sets a precedent.  It is important that we send out a very clear message that it does not.  We are talking about fundamentally different conceptions and applications and the two should not be conflated.  I am sure the witnesses will agree with that particular point.  I see Ms Peake wants to come in.  I am happy to pass over to her at this stage.</p></speech>

The pain and trauma are very obvious.  I am at one remove as I sit here listening to stories.  They are not my stories and I am not one who is directly feeling this or who has directly experienced this pain and trauma.  I thank the witnesses for coming and for their bravery in sharing their stories.  I thank Ms Peake and the WAVE centre for the support they provide and the work they do against that background.</p><p>I echo Dr. Farry's point that the rule of law and human rights are of fundamental importance.  There is a right to truth established in the European Court of Human Rights.  The truth ultimately is what the families before us are asking for.  As a committee, we are doing what we can to ensure that truth comes out and to help to heal the trauma and suffering in any way that we can.  </p><p> A question was asked earlier that I am not sure was answered.  I would like Ms Peake to set out what it is we can do.  We can have these sessions and make our appeals for information, but for those of us on this committee, what can we do to support WAVE Trauma Centre in the work it does?  Ms Peake mentioned the pension scheme.  There was a remembrance commission scheme here that paid out mostly once-off payments but my understanding is that medical payments for victims of the Troubles in need of medical treatment are available through the Victims of Crime Office.  There is no direct pension right.  In that regard, further information, even in writing, in follow-up to the committee would be very useful.  Senator Blaney also asked for that information and mentioned that the committee should engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on that issue.  Any additional information the witnesses could send to us that would shed a light on that would be very useful.  </p><p> I reiterate my question as to what we, as a committee, can do to support the important work that is being done in the search for that truth that is ultimately now the human right of the people before us.</p></speech>

For the British Government the commission demonstrates the challenges of believing you will get information.  It is almost 22 years since the legislation went through and Columba McVeigh and Joe Lynskey still have not been recovered.  It has taken 22 years to get the bodies returned.  The committee is not asking Dr. Farry the big questions for the families such as, "When did they die?", "What happened?" and "For how long were they held?".  Mr. McConville referred to the questions; I am just conscious of raising those.  If it was any of our relatives, we would have questions to which we would want answers.  The families cannot get answers to those questions.  They can get answers to questions such as, "Where did you walk them?" and "How far down did you put them?", which is what the commission wants to know.  We have struggled to get that information.</p> <p>  If the British Government wants to say that this type of models works, well then, you get partial information.  You get information you can interrogate and it shows that, for whatever reasons, people or organisations do not want to go back to that in which they were involved in an earlier life.  It highlights that.  Information needs to be interrogated.  When the committee visited, Mr. McBride made the point very eloquently that had the information with regard to the Ballymurphy case not been interrogated, we would still have Ballymurphy relatives labelled today as being relatives of gunmen and gunwomen.  As mentioned by Mr. McConville, the sad reality for the disappeared is that they are still labelled.  That has never been lifted.  Often when you read an article it goes on to say that they were allegedly involved in X, Y and Z.  The reality is some of these people were very young, only 16, a number of them were young men who had learning difficulties and one of them was a mother of ten.  As raised by Mr. McConville, what could his mother have done?  She was rearing ten children.  She was widowed in January and abducted the following December and those children were left.</p> <p>  We have to bear in mind the reality of what is out there.  Senator Currie asked about questions.  What we understand from the commission is that a whole team can be involved in a disappearance, from the scouters to the drivers to the people who dug the graves.</p><p>We need to go back to the start and look at each case from the start.  Something has gone wrong from the start when we have not recovered those disappeared.  We need to go back and that is really important because it is not just one or two people.  </p><p> Mr. Geoff Knupfer appeared before this committee previously.  He does not often share the magnitude of the work he has been involved in but he did talk about his work on the moors murders investigation.  He spoke about the importance of the time of day in terms of where the sun was positioned, the landscape at the time and various other issues like how far up or across the site the investigators went and all of the things that made the difference to locating those children on the moors.  He applied the lessons from the moors to the cases here.  That very forensic approach has worked well.  It has also worked well because people have engaged and given information, which has been so important.  At all of the funerals of the disappeared, the families have acknowledged those people because had they not spoken, they would not have got the information needed to enable them to bury their loved ones.  </p><p> This leads on to the question as to what this committee can do.  We need an Ireland-wide publicity campaign.  We need people to know that the disappeared are out there.  We do not need it to be known today, only for it to go again in January and for us to come back before the committee in May or have to raise it with Senators Currie and Blaney or Deputy Costello or whoever.  We need an Ireland-wide publicity campaign.  We need to keep this issue in the public domain and we need to re-humanise Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey and Robert Nairac.  To have a British soldier in Irish soil in 2021 is unacceptable.  If we are truly concerned about reconciliation, he should be returned to be buried in his family grave in England.  His sisters should be allowed to lay him to rest; that is the right thing to do.  In Ireland we know the significance of burial and the last rites and that is what we need to give people.  </p><p> On the injury pension, we need parity.  We cannot have a situation where people who were injured by loyalist bombs in Dublin are not eligible for a scheme.  If it is not the scheme in the North, it should be a scheme that is similar that will give them dignity by providing yearly sums to enable them to live their lives as fully as possible while dealing with severe injury.  I urge the Government to do something about that.  It is so important and it must happen.</p><p> We really need this committee's help.  We need to ensure that the disappeared are not forgotten.  We need to keep applying pressure and letting people know that nothing will happen if they give information to the commission.  I must stress, and I am sure the families will agree, that the commission holds that confidentiality extremely tight.  It does not tell the families what it is involved in but it does tell them when it has an indication of where it going to go to search.  That is really key.  I do not know whether the families want to say something about confidentiality.  The commission, from what I have seen of its work, holds it very tight.  That needs to be said in order to reassure people.  This is a process that delivers but we need people to speak.</p></speech>

That was a very important meeting and I was glad to see that some members of this committee were also in attendance.  I know that not everyone could make it but nonetheless, it was a very important meeting.  I was glad to be able to attend to hear at first hand the issues facing some of the families.  I am speaking as an MP but also as a cousin of one of the disappeared.</p><p>It is not an easy thing to talk about.  I appreciate the families taking the time to reiterate their stories.  It is unfortunate that they have had to do so time and again.  </p><p> I do not want to turn this into a political matter but I want to reassure the families that I have raised this on many occasions publicly and will continue to do so because the right thing to do is that anyone who has any information, no matter how small if it helps in any way to locate the bodies of the loved ones of the families represented at this meeting, it is important that they come forward now.  There is no point in waiting.  They need to come forward now because the families need to be put out of their misery, for want of a better phrase, because that is what their lives have been.  It has been a misery for them.</p><p> I commend the families on their campaign.  If any of them want to speak to me after the meeting, I have no problem in doing that.  I spoke to Mr. McVeigh very briefly after our meeting at WAVE and I will do so again if he so wishes.  I wish the families well and every success in their efforts to locate the bodies.  If anyone has any information, no matter how small it is, please bring it forward as a matter of urgency so that the families can get peace.</p></speech>

I know Mr. Maskey does not have any information but he has great influence.  He has to have great influence if he is a Member of Parliament or if he gets lots of votes.  I urge him to go forward.  As I told him that night, he should bring the matter to the Ard-Fheis and say openly that the disappeared issue has to be cleared up.  He should go and speak to Mary Lou McDonald about it in the D&aacute;il and go and speak to Michelle O&rsquo;Neill about it.  I am urging him to do all those things.  I will appreciate his help if he does it.  I will meet with anybody as long as results come out of it.  Talk is cheap.  We have talked for years.  We do not need any more talk.  We need results.  If I have to go anywhere to talk, I will go and talk to them, including to Mr. Maskey.</p></speech>

When I was trying to get information I went directly to members of the INLA and spoke with them.</p><p>It was through that that I actually found Seamus.  The information came through two ex-prisoners.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, those men were allowed out of jail.  They carried on with their lives, got on with their careers or whatever else.  Those two men were inside when my brother was killed.  They had nothing directly to do with his murder.  They were not there at the time he was shot.  However, those two men had the information and it is now Sinn F&eacute;in's time to go back to all the ex-prisoners and all the men released under the agreement, get them around a table in a hotel or wherever else and get them talking because that could be the place where that information may be found.  It is appealing to the conscience of those who have had a second chance.  Those men may have this information that goes back 40 or 50 years.</p><p> We as a society need to look at what we have given the republican movement in this country and appeal to it.  Sinn F&eacute;in MPs and councillors are at the front of this but the answers to these problems lie with the background staff, if you want to call it that.  I mean the background members who were there at the time.  Young Sinn F&eacute;in councillors or whatever do not know anything about this so they do not know where to go.  It is now time for them to actually delve into this.  They really need to delve into it and appeal to the members who were members at the time.  They need to get back to them.  At one stage we had a meeting with Gerry Adams and I said it to him, even.  He said people have died.  Granted, people have died and we know that, and they might have been present when our loved ones were killed.  However, it was not the old men of the IRA who dug the graves.  They would have had the young members digging those graves in those bogs for those men who were going to be killed.  These were our sons and our brothers.  Young men would have been involved in the disappearance of any of the disappeared.  Now, 40 years on, we are talking about some people who might be in their 50s, some who might be in their 60s and even, I suppose, some who might be in their 70s.  We have got the 50-year-olds right up to the 70-something-year-olds to appeal to.</p><p> It is time Sinn F&eacute;in put it to its ex-members and reminded the ex-prisoners they were the ones who got the best deal out of the Good Friday Agreement.  The families of the disappeared are still trying to get a good deal from the agreement because three families, plus that of Lisa Dorrian, are still sitting waiting.  You do not know what it is like.  My appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in is to go back and make a concerted effort.  It could let the families of the disappeared know the party is appealing to the ex-prisoners and to those who were members 40 years ago or whatever.  It could let the families know it is doing that.  We are not going to make a song and dance about it but it is about our knowing the party is putting in place and carrying through something that would help with Columba McVeigh and help the families bring their loved ones back and give them a Christian burial.</p><p>I think it is time that Sinn F&eacute;in put it together and helped all these Irish people buried secretly in Irish soil.  My God.  You have to appeal to them and find them.  It is up to Sinn F&eacute;in as an organisation to sort this out.</p></speech>

I have done it before and will do it again.  Following on from the last comments, I will again make an appeal for anyone who has information, whether ex-prisoners or whoever, to bring it forward.

I have spoken to people and if anybody has information, no matter how small, they should bring it forward as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

If it is helpful, I will make a comment.  Mr. Maskey attended our meeting with the republican ex-prisoners group.  That was fruitful but we did not discuss this issue at the meeting.  Maybe we could arrange to do that.  I accept the genuineness of Mr. Maskey&rsquo;s efforts.  The committee will pursue every possible way of getting at the truth of this.</p> <p>  If nobody in Sinn F&eacute;in wants to take up the three minutes left, I will move on.

I offer my deepest condolences to all the families.  It is heartbreaking to hear their stories.  I thank Ms Morgan, Ms Lynskey, Ms Kerr, Mr. McVeigh and Mr. McConville for coming in to share their stories and talk about the reality.  I cannot imagine the pain they have gone through.  We have heard it here but this has been unbelievably traumatic for them.  Their whole lives have been impacted.  The emotion at this meeting is palpable.  Ms Peake shared her story of getting the news of the possibility of finding her loved one and then it was not to be.  It is awful.  I met Mr. McVeigh a couple of weeks ago in WAVE and I am now hearing his story again, and the stories of Ms Kerr and Mr. McConville as well.  The whole thing is very moving and emotional.  I thank our guests for sharing their stories with us.  I hope some information will come out after this meeting that will result in the families finding their loved ones.</p><p>Of course, I am not forgetting Ms Peake, for whose work, and that of WAVE, I have great respect.</p><p> I was going to come to Ms Morgan, if that is okay, to ask her a question.  What was it for Ms Morgan in the end that made the difference?  I was wondering can Mr. Morgan say a little more about how that communication helped her.  That is the first question I have.</p></speech>

I knew that I had to go to places that I definitely did not want to go to physically, never mind mentally.  I had to put myself out there and into the middle of them.</p> <p>  In one case, I and a few of the families of the disappeared went to an ex-prisoners conference in Limavady and I was in a room with a group of men who were all ex-prisoners.  They were from both sides - there were loyalists and republicans.  I told my story.  In that room, there were men who cried.  Now when I am telling my story, I cannot believe that it is that emotive.  At times I will get emotional, especially when I talk about my mother, her waiting for him and all of that.</p> <p>  The ex-prisoners actually were one of my keys to get into finding out where he was.  I did not realise on that particular day that I was talking to men in that room - in a group format sitting around in a circle - who were going to find my brother.  I did not know that.  It was four years before Seamus was found.  I kept asking.</p> <p>  I had a telephone number of a fellow whom I spoke to in 1999.  I did not use that glibly.  If something came up, I phoned him and asked, &ldquo;What was happening here?  I want to find out more.&rdquo;  I was not on his back as such.  I sort of built up an informal relationship with him.</p> <p>  In 2008, I went to France with my sister, Patsy.  Patsy passed away two weeks ago.  Anyway, Patsy and I were there for four days and the forensic team were doing their job.  At the end of the four days, they just said, &ldquo;Anne, he is not here where they said he was.  We cannot find him.&rdquo;  There were men in forensic team who were crying to me but I was so grateful for them having gone there and having done their job so well.  I was in admiration of them for what their skills involved in this process.  I went back to the hotel and met my sister in the room and I phoned that fella, who I had the number for, from 1999.  I called him all the Bs and Fs, and Cs.  All sorts of language was used.</p><p>I just had a pay-as-you-go phone in 2008.  My sister Patsy said to me that during that phone call I was jumping up and down and calling him all the so-and-so's of the day for not giving me the right information.  I was so annoyed with him.  My phone ran out of credit and the phone call stopped.  Patsy said that because of the things I said to him, he would never help me again.</p><p> After a few years, I was speaking with the ex-prisoners and decided I was going to go back to the first man I called.  We met here in Newry.  Ms Peake was with me that day.  She told me to just speak the truth and look him straight in the eye and say what I was looking for.  That is what I did.  My communicating with him directly helped me.  He said to Ms Peake, "You should hear the conversation me and her had in 2008 and all the things she called me".  He got all the obscenities I had in my head.  You would not say things like that to this fella normally, or get away with it, but he appreciated me just speaking from the heart and giving it back to him.  Is that not peculiar?  He said he was glad my phone ran out of money because God knows what else I was going to say to him.  I had formed that relationship with him.</p><p> When Seamus was found, which was brilliant, I had another meeting with this man.  I took him and the two men who were with him up to my house, into the room I am in now, and we had lunch.  Then I took him to the grave.  I said I did not want him going up to the grave in the dark of night or anything.  I wanted to take him and I took them up.  That was a big day for me because it had all started in 1985 when members of their organisation had pointed at me and said "You're dead if you speak about Seamus again; you're dead if we ever hear anything more about him."  I was under the threat of death for all those years and as far as I was concerned, it was not lifted until Seamus was found.  Communication is the key to this.</p></speech>

Mary Lou McDonald has stated quite a few times that all victims need to know the truth.  I have already said this.  Are we, as victims, excluded from this?  Do we not need to know?  The answer is so easy.  It is just a matter of location.  I have had enough of listening to this.  During the dig for my uncle, the information that was given was that there were two bodies there.  Do these people realise how cruel that was to us?  I have never spoken about this because I have to be delighted about the two bodies that were found but you have no idea of what I went through in those ten minutes before I arrived at that location.  I would like to say to Paul Maskey that they have the power to do something for us when information is coming across.  I am as entitled to that as every other victim, and so are the McVeighs and the Dorrians.  We are all entitled to it.  I thank the committee for listening to me.</p></speech>

We deal with quite a number of families who are engaged in Operation Kenova.  It is fair to say that at the start, they were very sceptical about what was a police-driven initiative led by an English police officer who was the chief constable of Bedfordshire police, Mr. Jon Boutcher.  That operation was looking into the alleged actions of an informer who was involved in the army.  People thought that it would be a whitewash or that they would get very little information.  When we asked families at the start what level of trust and confidence they had in the process, we found that it was very low.  They engaged but they did not expect to get anything from it.</p> <p>  Several things make Operation Kenova different from other legacy investigations and engagements with the police, one of which is the fact that it is victim-centred.  Through their actions, those involved in that operation give honour and respect to the person who has died.  Families are made to feel that their loved ones matter to the team.  The team refers to them by name and they get to know the family.</p> <p>  The second issue is that there is continuity.  A big problem with legacy investigations, including those involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is that we are talking about serving police forces in which there is career progression.  Senator Black might deal with me this month but in six months time it might be Senator Currie and in another year, it might be Senator Blaney.   I can be passed from pillar to post continuously.  That is one of the issues.  Under Operation Kenova, however, there has been continuity.  These men and women, the family liaison officers, have built up relationships with families that have continued and the same person has seen them through in relation to their case.  The other issue is that the families have access to the head of the office, Mr. Jon Boutcher.  They all have his mobile number and can go to him if there is a problem.  They do not abuse that access but they have it.  I have never seen any other investigation where a chief constable gives out his or her mobile number and tells people, "phone me if there is anything and I will answer it.".  The investigators have taken the utmost care and sensitivity.  They have acknowledged family difficulties around anniversaries or when there are difficulties within families or when families are being approached by others.</p> <p>  People on this call will know this already but it is important for everyone else to know that some families are smirked at in the street.  The people who were involved in taking their loved ones use their name to let them know they are there.  They stare them out.  There is a level of closeness there in terms of the fact that it could be people who live in the next street or two street's away.  The families might see them at church, at school gates or in the middle of Tesco.  That is what really frustrates me about the legacy proposals.  People do not understand that this is not something that is addressed for some families.  They are living with the victimisation daily; it is continual.  Operation Kenova has been very supportive in that context.  Some of those families have been within that group and Operation Kenova has helped them when they have been approached and have continued to suffer victimisation.  That is really important.</p> <p>  There are files in for prosecution but not all families have files in and families accept that.  I have seen families get information that they never had previously.  These are families that came through the HET process or through Ombudsman investigations and who were told that there was nothing beyond what they already knew.  Operation Kenova  has given them information they never had previously.  The journey for Operation Kenova is as important as the end product.  The British Government is saying that it has not succeeded because there have been no prosecutions but that is only because there are 30 files sitting in our public prosecution office that have not yet been addressed and directions given on prosecutions.</p><p>We have urged the political parties, and we urge the Irish Government, to come behind this.  The Secretary of State keeps saying there is no agreement or alternative.  As this process works for families, everyone should get behind it and support it.  We need to put an end to the Secretary of State saying there is no agreement or that we cannot agree.  Ms Kerr said she is not interested in the politics.  I am interested in one thing only and that is the experience of the families and what they can get the best out of.  They are getting the best out of this so I urge people to look at it.  I ask the committee to invite Jon Boutcher to give a presentation to the committee in order that members can hear from him directly.  This is a process I have seen delivering and we feel it should be upscaled.</p><p> Ms Morgan said that her sister Patsy died two weeks ago and Mr. McConville buried his brother a month ago.  Processes to deal with the past are too late for them now but they represent so many others within our community who are dying daily without the answers they need.  To me, Operation Kenova is the historical investigations unit, HIU, by a different name and it is therefore ready to go.  It is the strands of accountability.  It is about the policy and procedures, and the victim-centred care.  It could readily deliver for families, particularly those who are terminally ill or those who have older relatives who want answers in their lifetimes.  We do not have time on this issue.  This is the last throw of the dice and we need to get it right.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses.  My deepest condolences to Ms Morgan on losing her sister and to others who have lost loved ones.  It is so hard.  I thank the witnesses for coming in today to share their stories with us.  It has been extremely moving.  I cannot even imagine the trauma, pain and heartache they are going through.</p></speech>

I was sorry to hear about the Cathaoirleach's own loss as well.  I know it was a long time ago but pain like that remains within families.  I apologise; I missed the Belfast meeting because I was a close contact of someone with Covid at the time so I had to restrict my movements.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations today.  It is impossible to imagine the grief, loss and torture their families have been put through over that time.  I also thank them for the powerful contributions they have made.  It has been an education.  I knew a lot about these cases and situations but until you see the human face of their impact it is impossible to understand the magnitude of it.  In Meath, we know a good bit about the disappeared because the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee were found in County Meath.  Burying loved ones is a central part of the grieving process, as old as humanity itself.  It is hard to see a greater wrong that can be committed against anybody.  The point we hear over and over again when dealing with victims and survivors is that there is a generation of people who have not long to live and it is important that that information is given to them.</p> <p>  I agree with the pension scheme for victims and survivors of atrocities in the South.  It is not something that is very regularly discussed in the South but we as a committee need to start raising it more in general discussions.</p> <p>  Most of the questions I was going to ask have been asked at this stage.  Ms Morgan's contribution is very important.  I was sorry to hear about the loss of her sister in the last few weeks.  Face-to-face discussions with people involved in these actions are the key to this.  I hear information that there are certain people who are willing to help but there are others who have just drawn a line under things and are not willing to participate in any way whatsoever.  It is hard to underestimate the power of a person sitting in front of another individual as a moral lever, or crowbar, to see what can happen and if the right thing can be done.</p><p>I appeal to anyone with influence in this to see if those face-to-face meetings can happen and that all the details of what happened to those loved ones are made known, not just the locations.</p><p> We often hear that there is no hierarchy of victims.  If there is no hierarchy of victims, those who have had loved ones disappeared are equally as entitled as those who lost loved ones to the Glenanne Gang, the British army or anyone else.  There has to be full equality among victims on this.</p><p> Following Ms Peake's suggestion, I propose that the committee invite Mr. Jon Boutcher to discuss his work on trying to find out the truth about what happened on the past.  </p><p> My next question is not an argument I am making but it is an argument that is sometimes made.  What role has the passage of time played regarding the ability to get to the truth?  What are the witnesses views on that?  Can the independent commission be strengthened in any way to help with its work?</p><p> On the British policy of moving towards an amnesty, has WAVE looked at legal avenues to prevent the British from enforcing an amnesty which in my vie would be contrary to the Good Friday and Stormont House agreements and human rights law? </p></speech>

I am a republican as well.  I am just not an Irish republican in the true sense of the word because I do not want anybody's blood to be shed.  I would have nothing to do with anyone calling themselves republicans if they leave issues unlooked for and unanswered.  We can talk all day about this but it all goes back to the same point.  I say to Paul Maskey and all these other people in the republican movement and Sinn F&eacute;in, at the risk of being crude, that we do not want to talk to the monkeys; we want to talk to the organ grinders, have a meeting with them and see what we can do to go forward.  We are all asking what can be done to move forward.  The way forward is to raise it at the highest level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sandra Peake" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021120900002#EE00400"><p>There was a search for Joe Lynskey in Wilkinstown.  Ms Lynskey said it was 2008 before there was any confirmation.  In 1999 when the list of the disappeared was released it was not complete.  There were others who were not on it.  Peter Wilson and Joe Lynskey were added later in 2008.  One of the difficulties is that there may be people in the area who know something but do not know that it is significant.  I say that because there were four cases in that area.  There were Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee in Wilkinstown, Brendan Megraw was in Oristown and then there is Joe Lynskey.  There has been a search for him in Wilkinstown and a limited search for him in Oristown.  The search in Wilkinstown produced Seamus and Kevin which was good.</p> <p>  The parish priest reached out to the families and that was the first time.  One of the things was trying to take it back into the heart of the community.  People were very reluctant.  They said there was a great shame in the area because this had happened in their locality.  They had farmed and tended to those bogs and cut peat in them and there was an embarrassment that this had happened and those bodies had been buried in their midst.</p><p>They did not know how to reach out.  The first thing for the families was to acknowledge that there was nothing to be embarrassed about.  It was not their fault that the bodies had been taken to that area.  There was something about the fact that they could actually provide help.  We had a blessing of Oristown bog before one of the searches for Brendan Megraw.  That search did not produce anything.  The family of Philomena and Kevin McKee went round with the priest.  Bishop Smith was very good to us at the time.  He has since retired.  He had empathy for the disappeared because he had lost a relative on 11 September 2001, so he knew the difficulties of when people did not come home and could not be buried.  He had empathy with the families.  He went and blessed Wilkinstown.</p><p> I said it to the other families when we were leaving.  We had a warm welcome in Oristown.  People came out to the bogland when there was the blessing there.  That was a major occurrence for the families because they had never met the families and the families had never met them.  They talked about the shame.  On the way home, I asked if they wanted to see where Philomena McKee was.  We went to Wilkinstown.  Local people stopped and talked about some of what had been witnessed.  Somebody had been coming along the road.  They had heard something and described what it was.  Looking back, when Kevin and Seamus were found, there was truth within that.  A man had died but he had told another neighbour, who had passed it on.  There is information in communities that they may not realise is significant.  If the Deputy could do anything to bring it back into the heart of the community, that would help us.</p><p> At the end of the day, those bogs were chosen by somebody who knew the bogs.  They had to know the landscape to know the best place to hide a body.  The information may well lie within the community in some cases.  I am not saying that everybody from the community was involved and do not think that, but that the community might be able to provide some information but does not know that it is significant to the commission.  Anything that the Deputy can do to help us with Joe Lynskey would be welcome.  All we want is his recovery.  There is one thing which I know Mr. McVeigh will say, which made a difference in Crossmaglen.  Charlie Armstrong was in his 50s.  He disappeared one morning on his way to mass.  His neighbour disappeared the year before.  They were never claimed on any list but the families believe strongly that they were killed by the IRA.  They were never accounted for.  One issue was that there was silence in the area.  We went back to do masses in the area.  Crossmaglen Rangers was good at providing some signage at the grounds to let people know that there was a system and process in place.  That was a major help in uncovering those two men, because it was brought to the heart of the community and the community wanted to address it.  Those two men are now laid to rest in St. Patrick's graveyard in Crossmaglen.  We cannot always rely on people who are still living in the area.  They may already have moved out of the area, which is why there needs to be a wider publicity campaign.  Anything that the Deputy can do in the local area would help.</p></speech>

The IRA gave information that our mother was buried on Templetown beach.  My mother was eventually found on Shelling Hill beach.  When they gave the examples of where they went on the beach in Templetown beach, to be fair to the IRA, Shelling Hill beach was similar.</p><p>They say that they walked across a wee stream.  There is a stream on Templetown beach.  There is also a stream on Shelling Hill beach.  The mistake was made by the IRA in thinking that it was on Templetown beach.  In other cases, mistakes could have been made as well.  For example, in 1999, when the first digs appeared down on Templetown beach, we were standing there for 50 days.  We got to know the local people.  They were very good to us.  An elderly man came to me.  He was talking away, beside Templetown beach.  He told me that I should ask them to go and dig on Shelling Hill beach because the IRA had two caravans on Templetown beach when they were on the run from the North.  He said that he could not see them burying my mother on their own doorstep when they were on the run from the North.  That man knew it was the other beach that they were talking about.  I am trying to explain some similar things that could happen in the other cases too.</p></speech>

There are a couple of people who may not have made a contribution yet and who might like to do so.  Senator McGahon, if he is there, can have his say.  We have 20 minutes left.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n wants to raise some separate issues with us at the end of the meeting.  I suggest that we stop at 4.20 p.m., if that is okay.  Everybody will have contributed then.  I take it Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will be happy with that.  After Senator McGahon finishes, we will ask Ms Peake to wrap up from WAVE Trauma Centre's perspective.</p></speech>

I will watch all of the testimony later this evening, from the start to the point that I missed, on the Oireachtas website because it is so important.  While I have not met many of the witnesses yet, I had the privilege of meeting and speaking to Mr. McConville in Belfast a number of weeks ago.</p> <p>  There are a couple of points I would like to make, particularly as, after three hours, many of the questions have already been asked.  When I visited Belfast and we met with the Ballymurphy and Springhill families, I was struck by the blanket of support that was wrapped around them by politicians from every political party and none, by civil society and by the Governments, North and South.  When we visited the WAVE Trauma Centre, we met Mr. McConville and others.  What stuck me was how it paled in comparison when I considered that these were families by themselves, with little or no political support, trying to trudge along with it.  They were not having their cases championed by political parties.  They were not having their cases brought to Westminster, the D&aacute;il or Stormont.  They have been trudging along by themselves on a lonely path for the past 40 years.  That was the comparison.  The reason is because their loved ones were murdered by republicans and people involved in the IRA.  The irony of it is the concept of a hierarchy of victims.  It is trotted out, time and again, that there is no hierarchy of victims.  There bloody well is a hierarchy of victims, and the families of the disappeared are at the very bottom of that ladder as far as I am concerned.  That is as clear as day from listening to the contributions of the family members today.</p> <p>  The first real injustice that was committed was the murder of their family members and the evil acts that they were.  The second injustice that was inflicted on family members of the disappeared was the blackening of their names for decades afterwards and the ostracisation of their families by their communities in order to try to justify why their family members were taken away and murdered.</p><p>The third real injustice is the fact that the bodies of their loved ones have not been returned to them.  I believe those are the three greatest injustices that have been committed against them.</p><p> The concept is what Sinn F&eacute;in can do.  I find it difficult when the same line is trotted out whereby Sinn F&eacute;in asks everyone to go ahead and give information and asks anyone with information to do this.  That is very easy to say.  I am not asking that Deputy McDonald or someone comes out and says that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to do this.  What I am asking is similar to what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked.  There are people in Sinn F&eacute;in today who were IRA gunmen.  There are people in Sinn F&eacute;in today who took lives and murdered people.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, some of those people are not willing to help and have drawn a line under this.  It would be really useful, and we are not asking to make a whole rigmarole of this, if Sinn F&eacute;in went back privately to those people and told them it wants them to do this, that it understands times have changed and events have been forgotten but it wants them to look at this again.  Three people are buried somewhere in cold, dark Irish soil who have not been returned to their loved ones.  Sinn F&eacute;in should say it wants to do this if it is serious about there being no hierarchy of victims.  That is something I believe the Sinn F&eacute;in Party could do.</p><p> I come from Dundalk in County Louth.  Dundalk and north Louth were on the front line of the Northern Irish Troubles for so long and bore the brunt of it for so long.  I think regularly about the family of Tom Oliver, whom I know personally.  When I listen to conversations of family members today, I think the Oliver family must thank their lucky stars that Tom was found.  His body was dumped on the side of a road so at least he could be found and buried.</p><p> I will follow up on what Mr. McConville said.  Again, I know the part of the world he spoke about extremely well.  There is not much distance between Temple Hill beach and Shelling Hill beach.  It shows the importance of what a local person in the Cooley Peninsula to tell Mr. McConville that, based on that information, he was able to provide information about the location of caravans in which members of the IRA used to hide out.  Based on that information from a local person, he was able to provide very useful information.</p><p> When I contribute at committee meetings, I tend to ask questions.  As the final speaker, I felt it was important to make a statement on a matter on which I have had deeply-held beliefs for many years.  Having to listen to the pain and trauma these families have gone through and continue to go through has been one of the toughest moments for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas.</p><p> There is a very simple way this can be resolved.  I am not being political about it.  The point is that if Sinn F&eacute;in, which is in government in the North aspires to be in government in the Republic, wants to move forward towards a shared island in which we can all live, how will it be able to do so when people in its own organisation know where these three or four people are buried and continue to stay quiet?  That is my view on it.  Sinn F&eacute;in knows what it must do.  Empty  words and platitudes are not good enough now.  Oliver McVeigh said he is willing to talk to anyone and wants to do so.  I cannot speak for the families but they just want to find their loved ones and take them home, as any of us, as normal, decent human beings, would.  Let us be decent human beings and make sure these people come home to their families where they belong.</p></speech>

It has been the families standing alone.  We had WAVE behind us alright but it has been the resilience of the families standing alone and making it known that their loved one has been disappeared and buried secretly somewhere.  The Senator brought up the idea of the isolation you feel when somebody in your family has been disappeared.</p><p>Communities and neighbours want to isolate you.  No one wants to speak about it.  Over time, you know the person you are looking for has died but no one commiserates with you.  It is not the same as when a person dies and is buried within three or four days.  People just do not talk about it.  In my case, it was only when my brother was found that the community stood with me.  For 32 years, they all stood silently somewhere away from me.  It was only my close friends and family who were close to me.  The community was away from me.</p><p> When Seamus was found, the local bishop at the time, Bishop McAreavey, said the town had let out a big sigh of relief that Seamus was found.  That was the way it was.  When Seamus was buried, it was a big occasion and a big day for the people to come out and give us support.  However, we did not get that support in the years before Seamus was found.  People were reluctant to openly show they were supporting us.  When you are going through it, you do not realise it is happening and you are being ostracised.  Nobody wants to speak about your loved one being murdered and secretly buried.  No one wants to take notice of it.  It is good that we are able to speak about it before this committee and to let members know that the families are still together.  During our campaign, if we lost family from our local areas, we gained a very big and enriching family within the WAVE organisation.  The Senator made a point about the families being on their own and that is exactly the way it is.</p></speech>

There has been clarity in the manner in which they have outlined the terrible grief and suffering of families.  I said at the outset that we should have a commemoration in Dublin, similar to that held by the families in Stormont each year, to try to keep a focus and create an awareness of this issue.  It would also show that we stand with the families and abhor the fact that the families were shunned by some people in their communities over the years.  As the Oireachtas, we should mark the events.  Perhaps the committee secretariat could speak to Ms Peake about that in the future.  I think we should do that publicly.</p> <p>  Senator McGahon said the D&aacute;il had shown no interest in this matter over the years.  For the sake of accuracy, I want to point out that I, for one, and I can only speak for myself, have raised this issue many times over the years.  At my request, this committee met representatives of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains a number of times and I previously suggested that representatives of WAVE be invited before the committee.  Some of us have raised the issue many times in the D&aacute;il and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

I see Senator Currie wants to say something and I will be happy to take her contribution.</p><p>Before I do, I thank all of our witnesses, Ms Anne Morgan, Mr. Oliver McVeigh, Ms Dympna Kerr, Ms Maria Lynskey, Mr. Michael McConville and Ms Sandra Peake for the fantastic way they showed us what is in their hearts and minds and what will give everybody closure at the end of this awful chapter in their lives, which has gone on for so long.</p><p> Senator Currie has something to say.</p></speech>

I think what the Senator meant was that the people who could do the most did not do what they could do both at the meeting and in the past.  My father was a TD up until 2002.  He arranged meetings with the families of the disappeared and raised the issue plenty of times in the D&aacute;il as well.  As I said earlier, the disappeared are never far from my thoughts and my family's thoughts.  The SDLP and the Alliance Party talk about thee disappeared a great deal, as has the Fine Gael Party, including Senator McGahon.</p> <p>  We do not need the Stormont House Agreement to come to a resolution of this issue.  The people who have the answers can bring them forward to give peace to the families.  I sincerely hope that today's meeting has moved that along and will send out a clear message that the disappeared are not forgotten.  The idea of a publicity campaign is a good one.  Anything we can do to bring peace to the families and bring their loved ones home, we will do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.805" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021120900002#KK00300"><p>Quite so.  Before we finish, I will call on Ms Peake to recap on some of the issues we have to deal with.  We have not told the families this but the committee agreed at a previous meeting to visit the places where the remains are believed to be.  We hope to do that.  We got the consent of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains to do that, which is very important.</p> <p>  I note that Ms Morgan's battle was fantastically fought and eventually successfully won.  We have met as a committee with the republican ex-prisoners and, maybe, through the support of Mr. Paul Maskey and other bona fide Sinn F&eacute;in members of this committee, which I respect, it might be useful to arrange that process, if that makes sense.  The best way to do that would be through Ms Peake, if that is not too much to ask.  That might be a constructive way to engage.  All political parties have to engage.  Meetings between the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in and the families would be very important.  We should, again through Ms Peake, request that Deputy McDonald meet with the families.  Those are the constructive things we can do and I hope we can all agree on them.  If anyone wishes to raise other issues, that can be done in private session in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>  It has been very productive, emotional and powerful to witness the pain and suffering of our guests.  The obvious solution is to find the remains of the disappeared and bury them in a Christian way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-09a.806" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sandra Peake" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021120900002#KK00400"><p>On behalf of all of us, I thank the committee.  We have appreciated the opportunity to appear it.</p> <p>  It has been deeply painful.  I am conscious that Michael McConville's mum's anniversary has just passed.  She was taken 49 years ago.  I always want to remember those who have walked along the way and journeyed, yet are no longer with us.  It was a sad day burying Patsy McAteer recently and burying Archie McConville before that.  Archie always carried what happened to his mum with him right to the very end.</p> <p>  There are a number of things.  Whatever the committee can do for publicity, we ask members please do not forget the families of the disappeared and please let this have a legacy beyond today.  It has been very painful for families to come to the meeting.  Members will have other priorities, hear other cases and have other constituency issues matters of government to deal with but this needs to be addressed for these families.  This is their legacy and there is no peace until we give those families what they rightfully need.</p><p>Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh, Robert Nairac and Lisa Dorrian all need to be returned to their families.  Any other families out there who believe their loved ones have been disappeared also need to have a mechanism to bring that forward and to highlight it.</p><p> We need help locally from members.  I urge anybody who can to help us to do so in their area, such as Senator McGahon with Robert Nairac, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in Meath and Deputy Brendan Smith and whoever else in Monaghan.  They might not realise that what they have is significant, but it could be very significant for the commission.</p><p> We urge Sinn F&eacute;in to please go back to the start and look at these cases and reassess them.  This needs to be addressed.  We have shown that with additional pressure from the families and additional work, we can recover bodies.  The commission has demonstrated that its work only works because the information comes to it.  It is important to acknowledge the information that has come to date.</p><p> Disappearing people is the cruellest of acts.  I buried my own father.  I know where he is.  We can mark and honour his place of burial.  These families do not have that.  Members might not know that the mothers put their sons names on the headstones before they died, handing the responsibility to the next generation.  Anne Morgan's mother put Seamus's name on the headstone.  Vera McVeigh did the same.  The same was done for Joe Lynskey.  Brendan Megraw's mother did the same.  That is very powerful.  Imagine having a headstone with a name on it and no body in the grave.  These families need the bodies to be returned.</p><p> People are getting older and it is getting harder.  Those with information are getting older and it is getting harder.  We need a push on this now, not to come back in a year's time to say we have made no progress.  We need help.  As the circle is getting smaller, it is becoming harder for the families to wait.  Oliver McVeigh always says that.  He says that when they were part of a bigger group and lots of people were disappeared, somehow it was a bit easier but as the circle has got smaller, the families are asking if they are going to be the only people not to have their loved ones returned.  That has become very hard.  That is said within the solidarity of support that is provided by WAVE and through the families of the disappeared, who are an amazingly supportive group.  I urge members to do everything they can in terms of publicity and policy to help the families and to not forget about them.</p><p> Regarding the injured pension, the legacy for the injured is to be looked after with dignity in their older age and to have respect and dignity.  I urge members to please move that forward to ensure equity.  I ask members to continue to push on the issue of legacy because that is hurting families.  It is painful.  Families are distraught at the thought of what may come.  I urge committee members to do anything they can, individually and collectively, and to please continue to do it.</p><p> Members are welcome to come to WAVE at any time.  The families wear a little badge, which is a little forget-me-not designed by Anne Morgan.  I will send some of them to the committee and when they are next in, I would ask them to wear the badges in solidarity with the families and in remembrance of them.  People will ask what they are and then that allows us to open up the discussion and to ensure this is not forgotten.</p></speech>
