    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#NN00200"><p>The purpose of this part of the meeting is to consider the motion re Fisheries (Commercial Fishing Licences) (Alteration of Duties and Fees) Order 2022, which was referred to this committee by both Houses on 25 January 2022.  I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his officials, to this meeting.  I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#NN00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to come before the joint committee today to discuss the motion.  The motion seeks the joint committee&rsquo;s approval for the Fisheries (Commercial Fishing Licences) (Alteration of Duties and Fees) Order 2022, which prescribes the licence duties payable in respect of salmon, eels and oyster commercial fishing and dealers' licences that fall to be issued or renewed in 2022.  Commercial fishing for eel is currently not permitted, in line with Ireland&rsquo;s eel management plan approved by the European Commission under EU Regulation 1100/2007 due to the perilous state of the stock.  The European eel is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN, red list as a critically endangered species.</p> <p>  In keeping with Government policy and the commitment first given in 2003 in front of the then joint committee, adjustments, if any, were to be applied in line with the consumer price index, CPI.  However following the reduction in licence duties in 2010, in response to the then prevailing economic circumstances, no adjustments, either increase or reduction, have since been recommended by Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, for approval of Ministers regardless of increases in the CPI.  It was always envisaged that the licence duty levels prevailing before 2010 would be restored.  Hence the recommendation of IFI is to restore the duty level to pre-reduction levels in as far as practical.</p> <p>  Since the cessation of mixed stock fishing in 2007 in line with scientific advice, commercial salmon fishing is limited to only those rivers with stocks that are exceeding conservation limits.  This licence duty restoration will apply to wild salmon, oyster fishing and dealers' licences.  The proposed restoration of duty levels for commercial fishing licences is consistent with my decision in December last year to restore the duties on certain categories of salmon rod licences as set down in the published Salmon Rod Ordinary Licences (Alteration of Duties) Order 2021 and the Special Tidal Waters (Special Local Licences) (Alteration of Duties) Order 2021.  The proceeds from the sale of salmon licences, both rod and commercial, amounts to &euro;900,000 per annum with the vast majority attributed to the rod licence duty.  A 50% component of all licence duties collected in respect of both commercial salmon fishing licences and salmon rod licences is ring-fenced to be invested in salmon stock rehabilitation and habitat improvement providing ecological and conservation dividends for the stocks.  </p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention and I trust that the committee will recommend that the Oireachtas should pass the motion approving the licence duties for 2022.</p></speech>

I call Deputy O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I seek clarification regarding the potential consequences for eel stocks, are licences for commercial fishing for eels being provided for?  Why are eels referenced in the opening statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#NN00600"><p>The licences are there on a statutory basis but are not being issued.  In 2009, there was a ban on eel netting and exploitation of eels was introduced because the stock was in crisis.  Across north-west Europe stocks were at 1% of what they would have been under pristine conditions.  It is a north-west European stock.  It goes to the Sargasso Sea.  It does not come back like the salmon to an individual river so it is particularly at risk.  It has a very long life cycle.  An eel will take 30 years before it will migrate down river.  We also have issues with a number of obstructions on rivers that make it perilous but there is no exploitation or catch of eel.  Eel fishermen to bring eels upstream and across dams, but there is no catching and exploitation of eels.</p></speech>

I do not expect the Minister to have this information now, but he might revert to the committee later.  How much money are we putting in, in total, to improve the ecological and conservation dividends for the stocks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#OO00200"><p>The budget for Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is the key agency, is &euro;30 million.  That is an annual application.  The annual revenue of approximately &euro;500,000 adds to that but is not the key element.  Of that &euro;30 million, some &euro;20 million is for salaries, particularly for fish protection personnel who monitor what is happening in the rivers.  We will have to look at this in connection with what we are doing on the national land use review and what work the GSI and the EPA are doing in regard to the scientific assessment of our river basins and of our water quality.  Inland fisheries is one of the areas where we need to look again and invest further to use it as the measure, particularly of water quality.  Salmonid species, in particular, are highly sensitive both to water temperature and pollution.  We are at risk of both.  The EPA's assessment that the rivers in the south east known as the three sisters have been fully saturated with nitrogen and phosphate is a warning call.  One of the best ways of monitoring, measuring and getting local community involvement and engagement and an understanding of the quality and health of our rivers is by monitoring, assessing and protecting the health of our salmonid fish stocks, in particular.  They are the canary in the mine, if we are not mixing metaphors, because they will tell us whether their environment is in pristine condition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#OO00300"><p>I thank the Minister.  To be clear, is he agreeable to increasing the investment and resources in fisheries so that we get those outcomes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#OO00400"><p>That is part of the budgetary process.  My general assessment is that one of the key projects for this Department and this Government is the scientific assessment that will underpin our land use plan.  Critical to that is the issue of water quality and biodiversity levels within our rivers, lakes and marine areas, particularly as part of the land use plan.  In that regard, the work of Inland Fisheries Ireland is important not only in its own right but also to complement what the EPA and the GSI are doing, and what we are going to have to do to get the land use plan right and act on it to improve the natural conditions in our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#OO00500"><p>I thank the Minister and call Senator Higgins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#OO00600"><p>I will follow up on the point about the 50% reserve and the question of what the other 50% might be earmarked for.  If I understand correctly, that 50% goes to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  As the Minister mentioned, the other complementary part - the work of the EPA - is very important.  Perhaps it would be appropriate for some of the other 50% of the revenue generated to be earmarked for the work of the EPA in regard to water quality in specific areas.  The Minister mentioned the intersection with the land use plan.  Marine protected areas are going to be very relevant, especially as they intersect with tidal waters.  Would it be worth considering the earmarking of a portion of the other 50% of revenue raised for the work of the EPA and for work that might be needed, perhaps for a specific time period, in regard to the land use strategy and the development of the marine protected areas?</p><p>On a related issue, one of the key issues relating to licences is the level of stock that is in place.  This was highlighted recently in respect of Cork by fishermen.  There was very serious concern that unless we have better monitoring and regulation of sonar and noise activity in our waters, it is likely to have a detrimental effect on fish stock.  That may affect future sea fishing quotas but also future licences.  To what extent is the Minister engaging with his Cabinet colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the development of regulations in respect of sonar activity in marine areas that may impact on fish stocks and in terms of the habitats directive?  Ireland has responsibility for the implementation of the habitats directive within our exclusive economic zone, EEZ.  I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on that.  I think it will affect both the quotas and the issue of future licensing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#PP00400"><p>Indeed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#PP00500"><p>What we learn through ecology is that everything is connected.  There is a connection in the marine.  One of the biggest challenges with salmon as a species is what is happening in far distant waters off Greenland where the salmon go for their feeding and development before they return and those changes and everything that happens on the way, be it a fish farm with the whole issue of sea lice or military or other matters.  The most sensitive aspect in that regard relates to cetaceans with the sonar effects on them being particularly acute.  We work with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  Coming back to what the Senator said about our inland waters, the water quality issue is something for which they have the key responsibility.  The EPA is the enforcement agency.  It is critical that there is good connection and good swapping of information, analysis, data and work across all the agencies.</p> <p>  Just to back up, the other 50% goes to the IFI, but that is earmarked for rehabilitation and habitat improvement.  It is not as if it is going into the general Exchequer coffers or any other source.  It is all for good conservation, development and protection of our inland rivers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#PP00600"><p>I thank the Minister for his attendance.  It is a pleasure to see him.  I have a few questions about the conservation status of stock.  He indicated that it is under considerable stress.  Some rivers are entirely closed because of a lack of stock.  Can the Minister give us a picture of the salmon stock status and the direction of progress?  Is it getting worse?  Are more rivers being closed?  Where exactly do we stand in respect of protecting the species?</p> <p>  How will new salmon licence charges relate in everyday terms to people who may be using them, for example, the proportion of the value of the catch that the fee will represent or the charge in respect of a person who is seeking to take out a licence on a river where it is open to angling?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#QQ00100"><p>I will give the Deputy an update on the status of the stocks, particularly salmon stocks.  They seemed to be relatively steady, if not showing a slight improvement, in the last five years.  The number of rivers open to catching where there is a total allowable catch set and conservation limits went from 44 to 48 between 2017 and 2021.  The number on catch and release has gone from 27 to 32 and the number closed has gone from 72 down to 64.  That is a slight improvement but still we would not be complacent.  Anyone with a close interest in angling will say that the numbers are a fraction of what they would historically have been.  Some rivers, such as the Moy, are still remarkable.  I think the total allowable catch there is something like 12,000 fish.  The next river down from that would be something like 4,000, which is a fraction of it.  I am thinking of the likes of the Blackwater or the Maine down in Kerry.  It varies across the country.  There is the Laune in Tralee.  They would be some of the larger rivers.</p> <p>  We have a complex system because there is both the spring run and the autumn run.  A lot depends on local conditions as well as the wider context, as I mentioned earlier, of what is happening in the feeding grounds out in the Atlantic.  Some 7,000 fish would be caught with commercial licences each year.  That is still very valuable.  In shops the price of wild salmon is astronomical because it is such a precious and rare commodity.  The number of licences is relatively small.  Commercial fisheries are limited just to salmon.  We do not do any eel.</p> <p>  On the range of licences in terms of costs, a draft net licence is &euro;385 and there were 58 sales of them last year.  Snap net licences, a slightly different netting type, sell as ten at a duty of &euro;152.  We are looking at about a 10% increase.  It is not a huge revenue accruing to the State.  Most of the revenue comes from the rod licences for anglers, tourists and others, including short-term daily licences.  The commercial licence income and numbers are very small.  For some people it is still a very significant business because those 7,000 fish are not insignificant in numbers but the licence fee revenue is a fraction of what it would be from the commercial fisheries compared to the rod licences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#QQ00200"><p>A lot has been covered.  I would like to get a sense of how the allowable catch compares to what it was at the start of the last decade or in 2008, 2009 or 2010.  How does the season compare?  Is it the same comparable season?  On this approach to licensing and the increase in fees and duties as a mechanism for conservation and management, is the Minister satisfied that it is effective?  Has there been an assessment of its effectiveness or appropriateness as a tool for conservation?  What assessment has been made of the impact of the increase in fees?  I expect from those who avail of these licences that there is a business case that this plugs into.  Has that been assessed from the Minister's end in terms of the implications of these increases and the impact they will have on fishing activity?  Is that plugged into the Department's analysis to achieve a desired result?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022020100002#RR00100"><p>May I give the wider assessment of the past ten years?  We were at a crisis stage 15 years ago.  If I recall correctly, Noel Dempsey was Minister at the time.  We were at a crisis point and still had drift netting at sea.  The issue of drift netting was critical because such netting is indiscriminate.  If you had a drift net off either the west or east coast to catch salmon coming down, you could not tell which river they were going to.  It was not scientific.  You could not tell whether that fish was the last to go up a particular river, so it was vital that drift netting be stopped.  That has worked in the sense that it has stopped the precipitous decline that had been under way since the 1970s, which is when drift netting and draft netting were at their height and when there were hundreds of thousands of salmon.  There had been a continuous downward curve since then.  The numbers have not come back up as much as we would have liked but there has at least been a stabilisation and, in some rivers, a restoration.</p> <p>  This is a complex issue to deal with.  As I have said, it is connected to global warming because salmon are very sensitive to water temperatures.  We are at the southern end of the feasible range for salmon.  Salmon numbers further south have dropped by even more.  They are also very sensitive to pollution.  We have a significant and ongoing problem with water pollution in all of our rivers.  We have gone from a largely pristine river system to having only 20 or so river systems being so described.  To go local, catch and release has been implemented in the Boyne in the Deputy's own area.  There is still the ability to fish to help with conservation.  It is not as if there are not salmon going up the Boyne.  I happened to visit Dowth recently and the point was made that Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange were the centre of early civilisation on our island because there was the most incredible protein source at the bend in the river just beneath where those portal tombs are located.  It was therefore the ideal place for civilisation to thrive.  Could we get back to those numbers on the Boyne?  I certainly believe we should set that as an objective.  It is not lost.  I have seen salmon jump over the weir at Clonskeagh.  We can restore the stock as a critical contribution to restoring biodiversity in Europe.  It is of that much significance.</p></speech>

It has been ten years since such a plan was drawn up for the country, so it is about time something was done in this regard.  I would like an update on that.</p> <p>  We had some discussions last year on by-laws in respect of the western lakes and salmonoid species.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has undertaken to draw up a management plan in respect of the western lakes.  This may not be the appropriate setting for this.  I know the Minister is to come back to discuss fisheries, including inland fisheries, in more detail but the western lakes are at particular risk from invasive species, so I would like to understand the work Inland Fisheries Ireland is undertaking with regard to that management plan.  Might we consider by-laws in respect of salmonoid species in general because they may be out of date?  Perhaps that work could be included in the conservation or management plan.</p></speech>

The River Corrib is one of the great rivers and Lough Corrib is one of the great lakes.  It is more of a trout lake than a salmon lake but the River Corrib is open.  Some 4,139 tags may be issued, just to give an indication of numbers.  You will see fishermen at the site by Salmon Weir Bridge.  They are there for a reason.</p><p>The Senator is right.  We need much more deep and dense analysis of what is happening in the likes of the great lakes so that we can manage them better.  There is a lot of controversy in this area.  There are all sorts of different views and opinions with regard to pike versus trout and perch and the issues around invasive species.  The ecology is highly complex.  It is of great importance that we manage and monitor the great lakes.</p><p> To help with that, there is a series of papers and policy initiatives coming from the Department.  Within a number of weeks, we expect a policy paper on water quality and climate.  We will forward that to the committee.  We also expect a further paper on the whole issue of aquaculture and the protection of our marine, lake and salmonoid environments.  There will also be a policy paper on the management options for salmon, which will go to consultation this year.  There are a number of different critical policy initiatives coming.  We will share all of them with the committee straight away.  We look forward to engaging on them.</p></speech>

The Minister signalled that some of the revenue collected from the fees will be put back into conservation and habitat protection.  In that regard, is there room to address the issue whereby necessary flood prevention works have taken place within a particular town to protect residences and businesses, the best examples in my own area being the works on the River Bandon, the River Fealge in Clonakilty and in Skibbereen, but the outcome had not been good from a habitat and biodiversity point of view?  What tends to happen on these rivers is that the Office of Public Works carries out its works with one thing in mind, that is, flood prevention.  However, at times what is left afterwards, including in the three examples I gave the Minister, is a biodiversity desert in which the riverbed has been completely changed and not re-established.  Is there potential for funding from this stream of income, perhaps supplemented by other funding, to rewild or replace habitat that has been lost where there is a desire in the community to do so?  The works in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen are perfect examples.  The spawning of fish and breeding birds have been impacted.</p></speech>

It is the River Ilen that flows through Skibbereen, is it not?  That is open.  There are 817 tags allowed on that river while 708 are allowed for the River Bandon.  I will be honest; when I saw some of those flood protection works, particularly those in Bandon and Skibbereen, I wondered how fish would ever come back up again.  There was a very significant intervention in these cases.  I remember that, on the Cork side of Bandon, there was a kind of-----</p></speech>

I will go local and again mention the weir at Clonskeagh in my own area.  Flood protection works have just been carried out there.  We were talking about different agencies with different responsibilities.  This is an OPW issue.  I look at the scale of the change to the local environment and I fear that some of our flood protection works are overengineered, do not take into account biodiversity and do not consider how more natural flood management techniques, such as overflow areas and so on, can be used.  I have a real fear that the approach taken may create further problems in that it tends to speed up the waters and funnel rivers, particularly in the likes of Skibbereen and Bandon.  There is a worry that rivers are being culverted rather than flood prevention works being designed.  The OPW has a job to do and will say it has to-----</p></speech>

It is difficult, however.  I had a discussion recently with representatives of the OPW regarding who has responsibility for flood protection on the railway line in Clare.  The Chair will remember this topic.  I made the point that the organisation is responsible for flood protection, but we would work with it to ensure when designing flood protection that we consider nature protection at the same time as working to avoid the flooding of homes.</p></speech>

A memorandum of understanding, MOU, has been worked out between the IFI and the OPW in places such as Bandon, because they must work together and they do.  It is not a case of one State agency being right or wrong.  The OPW benefits from listening to the IFI.</p></speech>

We are going to have a more detailed discussion on fisheries in this committee in future and that MOU information would be useful to allow us to have as informed and useful a conversation as possible.  I do not know if the MOU is a general agreement or specific to individual rivers, but it would be useful if information on the mechanisms of co-operation were to be available.</p> <p>  Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan's points about flood protection were well made.  To return to the licensing aspect, as well as addressing the question of the appropriateness of flood protections, in instances where a local pressure is being applied for a discrete period of time, for example, through flood works and other activities, is there a potential to suspend the use of licences in such areas?  I refer to a situation, for example, of a river in a particular area that may be under significant pressure, perhaps during a migration season.  Is that a tool that could be used to ameliorate the situation so no extra pressure is experienced?</p> <p>  Will the Minister clarify whether the licences referred to in this context apply to just wild salmon and shellfish or are charges for aquaculture licences or finfish aquaculture licences included?  Regarding the wider question of what kinds of mechanisms are employed, has there been public consultation in this regard?  I ask this because the Minister mentioned drift and draft nets and the negative impacts they have had.  Draft nets are still included in the Schedule to this Bill.  What public consultation has there been around the use of draft nets, as well as concerning the use of other gear which have by-catch implications?</p></speech>

They are used within the estuarine and river system, so there is not the same risk as I mentioned regarding drift netting at sea, which is indiscriminate.</p> <p>  I will certainly seek to get that memorandum of understanding, even if it is only an example of what can be done on the River Bandon, because that would be good.  I have not seen it myself yet, so I look forward to seeing how it works.</p> <p>  I assure the Senator that commercial licences are only issued where the scientific assessment of a river is that it is above its conservation level to ensure that any activity is not worsening a conservation problem.  Within that context, the ability to do other works on the river is governed by sensitive rules regarding what can and cannot be done.  Works on bridges or other roadways would have to be done outside particular times to ensure that migratory fish stocks are not disturbed.  Therefore, the type of licence and the sort of other activities that might impinge on fish stocks is heavily regulated under statute regarding when that takes place.  </p></speech>

To bring the Minister back to the local perspective, again, I ask him about some rivers in my neck of the woods, namely, the River Feale and the River Mulkear.  Perhaps the Minister might have some figures that he can share with us.  Most members are in favour of having a further session devoted specifically to barriers to fish migration.  There are serious issues in this regard with the Annacotty Weir on the River Mulkear, just outside Limerick city, and the Ardnacrusha power station on the River Shannon.  That last location might be straying into the Minister's other remit on energy.  We are going to take a close look at that matter, but does the Minister, or the representatives from the IFI, have anything to tell us about what it is planned to do in the areas where those projects are to remove what most people would agree are significant barriers to fish migration?</p></speech>

As it happens, I was just talking to my officials earlier today and said that what I would like to do is to visit both locations.  There is nothing better than seeing at first hand what is happening on the ground in the presence of our fish scientists and representatives from the ESB.  The Shannon system, in particular, is a large facility with a major disruptive effect on the eel and salmon populations.  If the Chair might be interested, he and other members of the committee could come along when I visit the region and we could see the situation at first hand and listen to what management options are possible to try to improve it.</p></speech>

If members or witnesses who are participating remotely experience any sound or technical issues, they should let us know through the chat function.  Otherwise, we will proceed.  I wish to advise everybody that as it is a public meeting the chat function on MS Teams should only be used to advise participants of any technical issues or urgent matters and not used to make general comments or statements.</p> <p>  I remind members who are participating remotely to keep their device on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking I ask them to have their camera switched on, where possible, and to be mindful that we are in public session.  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I ask everyone participating in the committee room to be vigilant with regard to Covid-19.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is on the rights of the child in respect of domestic and international surrogacy.  I welcome all our witnesses here today to discuss this very important topic.  The format of the meeting will be an opening statement from each group and they will be followed by questions and answers with members.  Each member has an individual question-and-answer slot of approximately five minutes.  The witnesses, who are addressing the committee remotely from outside Leinster House, are Professor Conor O'Mahony, special rapporteur for child protection; Dr. Lydia Bracken, University of Limerick; Ms Ciara Merrigan, chairperson, and Ms Cathy Wheatley, spokesperson, of Irish Families Through Surrogacy, IFTS; and Ms Elaine Cohalan, chairperson, and Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore, director, of Equality for Children.  We will start with Professor O'Mahony, who will be followed by Dr. Bracken, Ms Merrigan and Ms Cohalan.  Before I invite them to give their opening statements I must advise them about parliamentary privilege.  As all the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I must point out there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Each speaker is allocated three minutes speaking time and then there will be questions and answers with members.</p> <p>  I invite Professor O'Mahony to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

At present, we have laws allowing for parentage to be allocated in some cases involving donor eggs or donor sperm, but not all families benefit from this legislation.  Meanwhile, surrogacy is entirely unregulated in Irish law.  The result is that children are born and raised in families in which one parent is treated as a legal stranger to the child.  This fails to recognise adequately the children's right to family life and their right to identity in some cases of donor-assisted human reproduction and entirely ignores those rights in the case of surrogacy.  This is contrary to both the best interests of children and the principle of non-discrimination.  In 2020, the Government asked me, as special rapporteur for child protection, to examine the implications of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy for the rights and best interests of children.  My report was published last April and my input today is based on that report.</p> <p>  The question of whether to regulate or prohibit surrogacy is a subject on which there are strong and legitimately held opinions and on which there is little international consensus.  Nonetheless, from the point of view of children's rights, certain principles are beginning to become clear.  The unavoidable reality is that children will continue to be born following international surrogacy arrangements, irrespective of what Irish law provides, and to be cared for by parents who may have no legal connection with those children.  In the face of this reality, the European Court of Human Rights has held that states that are party to the European Convention on Human Rights must provide a pathway to legal recognition of family relationships arising from international surrogacy arrangements.  Ireland is bound by this obligation.</p> <p>  My report recommends that the Oireachtas should enact comprehensive legislation regulating surrogacy at the earliest opportunity.  This legislation should incentivise reliance on domestic surrogacy arrangements by adopting a more streamlined and less burdensome framework for domestic rather than international arrangements.  That said, even if domestic surrogacy is regulated there will always be families who will opt for international arrangements, whether due to the availability of surrogates or other issues.  It is unsustainable to allow these families to remain in the legal twilight zone they currently inhabit.  It is therefore imperative that any legislation enacted in this area also provides a clear pathway to recognition of relationships arising from international surrogacy.</p> <p>  My report makes a series of recommendations which are aimed at harmonising Irish law with children&rsquo;s rights principles deriving from our international legal obligations.  These recommendations include closing gaps in existing laws governing parentage in donor-assisted human reproduction procedures; for domestic surrogacy, that provision be made for a court application prior to the conception of the child that would combine advance authorisation of the arrangement with a pre-birth transfer of parentage; for international surrogacy, the legislation should provide for intending parents to apply to the High Court for parentage and parental responsibility, as well as for a grant of nationality and citizenship to the child, subject to satisfying a range of prescribed criteria, with such applications to be made before the child is brought into the jurisdiction; that retrospective declarations of parentage be available in respect of children born through surrogacy arrangements which took place before the legislation comes into effect; and that the legislation governing donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy would ensure that the right to identity be protected for all children born through such procedures and can be exercised by children while they are still children, with identifying information being made available to parents at any point after the child's birth and directly to children from the age of 12 years onwards.</p> <p>  All these points were addressed in much more detail in my report and I am happy to discuss all this with the members throughout today's proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#A00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to share my views on the rights of the child in respect of domestic and international surrogacy.  Based on the research that I have conducted as a legal academic, it is my view that the absence of legislation to specifically regulate surrogacy in Ireland is contrary to the best interests of children who are born through this process.  The central premise of my statement is that surrogacy must be subject to specific legal regulation in order to comply with the best interests principle and that law, policy and practice in the area must be shaped by children&rsquo;s rights and research on children&rsquo;s experiences.  Among other things, this regulation must ensure that the intending parents who care for the child from birth can both be recognised as legal parents; that the child&rsquo;s right to identity is safeguarded; and that the child does not experience discrimination due to the circumstances of the child's conception.</p> <p>  The current situation is that without regulation, children born through surrogacy are disadvantaged in a range of areas as they do not have a legal relationship with one of their parents, either the intending mother or intending father.  To address these issues, there is a need to legislate for future surrogacy arrangements, but the law must also provide a mechanism to recognise the intended legal parentage of children who have already been born through surrogacy.  This could be achieved in a manner similar to the provisions of our existing law that allow for the recognition of parentage in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction that occurred prior to commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.</p> <p>  As it is currently drafted, the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 proposes to prohibit international surrogacy and to criminalise intending parents who engage in it.  It is my view that prohibiting international surrogacy will not protect children&rsquo;s rights and criminalising intending parents would only exacerbate the issues.  The difficulties that arise as a result of prohibition are evident in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, which has heard a number of cases on this point.  The case law of the court and an advisory opinion issued in 2019 indicate that legal recognition of certain parent-child relationships must be possible following surrogacy, even in countries that prohibit the practice, in order to protect the child's rights.  Of course, assessment of the best interests of the child must take place on an individualised basis, taking into account all relevant factors.</p><p>However, ignoring the reality of international surrogacy by not legislating for it leaves the door open to children&rsquo;s rights violations. </p><p> While today&rsquo;s discussion focuses on children&rsquo;s rights in surrogacy, it is also important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s existing legislation on donor-assisted human reproduction, that is, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, falls short of children&rsquo;s rights standards in a number of areas.  For example, a number of pathways to parentage are omitted from the legislation, raising issues for the child&rsquo;s right to family life, and there are also issues with the process through which the right to identity can be vindicated for the child.  The assisted human reproduction Bill provides an opportunity to enact inclusive and comprehensive legislation to address the current gaps in Irish law and so I urge the committee to consider the issues in this broader context to ensure consistency across all assisted human reproduction legislation.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Merrigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for having us here today.  Irish Families Through Surrogacy is a group of Irish parents who are campaigning for our children to have the protection and benefits of a legally recognised relationship with both parents.  We are predominantly a group of Irish mothers who have already undertaken the surrogacy process to motherhood for many medical reasons such as cancer, endometriosis, cystic fibrosis, post-organ transplant, MRKH, multiple miscarriages, congenital heart conditions, stillbirth and unexplained infertility.</p> <p>  We are the voice of our children.  We call upon our Government to act as a matter of urgency on assisted human reproduction legislation, with its primary goal to protect the best interests and welfare of our children.  We need a positive, supportive and expedited process to protect the dignity and respect of all parties involved in the surrogacy process, namely, the child, the surrogate and the intended parents.  Our children deserve equal fundamental rights and protection to those afforded to any other Irish child under Irish law.  Currently, Irish legislation recognises the woman who gave birth as the legal mother of a child.  The European Court of Human Rights has tasked its member states to find a pathway to secure legal recognition of family relationships.  There can currently be a long wait until our children have a legally recognised relationship with their father within the State.  There is variation within the legal process and this can take many months or even years.  Intended mothers can only apply for guardianship of their children with permission of the father.  This expires once our children reach 18.  As we all know, parenting does not end at 18.  Our children need a legal relationship with us throughout their lives, not just for childhood. </p> <p>  This is how the lack of legislation affects our children on a daily basis.  As newborns, our children were unable to be legally accompanied by us, their mothers, for their vaccinations.  If our children are hospitalised, we legally cannot give medical consent for their care.  We cannot apply for first passports or sign consent to enrol them into cr&egrave;che or school.  We cannot open bank accounts for our children or travel abroad with them without their father&rsquo;s permission.  Effectively, our children only have one parent who can provide protection and stability.  We worry that their awareness that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not really their mothers" in Irish law will affect their future sense of identity and well-being and this will open them up to ridicule and bullying on the school playground in years to come. </p> <p>  Our children were created by us, albeit in a non-traditional manner.  We are their constant and their advocates.  They have no parents, no mammy or daddy, other than us.  Our children&rsquo;s needs are paramount.  They need the stability and certainty of having the benefit of two legally recognised intended parents.  They deserve the same access to the constitutional rights and equalities of all other children in society.  As set out in the Constitution our children have &ldquo;natural and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; that the State should by its laws &ldquo;protect and vindicate".</p></speech>

In Ireland, the majority of children born into LGBTQ+ families are prevented from having a legal parent-child relationship with both of their parents.  The legal protections, security and status that come from a legal-parent child relationship are not available to these children.  Children of the majority of LGBTQ+ parents are therefore not currently treated equally by the State.  Equality for Children, EFC, was formed in 2019 by a group of LGBTQ+ parents and allies with the sole purpose of righting this wrong.  We are a not-for-profit, volunteer-led organisation and currently represent 132 LGBTQ+ families.</p> <p>  Our guiding principle is that it is not equal unless it includes everyone.  We believe that, regardless of conception method, no child should be left behind or outside of the law when it comes to their fundamental rights to family life, equality before the law, social security, status, and protection by the State.  Thousands of children in Ireland are living in vulnerable, precarious situations simply because of how they were conceived.  All same-sex couples who want to have children require assisted human reproduction or assisted pregnancy to conceive a child.   The CSO reported in 2016 that there were over 6,000 same-sex cohabiting couples in Ireland and between 2016 and 2020 there were 3,433 same-sex marriages in Ireland. </p> <p>  This is not a marginal issue.  The lack of legislation in this area affects many other families, including families where a parent experiences infertility or has a disability or medical condition that prevents them from safely conceiving or carrying a child. </p> <p>  Working together with partners across these stakeholder groups, we have published a position paper outlining six key recommendations that we believe will address the inequalities that children born through assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, experience.  These recommendations are outlined in our submission and include that the recommendations from the Joint Committee on Health are addressed in upcoming legislation. and that all of the recommendations outlined in Professor O&rsquo;Mahony's report are adopted in that legislation.  Today, we will outline the significant negative impact that lack of legislation in this area has on the lives of ours and other children born into LGBTQ+ families in Ireland.

It is an important issue and one which I care about but am still learning about.  I hope my questions are suitable and allow us to have a helpful conversation.  My questions are geared towards Professor O'Mahony and Dr. Bracken.  They are more legal questions about understanding how to move forward with the legal framework.  I feel I am coming from a deficit of understanding but I hope the questions are pointing in the right direction to get closer to understanding the issue.  Apologies if they are not.</p> <p>  Ms Merrigan mentioned the constitutional rights of children, their access to them, how important they are and how the legal framework we create will allow kids and families to access those rights.  Are there any other constitutional legal barriers to creating the legal framework to do that?  There is the right to identity and the fact that in Irish legislation it is the process of giving birth that is deemed to determine the legal mother.  Is there any constitutional aspect preventing us getting to that point in the upcoming legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#B00500"><p>From the constitutional perspective, the quick answer is &quot;No&quot;.  This issue was before the Supreme Court eight years ago in the case of M.R <i>v</i>. An t&Aacute;rd Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  The wording used by the Supreme Court in considering its regulation of assisted human reproduction and surrogacy was that it is quintessentially a matter for the Oireachtas to decide how best to regulate that issue and balance the various interests and rights and play in such procedures.  That judgment clearly signals that the courts do not want to step in and draw bright lines about what can or cannot be done.  The courts are saying it is a sensitive, difficult policy choice to be made and, because of that, it is more appropriately made by the people's elected representatives in the Oireachtas.  The likelihood of laws in this area being struck down as unconstitutional is slim based on that decision, because the courts see it as a role of the Oireachtas to fill in the blanks we currently have.</p></speech>

If we can create a framework here for domestic surrogacy, will that begin to cause complications for anybody who seeks international surrogacy in terms of being able to access the same laws under the legislation that will be drafted or will people be treated differently, which is not what somebody would want to see?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#C00200"><p>That is a good question.  Dr. Bracken might also want to respond to it.  Domestic and international surrogacy give rise to different considerations and different risks arise.  Ideally, what one would want to create is a pathway that gets people to the same place, which is full recognition of family relationships, full parentage for the intending parents and full protection for the right to identity wherever that is possible.  One would want to get them to the same place, whether it is a domestic or international framework.  There are different issues and risks that arise in the international framework relative to a domestic framework.  It is more complicated and there are more moving parts.  Suddenly there would be issues around the interaction between Irish law and the law of another state, issues around what rules are in place in that other state governing payments, for example, to the surrogate mother and various other considerations like that.  It is probably not as simple as just taking exactly the same process that one might operate in a domestic context and saying that could work perfectly for international cases as well because it is a different process.  The recommendations in my report were aimed at trying to get people to the same place but adding in some additional steps that would provide those additional safeguards that one would need to deal with those extra considerations and risks I mentioned but also providing some degree of a safety net.  Some of our existing laws on donor-assisted human reproduction provide for a situation where there is a pathway and if one stays on it one would get everything but if one deviates from it one would get nothing.  Part of what I was trying to achieve in the report recommendations was to set out our ideal pathway where one would get everything and everybody's rights are protected but also providing for a situation where some people, for whatever reason, deviate slightly from that pathway and it would not be a case of saying that person does not qualify for parentage and we would not give that person any recognition whatsoever.  The child has already been born and that appears to be a disproportionate response in the event that somebody has deviated slightly.  The recommendations in the report were about stating here is where we want to get the person, here is best practice and we will try to funnel cases this way, but here also is a safety net potentially of guardianship rather parentage, for example, for cases where people have not ticked all the boxes but the court is still satisfied that is the best outcome for the child.</p></speech>

My final question is for Dr. Bracken.  She mentioned in her contribution the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and how it falls short in terms of children's rights standards.  She mentioned that a number of pathways to parentage are omitted from that legislation.  Could she elaborate on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#C00400"><p>Absolutely.  I thank the Senator for her question.  What I was referring to in my opening statement is that there is a handful of pathways that are very clearly omitted form the legislation.  In particular, non-clinical donor-assisted human reproduction procedures currently fall outside the framework for parentage that is created by the 2015 Act.  Similarly, the legislation does not cover donor-assisted human reproduction procedures that take place in another country.  If one travels to another country to engage in donor-assisted human reproduction, one would not be subject to the same parentage provisions once one returns to the country.  Within the legislation there is a provision which would allow for parentage to be allocated to an intended parent who is not currently recognised as a parent in a situation where the child was conceived prior to commencement of the legislation, that is, prior to 4 May 2020.  In that situation, if a known donor had been used then, again, the procedure is not available to that family.  In that way, those pathways are omitted from the legislation despite the fact that those pathways are the reality of life for many families within the country.  It raises children&rsquo;s rights issues in terms of the child&rsquo;s right to family life and, in particular, having a legal relationship with the other non-legal parent who the law does not currently recognise in any capacity as having legal rights and responsibilities towards the child.  That is an area where, if we are introducing new legislation on assisted human reproduction, we should also be fixing our existing legislation to ensure the same children&rsquo;s rights standards will apply throughout.</p></speech>

It is very important to get the legal perspectives and to hear the experiences of those families most directly affected.  I was glad to support Equality for Children, which co-hosted the event outside Leinster House in November with Irish Families Through Surrogacy.  It was good to meet the witnesses at that time and since then.</p> <p>  What we have heard today is that this is a deeply complex area, that the current lack of regulation is simply unsustainable and it is leaving many families simply without recognition or protection in law.  Therefore, we have to change it and we have to legislate.  I commend Professor O'Mahony and Dr. Bracken on setting out so clearly what needs to be done.  I  have read Professor O'Mahony's report from 2020.  I was a member of the justice committee during the period from 2011 to 2016 when we tried to legislate on this area.  In the end, as the witnesses will be aware, the Children and Family Relationships Act came out of that process but it did not regulate surrogacy because there were simply too many complex issues for us to be able to get agreement or consensus on prior to the holding of the marriage equality referendum.  Time was against us at that point but it has left this legal vacuum.  I am conscious there will be an Oireachtas special committee on international surrogacy .  </p> <p>  I wanted to raise particularly with Professor O'Mahony and Dr. Bracken but also with Ms Merrigan and Ms Cohalan and their groups the key issues we have found the hardest to navigate in law.  How do we deal with those?  First, there is the distinction between altruistic and commercial surrogacy.  It is much easier to provide for altruistic domestic surrogacy but much more complex if we try to create a framework to recognise international and commercial surrogacy.  How do we do that in such a way that we are protecting not only the rights of children, which are crucial and the witnesses have addressed that, but the rights of women, particularly women in developing countries who may be very much open to exploitation where there is not a proper regulatory framework?  That is the real challenge with international surrogacy.  I am conscious that with adoption we have the Hague Conventions but no equivalent for surrogacy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' views on that.  </p> <p>  The other point we had difficultly with was how to provide for sanction for those who do not use the frameworks that are provided for in law.  To penalise parents is to penalise children.  That was a real issue.  It is a really difficult issue in drafting surrogacy legislation.  These are issues that have been discussed previously.  The special committee on international surrogacy will be dealing with some of these issues but these are some of the crucial questions.</p> <p>  I commend the witnesses and note we are all conscious there are children and families currently in Ireland who do not have legal recognition, status or protections and we need to sort that out.  It is incumbent on us in this Oireachtas term to do so.  That is for sure.  I agree we need to regulate not only domestic but international surrogacy because that is the reality for many people.  With that in mind, the witnesses might comment on how we address those very tricky issues.</p></speech>

We will start with Professor O'Mahony, followed by Dr. Bracken and then I will bring in Ms Merrigan or Ms Wheatley, followed by Ms Cohalan or Mr. Kenny, whoever from each group would like to answer.</p></speech>

My recommendation was that to try to avoid that situation as we do not want to penalise the children, as the Deputy said, but we want to incentivise the very best practice with the parents.  If people are going to engage in international surrogacy arrangements and we are going to recognise those, we want them to be ones we are comfortable with as a country and that comply with the standards which we find acceptable.</p><p>That is why the recommendation in the report is for a kind of two-tier situation in which there would be parentage and guardianship, which are different legal statuses.  Parentage is what people ultimately want.  It is the gold standard most people are seeking when they enter these arrangements.  We recommend that, where the arrangement complies with all of the standards and various other criteria and where we are happy that the child's rights, for example, the right to identity, are fully protected, full parentage status would be available.  However, the use of an anonymous donor, for example, which means by definition that the right to identity cannot be protected, deviates from the gold standard we are trying to set.  The sanction, as it were, would be to say that parentage is now off the table.  People who do not comply with the gold standard would not be eligible for full parentage.  However, we do not want to penalise such people's children by making them legal strangers so guardianship would still be available from birth.  Guardianship is available at the moment but only after a wait of two to three years, depending on the circumstances.  Guardianship would be available from birth but parentage would not be available.  In that way, legal recognition could still be provided and people could still be given the right to make decisions for their child including consenting to medical treatment, applying for passports and all of those practical, day-to-day issues while still providing a very strong incentive for people to comply with the highest standards as that is what is required to get parentage, which is ultimately what people want.</p><p> The question of commercial versus altruistic arrangements is very complicated.  There is no question about that.  Some people may look at the recommendation in the report in which I say there should only be altruistic surrogacy domestically and wonder why I did not replicate that recommendation for international surrogacy.  The rationale is simple.  On the one hand, we have obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children has expressed concerns about aspects of commercial surrogacy.  Much of that material suggests that we would best comply with that framework in our domestic laws and in what we can regulate here in this country by going for altruistic surrogacy only.  </p><p> At the same time, we cannot legislate for what happens in other countries.  If Ukraine or California wants to allow commercial surrogacy, we cannot stop that.  If Irish couples are going to go to these places and come back to Ireland with children born as a result of those commercial surrogacy arrangements, we need to figure out how to deal with that in a way that avoids all of the problems that have been discussed today.  We need to be conscious of the risk of exploitation and that this may amount to the sale of children.  The report recommends that this be dealt with by requiring a High Court application.  This means the court would have to be satisfied that regulation in the jurisdiction in question is such that it ensures the arrangement does not amount to the sale of children, there was genuine consent on the part of the surrogate mother and so on.  The court would have to satisfy itself of that before it would grant an order recognising the relationships deriving from that arrangement.  In doing that, we can construct our laws in a way that tries to direct people towards countries whose frameworks are compatible with ours.  People would be on notice that, if they go to countries where things are looser, the High Court might not be satisfied that the standards have been met.</p></speech>

I will start with the point on commercial surrogacy.  A very careful and nuanced discussion on commercial surrogacy is needed to begin with because it raises many different issues, as was mentioned.  First, we need to agree on what we mean when we talk about commercial surrogacy because, when we look around the world, we see that practices that one country might regard as purely altruistic might be regarded by another as commercial.  That is the very first thing we must do if we are going to talk about commercial surrogacy.  A useful starting point before we even get to that stage is to decide how to ensure that surrogacy is ethical.  How do we ensure that the human rights of all stakeholders have been protected in the surrogacy arrangement?  That comes down to safeguards to ensure that free and informed advice has been given, that there is a balance of power between all parties and, very importantly, that the rights of the child have been upheld throughout the process.  It is more useful to focus on those aspects first and to decide what we mean by ethical surrogacy and then to get into the conversation on what we mean by commercial surrogacy and whether those other aspects can be safeguarded in whatever type of process we are talking about.  Our starting point needs to be a focus on whether the process is ethical and how to ensure that it is.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on sanctions, I fully agree with the points Professor O'Mahony made on awarding guardianship instead of parentage in certain circumstances.  The points made in the report balance the interests of all of the stakeholders in the process and provide us with something of a compromise that allows us not to penalise parents in a way that ultimately penalises the child and that provides a solution that actually works and is respectful of the reality of the child's life.</p></speech>

There are certain countries where there are legal frameworks in place to protect surrogates.  These include the US, Canada and Ukraine.  In Ukraine, where we went to have our children, our surrogate, whose name was Ivana, was afforded independent legal protection and advice, counselling, psychiatric welfare assessments and support.  That was really important to us.  At the end of the day, as parents, your surrogate is carrying your child and you want them to be protected in every way possible.  You want all parties to be protected.  As an organisation, one of the things we want goes back to Professor O'Mahony's recommendation.  We want a pre-birth agreement followed by transfer of parental rights on birth.  This would make sure that the amazing women who act as our surrogates still retain autonomy over their bodies, which is what every woman should have.  There are ways to do that.  We want to create a pregnancy partnership.  We want to be able to look our children in the eye and tell them we did everything we could to protect the women who carried them and gave us the most precious gift anyone can give.</p></speech>

Our legal and medical practitioners weigh in on the technicalities but, at Equality for Children, we want to ensure that the rights and best interests of all parties involved in a surrogacy journey are upheld.  We would like this committee and the upcoming committee to investigate appropriate models of compensation for surrogates, who give such a wonderful gift in helping people to create their families.</p> <p>  On the question in respect of sanctions, this is the one piece on which I slightly disagree with Professor O'Mahony's report.  The idea of awarding parentage needs to be turned around slightly.  The awarding of parentage is the awarding of equality to the child.  Withholding it penalises the child.  I would like the committee to investigate options through which legal sanctions could be applied to parents, medical practitioners or fertility clinics that do not abide by the law in a way that does not impact on a child's right to equality before the law.  There are ways in which our laws can be an invisible protector and enabler of our children's best interests.  I would worry about sanctioning people through the withholding of parentage because that means withholding rights from the child.  I know Mr. Kenny also wants to come in on this point, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#D00500"><p>I will make just a very brief contribution as I am conscious of time.  My husband and I are the parents of three children.  We initially began our journey back in 2014 working through the Canadian system, which was ultimately unsuccessful for us for medical reasons.  However, I feel members of this committee could look at many elements of that model when deciding on these issues around altruistic versus compensated surrogacy, sanctions and the rights of the surrogate.</p><p>Under the Canadian model, everything that occurs before birth is focused on the rights of the surrogate.  She must have independent legal advice and independent medical and psychological supports.  A variety of government-approved agencies are appointed to support surrogates as they work through their pregnancy journey.  They are accredited and have to meet very strict terms and conditions.  The clinics that support surrogacy journeys are bound by the same regulation.  The Canadian model is a really strong one to consider because, before birth, everything is focused on the rights of the surrogate.  However, as soon as the child is born, parental rights are immediately transferred to the intended parents, allowing them to make decisions.  Up until that point, everything to do with bodily integrity, even to the point of having the right to abort the child, rests with the surrogate, her family and her legal team.  That is a model that might bring some clarity for those interested in the issues concerning altruistic surrogacy by comparison with compensated surrogacy and the rights of the surrogate.</p></speech>

It is very appropriate that we have them here on St. Brigid's Day considering St. Brigid's really strong connections with fertility and new life and her perception of children.  This whole conversation embodies what St. Brigid means to me.  Regardless of how a child comes into this world or is carried, it is an absolute miracle.  We need to grab hold of that.</p> <p>  Ms Merrigan's contribution broke my heart.  She articulated so well the reality of the State not catching up with the reality of families.  I am sorry that, instead of spending time with her beautiful children, she must come here to advocate on behalf of everyone's children.  I am really sorry about that.  A family, regardless of its manifestation, should be protected.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for the representatives from Irish Families through Surrogacy.  Can they give examples of the difficulties families face because of our lack of legislation and our not being able to catch up as quickly as we should with the reality of families?</p> <p>  With regard to countries with best practice, I was interested in the reference to Canada.  Is there any other country we should be examining with regard to best practice?</p> <p>  I had not thought before about the difference between parentage and guardianship.  To me, as a complete layperson coming to this conversation and listening to the contributions today, it seems like there is a two-tier model.  It does not seem that the children in the two categories would be equal.  I would like the representatives to elaborate on this.  Ms Cohalan mentioned it.  It reflected what my gut was telling me when I was listening to Professor O'Mahony's contribution on the issue.  I would really like to hear further comments.  My partner and I are not married.  Technically, we had to go through the whole guardianship process.  My partner is a parent.  The two-tier parentage phenomenon really bugged me.  I can imagine it is grating for many other families.  Legally, emotionally and practically, it seems a child could be on a two-tier road.  I could be absolutely wrong.  It does not seem like there is equality to me.  I thank all the delegates very much.  I really enjoying learning from all of them.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Merrigan, will then talk a little about countries that we can model</p> <p>  One of the main challenges we face from day to day is exemplified by the circumstances of one of our group members, who has two children.  One was born naturally to the mother and the second was born through surrogacy.  The current position is that the mother has a legal relationship with one child as a parent but not with the other.  The family is effectively split in two in that way.  Unfortunately, the father of the family has had a recent cancer diagnosis.  One can imagine the stress and anxiety this causes on top of everything else.  God forbid, if anything should happen, the second child would be left without a legal parent.  It is gut-wrenching to think of the effect if anything were to happen.  Any of us could be in this situation.  We all sympathise with the family.</p> <p>  Second, during Covid times only one parent was allowed into hospital with a child.  I experienced this recently, as did one of our members.  Unfortunately, my little girl had Covid-19.  We were very worried about her.  She developed pneumonia, she was very sick, and we went to the hospital.  I knew that I could not legally sign for her treatment if anything were to occur.  I went to the hospital and sat in the car in the carpark and cried my eyes out because I could not be with my baby.  I get a bit emotional about this because the reality is that I am her primary caregiver.  My child was in the hospital with her much-loved daddy and he was doing everything he could, but she was crying for me, her mammy.  I was on video chat trying to reassure her tell her it would be okay, and tell her daddy the answers to the questions the health professionals were asking, because I was with her most and was her primary caregiver.  The anxiety and stress that causes for a family at a time of incredible worry are difficult to take.  That is a personal example.  Members can probably hear from me how much it affected my family.</p> <p>  Let me give another example.  It pertains to another member of our organisation.  Her children were left with no legal parent in the State for five years.  The children got a declaration of parentage for their father just before they started school.  The limbo they were left in caused so much anxiety and stress for them.  Until the father got his declaration of parentage, the mother was not able to apply for guardianship.  For five whole years, and longer in certain cases, children can be left with no legal parent in the State.  It comes down to whether one goes through the High Court.  It is kind of a postcode lottery, considering where you are in terms of the District Court, etc.  It really leaves a child unprotected and vulnerable.  All parents want to do is protect their children.  As everyone knows, they will do anything they can.</p> <p>  With respect to vaccination, one mother was not allowed to consent to giving the Covid-19 vaccine to her child recently.  Sometimes when we think about vaccinations and so on, we think about bringing babies for their first vaccination.  We were not allowed to do that.  The children's daddies had to go with them.  Obviously, it is an emotional time and one wants to do everything one can.  Even as time goes on &mdash; the kids are five or six years old, and some are seven or eight &mdash; the mothers are not allowed to consent for them to have a vaccination.  It should be simple for them to do so.  When broken down to what we deal with on a daily basis, it is hard.</p><p>Some women in our group live in fear because if anything were to happen to the relationship, they would have no legal rights to their children.  Let us think about that for a second because it really leaves women in positions where they may have to stay somewhere they are not safe and is difficult for them.  They need to be protected as well and in such a case they will not leave their children.  Nobody knows what will happen in future and situations change but it really brings home to us that every family model is different.  Nobody knows what will happen in each family model and, for us, it is really about our children.  We do everything we can to protect them but sometimes we cannot because we do not have that legal relationship with them.</p><p> Ms Merrigan will speak to the question on best practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Merrigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#F00200"><p>I thank Senator McGreehan for acknowledging that we are here for our children and, as Ms Wheatley has said, we will do anything to protect children like a mother lion.  I would be here a thousand times over to protect my two three-year-olds.  I have a little girl and boy born through surrogacy.</p> <p>  There was a question on best practice and there are countries we would ask the special committee on surrogacy to review.  The first is looking across the water at the UK, as we always do in Ireland.  The UK has recommendations from its Law Commission and although they are not yet in law, they would be interesting for the committee to look at.  In the other direction we can look to the United States.  New York has a surrogate bill of rights if the committee wants to look at that model.  Among European countries, Greece would be a good example of an EU country with a comprehensive legislative process in place.</p> <p>  I echo what Ms Wheatley has said in terms of parentage for people's understanding.  People may not understand the full process.  Our children were born internationally.  Like Ms Wheatley's twins, my twins were born in Ukraine and before coming home from there, our children had to have DNA tests completed.  We then applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs for an emergency travel document to get home to Ireland.  In Ukraine, when the children are born, their births are registered, as they are here in Ireland.  For example, on the register is my name, my husband's name and the name of our surrogate, Lydia.  All the names are accounted for in that register.</p> <p>  My twins' birth certificates have my name and my husband's name on them.  All our group know about the smack on the face when we land at Dublin Airport with our beautiful babies, as we are no longer considered their mother because the State recognises the surrogate mother as the mother because she delivered the child.  We are really asking that we do not lose this opportunity now and we try to get this right for our children.  We do not want to have a generation of children who have never had legal recognition with the parents caring for them every day, looking after them and mothering them.</p> <p>  Ms Wheatley mentioned how one of our member's children were five and my children were just under three when we got their parentage through.  It is three years without having a legal parent in the State and one lives in fear every day that somebody will come in and take the children.  It is not right for our children and it is unfair for them.  It is now time for this to be sorted, particularly for the children now in the State.  There are children arriving every day from different countries who are born internationally.  We have children up to the age of 18 who, unfortunately, have never had the legal relationship with their mother.  The time is now and we just do not want to lose this opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Cohalan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#F00300"><p>I will speak to a couple of matters before letting Mr. Kenny Moore in.  There were questions about a couple of day-to-day issues and I will cover citizenship.  It might seem like an automatic right that every child in Ireland should have but, unfortunately, there are cases where children are born outside the provisions of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and born through surrogacy.  For these, citizenship can be a significant difficulty.  As it stands, those children born through surrogacy outside the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 can only claim one parent and citizenship from that parent.  They are non-recognised parents if they are from another country or if they are not from Ireland, there can be difficulties with attaining Irish citizenship.</p> <p>  I can start with my own example.  My wife is from the US and she is not recognised as the other mother of our daughter, who was born through intracervical insemination.  Therefore, she cannot claim any American citizenship entitlements that every other child in that scenario - if it was a heterosexual, cis scenario - would be able to claim, regardless of how the child was conceived.  That is because there is a presumption of paternity in Irish law.</p> <p>  There is an example involving surrogacy and a member of the IFTS with whom we worked closely.  Andr&eacute; is not an Irish citizen and he was the recognised parent of the child he and his wife had through surrogacy.  The child could not claim Irish citizenship through his lineage because he is not an Irish citizen.  In this case, the child is left stateless.  Many issues arise from surrogacy arrangements because the parents or intended parents are not recognised as parents.</p> <p>  There are also issues around travel and the issuing of passports.  I can again start with my example and although the birth did not come through surrogacy, it is the same scenario.  I had to sign an affidavit when applying for our daughter's passport and agree no other person had any involvement in her raising and parenting her.  As one might imagine, many families decide not to get passports for their children and simply do not travel because this is such a difficult, emotional and awful thing to have to sign away the other parent's rights, effectively.  There is also fear involved and we certainly had the worry that by signing that document, we could affect any future establishment of that legal relationship.  That has an impact when a child has only one parent listed on the birth certificate, only one parent can apply as a parent for a passport, so the child can only travel legally with that parent.  The child can only travel with the other parent with the express and written permission of the parent deemed the biological parent.</p> <p>  This creates many issues for us, for example.  My wife is from the US and we have lots of family there.  Her travelling with our daughter without me is extremely problematic.  We have lots of examples in our membership of people having difficulties in airports and at borders for those reasons.  Mr. Kenny Moore will speak about some other daily difficulties he has come across.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#F00400"><p>I have three examples that may be of interest to the committee.  In my previous input I spoke about how we did not succeed in having our children through the Canadian system but, ultimately, in our case and having been through four years of stress and hardship, a friend of mine who lives in England came forward and agreed to carry our children for us.  We initially had twins just over three years ago and then six months ago, our little daughter Anne was born, again through the same surrogate supporting us.  I am in the very privileged position of being a stay-at-home parent to three kids aged three or under.  It is mayhem.</p> <p>  The reality is I am only legally connected to one of my children and I have no rights, pretty much, with respect to our newborn daughter.  When I bring her to the green to play or go for a walk, all of my neighbours pretty much have the same level of rights and privilege towards her as I do because I cannot claim guardianship for her.  I will speak a little about that topic of guardianship right now.</p> <p>  As I alluded to, one cannot as the second parent claim guardianship of a child until he or she reaches the age of two.</p><p>As our colleagues from Irish Families Through Surrogacy explained, that means I cannot participate in any of her medical decisions or her vaccinations.  It is a pretty big slap in the face, to be quite honest.  I cannot even do things like open a bank account for her.  If we go into our local bank, as two same-sex male parents we stand out a little bit more than a heterosexual couple with three kids under the age of three.  It is immediately obvious to the people we are talking to in institutions like banks or passport offices that there are two same-sex parents raising kids.  The bank obviously has a duty of care towards its business and has to ask that only the legal parent can open a bank account or savings account for our daughters to deposit the gifts they got from their aunts and uncles.</p><p> It gets more severe.  As we touched upon, when our children, who are connected to us through guardianship, reach the age of 18, most parents celebrate that day but I will dread it.  When the candles are blown out on that cake I will no longer be the parent or guardian of my kids.  If I want to leave them an inheritance, I will have to get a special dispensation from the Revenue Commissioners because we are legally unconnected.  I am now in the position where my elderly mum is in a nursing home and I can see very clearly the importance of having the right to make guardianship for our parents.  Touch wood, I will live to be an old man as well.  I would want my kids to be able to make decisions for me, but currently they cannot do that.  Once they turn 18, they will have no automatic right to care for me.  In the event I had a sudden illness where there was not an opportunity to put in place appropriate arrangements to look after my welfare, my guardian children would not be allowed to sign me into a nursing home or consent to a medical procedure because we would just be considered as two people who happened to share a house for 18 years.  Guardianship is a really inferior option because it does not kick in until the child is two and is extinguished at 18, basically obliterating the memories that we are a family.</p><p> We touched on international surrogacy but we should talk a little bit about how domestic surrogacy works when it comes to birth registration.  This was mentioned already in respect of the fact Senator McGreehan and her partner were not married at the time their child was born.  When birth registration occurs in a surrogacy case here in Ireland, the only person who has automatic legal rights to be considered a parent is the surrogate, regardless of whether she is biologically connected to the child.  Earlier in the session we talked about protecting surrogates.  Actually, typically surrogates do not want the responsibility of parenthood.  They want to support a family to have their children and then to get on with the lives and families they have themselves.  Our State forces them to go on the birth certificate and to take on the role of the sole legal parent at the birth of their child.  The biological father has the opportunity to go on the birth certificate but it typically only occurs with the consent of the surrogate.  Even when that is concluded and the birth certificate is issued, the father still has no automatic rights around custody or guardianship.  They must also be sought.  The birth registration process in Ireland as it stands at the moment places an undue burden on surrogates because it puts them in the position of being the automatic primary carer for a child who is not necessarily connected to them.  It leaves them in a situation - it has never happened and touch wood it does not happen within the jurisdiction - whereby the intended parents could actually say they do not wish to care for this child and leave the surrogate with the responsibility for the child.  They are some of the issues.</p><p> On a personal level, our children were born in the UK.  They have British registry documents.  My guardianship is a really tenuous relationship to have with my children.  It is something that genuinely upsets me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#G00300"><p>I thank everyone for attending today.  They are very powerful, real, lived experiences of people who passionately love and advocate for their children.  It would be prudent of me to commence my section by acknowledging my personal experience of surrogacy.  No one in the surrogacy space, either domestic or international, wants to see anyone's human rights violated.  That is a commonality among all of us.  No one wants to see women exploited and no one is in denial of the potential for exploitation in some jurisdictions.  Let us dispel the notion we are unwilling or have our heads in the sand as to the potential here.  We want to engage with that and find an ethical route through it that safeguards everybody's rights.</p> <p>  We also have to acknowledge in this space that intending parents are also vulnerable and at the risk of being exploited.  They are obliged to engage with their childlessness in the world of commercial fertility clinics, whether in Ireland or abroad.  It is also in Ireland; let us be clear about that.  Infertility arises in a number of ways, whether it be diagnosed, undiagnosed, arising out of serious or chronic illnesses and disabilities, or arising out of the social infertility of same-sex couples for obvious reasons.</p> <p>  What are we saying?  In some of this debate and some of the contributions we hear in public areas, we are saying we are going to decide who can and cannot have a child, that in 2015 when we voted for marriage equality, we were going to put a ceiling on who should be entitled to the opportunity to aspire to a family.  No one in this space thinks they are entitled to a child but they are entitled to the opportunity to create and try for a family in the same way everybody else does.  I believe this really is about an ethical pathway, about the possibility of parenthood and ensuring everybody's rights are safeguarded.  The failure to legislate and to address maturely the very reasonable questions that arise is signalling we are deciding who can and cannot become parents.  That is not a reasonable position for anybody to take.  As legislators we have to have the courage to take on board all of the potential here.</p> <p>  My vision for the outcome of the international surrogacy special purpose Oireachtas joint committee - that is quite a mouthful - is that we have some sort of oversight entity in Ireland that regulates assisted human reproduction, full stop, and that we have a structure that guides and incentivises or funnels, as Professor O'Mahony has said, couples needing surrogacy in order to have an opportunity of parenthood to choose the most ethical routes possible.  There is an ethical way we can honour the European Court of Human Rights obligations on us to provide that route to having that parental relationship legally recognised.  We can also ensure we can apply the UN standards so that, when our people travel to other countries, there are similar standards in terms of human rights, it is free and informed consent, and there is access to the court, independent legal advice and independent translators.  There is a collective experience among those who have been there and done it that can contribute to the due diligence.  It is about putting that into the legislation, either primary or secondary, or in the guidelines that are required.  It is important we ensure we have one genetic link to a child born via international surrogacy, that compensation payments are made in advance of any birth so it is not seen to be transactional around the birth of the child, and that we have oversight.</p> <p>  There are two important things to introduce into this.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is a member of the International Social Service, ISS, an international federation of organisations that includes NGOs and governmental agencies.</p><p>Their main purpose is to reconnect families across jurisdictions.  However, ISS has developed what are called the Verona Principles, which require comprehensive safeguards and protections for children born via surrogacy, and that they should be clearly established in relevant legislation, policy, decision-making and practice.  There is also the Hague Conference on Private International Law which has an expert group that is expected to report in 2023 on the private international law issues relating to international surrogacy.  These are important to set a context for those who are starting to speak out on international surrogacy and on this need in anticipation of the committee.</p><p> I welcomed Professor O'Mahony's report.  I was very grateful when it was published and that the Minister took the decision to publish it.  However, between that and Professor O'Mahony's statement today, there are two things that raise concern for me and which I would like to discuss.  I am with Ms Cohalan all the way on the sanctions element.  I believe we will end up penalising the child.  Also, the law as it stands sees a parental order for the father automatically because of the way we assign citizenship, which means that the guardianship would perhaps only be effected to the mother or the second parent in that instance.  I would be loath to see that.  I am aware of the current availability of guardianship and custody in many instances, including my own, but I am aware of situations where that has been weaponised in other couples in relationship breakdowns.  Given the fact that guardianship can be lifted and removed, I would be fearful of that.</p><p> Professor O'Mahony also has a line which states that we need to ensure that intending parents are suitable parents.  As we look around this call, what would he determine to be suitable parents and where is that threshold?  Should we not apply that to all people who are being parents?  I believe there is an inherent possibility of bias in that, or that it subscribes to a stereotype about parents and couples pursuing their passion for a child via surrogacy and ascribes the stereotype to them.  I am mindful of that.</p><p> I agree with Mr Kenny Moore with regard to Canada.  There is a model there that we should be pursuing.  He also touched on something very important, which is with regard to language here.  We refer to surrogates.  That is not meant to be dehumanising or disparaging in any way.  It is the preference of the women who we prize in our lives who gave us the gift of our babies.  At present, children can inherit from women who did not intend that lifelong relationship, so they prefer to take that word out of it although we very much respect their role.</p><p> I have said enough and will hand over to the witnesses.</p></speech>

I will deal quickly with the second point, before coming back to the guardianship versus parentage question, and explain my thinking on that.  On the question of the assessment of parents and the authorisation of the arrangement, this essentially is similar to what would happen in an adoption scenario.  It is not the case that parents who want to adopt can simply turn up and say they are going to adopt a child.  There is a process through which parents are assessed as potential adopters.</p> <p>  We have to be conscious of the risks here as well.  I absolutely agree that in the vast majority of cases the issue here will be a relatively straightforward one.  Absolutely, these are people who have a deep desire to have a child and to do the best they possibly can for that child.  However, in this world there are going to be people who are concerned about the risks here.  The risks, when one strays into the very serious side, appear from a sale of children point of view and the motivations of people who might be inclined to make use of international surrogacy in countries where regulation is poor in order to get their hands on a child they might not otherwise be able to get their hands on.  These risks exist.  I am not saying that it is a big risk in the vast majority of cases.  Nonetheless, if we are to have a legal framework we can stand over and say it is compliant with the highest children's rights standards, we must legislate not just for the best cases but also for the risks associated with the very rare and worst cases that might also arise.  That was the thinking there.</p> <p>  On the other question of parentage versus guardianship, in a sense it is regrettable that the term "sanctions" came into our discussion at all.  I did not use that word at any point in the report, and it obviously paints it in a particular light.  The thinking behind this is that our discussion today so far has entirely focused on the recognition of family relationships.  We have not really talked about the right to identity.  The remit I had for the report was to look at all children's rights and children's best interests.  The principle of children's best interests envisages that all children's rights be protected, including the right to identity.  Members of the committee will have engaged in the last while with people working on the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, will have met people working on that issue and will be acutely aware of what a big issue identity is for people who do not know their origins and their birth story and of the lifelong impact that has.  That is a significant issue in this conversation.  It is one we cannot lose sight of and one we are legally bound to take into account in what we do.</p> <p>  Let us look at what we do currently in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  In order to try to protect the right to identity we tell people that we want them to go to a clinic where there are record-keeping obligations, as that will ensure that people can trace their identities later.  However, to make that happen, we say that if one engages in a do-it-yourself, DIY, procedure at home, one is completely outside the Act.  In essence, one qualifies for nothing.  In trying to protect identity we say it is all or nothing - people either get the recognition of the family relationship and protection of the right to identity or they get neither of those things.  What I was attempting to construct was to take the idea that we want to ensure that identity is protected, which means that we must have non-anonymous, identifiable donors being used, record-keeping procedures and a framework that will allow people to trace their identity if and when they wish to do so.  At the same time, we also want to avoid that all-or-nothing approach which is the flaw in the Children and Family Relationships Act at present.</p> <p>  On guardianship and parentage, from the point of view of all the practicalities we have discussed today, guardianship is the more significant status.  For example, an unmarried father who has not been appointed a guardian has parentage, but he is not able to consent to medical treatment, is not able to consent to a passport and so forth.  From the point of view of the day-to-day practicalities, it is guardianship which gives people the legal right to make those decisions, not parentage.  Guardianship will address those points.</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Moore mentioned that it does not kick in until two years of age, but the recommendation in the report was not that somebody who finds himself or herself having guardianship rather than surrogacy would have to wait those two years, but that it would be available immediately and not just from the age of two years.  The key point in all of it is that what I was trying to achieve in the report was not that anybody would find himself or herself in this position but that all somebody has to do to qualify for full parentage would be to ensure that the right to identity is protected by using an identifiable donor and then filing the relevant paperwork with the relevant register, which would include the information that would allow people to trace later on.  Anybody who does that gets full parentage.  It was intended to be a nudge, something that would steer people in a particular direction.  It was not really intended to be something that one would want to see used with any type of frequency.  It would simply be that people would go into the process knowing that if they engage in international surrogacy or decide to opt for an at-home donor-assisted human reproduction procedure, they know when they go into that process that they want full parentage, which, for all the reasons Mr. Kenny Moore articulated so well, is what people want.</p><p>We need to make sure that we use an identifiable donor and we file the relevant paperwork, and if we do we will get full parentage.  It was intended as a nudge and to avoid the all-or-nothing approach that we currently have for at-home procedures, which means that people will have nothing if they do not protect identities.  There is a safety net element as well.</p></speech>

As a member of this committee, I have come through the birth, information and tracing legislation and sat with very many groups and individuals over the last year.  There is no desire to deny identity and to have that full transparency.  However, we have a difficulty when it comes to retrospectively dealing with children who are already in existence.  Having a framework is very important as we go forward, but we need to have this.  We need to deal fairly with people who went out and operated within the legal framework that existed in other countries yet now find themselves in Ireland.  Their children need to be recognised.  I think we will be obliged to have a transition period which deals with that retrospectively and then sets up a framework that incentivises transparency of identity and is transparent when it comes to the conception circumstances of any child.  In my experience of groups, there is no desire to withhold that information.  I appreciate that there are some countries and clinics where that is not possible.  I believe we can put systems in place to require the affidavit and the information in line with the systems that already exist.</p></speech>

Citizenship and inheritance are situations where one gets a divergence between the impact of parentage and guardianship.  Potentially, one could build a workaround on that into the legislation.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility.</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Moore mentioned the question of children making decisions for their parents down the line.  Even though we use the term "next of kin" in a day-to-day context, it has no legal status at the moment.  Even in cases of children who are recognised and where there is a full relationship, parentage currently does not give a legal right to make decisions for parents down the line.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which is just about to be commenced, is the legislative framework that deals with this sort of issue and would be the home for addressing this question.  However, it does not have a direct bearing on the question of guardianship versus parentage under current law.</p></speech>

As Senator Seery Kearney has said, we did the best we could with what we had.  At the time, some people went ahead and used donors but identifiable donors were not available.  That issue will definitely have to be addressed.  Nobody did anything wrong.  They did the best they could at the time.</p> <p>  As an organisation, we welcome the publication of Professor O'Mahony's report.  When I met him in person, I told him so.  It is great to have a framework in place where we know the best interests of our children.  As parents we know but it is good to have it there as well and the publication eliminates any doubt.  The best practice for children is to have a right to their identity and that is what we try to provide.</p> <p>  I will talk about how I do it as a mother in talking to Ted and Elsie.  I really believe that from an early age these conversations need to be had.  Ted and Elsie are my twins and they are two years old now.  If they grow up knowing everything that they know about their story, that is the healthiest possible thing for them.  We talk to them daily.  We tell them that mummy's tummy was broke and that I needed a lovely lady to carry them for me.  Ivana is our much loved surrogate and we are in regular contact with her.  We call Ivana their tummy mummy because she carried them for the nine months of pregnancy.  Ted and Elsie very much know that during that time they were inside Ivana's tummy.  That deals with one element of surrogacy and the carrying of a child.</p> <p>  It is important to try to establish a relationship with the surrogate.  Ms Merrigan has a fantastic relationship with her surrogate Lydia, as I do with Ivana.  We are in constant contact, exchange pictures of our families and give each other advice.  It really is a fantastic relationship to cultivate.  When we talk about pregnancy partnerships during pregnancy, that is really important because the relationship continues to be built for the children.  We want our children to be able to know what happened.  My children say, yes, Mammy, I was in Ivana's tummy, and she is our tummy mummy and you are my mummy.  That works for us.</p> <p>  In terms of donor identity, Ted and Elsie were born through donor-assisted human reproduction.  They very much know that story as well.  We broke the information down into basic details.  We have told them that I needed an egg because all of my eggs were cracked and did not work and, therefore, we had to get a lovely lady's egg.  In terms of the basis of trying to talk to our children about this matter, we very much want to do that.  As an organisation, we try to show people best practice and make sure the language used suits the children.  I do not know if these are the right things to say.  This is what I do as a mammy.  I am not saying it is perfect; I am saying it is the way my children respond to it.</p> <p>  In order to move forward with identifiable donors, I was lucky that at the time I was able to get donor identity to be released to Ted and Elsie at the age of 18.  We now know that this practice is not what is recommended.  If I was in that position again, I would first fight for them to have a recognisable donor or I would go somewhere to make sure that was the case.  Now that we have this information, we are able to put it into practice.  That is what we want from the legislation going forward.  We want to make sure we have a clear understanding for everyone involved.</p></speech>

We are very much in favour of the donor registry that was put in place through the Children and Family Relationships Act and all provisions that have been put in place through surrogacy.  If there are situations where that is not possible, or where identifiable donors are not available, I would reframe the awarding of parentage as follows: the awarding of equality to the child should not be withheld because of decisions that were made before their conception and are outside of their hands.  I think we need to continue to reframe it around the children's access to equality, to equal status before the law and the State, and to a family life.</p> <p>  In terms of the discussion around the assessment of parents, I am not sure if it is appropriate for me to ask Professor O'Mahony a question.  On the assessment of parents and aligning that concept with adoption rather than what already happens in terms of assessment or lack thereof with IVF, IUI and other assisted human reproduction treatments, especially when the recommendation is that parents availing of surrogacy must have a biological link in the case of international surrogacy, I question why the alignment went with adoptions rather than with what already happens in practice with other assisted human reproduction procedures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#J00600"><p>I will make a brief point about what happens if the ethical framework we strive to build for surrogacy is not adhered to.  My academic view is that if we put all of this effort into building an ethical framework for surrogacy, we need to consider what happens if and when certain intended parents do not adhere to all of the elements of that framework.</p><p> In other countries, the consequence would be that people are simply not entitled to parentage in the way we have seen many families have that experience under the Children and Family Relationships Act, where the specific criteria are not met.  My reading of Dr. O'Mahony&rsquo;s report, which he can correct if necessary, is that by allowing for guardianship to be awarded in certain circumstances, we are giving the court more options.  It is not simply a case of saying, &ldquo;No parentage and go home&rdquo;, but rather a case of saying, &ldquo;Here are some other options.&rdquo;  We need to emphasise that any determination would be made in the best interests of the child.  After assessing the full circumstances and whatever has happened in the surrogacy arrangement, the decision is made on the basis of the best interests of the child.  The more options we can give our courts in making those determinations, the better, so it is not a case of saying, &ldquo;Just go home&rdquo; and saying that no legal parentage is awarded.  We need to consider what we want our framework to look like but also the consequences if that framework is not adhered to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#K00200"><p>I might reply to that because it covers both points.  The way Dr. Bracken has described it is exactly what I was aiming for so we would not go down that all or nothing route.  As I said earlier, it is trying to give a nudge.  If it is the case, and I have no reason to think otherwise, that parents all believe identity is important, then hopefully they will do everything they can to use identifiable donors and to make sure the records are kept, and so on.  In that event, the issue of guardianship simply does not arise and it is not part of the conversation.  It was trying to have that nudge in there because, otherwise, while we talk about that idea of equality, we are just trading one risk for another.  If we say there is no consequence to not complying with that, what we are likely to see is more children for whom the identity records are not available.  It is about trying to find a balance.  There are so many different and competing considerations at times.  What I was attempting to do was to construct a framework that will balance them all as best as possible.</p> <p>  Ms Cohalan made a reasonable point that adoption was not the best example to use, particularly given that the process will be court-based in any event.  The better comparator would probably be where somebody goes to court seeking guardianship in the sense that, if somebody goes to court seeking to be appointed a guardian, a judge will have to make that decision as to whether it is in the best interests of the child to appoint this person, as Dr. Bracken just said.  In any of those circumstances, there will be an assessment by a judge of what is best for the particular child and whether a relationship with his parent is best for this child.  It is a case of putting in place a filtering mechanism to guard against the worst things that might happen.  In the vast majority of cases, they will not happen but the risk still exists that there may be people seeking to use international surrogacy to acquire children for purposes that we might not want.  The fact there would be this filter of having to go before a judge and convince the judge that this is all above board provides a level of protection against that risk.  Again, in the vast majority of cases when dealing with intending parents who very deeply want to have a child for all the right reasons, as with current guardianship applications, that would be a process where the judge should be able to satisfy himself or herself of that relatively easily.</p></speech>

Her story was very refreshing, particularly regard in to identity with the child.  I welcome that.  We need to hear the real stories and that is very important for all of us.</p> <p>  I have several questions.  I apologise that I was late but I was attending oral questions to the Taoiseach, and I am not sure if some of my questions were asked.  This issue falls under the three Departments of Justice, Transport and Health but, surprisingly, not the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is very important that we have a separate committee to discuss this.  While we do not have a roadmap, what are the witnesses&rsquo; hopes for the special joint Oireachtas committee on international surrogacy?  What do they hope to achieve from this?</p> <p>  My second question is to Dr. O'Mahony on his report.  I want to ask about the approaches taken in different countries.  Does he think the discussion on corruption and exploitation is helpful?  He suggests Irish surrogacy over international surrogacy in the report, and he might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  On the question of family through surrogacy, my understanding is that six regular couples in Ireland are going to Ukraine on their surrogacy journey.  Are they getting the support they need, given the political situation?</p> <p>  My last question is for Equality for Children.  In 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Act was passed.  What has happened since its commencement in May 2020?  How can we learn from this legislation to strengthen the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill?  I again thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

On the specialist committee that is coming up, we want it to look at all aspects of surrogacy but we want it to keep in mind that these are real families we are talking about.  These are ordinary, everyday people &ndash; nurses, teachers and farmers - who have found themselves in a situation, through no fault of their own, where they have to avail of surrogacy to complete their families.  For us, surrogacy is a medical treatment and an answer to a medical problem, which is very important to remember.  It is not a choice; it is a medical treatment.  With so many advances in medical treatment, we are very privileged and honoured to be able to create our family in this way.</p> <p>  By no means do we feel entitled to do so.  We just feel absolutely delighted that we can, given situations like those mentioned by Ms Merrigan in her opening statement.  We have members who have cystic fibrosis and members who have congenital heart defects.  In my own situation, my first little girl was stillborn.  We really need to get across that it is not a choice.  It is 100% our only option to create a family.</p> <p>  In terms of what we want, our asks are very simple.  We absolutely want a pathway to parenthood for the mother or second parent of children who are already born.  That is really important to us.  As we talked about previously with Dr. O'Mahony and Senator Seery Kearney, we want an amnesty if the criteria do not meet expectations going forward.  We need to make sure that these children are not left behind and that we have that pathway to parenthood.  We want all parties protected.  As we said earlier, we want our children protected.  We want our amazing surrogates protected because they are doing this for us.  We want a future route for parents of future children who are going to be born.  As Dr. O&rsquo;Mahony said, whether it is domestic or international, it is still going to happen and international surrogacy is very much still going to happen.  We believe those people are entitled to parenthood.</p> <p>  We cannot underestimate the power of language in what guardianship gives people and what parenthood gives people.  Once we break it down, we are very much their parents, and guardianship just never seems enough because of the fact it ends at 18.  That is a real bugbear for us as families.  We really want to make sure that we are recognised as their parents and to let the children have that.  Our children need to know that it is not going to stop at 18.  It gives them a sense of security and stability and it is a lifelong commitment to them that we have all made.</p> <p>  We want international surrogacy recognised and we want that for a reason.  If it is recognised, safeguards will be put in place that will protect our surrogates.  There will be situations where we can assist the process.  It is very important for that reason.  We also want an ethical framework for everybody involved.</p> <p>  Our hope for today's meeting is a little different.  What we want from this is to separate those two issues.  There is, of course, a conversation that needs to be had around international surrogacy and it is a very important conversation.  At the end of the day, however, there is a conversation about the children who are living, breathing Irish citizens who are here now - our families.  We want to get across the need for them to be protected now as opposed to them being bundled in together with international surrogacy and what that means.  If I could just show committee members the faces of the children all going through different stages in life, from newborn babies up to children who are coming to 18 years old, I would.</p><p>The time is nearly gone and it will be too late for us to establish a legal relationship with those, which is absolutely not what we want as parents.  I reiterate that we want to separate the two issues.  We want the children's rights, of the children who are here and now, to be recognised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#L00200"><p>I will make a quick point about a matter that has arisen in a couple of the recent contributions.  I refer to the question of how will recognition be given to surrogacy arrangements that have already happened.  In my report there are recommendations that we have been discussing about that question of needing to have the identity aspect covered in order to qualify for full parentage.  On page 43 of my report it is specified that that would not be a requirement for the retrospective cases simply because people would not have known it at the time.  I clarify that for retrospective declarations under my proposals it is, essentially, that transitional arrangement that we have already discussed and that the identity requirement would only be for future cases.</p> <p>  I was asked about domestic versus international and why would we want to incentivise people to engage in surrogacy here rather than abroad.  This is for a couple of reasons.  We are having a discussion here today where all of the contributors are very much in favour of putting in place laws that will facilitate people to engage in surrogacy be it domestic or international.  That is the tenor of the discussion today but that is not a view which is universally shared.  There are people who have very significant concerns and even objections to all of this.  Consequently, in any laws that we do introduce, we need to do two things.  First, from a legal point of view, we need to ensure that we comply with Ireland's international law obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights.  We must put in place the highest standards with respect to what we are required to do under those commitments. </p> <p>  Those laws also need to assuage the concerns of those who might oppose their enactment.  From that point of view, when we talk about how can we regulate surrogacy in a way that we best ward off the potential risks to children's rights, surrogate mothers, intending parents and all parties involved, we always need to be cognisant of the fact that we can pass laws governing what happens here in Ireland and that we cannot pass laws governing what happens in other jurisdictions.  Equally, there is a reality with international arrangements, as the English High Court has observed in some of the cases that it has dealt with, that by the time the child arrives in the jurisdiction it is often a little late in the day to try to do things to address anomalies that have arisen earlier in the process.  This is the reason for the recommendations around the domestic process, in that if we try to have people engage in surrogacy in Ireland rather than abroad, we can put in place a framework where we have full control over the laws governing that.  We can put in place the highest standards to protect the rights of all parties.  We can also have that pre-conception part of the process where people go before the courts seeking authorisation before the process begins and that has two advantages.  One is that it can avoid problems before they arise, that is, before the child is born rather than after.  Second, from the parents' point of view, it means that parentage transfers immediately from the moment of birth and one does not get that in-between period.  We can do all of that in a domestic framework.  It is an advantageous process for those reasons and, therefore, it is good if we can incentivise people to do it here under that process, which is better for the child and the parents and allows us to ward off the risks more effectively.  Once people go outside of the jurisdiction one enters a situation where we do not have full control over the framework governing the process.  Our laws, in a sense, do not even become involved until the child has already been born.  As more things can go wrong in an international arrangement, that is why I recommended a domestic arrangement.</p> <p>  For all that, I reiterate that we still need to make a provision for the international pathway simply because we are a small country and there will always be a limited availability of surrogates.  No matter what we have as a domestic framework there will still be people bringing children home to Ireland having engaged in international surrogacy.  That is the reality and we cannot continue to keep our head in the sand on that.</p></speech>

As Professor O'Mahony has outlined, it is an all or nothing approach.  There are prospective arrangements for any child born after May 2020 if he or she met the criteria, that is, was conceived in a Irish fertility clinic either through IUI, IVF or reciprocal IVF, if he or she was conceived using either a traceable or a known sperm donor and the child was born in Ireland for same-sex female couples.  Since that Act has been commenced hundreds of families have had automatic rights and the automatic relationship between the children and parents recognised upon birth.  For those children, the details of their conception and their donors are put forward for the national donor registry.  Those families are recognised as equal families before the law in Ireland.</p> <p>  Some people have referred to an amnesty but there were retrospective provisions outlined in the Act once it commenced.  Families who did not meet those criteria but met other criteria, that is, if they were conceived in an Irish or an international clinic through IUI, IVF or reciprocal IVF, either using anonymous or traceable sperm donors and were born in Ireland, then those children and those families were able to apply for what is called a declaration of parentage through the courts system.  Again, hundreds of families have availed of that opportunity and now have their families recognised as equal before the law.</p> <p>  There were anomalies.  The impact of that, while a very joyful and welcome provision and an Act that was commenced in 2020, it also has left many families, including my own out of the legislation, and in some cases for seemingly incomprehensible reasons.  For example, a lot of the legislation is built around the child's right to his or her identity.  In our own case, we specifically chose to have a known donor in our conception for that purpose so that our child would always know who their donor was.  If one had a known donor and conceived or had one's child before May 2020 then one was left out.  If one had a known donor after May 2020 then one were provided for, so that is a very strange anomaly in the legislation.  Equally, I refer to those families who conceived children outside of clinical settings.  As I am sure all the members are aware, in the case of same-sex partnerships, marriage and couples, fertility is not always the reason they cannot conceive children and they do not necessarily need the services of a fertility clinic to conceive a child using a donor.  Those cases are also left out of the Act.  For the children who were born outside of Ireland, a child can be born outside of Ireland purely through happenstance such as early delivery while on holiday or for many other reasons.  A child who was born outside of Ireland is also left out of the provisions.</p> <p>  The impact has led to a split in the already marginalised community.  Historically, the LGBTQ+ community has been marginalised and discriminated against in Ireland.  Now it is further so, by splitting people into two groups, people who qualify for tier 1 parentage and those who do not meet the criteria.  We will see the impact of that over the years and it is already very evident. </p> <p>  Finally, I refer to the Children and Family Relationships Act in respect of identifiable donors.  In terms of equality for children, we fully support children having access to information on their genetic origins.  In some cases, families have embryos in clinics in Ireland and abroad that were created prior to the commencement of the Act, which may not meet the criteria around identifiable requirements.  In those cases a very short period was put into the Act during which families had to use or lose their embryos, which seems like a very harsh approach to take.  We have many families in our community where they have children who were able to avail of retrospective provisions through the Children and Family Relationships Act.</p><p>They will have identical siblings born to them in the future who will not be able to avail of that equality simply because they were not conceived or born on time or within the timeframe of the Act.  That is another gap that maybe needs to be addressed within that.</p></speech>

It will be very important that we look at the length of that assessment.  When we look at adoption at the moment, I hear of couples spending two or three years going through the adoption process.  Again, if it was to be a very prolonged assessment process, that would then drive parents overseas to carry out their journey.</p> <p>  There was a question on the current political situation in Ukraine and the couples who are currently engaged in their journeys over in Ukraine.  It is correct there are a number of couples there and I think there are close to 14 babies due to be born by the end of May in Ukraine.  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and Senator Seery Kearney for all their assistance with all the families currently going through the process in the next couple of months.  They are being a huge support to them.  I hear from couples who are on the ground at the moment waiting on the birth of their children that things are very calm over there.  Their clinics are being supportive and the embassy is as well.  I thank the Minister and Senator for that.</p></speech>

There has been a huge amount of information, with much to take in and digest and I am relatively new to this issue.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The first relates to what Professor O'Mahony was talking about, namely, what could be referred to as funnelling and coming back to this issue of parentage versus guardianship.  Dr. Bracken mentioned in her opening statement that one of the things the regulation must ensure is that a child does not experience discrimination due to the circumstances of his or her conception.  Does she foresee that if there were a differentiation between guardianship and parentage, that would meet the threshold of discrimination from her perspective or does she think it would still be allowable to be that funnelling, as it were, towards domestic surrogacy?</p> <p>  We were talking about the right to identity and the identifiable donors.  In real-life experiences, do surrogates tend to want to have that connection going forward?  I imagine there would be quite a few instances where they go through that parenting journey or that journey.  I am not sure of the terminology so I hope I am not offending anyone.  Once the baby is born, is there usually an expectation that relationship would end for some of them?  Is it difficult to find someone who would consent to being identifiable and giving her information to a child?  I am wondering if that could be a difficult criterion to meet.</p> <p>  The parents today have been fantastic advocates.  Are there any advocacy groups that represent surrogates or are there children born from surrogacy who are old enough to be advocates for themselves and to tell us their story?  I am just wondering whether their stories are available to be heard either in Ireland or internationally.</p></speech>

I will give my own personal experience.  As I mentioned, we started our surrogacy journey in Canada.  We had an amazing surrogate who tried to support us in conceiving a child or children for us.  It did not work out.  She continued to try to help other families and did have surrogate children with them.  Her preference was to have an ongoing relationship with the family, as in to understand the various milestones that would be achieved, such as going to cr&egrave;che, school etc.</p> <p>  In the case of the surrogate who supported us to have our three children, she is, as I mentioned, a personal friend.  She was a gestation surrogate, meaning she had no biological link to our children.  In fact, she was of a completely different race and colour to our three white, pasty Irish babies but when they were born she held them in the hospital.  She stayed in the hospital with us while her postnatal care was being looked after.  She has frequently visited us here in Ireland.  She feels absolutely connected to our family but absolutely no connection to our children from a biological or maternal perspective.  She would always say her relationship is primarily with me as her friend and my husband as my husband and that her relationship with the children is entirely distinct and separate from that.  That is just anecdotal evidence from our perspective.</p> <p>  I participate in many forums for intended parents and people within the surrogacy community.  My general impression is the majority of surrogates I have heard from who speak within those forums will say they want to have some sort of connection to the family post birth.  The level of that connection will vary according to circumstances like how busy everybody is, time zones, locations, language etc.  My understanding is that typically surrogates want some sort of connection to the family they have helped and the children they have conceived.</p> <p>  With respect to official advocacy groups for either surrogates or the children conceived through surrogates, I do not believe there are groups available.  I am certainly not aware of them.  There are informal groups where surrogates communicate with each other, where surrogates communicate with surrogates and the intended parents, and there are probably such groups for children who have been conceived through surrogates.  However, I am not aware of any actual advocate groups that exist.  I hope that gives the Deputy some insight and useful information.</p></speech>

I and Cathy went through the process in Ukraine and we both have very good relationships with our surrogates.  There is still ongoing contact on roughly a weekly basis at least.  Obviously however, not everybody wants this from the surrogate, not every surrogate wants to keep in contact and not every intended parent wants to keep in contact with their surrogate either.  What we believe is in the best interest of the child is that we try to keep up that relationship with our surrogate.</p> <p>  Percentage-wise, it was a question I asked the clinic I was dealing with in Ukraine.  I was told approximately 40% of all parents keep in contact with their surrogate and have a good relationship, but it obviously has to be a consensual relationship.  Again, at the beginning of this process you meet your surrogate and it can be a question and a conversation you can have at the beginning of the process, before you decide whether to move forward, to know and to get her feelings on that beforehand.  It would be an important conversation to have.</p> <p>  There are not necessarily any advocacy groups in Ireland for surrogates at the moment.  There are online forums for surrogates and for intended parents.  In terms of our own group, we certainly have good contact with some surrogates domestically and internationally who would be very happy to speak to the committee on this matter.  Internationally, they are following our campaign, watching it very closely and have been passing on their remarks.  They are deeply offended in terms of media and things like that so they would be very happy to come and speak to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#N00100"><p>I will respond to the question on how we avoid discrimination against children based on the circumstances of their conception.  That refers to the very limited situation where, in our new ethical framework for surrogacy, if the criteria are not met, a court might be able to award either parentage or guardianship in a particular situation based on the best interests of the children.  That would come down to a policy decision that needs to balance the best interests of children in general by maintaining the integrity of that ethical framework with the best interests of that particular child who is subject to the case that is ongoing.  Ultimately the decision will come down to the best interests of that particular child when the court has balanced the various factors.  In that way, if guardianship was to be awarded in that particular instance, I would not view that as discrimination against a child, in particular when guardianship, as was already outlined, is really the mechanism that gives parents the ability to make decisions for their children and to undertake that caring role, although I fully appreciate it is not equivalent to parentage in any way.  Again, it comes back to the policy decision of how we balance the rights of children in general with the interests of that particular child, which comes down to what our legislation will look like ultimately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#N00200"><p>When we talk about legal principles about non-discrimination, the law treats people differently all the time in all sorts of scenarios.  An assessment in an individual case of whether a particular classification violates non-discrimination principles comes down to that question of whether it has a legitimate policy goal it is trying to achieve, whether it goes further than necessary in achieving that and so on.  In that respect, the idea it is saying guardianship rather than nothing at all is the idea of trying not to go any further than necessary.</p> <p>  If you go the alternative route of saying that everyone gets parentage irrespective of whether identity is protected or not, that creates a different inequality.  It creates an inequality where some children have a right to identity and some do not.  My thinking was trying to create a scenario where as many children as possible got both parentage and identity protected.  My thinking was the scenario most likely to achieve that was the one laid out in the report, because for all the reasons we have heard today, people want parentage - that is what they want - and therefore people would opt for that.  The guardianship thing in the background was just something to try to nudge them in that direction and that the number of people who might end up using it would be smaller than the number of children who might be born without an accessible right to identity in the other situation.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for sharing their experiences.  Each one of them has made me think about the challenges they face.  This can be a very contentious issue and it evokes very strong emotional reactions.  The idea of a woman undergoing pregnancy to give birth to somebody else's child challenges all our traditional notions of what being a mother is and what motherhood and parenthood are.  It has emotional and ethical challenges for us all.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, some having been answered already, on jurisdictions that would be an ideal model.  Ms Merrigan, I think, mentioned the UK, New York, whose bill of rights I will look up, and Greece.  What violations might children born through surrogacy face if international surrogacy is not regulated?  What age do the witnesses think is suitable?  Do the witnesses wish for the legal guardianship to continue past the age of 18 years?  Would they want to see that go to 21 or 23 years?  Is there a specific age to which they would increase that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022020100002#N00400"><p>The risk of not regulating international surrogacy and the violations of children's rights would occur would be that we would continue the scenario we have currently.  It is as simple as that.  At the moment, we have no laws at all on international surrogacy.  If we leave that out of the Bill, we continue the current unsatisfactory situation.</p> <p>  Age and the extension of guardianship is a complicated thing.  Guardianship is not something that arises only in the context of surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction.  If you were to rethink guardianship, it would be a much broader family law reform measure.  That is probably not the way to think about it.  The way to think about it is about trying to secure parentage as being the model for as many people as possible because parentage is a lifelong status.  Guardianship is a different kind of thing.  If you were to start reforming guardianship, it is not something that is limited to assisted human reproduction; it is much wider.</p></speech>

I would like to address the damage done to children as a result of not being legally recognised as the children of both their parents or their intended parents.  Earlier, we discussed a significant number of matters around medical issues, foreign travel, accessing passports, tax and inheritance, so we have addressed a significant number of the issues that occur daily for our families.  What we have not had an opportunity to think or talk about is how our children are classified as inferior to the children who live next door to them because, although they are born typically to married parents, they are considered to have only one parent.</p> <p>  On a personal level, my children are very young.  As I mentioned, our oldest twins are three and a half years, yet they are already starting to realise some of the differences between them and the families around them.  They have already recognised, obviously, that they do not have a mother, but as life goes on they will see scenarios where their family is treated in an inferior way.  If we want to go on a family holiday and my husband is already abroad, I will need a letter from him to bring my children out of the jurisdiction.  They will see scenarios where I will have to tick the guardian box on certain application forms rather than the parent box.  There will be all sorts of subtle differences that emerge as the children grow older.  As they get older, their understanding and perception of those differences will become very tangible and real.</p> <p>  It is my belief, having grown up as a gay man in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, when it was illegal for me to be gay, that when you are treated by the State as an inferior person, you actually take on certain disadvantages, either emotionally or psychologically, from being treated in a second-class, different or inferior way.   Even though the differences for our children are probably less pronounced than those that existed for me as a gay man, they do exist, the children will be aware of them and they will, I believe, have an impact on them.  The level of impact has never been quantified but it will have an impact on them for them to know their family unit is valued somewhat less by the State than other family units around them.  I cannot quantify it other than the examples we have given but it is definitely a real scenario that has been addressed by psychologists over the years.  When you label somebody as different and inferior, it does impact them.</p></speech>

Even to go outside the jurisdiction, to go up North, you have to have permission to take the child out of the Irish jurisdiction, so it can be difficult.  How are the birth mothers of the surrogates looked after emotionally after giving birth to a child?</p></speech>

When we were deciding where to go to create our family, we looked at the clinics and the countries which had the best protections in place for the surrogate.  One of the things that we also worried about was that psychological impact on the surrogate.  There is the physical act of giving birth and one&rsquo;s brain, emotions and everything need time to catch up with that.  We chose a clinic which offered support to the surrogate after she had given birth.  It was very important to us that she had access to counselling before and after birth, if she needed that.  I have been told that some surrogates do not wish to avail of this but it was very important to us to safeguard the fact that if she needed it, there would be support there for her.</p></speech>

Our children were born in the UK where surrogacy legislation exists.  That enabled the hospital to enact certain procedures for the birth of the surrogate child, such as offering the surrogate a separate room post birth, for her recovery and a separate midwife to visit her at home.  In Ireland, because there is no surrogacy legislation, the person who gives birth, no matter what the circumstances are, is the legal mother.  As a result of that she is forced to stay in the hospital until her child can be discharged and is forced to stay in the general ward for recovery with the child in a crib beside her, which some surrogates are very comfortable to do but some do not want.  We have already spoken to the HSE on this and they cannot and do not enact separate policies and procedures because it is simply not on the legislative books.  The lack of legislation means that the surrogates are forced to take on roles in the hospital setting they often do not want to take on.</p></speech>

First, I thank all the witnesses today in what certainly have been very informative, engaging and personal contributions from many of those in attendance.   For those who see surrogacy as their only option in creating a family, this is an area of great importance which I fully support.</p> <p>  Last year I was exposed to the whole international surrogacy issue when a couple within my constituency were looking for support to access an emergency travel certificate from the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the whole process around DNA testing which had to be done before the certificate was issued, combined then with the legal documentation.  That took six to seven weeks where both parents were abroad with their family at home.  That created significant anxiety and uncertainty about bringing that newborn child back into Ireland and to a loving home.  The emotional strain which that caused this family, in what should have been a joyous occasion, was something that stood with me.  That happened last year and I am glad we have our invited guests here before the committee to continue the discussion on this topic.  </p> <p>  On the proceedings for a declaration of parentage, can I hear a personal account or more information as to what that actually consists of?  As I do more research in this area, I receive a real understanding of the complexity and process in respect of what needs to be overhauled.  Professor O&rsquo;Mahony spoke about different frameworks but I am sure these frameworks expand into the Departments of Justice, Health, Foreign Affairs, and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  What would our witnesses like to see, or are the immediate short- or long-term legislative changes that are needed as we look towards furthering or strengthening our legislation in this area, which at present creates a very significant vacuum for many families?  What are the expectations they have in this regard?</p> <p>  I compliment my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, on her work to date within our party as she has been to the fore on this topic.  I would like to gain an understanding on this from our witnesses' point of view.</p></speech>

As Ms Merrigan had indicated I will bring her in first but I wish to say to all of our witnesses that apart from answering those questions, if there are any concluding remarks or if there is anything they would like to say but have not had the opportunity to do so, now is the time.  I will give everyone some individual time for that.  We will start with Ms Merrigan and we will then have Professor O&rsquo;Mahony..</p></speech>

My answer to this question will probably double up neatly on what I would have said in my closing statement in any event, which is that I do not like to think of this so much in respect of a sequencing of priorities because the risk with that is that we end up doing things in a piecemeal way.  This is the opportunity that we have been waiting on for too long in order to address this in a holistic way and to do everything, not just to do some of it.  It has taken us years to get to this point.  Deputy Bacik made the point earlier on that she was on a committee many years ago at this stage, 15 years ago, looking at this issue and it failed to get it done.</p> <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 failed to get everything done.  We had a Supreme Court decision in 2014 in which the Attorney General made a commitment to the Supreme Court at that time that the Oireachtas was planning on legislating to address these issues.  That has still not happened.  My real sense of all of this is if not now, when?  Anything that gets left out now could stay left out for an awfully long time.  The real message I want to leave the committee with is that we cannot afford to decide that certain things are for now and certain things are for later because later could be a considerable time later and all one is doing then is replicating the same problems that we have been storing up to now.  As this is a chance to do everything, we need to have a holistic Bill that covers all of the angles.</p></speech>

We, Irish Families Through Surrogacy and Equality for Children, are groups that were set up as entirely volunteer-led organisations to raise the profile of our families and to get this issue resolved.  For us, getting this opportunity to tell our stories in this format and forum is greatly appreciated.  As a group we work very hard.  We are all full-time parents and many of us have full-time jobs.  We do a great deal of work late at night, exchanging emails and making calls well after 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.  We would greatly appreciate any support that the committee could offer us in furthering our cause.</p> <p>  I would like to ask one short question of Professor O&rsquo;Mahony, if that was possible, on an issue that was raised by Senator Seery Kearney on retrospective provisions for children already born.  He has already clarified that identity and donor information will not be a criterion for retrospective recognition to be applied but will any other criteria apply?  What about the children who were born abroad to Irish parents who only ever come here on holidays?  Will they be recognised?  What about the children who are now aged 18 years or over?  Will there be an opportunity for them to be able to establish a legal connection with their parents?  Is it the case that any children who were conceived before a certain date will automatically get their retrospective allocation of links to their parents, regardless of the conception method, the location of their birth etc?  I think it would be beneficial to have a short input from Professor O&rsquo;Mahony, and from anyone else who is willing to make a contribution, just that we might understand how that retrospective piece might work.</p></speech>

It is supposed to be the members of the committee engaging directly with witnesses.  Much of what has been raised by Mr. Kenny Moore may pertain to the new committee on surrogacy.

On behalf of the committee, I thank everyone very sincerely.  It was a really good discussion, and very interesting.  As these are public hearings, it will be good for people who do not understand many of the issues even to hear some of the day-to-day challenges, such as hospitalisation and vaccines.  People would not even think about that.  It is something many parents take for granted and would not even think twice about.  When you give practical everyday examples such as that, it resonates with people.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, it is very emotional.  It is not easy to come into a public forum and share your story.  It is not something that anybody probably envisaged doing, both in terms of the witnesses' own children and being excellent advocates for them</p> <p>  In terms of our work, there will be another D&aacute;il committee specifically in relation to this topic.  This was a good starting point for some of that work for all of us to learn from.  It is hoped that work will get started fairly soon.</p> <p>  I sincerely thank everyone again.  I agree to a certain extent that much of the talk has to come to an end soon and there has to be action.  Given some of the significant stories of people with medical issues or cancer in the family right now, they and their children need answers.  It is relatively early in 2022.  It is to be hoped this will be the year when we will see action.  There is a real sincerity, particularly in this committee.  Everybody is very much on board and wants to see this happening.</p> <p>  I thank everyone for their time and for the engagement with all of the questions and answers.  Is it agreed to publish the opening statements on the Oireachtas website?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Ms O'Rourke will be attending virtually.</p> <p>  Our witnesses are attending to assist the committee with our scrutiny of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Dr. Redmond to make a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. Crone, Ms O'Rourke, Mr. McKelvey and finally Ms O'Sullivan.  Their statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has an eight-minute slot to ask questions and receive answers.  I will call people to a halt after eight minutes or thereabouts.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish their opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Since Ms O'Rourke is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, she may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  She has already been advised of this.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed by the Chair to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Redmond to make a brief opening statement.  I ask witnesses to stick to three minutes each.</p></speech>

Our written submission to the committee sets out some key challenges faced by schools in allocating places in situations where there are more applicants than places in any given year.</p><p>A particular challenge relating to the committee's focus today is the fact that parents can, and increasingly do, accept offered places from more than one school, cancel applications late, fail to present in September, and-or fail to communicate with the school about their intentions.  We urgently need to address this anomaly if any real progress is to be made on the challenge of oversubscription.</p><p> It is important to recognise that current legislation and regulation around the enrolment process can present challenges to making timely provision for incoming students with special cognitive, physical or sensory needs.  For such applicants, our schools require a longer timeframe than the one year set out in the Bill.  That said, neither current legislation, nor indeed any legislation, can address the fact that, in some areas throughout the country, there is a shortage of school places.</p><p> What is certain is that, in oversubscription situations, the practice of prioritising siblings and children or grandchildren of past pupils arose from a concern for continuity of family experience and for the primacy of parental choice as protected in the Constitution.  Schools, like families, are not solely operational entities.  They thrive on relationships, values, continuity, local community cohesion and loyalties built up over time and, indeed, generations.</p><p> In terms of transparency, schools must declare the number of places being made available in first year.  They must admit all applicants if places are available and must specify the criteria that will be used if the school is oversubscribed.  All schools that were oversubscribed in the previous year must publish a breakdown of the total number of applications received and the number and order of offers made in that year by reference to each of the selection criteria.</p><p> Section 62(10)(a) of the Education Act 1998 allows schools to include a criterion based on a student's connection with the school by virtue of a sibling attending or having attended the school.  Section 62(10)(b) allows schools to include a criterion based on a student's connection to the school by virtue of his or her parent or grandparent having attended it.  The parent or grandparent criterion is subject to a maximum of 25% of the places being made available by the school.</p><p> It is important to note that there appears to be a misconception that, where schools choose to include the parent or grandparent criterion, 25% of the total number of places being made available are automatically set aside for qualifying applicants.  In our experience, very few schools reach the allowed cap of 25%.  The school may not be oversubscribed or the criterion may have been placed down the list of criteria so that it is not reached at all or, where reached, very few places remain to be allocated.</p><p> The JMB supports the retention of section 62(10)(b) and welcomes the committee's focus on oversubscription and the shortage of school places more generally</p></speech>

The NAPD is the professional association for post-primary school leaders and provides a united voice for principals and deputy principals on issues of common concern across all three post-primary sectors.  I am here to speak about the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020.</p> <p>  Education in Ireland is seen as an enabler, a means of personal development and a way towards self-improvement and personal fulfilment.  Our education system prides itself on promoting equality and inclusiveness and embracing diversity.  The local school for the local child builds a sense of belonging and ownership in the community in which the child lives.  The development of this stewardship builds the communities in which we live.</p> <p>  The vision for Irish education, as outlined in the Department of Education's 2021 statement of strategy, strives to give every student the same opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  This means that every student must be given equality of opportunity.  It is understandable that a school may wish to prioritise the children or grandchildren of past pupils, given that they have previous connections with the school, have contributed to the development of the characteristic spirit of the school and share common values.  However, the operation of this criterion with the potential to reserve 25% of places can have the consequence of excluding newcomers to the area, international children, members of the Traveller community and parents who may not have completed their own education yet value education for their children.</p> <p>  School boards of management are charged with deciding on the admission criteria for schools and many choose such criteria as having siblings who have already attended the schools, living in defined catchment areas or attending specific feeder schools.  It is likely that parents or grandparents who attended a school may still live in the local area, the applicant may have a sibling already in the school or an applicant may attend the local primary school.</p><p>In preparation for this hearing today, I sought and identified one post-primary school that operates the parent or grandparent criterion to use as an example.  I asked how many current first-year students relied on this criterion to gain access to the school.  The answer was none.  While many students had parents or grandparents who attended the school, all of the current first-year cohort qualified to be awarded a place under the other criteria operated by the school ahead of the parent or grandparent criterion.  This raised the question of the relevance of this criterion for this school.  This situation may well be replicated elsewhere throughout the country. </p><p> While I accept that this is a complex issue for some schools, the strength of our belief in the purpose or vision of Irish education to promote equality and inclusiveness will determine the decision required to adopt or reject the proposed Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020.  I thank the committee for its time.  I will be here to answer questions afterwards.</p></speech>

I am the director of schools for Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, and I represent ETBI today.  There are 250 post-primary schools in the ETB sector, of which 48 offer education through the medium of Gaeilge.  In addition, we have 27 community national schools within our remit.</p> <p>  When people walk into an ETB school, they walk into a school reflective of its own local community.  They might see signs on the corridor walls reading "co-educational", "multidenominational", "excellence in teaching and learning", "an inclusive school" or "a diverse school".  When the school bell rings and the students of an ETB school emerge onto the corridors, they will witness at first-hand a manifestation of those signs including: children emerging from a special educational setting, international students, children in receipt of learning support, children from Traveller backgrounds, students of various religious persuasions and none, refugee children and children living in the community.  They have to ask themselves how all of these students, representing such diversity, come through an admissions process and end up under one roof.  The answer is simple; in an ETB school, the school community is a reflection of those who live and work within its environs.  An ETB enrolment or admissions process is open.  We accept all and, where we are oversubscribed, we have criteria within our policies that are very much embedded in a spirit of supporting the members of the local community.  Yes, we have admissions criteria to support a fair and open admissions process.  These are used especially where we have an oversubscribed school.  These criteria are very much grounded in a community focus within the spirit of accepting all students and providing a welcome for everyone. </p> <p>  The parent or grandparent criterion is a cause of concern and ETBI would have no difficulty with its exclusion from the legislation.  Many siblings of current students, students from primary feeder schools and students in the recognised catchment area are, in fact, children of past pupils.  The enrolment of these students, when added to the 25% of places set aside for past pupils, often results in a far greater percentage of past pupils in the cohort of students in any incoming year group than would be representative of the local community.</p> <p>  While we have an opportunity today to consider the current Bill, it would help to give some consideration to all areas relating to admissions that are a cause of concern within the current legislation.  There is a loophole regarding applicants applying to more than one school in that there is nothing in the legislation to set out a timeline for when parents must tell the school that they are not accepting a place.  The Act does not allow schools that are not oversubscribed to refuse a student on the grounds of age.  This presents difficulties in respect of children coming into primary or secondary schools who have not reached the age laid out in the Department's regulations.  The Act does not allow for a principal or board of management to uphold its duty of care to the school community in the case of an applicant who poses a threat.  If the school has a place, such children must be accepted into the school.  This is all fine as long as all schools apply the Act in the same way but that has not always been our experience in the ETB sector.  The issue of twins, triplets and other siblings who seek to join a school in the same year group in the same year is a difficult one.  Should we treat their applications separately or together?  Either way, there is potential for discrimination.  The approval or sanction by the special educational needs officer, SENO, of a special class often comes after the annual admissions notice has been published and the admissions application window closed.  </p> <p>  ETB schools have an open and transparent approach to admissions.  While the parent or grandparent criterion does exist, it exists in only a very small number of ETB schools.  Where it does exist, it is so low down the list of criteria that it is not often used.  Indeed, many students of past pupils will be offered a place as a sibling of a current student, as a student of a feeder school or because they are from the catchment area.</p><p>As such, it would not be a cause of great concern to ETBI if it were removed, provided it were removed for all schools.</p></speech>

I am the assistant general Secretary with ACCS, the management body that works with 96 post-primary schools across the country.  ACCS welcomes many parts of the Bill or what has come with the Bill.  It has provided greater clarity and consistency in the drafting and application of admission policies in our schools. The transparency that comes with the annual admission notices is most welcome. The clear designation of the responsibilities of the various stakeholders is also welcome.  Section 66, on the co-operation between boards, is particularly welcome.  It has really assisted in the allocation of places where schools are oversubscribed.  For example, in one large urban area, there are three post-primary schools.  A total of 1,192 applications was received by those schools for 472 places.  Working together, the schools were able to bring the deficit down to 57 places from the figure of 1,192.  On the ground, schools are working hard and constructively to try to work on the issues around oversubscription.  The argument that we make in our submission is that schools are communities that are strengthened by strong family connections.  In our schools, attending parent criterion is not widely implemented at all.  In fact, in a survey of 67 schools, six schools stated that they included that as a selection criterion.  According to the survey, of the six schools, only one used it where students lived within the catchment area.  Most of our schools work on the basis that living within the catchment area and having siblings at the school are the main criteria, because community schools and comprehensive schools are schools for the local community.  Really, it is only where schools are hopelessly oversubscribed that they have to perform this balancing act.  In our submission, we reference the judgment of Judge Teehan in the Stokes v. Christian Brothers High School Clonmel &amp;amp; Anor case of 2011, where he talked about the role of school boards in seeking to strike such a balance between legitimate competing interests.  We argue that the role of boards in seeking to strike such a balance should not be removed.  We do so in the context of that judgment, which was made with some hesitation.  The hesitation highlights just how complicated and complex the issue is for schools.  We argue that the lack of school places in certain locations is the main issue here.</p></speech>

I represent NAMBSE, which represents the boards of management of special schools and mainstream schools with special classes all over the country.   Our schools work with and support students with SEN from the ages of four to 18.  These children may have mild, moderate, severe and profound disabilities.  They may have autism, social, emotional and behavioural difficulties and also complex medical needs.  The access to education and the well-being of our pupils is, as always, the central consideration of our boards of management.  Section 62(10)(b) of the Act, if applied to enrolment in special schools and special classes in mainstream schools, would be contrary to the centrality of the child's specific needs in the enrolment process.  Therefore, NABMSE supports the removal of this paragraph from the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.</p></speech>

Apologies for my late arrival; I had another engagement.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I think this is a most important issue.</p><p>From reading some of the submissions, I think that in a way it goes without saying, but it is worth putting on record, that yes, sometimes these issues only arise in the minority of cases but that is when enrolment policies matter.  In the vast majority of instances, school enrolment is fairly straightforward.  It is where there is high demand that it becomes a significant issue.  Not exclusively, but typically, that is in the large urban centres and the counties around Dublin.  I will put my questions to any of the witnesses who wants to respond.  </p><p> Some of the concerns that have been raised relate to the issue of continuity.  It has been said that family and connections inform the values of the school and the school community.  My own view on that is that while that is entirely legitimate and perhaps desirable, the key point is that it should not disadvantage a child who is in the local community.  Those are the potential circumstances that can arise and this Bill seeks to avoid them.  Such circumstances include cases where there is an oversubscribed school, there is a child in the community who has applied to go to the school, whose parents may not be from the locality or even the country originally, and they are in competition with a child who is not living as locally, whose parents did go to that school.  I know that family connections to schools matter.  I do not believe that they are of no value or should be discarded lightly.  However, the point is that the local child should be the key priority.  I ask for a response from the witnesses on that point.  </p><p> I do not have the submissions in front of me.  I ask the witnesses to correct me if I am wrong, but I think the JMB raised an interesting point on another issue relating to school admissions, namely, that there is a need for a two-year run-in for children with SEN who are trying to seek placements.  We have come across this issue in my own office in relation to the new disability teams trying to get up and running and the challenges that they have faced.  There have been cases where children have applied to get into a school but they do not have the educational placement assessment document.  It is an interesting idea and one that is worth exploring.  </p><p> As a final observation, not all the bodies represented here necessarily have dealings with primary schools, although obviously, ETBI does.  Another issue that I have come across in relation to school admissions at primary level is the inflexibility that exists around school planning areas.  In cases where a primary school is oversubscribed or is located on the very edge of a school planning area, a child from the far end of the school planning area - which can be quite large and take in several towns - has priority over a child who might live 2 km or 3 km away, but just falls on the wrong side of that line.  Obviously, that is an issue that only arises in circumstances where a school is oversubscribed, but I have come across it.  It comes up in areas where schools are oversubscribed, such as Cork, Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  I ask the representatives of the organisations that are dealing with primary schools for their observations on how that issue arises.  Perhaps it also applies in relation to secondary schools.  That is all I have for the minute.  Generally speaking, I agree with the objective of the Bill.  It is a straightforward Bill.  There is a value in preserving family connections, but for me, the local child has to be at the centre of things and they have to be given that highest priority.  That is how it should be.</p></speech>

Parents often feel that they have had a positive experience in the school themselves and they would like that experience for their child.  That is very real and positive.  However, it can indirectly or inadvertently result in discrimination against a child who lives directly outside the gate of the school and who is perhaps looking at that school for 12 years of their life.  It may be that they have to attend a primary school closer to where their grandparent lives because they are doing the childminding, but the child always intended to go to the local school.</p><p>That is an important and valid point, and one which should be central in decision-making.  Equality of access for local children to local school should be a priority.</p><p> Regarding SEN, that was not in the JMB but it is something very close to our hearts.  Planning for students with special educational needs starts in the October before they start school the following September.  Often, that means there is not enough time to collect reports, do what needs to be done and prepare and collaborate with all of the other schools and agencies in order to have a SEN plan, SNA or whatever else is needed.  I will not comment on primary schools as we are primarily concerned with secondary schools.</p></speech>

While we understand the importance of tradition and continuity, we would also make the point that even if this clause was removed from the legislation there would still be a large number of parents or grandparents in an area whose children will attend the school they did.  We have some statistics on this and found that the rule is very seldom used, yet a significant amount of parents still send their children to the school they went to.  There is a threshold above which schools do not need to have that policy enshrined in law in order to keep that continuity and consistency.</p> <p>  From an ETBI point of view, what worries us is equity and serving the local community.  The idea that the rights of a grandchild of someone who went to a school 70 years ago would trump those of a child who lives across the road from a school is wrong.  We understand the importance of continuity, but this is about a balance of rights rather than one right trumping another.  From an ETBI point of view, we are very much committed to serving local communities.</p> <p>  An important point was made by the Deputy on primary schools, and there is a piece of work to be done on that, in particular where a school falls on the edge of a planning area and the natural catchment area of the school does not concur with the planning area.  That is something that needs more scrutiny.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  It is interesting to hear their views and opinions.  While they differ slightly, addressing the balance of rights within a community and the ability of every child to have an opportunity to go to school in his or her community is uppermost.</p> <p>  Some 20% of schools have a problem with oversubscription.  The inference may be taken from the Bill tabled by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that this is an elitist issue and impacts on fee-paying schools.  However, my experience as a public representative, and having been a teacher, is that oversubscription was not an issue in fee-paying schools in terms of parents wishing to send their children to the schools they went to.  Rather, it was quite the opposite.  There are fee-paying schools in my area.  </p> <p>  Without a shadow of a doubt, we have to address the situation whereby parents make a number of applications to a number of schools and, in some cases, accept all of the offers and decide at the last minute which school to go to.  That leads to huge problems, in particular in areas where the Department of Education is trying to define the need for a new school.  In south Kildare it was hard to crunch the numbers.  I contacted sixth class children in primary schools to try to determine how many children were leaving primary school and how many were on waiting lists for different secondary schools.</p><p>The one-year timeframe is not sufficient, a point that was well made in the submission.  Applications need to be made from fifth class onwards.  </p><p> There has to be some type of central enrolment policy, which most primary schools within catchment areas already have.  That is key.  In some cases, principals get together informally.  The Department should take a lead on this.  It is doing that in south Kildare at the moment, in particular in the areas I outlined and because there is an agreement for a new school.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses as to how that could work.  It is crucial for the future.</p><p> The balance of rights has been mentioned.  That is important in terms of solidarity in a community.  As new families, be they new Irish or from different parts of Ireland, move to towns they need to be able to become part of a school community.  We cannot have a situation where they are, in effect, not allowed to become part of the community.  That is the key issue.</p><p> The timeline is important in terms of applications for schools.  In Newbridge, there are ninth and tenth round offers being made right into August, sometimes two weeks before school is due to start.  That is difficult for parents and students, in particular.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>

At school and board of management level, there is not a school in the country that is oversubscribed which likes to impose criteria on incoming applicants.  Criteria are, by definition, exclusionary and inclusionary.  The hierarchy of criteria is down to the local board of management.</p> <p>  In our experience, schools do not ring fence 25% of their places for the children of parents or grandparents.  In a survey we carried out in preparation for this meeting, 250 schools responded.  Of those that responded, 60% of schools of all types have this provision in their criteria, including many DEIS schools.  St. Kevin's College, Ballygall, New Cross College, Finglas, Mercy Secondary School, Inchicore, St. Paul's, North Brunswick Street, and St. Vincent's, Glasnevin, all have this criteria in their admissions policies.  Whether they apply it depends on the degree of oversubscription.  </p> <p>  Of the respondents that have this criterion in their admissions policies, 60% are oversubscribed.  In the final shake up, only 15 of the 250 schools that responded to the survey brought in 25% of their enrolment under that criterion.  A further 25 brought in single figures.  From our trawl of the voluntary secondary sector, 40 schools applied the criterion.  The majority of those only brought in single figures in terms of students.  In practice, the criterion is not at the apex of the selection criteria schools employ.  </p> <p>  Far from being an elitist provision that is designed to be exclusionary of local children, quite the opposite is the case in the schools our sectors represent here today.  Nationally, our schools are extraordinarily inclusive and welcoming of all students, in particular students in their local communities.  The simple fact is that capacity is the problem.  In many parts of the country, our schools do not have sufficient places to cater for all applicants.  That is where the problem lies.  Schools are not applying this criterion in an exclusionary way.  </p> <p>  In terms of special educational needs and enrolment, schools seem to be managing reasonably well with the current one-year provision, except for two situations.</p><p>The first concerns boarding schools, and the second, which is more universal, concerns students with special educational needs for whom the installation of certain infrastructure, such as lifts and ramps, requires a lead-in time.  As members have heard from my ETBI colleague, Mr. McKelvey, there may be circumstances in which a SENO presents a late assessment of need for a student.  That can be problematic, too.  However, that can be solved fairly straightforwardly.  What cannot be solved through universal provision is the fact that, in many parts of our country, schools are heavily oversubscribed and need to apply criteria.  They do not want to be in that position but they must apply the criteria.  When they do, they follow the law.</p></speech>

The two tests that apply to any legislation concern whether it solves a problem and whether it will result in unexpected consequences.  Interestingly, I played the admissions game on the way up on the train today.  Tramore is quite a good place to run this tote experiment.  It is an old town with an expanding young population that is creating demographic pressure on the school system.  There are schools of varying ages.  One is more than 100 years old, another is 50 years old and yet another is 30 years old.  There is also a newer school, which started up in the past decade or so.  It boils down to the questions of whether the right of those whose families have lived in the town for a longer period to access one of the two older schools trumps that of others living in the town and whether the right of access of someone living in the city of Waterford trumps that of a person living locally.  I find myself in that situation in that I am not from Tramore but from the neighbouring parish.  My team played Tramore in Gaelic games.  I would have lost out on the admissions game because there is pressure on places.  I do not believe the criterion under discussion is being applied to remove the pressure on cases, but I would have lost out because I am new to the parish, as the saying goes.  There is a legitimate question to be asked about the balance of rights because there is a genuine tradition in the case of the school that has been in existence for more than 150 years.  The school has serviced the town of Tramore for that period, and people have a deep and emotional connection with it, which I understand.  That is what we have to weigh up.  In weighing it up, I come back to the first test, that of whether we are solving a problem that exists.</p> <p>  I read the admissions policies of the schools in question.  There are four primary schools and one post-primary school in the town.  Two of the schools have the provision under discussion and three do not.  It is interesting that all the schools have their admissions policies online, but the admissions statements are not as easy to access.  Therefore, I could not see in black and white how often the provision had been applied and how many people it had applied to.  Do we have reliable figures on this?</p> <p>  Dr. Redmond talked about running a school survey.  A school survey is self-selecting in that whoever will gain access to the school will reply to it.  Do we have hard and fast figures on how many schools have the provision in question and the number of children it has been applied to on the State-wide level?  Can anyone provide me with a picture of the problem we are trying to solve?</p></speech>

I am referring to the gross data indicating the number of schools that actually have the provision in question, the number of those schools that are oversubscribed, the number of those that apply the criterion, and the outcomes.  We encourage the Department, with its warrant and authority, to produce a definitive survey and a final tranche of figures that reflect the contemporary position in schools across the country.  It is difficult.</p><p>Of course, 250 out of 380 involve self-selection.  By and large, the headline numbers may be at variance.  We carried out the survey following a request from the Department to find out how the data reflected the current situation.  It was at the height of a pandemic, when school principals were suffering an existential crisis in their schools.  Survey fatigue is a serious problem.</p><p> The Department recently carried out a survey on unmet need regarding teacher supply.  With the support of all the management bodies, it got a response rate of more than 90%.  I encourage the Department to replicate that exercise because that kind of response rate is very difficult for a management body to come by.  We encourage the production of data.</p><p> Working with unchecked assumptions carries the risk of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  We need to see how big the issue is.  However, I need to keep coming back to the straightforward fact that school capacity is the problem.  Schools do not want to apply criteria that are exclusionary, but any criterion they apply will, by definition, include some and exclude others.  Every parent wants the criterion to be the one that will benefit his or her child.  That is how I felt about my children, and that is the way members and everybody else in the country will feel.  The crisis is not of the schools' making; it is an infrastructure and investment problem that really needs to be addressed as a matter of national priority.</p></speech>

We have to make the child-focused decision here.

The schools must comply with the law.  None of us here will stand over schools that do not publish their admissions statements or admissions policies, or make them difficult to find, for one reason or another.  Such behaviour is not democratic.  It is against both the spirit and letter of the law, as well as being unfair to families.  Of course, we do not stand over that.

They are relatively standardised, but further standardisation is required.  Combined admissions policies should be applied in areas where there is pressure.

It was chosen through the random-selection process as a Private Members' Bill on a Thursday evening and the Minister gave 12 months for it to be assessed, and here we are.  It is a great credit to the Oireachtas that a Bill like this can get to this point.</p> <p>  I will start with a point of agreement.  All of us agree that it is better that children should access a local school and that no criteria should ever have to be needed to differentiate between children.</p><p>However, if I were to ask any of the people here, whether the members, the witnesses or the secretariat, what school their fathers and mothers or grandfathers and grandmothers went to, they would probably feel that was an irrelevant question and would perhaps be slightly insulted by it because I might be perceived as trying to paint a picture of who there are.  I understand that this provision in the legislation was included because of the lobbying by the fee-paying sector, which wanted to maintain some sort of royal line of succession within their school communities.  It is up to them to undertake that lobbying and for them to answer as to why they wanted to do it.  The argument that this approach is one that not many schools adopt does not stand up.  To suggest, based on experience, that only about 15 schools are adhering to or enforcing this approach, then that is still 15 schools too many.  For people living in the communities around those 15 schools, it is irrelevant to them if they are on the rough side of this discussion.</p><p> Everyone should enter the school admissions process as equal citizens in this republic.  It should not matter where someone&rsquo;s father went to school or who he was.  It is completely offensive to the equality agenda of a republic for consideration to be given to the school that someone&rsquo;s father or mother went to, or, indeed, the school that someone&rsquo;s grandfather or grandmother went to.  It is absolutely offensive.  How is anybody expected to compete for a place in those circumstances?</p><p> I accept that we should not have a situation where young people are competing for places, but how are they supposed to compete for a place or try to access a place on an equal basis, if they are not from the area or the country or if their parents or grandparents did not attend secondary school?  What if this were to be the only opportunity that someone&rsquo;s family has ever had to break out of a cycle of educational disadvantage, attend secondary school and in that way break out of disadvantage?  Yet a person in that situation could be disadvantaged in trying to enter that school because his or her father or grandfather did not go to it.  It is so patently elitist and wrong that I cannot believe that anyone would try to defend it on any level whatsoever.</p></speech>

When the 2018 Act was passed, it was progressive legislation and most attention was paid to the abolition of the baptism barrier.  We all felt it was progressive legislation, but I made these arguments in the Seanad when it went through.  I was voted down and that is what happens.  We are now in a position, however, where we are asking people to defend it.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand how the best argument that people can come up with is that not many schools actually use this criterion now.  Other schools could use it and all schools could use it, if they wanted to do so.  Every school could say to child A versus child B that the father of child A went to the school.</p> <p>  A great deal of inequality in Ireland is based on education.  Nothing perpetuates inequality more than the Irish education system.  Much of it comes down to what schools people have gone to, the advantages they have had, the area they have come from, etc.  The committee will have to tackle the issue.  To enshrine inequality in legislation, however, and to give more rights to those families who have had the advantage of attending secondary school, because their parents or grandparents did, is offensive to the idea of a republic.  It is offensive to the idea of an education system that lifts everybody.  Therefore, the argument that this type of approach does not really happen very often is a ridiculous one to my mind.  I return to the situation of those children who need education more than anybody else.  The possibility that such children would be asked even once in any process where their parents or grandparents went to school or that such a situation could arise in any circumstances in any school is something that should not be in any legislation and especially not in a proposed Bill on school admissions.</p><p>Those are my views.  I will be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say.  </p></speech>

I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said.  It is important to combined that with the point that everybody should have access to education at every level.  This is an issue we have to deal with in certain areas where there is oversubscription for schools and then schools are put in an awkward position.  Do they go with those living in the local area and attending the local feeder schools?</p> <p>  Everything is open to abuse, and as part of our connection with the wider European educational community, through the European School Heads Association, ESHA, we have explored how this issue is handled in other jurisdictions.  I refer to local educational authorities assigning students to schools.  In Ireland, however, this process is concerned with respecting the parental right to choose.  Frequently, parents choose what is perceived to be the better school and they put the names of their children down for admission.  As an example, two schools could be 500 m apart, with one getting 800 applicants and the other 30 applicants because of a perception of one being the better school or because one has DEIS status and the other does not.</p> <p>  Therefore, this is a wider issue.  As a society, we must examine our vision for the Irish education system.  What is it that we want it to do?  The answer to that question will frame our admissions policy and how we tackle senior cycle reform.  Is our vision for Irish education based on equality?  Is it a vision for a system that is fair, open, transparent and to which everybody has access?  If we decide as a society and a nation that we do want such a system, then everything else under that theme becomes an easier decision.  The perspective of the NADP, then, is that we support the Bill. </p></speech>

The ETBI believes that publicly-funded schools should serve their local communities first and foremost.  It is then necessary to ask several questions.  I respect and understand the need for schools to have continuity and tradition, and to maintain those aspects.  Schools that do not use this clause, however, and which have never done so, have also maintained their traditions and continuity and been very successful.  Therefore, the idea that this clause is needed to do achieve that aim seems to be somewhat of a stretch, given that we have serious evidence that other schools that do not use the clause managed to do exactly the same.</p> <p>  Another aspect concerns the value this clause has in the legislation.  If the clause is not being used, then why is it there?  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  My comment for the legislators in response is that what is important regarding this clause is not a measure of how many, but of if any.  This cannot be a case of needing to reach a threshold regarding the number of children adversely affected before we decide.  In a republic like ours, we should be saying that every child counts.  We do say that, so if every child counts, then even one child affected in this way is one child too many.</p></speech>

We feel that must be a central tenet of all aspects of what we do in schools.  I echo a point made earlier about the length of the enrolment process for students with additional and special needs.  Currently, the cut-off date has been moved forward for the application for extra resources for these children.  It has been moved to February, which is unworkable.  We have had a great deal of communication from NABMSE members recently regarding this difficulty.  It is an onerous task to pull together the necessary meetings, documentation and perhaps the reassessments of the children applying.</p><p>It is quite an onerous task to pull together the meetings, documentation, perhaps the reassessments of children who are applying.  We also have to fit into our schedule many out-of-school visits and opportunities to photograph key people, meet people repeatedly, come to school at busier times, quieter times and so on.  It is quite a complex process because we are enrolling children with extra needs.  We would really support looking at the length of the enrolment process.  Currently with the cut-off dates in place one year is not enough for our members.</p></speech>

I would again like to point out that even if this only affects a small number of people, for them it is overwhelmingly significant.  The defence is that this is not normally utilised within the school experience.  If someone is on the rough end of this it does not matter how many schools across the country use it or not.  The school that person wanted to attend did use it and the fact that his or her parent or grandparent did not attend the school was the reason he or she did not get in.  That potentially has a life-forming impact.  While we may say it is only a handful of schools, it could grow and grow.  The fact it is there in legislation gives it legitimacy.  There is legitimacy from the Houses of the Oireachtas to discriminate on the basis of what school someone's parents or grandparents went to.  I know I might be using strong language here but I do find it offensive.</p> <p>  There is a middle Ireland assumption that everybody's grandparents went to secondary school or that everybody's parents went to secondary school but not everybody's did, including those from outside the area or the country or from a tradition where their grandparents or parents were not afforded that opportunity.  This goes to the core of what inequality really feels like.  Middle Ireland needs to understand that.  Those overseeing the management of our schools and our education system need to understand that too.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that people are positive.  I would like to address the challenges around oversubscription.  It is critical and it is somewhat related.  In a city like Galway, where I am from, we have massive oversubscription and a small number of schools.  Part of the difficulty is the patronage system.  People's number one choice is a school where the ethos matches their family's ethos.  The majority are not going to get in there so they have a second tier of those that may be more accommodating of different beliefs.  There are different reasons they might decide to go to a school.  It is to do with local schools but it is also to do with ethos.  According to CSO figures, of those who are Catholic, only 27% are going to mass yet 90% of the schools are Catholic.  It is inevitable that people are not getting the schools that match their family's traditions.  Tradition is important to those families as well.</p> <p>  This has to be addressed in the entire conversation about oversubscription.  Even where we have oversubscription, the criteria applied to determine who goes to those schools has to be just and fair.  Whether a school is oversubscribed or not is kind of irrelevant in that conversation.  If a school can just apply anything because it is oversubscribed, where is the equality in that?  Justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done when it comes to the numbers who are actually affected.</p><p>In the same way when it comes to equality it is not just that there are not that many people affected.  Do people feel like the system is equal for everyone?  At the moment they just do not.  This is part of what creates that.</p><p> I very much agree with a lot of what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has said.  This is about elites although I do not think many people intended it to be that way.  When I go to doors people ask if I can get them into X school.  I am sure a lot of members get the same thing; we cannot get somebody in.  In the same way, if it was my child, I would be looking for whatever is out there that I could possibly use.  I do not know that it is always to do with tradition.  It is to do with what people can do to get their child into a school that is fundamentally compatible with their system of beliefs, whatever that might be.  I would like the witnesses to address that point.  I think the two things are being conflated, the oversubscription and what we apply.</p><p> A lot of people have mentioned the fact that there are new people moving to the area.  I know many people who cannot afford to live or get a house in the county where their parents went to school.  There are people who travel from county to county as members of the Traveller community do.  Quite apart from that, we have lots of new people coming into the country.  It is simply not something we can stand over.  We cannot say we have an equal Ireland for everyone and still have some of these things applied to the conditions in which people can join schools.  I understand that people will use whatever means they can.  It is our job to legislate for a better system that is fairer.</p></speech>

On Catholic schools, since the Senator mentioned them, every school has an ethos right across the board.  Every school has a characteristic spirit.</p></speech>

Faith, the faith of the family or one's religion have no bearing on admissions, oversubscription or other inclusionary or exclusionary criteria.  That said, schools are not for Catholics only where they are Catholic in ethos.  They all must and do welcome students of all faiths and none.  Whereas there may have been historical issues around that particular challenge, they are no longer in place and they are quite rightly illegal and are not practised in any school in our sector or in any of the other sectors.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in rightly used the phrase "the rough end" of a criterion.  We will keep coming back to this time and time again.  The rough end of the grandparent criterion is one that it is up to the Oireachtas to legislate for and to consider in terms of the values of the State.  At the same time, there are rough ends of the other criteria that will apply.  They could be geographical.  We could have the same anomalies where we have somebody who does not get a place in a particular school, who lives in a house a short distance away from another person who does get a place, because the catchment boundary had been drawn in a particular way.  There are other ones to do with gender and whatever else.  Certainly I can assure the members that no board of management draws up or applies its criteria lightly.  They feel the pain of the families who are on the rough end of every single criterion that must be applied.  That is universal across all our sectors.</p> <p>  Not only does the State have a duty to legislate in terms of admissions criteria and enrolment frameworks but also in terms of infrastructure provision, removing some of the rocks in the river of parents and families who quite rightly want to have their child receive the best education they can.</p><p>Parental choice will never be removed from the Constitution.  The flow down from that is quite different from other jurisdictions in Europe and elsewhere.  Parental choice reflects the values of those who originally drafted the Constitution and in contemporary society they are still very well accepted and affirmed by people, irrespective of whether they have religious faith.  At the same time in the end there will be rough ends of every single criterion and it is the privilege of Oireachtas Members to draw those up and to give schools clarity.  Sometimes the removal of one criterion for example, will simply allow the others to expand where they are applied.  We have seen that they are not applied universally or even extensively.  Therefore, the removal of this one will allow a certain levelling of the water.  The water will still hit a bulkhead at some point and there will be a rough end of the next one and subsequent criteria.  The State, as opposed to the Oireachtas, has a real duty to invest in as many places and to enrich the calibre, quality and inclusion policies of every school in the State.</p></speech>

It is important to highlight how in some areas schools are hopelessly oversubscribed, not just in Dublin and other urban areas.  In one school three years ago, 120 places were available for first year and now 232 places are available in the same school.  Over a short course of time, we are seeing the numbers increase because there is a bulge.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his work on the legislation.  There is a rather unusual provision in the legislation.  Section 62(7)(e) lists the categorisations or issues a school is not entitled to take into account when admitting a child into school.  Section 62(7)(e)(vi) states: "a student&rsquo;s connection to the school by virtue of a member of his or her family attending or having previously attended the school".  It is surprising that section 62(10) seems to contradict that.  It is an unusual form of legislative drafting.  It may have some evidence about the provenance of the rule as to how it came in.</p> <p>  I have been very interested to listen to what the witnesses have said.  I usually go directly to questions but in this instance, it is also important to listen to what the members have to say.  We bring considerable knowledge from our constituencies in respect of this issue.  I represent Dublin Bay South, a slightly unusual constituency educationally.  I receive an enormous number of questions from parents about their children applying to schools.  In general, most of them are in respect of national schools.  Particularly with the first child, parents do not know what school their child will get into because the national schools in my area are significantly oversubscribed.  The most distressful and pressing issue I face - this may be of interest to Ms O'Rourke - is the number of parents who cannot get access for children with special educational needs in the area.</p> <p>  My constituency is unusual because within it there are, by my count, 12 fee-paying secondary schools.  The reason for so many fee-paying secondary schools is obviously down to history.  It is probably where the middle classes in Dublin lived predominantly in the earlier part of the last century.</p><p>There was very limited choice there, and there is very limited choice for parents in Dublin 6 and Dublin 4 with regard to where to send their children to secondary school other than to fee-paying secondary schools because of their dominance in those areas.  I welcome that we recently have had a new Educate Together secondary school in Sandymount, and we have a new Educate Together secondary school in Harold's Cross.  I hope that in time the 12 second level fee-paying schools there would no longer need to be fee paying.  I do realise that it gives rise to issues.  I have listened to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in<b>, </b>and he makes a valid point about why should there be preferential treatment given to students whose father or grandfather went to a particular school.  I believe that the answer I am hearing back from the witnesses is that while this is an issue, it is not the biggest issue we are facing in the context of admissions.  If it is the case that this criterion is not really being used, what is the necessity of it?  What benefit is it serving to the schools?</p></speech>

We have repeated many times that whatever weight the committee members wish to give to it, as legislators, is up to them.  That family continuity and the relationships between families and schools is a very real phenomenon in Irish life.  We have not been the most mobile population in the world and we do tend to settle and stay in places, but of course this is changing in many ways now.  We need to be conscious also of not commodifying education and saying that one gets the same product; it is not like McDonald's where one would get the same product in every location around the country or around the world.  Education is laden with values, and it is something where parents wish to make sure there is the closest possible alignment with their family values and their educational values, which essentially is the <i>in loco parentis </i>function.  The parents are the primary educators and this is the constitutional protection for their choice around the placement of their children, and schools are obliged, quite rightly, to take them.  We will not keep rehashing the arguments about the capacity issue but certainly this is as much about the values-based piece, and a shared value between schools and families, as it is about any other element of this very important and wide-ranging conversation.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Mr. McKelvey said, it is around schools being reflective of the community in which they are situated.  The school should be a mirror image of the community it serves and it should be available for the students who live locally.  It builds that sense of community and sense of spirit.  As children grow up they will know children who live near them.  If our vision is very clearly that we want to create equality of opportunity, then this criterion has very little relevance to that.  The local children will gain access to the local school through other criteria such as living locally or attending feeder schools.</p></speech>

What really strikes me about this is that schools do not do this lightly.  Having been a school principal for 20 years, we spent a lot of time on this whenever we were oversubscribed.  Schools must have something in terms of priorities, and this was one criterion that this particular school had chosen.  At the same time, obviously as community schools we would say that the schools should be for the children of the community.  When a school is in a position of being oversubscribed and the school board finds itself having to prioritise, it is not an easy place for a school to be.  In this one instance, therefore, we have a situation where there are children living within the school catchment area, and the school must try to prioritise in some way who gets a place over another child.  This is what this school has chosen to do.  The lottery system applies in all of our schools also when there is oversubscription.  I have been at the other end of that when there can be an unintended consequence of the parent who had attended the school saying, "We want to be part of the school for our child, and now that is not there."  They do not like the lottery system and find it difficult.</p><p>This is not something that is done lightly.  The work that we did with schools over the past couple of years when this Bill was introduced, and the work we did around what it is now to have an admissions policy, was very meaningful.  With these policies, we now have a mechanism whereby they can be reviewed every year following the process.  Schools can actually look at this each year.  There is a lot that is positive in this Bill, although it is not an easy one.</p></speech>

The issue is that parents want to get their child into what they perceive as the best local school, and it can irritate them if others are gaining access to that school because of their family connection.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility that we will end up with all- white schools or schools with very few Traveller children, or with very few children from families whose parents were not able to go school because of economic circumstances?  I am sure that members are all aware that we already have many schools with almost no special needs children at all.  We do not want to make an argument at step one that may actually have discriminatory impacts further down the line.</p></speech>

Until Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke I was thinking that this conversation was based on white and middle-class students with opportunities.  The education system does not have equal access for all students, and that must be our starting point here today.  In 2011 and 2012 when I was the education worker in the Irish Traveller Movement I remember the Stokes case in Tipperary where a child could not get access to school because the parents did not go to that school.  I remember in 2012 my own nephew did not get access to a local school in Ballyfermot.  It was all over the news.  Again, it is very tough.</p> <p>  I remember doing an interview after my nomination to become a Senator and the interviewer said to me: "So, you can be anything that you want to be."  No, you cannot: you cannot be anything you want to be if you are from the outside.  Could anyone in this room answer one question for me today?  What is the local community and who are they?  Are they white Irish people or are they settlers within the community?  Does this include members of the Traveller community?  Does it include Black people?  Does it include Roma people?  Does it include the child in the wheelchair?  Even the term "we tend to settle" suggests that we must look at our language here today.  Until Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made the point on that, which I did not have to make, it appeared that we are okay with it and that we are okay with being here trying to defend it, even if it is only two schools in the whole of Ireland.  It is still discriminating against the others.  My grandfather never went to secondary school, my father never went to secondary school and none of my brothers and sisters went to secondary school.  People think that I am here because I was the Taoiseach's nominee.  That is not the reason.  I am here because I was allowed to go to my local schools in Ballyfermot and to university.  I was lucky because I got equality of opportunity that I had to push through.  That is just talking about me as a person.  Now I am fearful here and I am thinking about my two girls: my four-month-old baby and my two-year-old girl.  I live in Donegal now and now I am wondering how does that school operate.  Will Billie be allowed to go to that local school?  I have not even checked the admissions policy, how I would access it, or if I need to put her name down now because she is also a member of the Traveller community.  What about refugee children?  This clause is discriminatory and we cannot sit here and define it and say "well actually it is only one school".  No school should have such a policy where it is about the child's grandparent, sisters and brothers.</p><p>It should not be about that.</p><p> We are speaking here today about boards of management.  I do not mean to say to people, "Answer me this question now", but it is something going forward if not the case.  Do members of boards of management ever ask themselves the question is there a member of the Traveller community on the board of management?  Is there somebody within the local community on the board of management who is different, who represents the other children in the school?  That is something we should look at going forward and I will leave that with our witnesses to answer for the future.  That is also inclusion.  Always look around the room at the people who are not there and invite them in.</p><p> I have one other question - sorry I got a little sidetracked - on special education needs, SEN, students and the facilitation of spaces for people with special needs.  I cannot even believe we are speaking about equal access to education in 2022, and I support Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in 150% in his Bill as it goes forward, but we really need to tease this out.  This conversation is only starting today.  I thank our witnesses so much for coming in to us.</p></speech>

As someone who lives in a very diverse community, where my children attended the local school in a diverse community, it is my core belief that we as a society need to look at and have that discussion around what our vision is and how we can promote and support inclusion.  How can we encourage people to be more inclusive and welcoming?  It is very difficult.</p> <p>  Speaking to the Senator&rsquo;s point, we had a number of Traveller families in the school I was in and we did endeavour to make it very welcoming in engaging with the school, and in fairness to the school, it did.  That is something we need to replicate as a society.  We do not and should not want anybody to feel as if he or she is on the outside, is being excluded or is being treated differently in any way.  I welcome the Senator&rsquo;s passion here today and thank her for it.</p></speech>

I was born and raised in Ballyfermot also and I know the transformative power of education and what it can do in a person&rsquo;s life.  I have worked in education all my life and have led two DEIS schools, one in Finglas and one in Loughlinstown, and they have both been extraordinarily inclusive.  The work we did around including Traveller children, not just in those two schools but in schools right across all three sectors represented here today, was outstanding.  There are forces at play that are to some extent profoundly cultural, while some are historical and some are societal, but none of these gives us any excuse for exclusionary practices.  It is illegal for a school to refuse to enrol a Traveller child, a child with special educational needs, or for a school to use anything other than the criteria set out in law to deal with the oversubscription crisis that exists both at primary and post-primary level in our country.  I am so happy to say that because it makes things easy for boards of management.</p> <p>  Since the Senator has raised the issue of the composition of boards of management, that too is set out in the Education Act and in the articles of management under which schools need to work.</p> <p>  There is the capacity there to open this conversation and I am delighted to see the Senator opening it here as opposed to coming to a quick and easy solution that would not be reflective of reality.  This should not just involve all of the various stakeholders and members of our community and the wonderful diversity that is emerging but young people&rsquo;s voices also.</p> <p>  We really need to reflect on the incredible amount of voluntarism that is demanded of the citizens of this State in acting as members of boards of management in 4,000 schools throughout the country.</p><p>In other words, our boards of management and governance are based on a volunteer model.  The legislative, administrative, regulatory and health and safety demands that have been imposed on boards of management over recent years, all of which are very valid, are now on the shoulders of local people who are not trained for it and are not invested in it other than by virtue of the fact that their children happen to go to the school, they are a member of the staff or they are a nominee of the trustees in our sector. </p></speech>

She raised a very valid point on the board of management which is, as we know, the point of oversight and power in many schools.  It is enshrined in our deed of trust that there are two parent nominees on all of our boards, one of whom must be a mother.  The work we have to do on the ground goes beyond that.  It is there in the legislation and in the deed.  It is open to all the parents.  It is up to the parent body to nominate people to go forward.  As Dr. Redmond said earlier, we have not got that right in our schools at second level because, for some reason, parents tend to step away.  We have a great deal of work to do to ensure the diverse communities in our schools are reflected on the boards of management.  The Senator is absolutely right on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McKelvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020100002#V00500"><p>Senator Flynn has asked some important questions that we are having to give the answers to.  The ETBI considers that her question about who the school serves has a simple answer.  Our schools should primarily serve their local community, and every child in that local community should be served.  That is the simple answer.  In looking at this and other pieces of legislation, that should be the primary motivation.  I understand that choices have to be made in cases where there is oversubscription, but they are choices and the nature of those choices decides how equitable the process is.  That is a consideration.</p> <p>  The Senator is completely right on her other point, which I take.  I share the view of my colleague that most of our boards of management are staffed by people who do a great job in very difficult circumstances and make very difficult choices with great goodwill.  I also suspect it is true to say that they represent a fairly narrow spectrum of our society.  I would like to make a further point in this regard, which is relevant as we take the next step on the journey.  I am reminded of the phrase "if you can't see it, you can't be it".  The children who sit in our classrooms, certainly in ETB schools, come from very diverse backgrounds.  The person they look at in the room, generally speaking, comes from a very narrow spectrum of society.  In other words there is a job of work in respect of the teaching population that we have here.  How many children from other backgrounds are represented in that population and how many times do children see such people?  There is also a job of work to be done around that too.</p></speech>

Once upon a time, all of the teachers in the ETB schools would have come from a certain background.  I will not say it was a privileged background.  In the past ten years, I have seen that mould being broken in a big way.  People whose parents often did not have the opportunity to go to secondary school now have the opportunity to teach in ETB schools.  Perhaps that is where they went to school as children.  I would like to see those teachers breaking the mould and going into what I will not describe as the &ldquo;other&rdquo; schools.  That is a greater challenge for us.  The mould is being broken big time, specifically in ETB schools.  I see it in my local ETB schools.  It is absolutely fantastic.  In families where only one person finished the leaving certificate, that person is now teaching very difficult subjects such as maths, Irish and English in ETB schools.  I will bring Senator Flynn back in.</p></speech>

I will never say that I want to put upper-class people down or anything of the sort.</p><p>It is actually about giving all the children a hand up.  That is something I say a lot in having that equal access.  It is good that schools and the education system around teacher training is changing somewhat.  They are moving in St. Patrick's teacher training college to include the Yellow Flag programme, educating people around the Traveller community, the Roma community, refugees, migrants and so on.  It is for all children but we need to include all those children.  That is my point.</p></speech>

Mr. McKelvey is here in front of me and managed to arrive on time from Cork; I will not be able to use that excuse any longer.  I welcome the witnesses.  I read their statements last night.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's Bill and the proposition he presented to us.  In a republic everybody should be treated equally.  Unfortunately there is inherent discrimination in our enrolment policy.  There has to be because one way or another we have to discriminate.  It is often the most contentious period of the year for us as public representatives.  We get phone calls from parents not understanding and finding it difficult to accept they have been placed on a waiting list or whatever the case might be.  It is quite a stressful period.</p> <p>  While I am in agreement with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's Bill I would like to focus on one or two other areas.  Dr. Redmond said a while ago that we do not discriminate against Travellers or people from minorities.  While that is technically true there is inherent discrimination built into the process.  If a child with a special educational need applies to a certain school, he or she might often be told that the school does not have an ASD class.  It happens.  They might be told that there is an ASD class but it is oversubscribed.  The difficulty is that the greater population does not know it is up to the school and the board of management to apply for further ASD classes or whatever the case may be.  In a way there is a bit of discrimination there, I find, when certain families or children are told the school just does not have room for them this year or that they will have to wait until the school builds a new class or adds on to the facility.  I would appreciate Dr. Redmond's feedback on that.</p> <p>  Mr. McKelvey and I spoke a couple of weeks ago about the issue we are having with twins applying for school places.  He mentioned it in his statement today.  I spoke with a principal in east Cork last night who has eight sets of twins in her application round this year and only four sets have been accepted.  She is hopeful as the competition continues that more will be accepted.  There is this strange situation where we have kids travelling, possibly from the same rural village, into a town and going in completely different directions for their schooling.  Mr. McKelvey has spoken to me previously but perhaps he could expand on it on the record.  It is presenting us with a difficulty in my own area.</p></speech>

There is provision in legislation for designating a school to take a class.  It is not used because the ethos of the NCSE as well as the ethos of boards of management across the country have been collaborative as opposed to something that is more directive.</p> <p>  The provision of an ASD class is a major undertaking for a school.  It does not just convert a room and hire some additional staff.  It is a piece of work that demands serious planning.  We need a minimum threshold of six students for each class, as the Deputy knows.  In situations where there are fewer than six, we are not permitted and will not be resourced to open a special class.  Conversations between parents and schools around provision generally quite rightly centre on the needs of the child and the best care that a school can provide for the needs of the child.</p><p>Schools would much rather have ASD special classes in place to cater for fewer than six.  I refer to classes of five, four and so on.  The population of students who have ASD-type conditions is expanding.  There is also the matter of mobility.  There is a lot of fluidity around that.  My point is that there is a degree of complexity involved and that it is not all based on exclusionary practices or soft barriers to enrolment.  It is still illegal for a school to refuse to enrol such students if it has a place for them.  It does not have to be a place in a special class.  Our schools typically want these students.  If I may make a strange point, there is also an anomaly in that fee-charging schools are not allowed to have special classes.  This particular piece of work could also focus on that.  Conversations have recently happened in Limerick and schools massively expanded their provision of ASD classes following a single conversation with their local senior special educational needs officer, SENO.  It is about to happen again in Cork, where there is a bottleneck.  We will see the same willingness on the part of schools to open special classes.  It cannot happen overnight but, where it does happen, significant resourcing will be needed.</p></speech>

In my experience they are, but there is a bottleneck in Cork.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who was here a while ago, can attest to that issue.  Particularly on his side of the constituency, there is a large suburban area with a population of 30,000 people but there is no ASD provision whatsoever.  That is criminal.  That has gone on for years.  I have named that area publicly in the past, although I will not do it here today.  There must be more to the issue in that particular area.  I understand that most schools are quite open to it but, in my experience, that is unfortunately not true in every case.  I will pass over to Mr. McKelvey on the matter of twins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-01a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McKelvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020100002#X00300"><p>I am talking about twins, triplets or even siblings who are what they call "Irish twins", two siblings who were born very close to one another and who may be in the same primary school class and transferring to secondary in the same year.  The difficulty here relates to a clash between legal entitlement and common sense.  Common sense would suggest that, if a twin gets a place, the other twin should also get a place because of transport issues and so on.  The difficulty is that, if you treat both applications as a single unit and the applicants do not get a place, a parent can make the case that they should have been treated as a single entity and that the chances of one of the children getting in were halved because their applications were treated as a single case.  If the applicants do get in, there is no difficulty for those twins but others may have a difficulty.  If the twins' applications are tied together, if there are 120 places, if one twin gets in having been placed 118th and if the other twin is given the 119th place because the other twin is in, the person who finishes 121st can make the case that the second twin got a place not on the basis of a reasonable lottery but on the basis of their application having been attached to another.  Legally, each individual must be treated individually.  I am not a legal expert in any way but it is my understanding that the legal position is a bit like the tax treatment of couples in that each person must be treated as an individual and must, therefore, go into the lottery on their own.  However, there have been several situations in my own ETB in which one twin has got in and the other has not.  That is a nightmare for parents from an organisational point of view.  Some twins or triplets want to be apart but it is very often the case that they want to be together.  They do not grow out of that need to be together until they get close to adulthood.  That needs to be looked at from a legislative perspective.  It is certainly a real difficulty being experienced on the ground.</p></speech>

I will follow up on my initial question to Dr. Redmond.  He mentioned that there is a bottleneck in Cork.  I believe 36 ASD classes are due to come to Cork between now and September.  Many of these have already been announced but many are yet to be announced.  I was speaking to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, about this only last week.</p><p>These classes are not always announced for various reasons, including the fear that the project might be kicked out to the following year and so on.  The issue for parents who have applied for enrolment for the academic year beginning this September is that, if an ASD class has not been announced, the school will plan on the basis of what exists now and not on what may exist because any new ASD class may be kicked into the following year.  The parents of people with special educational needs are finding that, even if a class has been committed to, although it may not be committed to for 2022 but rather for 2023 or 2024, it is difficult to decide where to apply to.  They wonder whether they should go on a waiting list.  A myriad of things pop into their heads.</p></speech>

It is not down to schools' or boards of management's refusal to enrol children.  It is down to the system not being forward-looking enough to put ASD classes in place before demographic bubbles - if I can use that term - of children with particular special needs arrive into post-primary education.  These children are well flagged.  They are well known to the system and well identified locally.  The special educational needs officers, SENOs, are well aware not only of the number of children in these situations but of their names.  We are absolutely at a loss to understand how that forward provision, that is, establishing school places, cannot be made.</p> <p>  Much of the school stock in all three sectors, but particularly in the voluntary secondary sector, if I may say so, is quite old.  It is on tight old sites with little scope for expansion.  Very often, an additional building is needed rather than just putting up a prefab and ghettoising these children when they should be part of the real school community.  Real, pre-planned and forward-looking infrastructural investment is needed.  It is not only the National Council for Special Education and the school system that need to engage in this.  The planning and building unit also needs to be well ahead of the curve on all of these provisions because not only does this unit provide for additional spaces, it also provides for conversion or merging of rooms and for quiet spaces for children who need that resource.</p> <p>  The matter of staffing is straightforward, as is the enrolment.  Local provision where bottlenecks exist and the lack of forward planning are the issues.  This should have been seen in Cork and Limerick years ago.  The solution in Limerick was simply to gather everybody together and, virtually and straightforwardly, to look school patrons and boards of management in the eye and ask if and when they would take these students and where they would put them in their schools.  I was present for one of those conversations and it took quite a long time to work through the significant number of schools in the Limerick area.  There was no resistance in principle to these classes.  One or two schools cited problems and constrictions but no school had an issue with its values, enrolment policy or intention to comply with the law.  No school refused an ASD class.  There are a whole lot of little anomalies but it is possible to work around all of them if given time.  To come in very late in a year, and it is now late in the year for school planning, and seek to put ASD special classes into schools that are not prepared for them is not good for the children.  However, neither is it good for them to be left out or to have a year of no schooling.</p></speech>

I got to listen to quite a little bit here and I have a few questions.  It is funny; it was mentioned that this may not be the utmost priority in many minds in many schools and for many principals.  In my area, my priority is building schools and getting space.  There is a special needs school in Ballinasloe that is literally fighting for additional accommodation.  It has now got a site to build a new school.  Children literally do not have space in a classroom, especially during the lockdown.  There is a primary school in our area, which is a deprived area according to Pobal and based on the most recent census, and this school has been waiting 25 or 30 years for a new building.  That is what we are fighting for.  I understand about the priorities.  The speakers have mentioned the different priorities of teachers, principals and their own organisations.</p> <p>  I will just pull up a document with some of the questions I wanted to ask.  We are here to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020.</p><p>I know I have heard a few comments arising from the previous few contributions from colleagues.  An area of priority for me is the roll-out of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, identification models so secondary schools can apply to be part of DEIS and get extra supports put in place to do things like having special needs classes.  Again, that must happen and money has been allocated in the budget this year.  It is more than &euro;18 million and that should be happening very soon.  It should have happened ages ago but anyway.</p><p> There is an oversubscription crisis now and the census is due this year.  There will be data from that relating to areas of population, where we will have demand and so on.  When it comes to oversubscription, what about areas of deprivation and how do we encourage and support parents that come from deprived areas in getting more involved in the likes of boards of management and the application process?  How do we engage with them at an early stage and whose role is it to engage with parents at an early stage?  Those are three questions in one.  There has been a bit about involving boards of management.  Do the witnesses have any comments on the census to be done this year?  I am posing that question to Mr. Crone and Mr. McKelvey or if anybody else has time to come in, they can.  If they want to comment on special needs schools as well, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

The census data are very welcome.  In my previous role, before working with the NAPD, I worked with the City of Dublin Education and Training Board and was very involved with looking at school places and buildings and considering the demographic needs of the particular areas.  Again, I do not have the figures in front of me but the anticipated cap in numbers is around 2024 in the post-primary sector.  That may be contradicted in this census and that is why the process will be very interesting.  We are in the middle of a teacher supply and school building crisis and we must know, as we come out of Covid-19, where there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The census will provide that information for us.  As stakeholders in education, we have a responsibility to get involved and drive that debate to ensure schools are supported.  It is very difficult for communities and parents not to understand why there are delays in that area.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about engaging parents, which is a major concern coming out of the pandemic.  The DEIS programme has been phenomenally successful and looking at our international scores in the PISA studies has indicated it has been very successful.  It is being looked at internationally as a success.  Through the home school liaison scheme, the DEIS schools have managed to connect parents with schools.  They have actively sought that and done much work in improving attendance, attainment, retention and transition.  Despite all of those, there was big fear during the pandemic with remote teaching and schools, which were inclusive environments and a hive of activity until 5 p.m., 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m., when the caretakers locked the door, are now empty by 3.30 p.m. because of Covid-19.  There is a huge job to be done and a real fear that the work that has been done in DEIS over the past ten years has perhaps lost some ground.  It will have to be a priority.  We are waiting on the review of DEIS.</p></speech>

I genuinely believe this is a major concern for principals and deputies.  They actively seek the involvement of parents.  They get involved with parents' associations and with sending the home school liaison teacher out.  They also want to link with community groups.  Most of the school leaders really engage with the idea that the school is in the community and for the community.</p> <p>  It is at times very difficult and this is something that must be high on the agenda.  It continues to be high on the agenda.  There are elements we can embrace going forward, such as remote parent-teacher meetings, as they tended to have a slightly higher attendance rate than face-to-face meetings.  That is the effect of having to come out on cold evenings, perhaps.</p><p>The remote connection is sometimes easier to maintain with a parent, and that is something we recommend should be embraced going forward.</p></speech>

Very often the people that we are trying to target may have had a negative experience of going to school or they may have had no experience of coming to school.  The very act of physically bringing those people into a building can be a major step.<br/><br/>Schools become DEIS schools based on Pobal percentages.  There are many children and families in non-DEIS schools who suffer equal levels of deprivation and who, unfortunately, do not have that access to home school liaison, etc.  That may be problematic in itself.  In our experience, schools are very proactive in bringing in parents with purpose.  Where it has worked well, there are training programmes for parents.  Some of those are around parenting and some are around understanding.<br/><br/>The Senator made a really good point about parents who may not be <i>au fait </i>with the education system and how it operates, and for whom the current enrolment process can be quite daunting, for example.  Which pieces do they have to do, when do they come in and how do they know about the different elements?  There is work to be done in that respect.  In fairness, our schools are getting better but rather than the school deciding what they think the parents need, we must go to the parents and ask what they need.</p></speech>

There are issues around getting parents on boards of management, a parents' association or any organisation in a school as we must get them into the school first.  A parent may have been very involved with a child's education in primary school but coming to second level, parents sometimes tend to step away.  That is a job of work for our schools and some of our schools do that very successfully, even through the community education programme, which we can use to bring in parents.  As Mr. McKelvey points out, many parents do not come into the school because they have had a negative experience.  It is about changing this around.</p></speech>

The census data could be incredibly useful to the special needs sector and I fully support Dr. Redmond's comment about pre-planning and pre-training in good time before children start in school.  As I mentioned, the enrolment and familiarisation process is lengthy and quite complex, depending on a child's needs.</p> <p>  I really welcome his comment that JMB schools are very open to opening special classes and I suggest those principals or boards of management make contact with SENOs and the National Council for Special Education straight away.</p><p>It is our experience in the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, that special needs children in some instances travel very long distances on school buses every day, sharing those buses with children from several other schools, which can lead to a commute sometimes of an hour to an hour and a half each way.  That brings us back to the issue of the right of a child to access education in his or her area in order that the child can make friends in his or her area and is not subjected to those very long commutes.  In my experience in a school which had autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, we did not have to wait until we had a full enrolment before we opened those classes.  We opened the class with two children and very quickly we had two full classes and waiting lists.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions from Senator Mullen who had to leave early.  One of his questions is for the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD.

We operate a national executive which is representative of our regions and sectors.  In preparation for today, we would have consulted extensively with our executive committee to form an opinion.  Equally, as part of our strategic review, which has been ongoing since September, we have consulted widely with our full membership to gain their views on many issues related to education.  I would argue I would be hard pushed to find a school whose ethos and mission statement does not promote equality and equality of access to education.  On that basis, I would be confident we are representing the school leaders in that we are promoting equality and equality of access.</p></speech>

I would point out the anomaly that schools in the fee-charging sector are not permitted by the Department to open special classes or classes for students with autism.  That anomaly needs to be addressed.  I do not think the schools in that sector are seeking anything particularly special other than equitable treatment.</p> <p>  What the Senator may be referring to is the inequitable treatment in terms of resourcing.  For example, around the Covid reopening, the schools in the fee-charging sector were specifically excluded from Covid reopening resources and then, following advocacy from ourselves, it was opened on an application basis only.  One grant type after another is denied to them or reduced down to 50%.  That is a policy the Department has evolved from but it is one that has never been tested.</p> <p>  In terms of equity, even though there could be an ideological civic discourse on the rights of parents to send students to fee-charging schools, first, that is still constitutionally protected and, second, it would go against the diversity argument if we were to eliminate one particular tranche schools in favour of another or to try to homogenise an educational system that is working, by and large, at post-primary level to serve the needs of students and families of all types.</p></speech>

Why should those who happen to live in the city, possibly in a very affluent area, take precedence?</p><p>Which of the witnesses would like to take that question?

The boarding school provision is one that every single country in the world has to provide for students who are not domiciled during their education for a whole range of reasons.  In Ireland we have a particular situation, first, the minority faith population is dispersed and for them to achieve access to the school of their choice, that is a school with their particular family&rsquo;s ethos, they need to have boarding provision and that boarding provision is not a luxury and is certainly not elitist.  It is as inclusive as anything in any other aspect of the State&rsquo;s provision of education.  Although I do not fully comprehend the question, and it is not for the want of trying, the boarding school provision demands a fairly honest and frank consideration by the system at large, the Legislature and the Department in terms of its provision and supports, and, in particular, the challenges it faces that are quite unique in the school setting in terms of childcare and, for example, even holiday provision.  The movement of the oral examinations leaving certificate to Easter has not been unproblematic for boarding school children.  There are many anomalies that require to be addressed.  It is probably high time we had a good system level conversation that is frank and honest about the needs of boarding schools in this State because they serve a distinct need.</p></speech>

Senator Flynn brought a totally different dimension to the meeting than what we might normally have had and the question she asked was a very good one.</p> <p>  I have a further question for Mr. Crone.  Would many of the members of the NAPD who down the years would have been totally opposed to the policy we are discussing now have come around to changing their thoughts on the issue?</p></speech>

As described by Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, schools that are oversubscribed are put in an untenable position and they have to make decisions to categorise students.  This is one such consideration.  A number of schools I am aware of, as we spoke about it at our executive, discussed this point and whether to include it.  Some of them decided they would include and it ended up not being used.  Some of them decided they would not use it because they felt it was unfair, but it depends on the level of oversubscription.  With some schools, they would be arguing over something but they will never be oversubscribed.  Therefore, it does not make any difference.  If we view that this point is potentially discriminatory, then it should not be there.  That would be my point.  Perhaps we need to work with the provision of school places to prevent those pinch points in particular areas where oversubscription is a significant problem.  If I was put to the pin of my collar over the next 20 minutes I could probably identify the ten or 20 areas in the country where that is a problem.  In general, school leaders want the best for their students.  They want education to be the best enabler, for it to be available for everybody and for nobody to be discommoded.</p></speech>

In my constituency people in Wexford town travel to New Ross and Enniscorthy.  People travel from Rosslare to Enniscorthy to get secondary school place.  It is wrong.  When a new secondary school is built in any town there is consultation with the local authority.  It would be better if there was consultation with the local politicians.  They might be able to give a lot more information.  We get evidence on the ground every year.  I know people want to keep politics out of this.</p></speech>

This is a complicated complex area for schools when they are over subscribed.  We know this.  Schools have spent a lot of time on the 2018 Bill putting together their admissions policies, including all the stakeholders from the patrons down.  They have also spent a lot of time working together on trying to deal with oversubscription at local level.  They have also spent a lot of time in board meetings looking at reviews.  Now there is a facility for parents to appeal to the board and look at the whole procedure.  This has been useful.  There are many positive elements in the Bill.  I am thinking back to my time as a principal.  A lot of time is spent at board level looking at the issue of admissions and to see whether a school has discriminated.  A school will know this from the correspondence from those who did not get places.  Schools spend a lot of time reviewing the process each year.  A question was asked as to whether schools have changed from being firmly on one side or the other.  Most likely they have.  Schools are very mindful of all of the unintended consequences.</p></speech>

It is easy for parents to become aware of what the process is because anyone they speak to about it will have gone through the same process in other schools.  The legislation has been very good in this way.  It has kept everybody singing off the same hymn sheet with regard to process at least, even if the criteria used are different in different schools.  This has been a great advantage of the legislation.</p> <p>  Mr. Crone was asked about principals and deputy principals.  Very often they may very strongly want to go in a particular direction but the board of management, parent representatives and teacher representatives may want to go in a different direction.  Ultimately it is the board of management, with the permission of patron, who decides on the policy of the school.  This is an important part of the constituency.  The vast majority of people are very open about this.  Human nature being what it is sometimes people think they need to get into the tent.  This is definitely an influencing factor.</p></speech>

They may be getting some travel subsidy for doing it, but that is all they get for spending hours in the car every week to get the best education for their sons and daughters.  A new special education unit has opened in St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy.  From talking to one family there, I know the great feeling of relief that has brought to them, because major pressures are faced by all families whose children have special needs.</p></speech>

If we consider the number of schools in Catholic patronage compared with the number of people now professing themselves to be followers of that denomination, it is evident that diversity at primary level seriously lags behind that to be found in society.</p> <p>  I agree completely with my colleagues about the need to build more provision.  That is fundamental.  In addition, however, from a legislative perspective, we must ask if the fundamental purpose of schools subvented and paid for by the State is to serve their local communities.  If that is the fundamental purpose, then that must be reflected in the legislation.</p></speech>

The whole tradition and culture and partnership model of schools and the State working together has always been a collaborative one, right up to this morning's conversation around the leaving certificate, for example.  Every aspect of Irish education is collaboratively determined.  One Minister after another has stood over and maintained that approach.  I would argue, as my colleague Ms O'Sullivan said, for better planning.  Why are we having fire brigade meetings in Limerick and about to have another one in Cork?  Why will we have the next one in Wexford and the one after that in Tipperary?  I ask that in the context of planning and making provision for students with particular special needs and undertaking the required investment locally to allow the necessary building, classroom set-ups and hiring of staff.  Therefore, this is really a question of planning and of the State not just leaving this issue totally up to the well-meaning and hardworking boards of management.  Other than the teachers on boards, their members are not professional educators.  In governance terms, boards of management are carrying a workload, a worry load and a responsibility load well beyond their capacity to cope with in future.  That is where the State, at planning level, must come in to offer support and provide the required resources to reflect the needs of its people is so far as possible.</p></speech>

One school can end up with three special classes and another with none.  Ultimately, the decision has to rest with the Department of Education.  There has to be a collaborative element because a school needs to own the decision.  That brings me back to the vision piece, namely what we want from Irish education and whether there is a richness in that diversity in every school community.  The Department needs to plan for that with schools in plenty of time, in order to give them opportunities to be involved collaboratively and feel they have ownership of the decision.  </p></speech>

We need a collaborative approach, but in a small number of cases we reach a point where such an approach is not yielding any result over a protracted period and then a more directive approach needs to be taken.</p></speech>

I would again suggest that a collaborative approach is what works best and it has certainly been part of the way the system operates.  We have plenty of examples of where it works well.  The system behind it needs to be well resourced.  We talked about special needs.  The SENO piece needs to be well resourced.  That is really important.  I would suggest that collaboration always wins through.</p></speech>

It is perfectly normal for them to question whether they will be able to meet needs effectively.  I agree with the collaborative approach, but sometimes schools made need a little nudge.  If the support and time are there, most schools will be willing.</p></speech>
