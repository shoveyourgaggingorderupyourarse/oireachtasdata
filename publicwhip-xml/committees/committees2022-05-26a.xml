No apologies have been received.  Please note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, be respectful of other people's physical space and adhere to public health advice.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we are engaging with officials from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, HSE, in resuming examination of the following matters.  Those are the 2020 appropriation accounts, Vote 38 - Health, and the HSE's financial statements for 2020.  Both organisations have been advised in advance that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters that arise mainly from reports in the public domain.  They are redeployment of HSE nursing home staff and value for money; the temporary assistance payment scheme for nursing homes; oversight and governance by the Department of HSE expenditure, including supplementary budgets; HSE recruitment targets, budgeting, delivery and departmental oversight; consultant salary scales; departmental oversight of Exchequer funding carried forward by the HSE; HSE treasury management; and requests for additional funding for mental health services and subsequent delivery.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Mr. John O'Grady, principal officer, and Mr. Kevin Colman, principal officer.  From the HSE we are joined by Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer, Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer, and Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations.</p> <p>  We are also joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department, Ms Fiona Larthwell, principal officer, and Mr. Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer.  From the HSE, we are also joined by Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer, and Ms Anne Marie Hoey, national director, human resources.  Finally, from the health Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are joined by Mr. Daniel O'Callaghan and Mr. Eoin Dormer.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation made to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statements on the HSE's financial statements and the Department's Appropriation Accounts last September and December respectively.  These were circulated to the committee before this meeting.  Unless the Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to address the accounts, we will move straight to Mr. Watt's opening statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022052600002#A00800"><p>Good morning.  I am very pleased to be here today to deal with the 2020 annual report, the appropriation accounts and the specific issues raised by the committee, as articulated.  The Chairman mentioned the colleagues from the Department who are with me.  Ms Louise McGirr cannot be here as she is at the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission dealing with various industrial relations matters.  She sends her apologies.</p> <p>  I have previously set out to this committee the main points of the 2020 accounts.  I will not go through that again and it is already on the record.  I know the committee has asked for information on the governance and oversight role of the Department.  We have provided briefing detail on this and I look forward to discussing these issues.  It would be helpful at this stage if I set out broadly how the Department conducts its oversight role in respect of our colleagues in the HSE.</p> <p>  As well as providing leadership and policy direction for the health sector, the Department has a key role in governance and performance oversight in the delivery of health and social services.  The oversight arrangements for State agencies, including the HSE, are set out in the 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Reflecting the requirements in the code, the starting point for accountability between the Minister and the HSE is our oversight agreement.  This written statement between the Minister for Health and the HSE sets out the terms of the relationship between us and the respective responsibilities of each party.</p> <p>  The Department conducts its oversight role through our Department of Health-HSE performance engagement model and I have provided the committee with more detailed briefing on how the model works in practice.  Our oversight model is operational and working well.  A key area of focus of our performance engagement model is on the financial performance of the HSE.  I know the committee has a specific interest in the financial oversight role of the Department.</p> <p>  On the question of Exchequer funding for health expenditure, the Department of Health co-ordinates the Estimates process for all voted expenditure within current and capital subheads of the health Vote.  This includes expenditure by the HSE and other funded agencies, as well as the requirements of the Department of Health itself.  The Department works closely with the HSE to determine the level of new services and the associated levels of funding as part of the Estimates process.  Based on this, the Minister negotiates a settlement, which is ultimately voted upon by the Oireachtas.  This provides the basis of HSE's national service plan, which is submitted to the Minister for approval.  The key performance indicators and targets set in the national service plan and the associated expenditure are then monitored by the Department during the year.</p> <p>  On the question of HSE financial performance, the Department is conducting its oversight role on a near daily basis throughout the year, both in a structured way and through more collaborative and informal channels.  We have a formal detailed engagement between the Department and the HSE monthly, informed by a suite of reports to assess financial performance against targets and to identify any actions required.  Where additional expenditure is incurred outside of the service plan process, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have specific and detailed sanctioning and monitoring arrangements to ensure additional funding is required and that it is spent as intended.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also plays a significant role in monitoring financial performance through the health budget oversight group, which meets monthly.</p> <p>  There are strong oversight and governance systems in place to manage expenditure in the health sector throughout the budgetary cycle. Of course, as part of normal business in the Department of Health, we continuously seek to strengthen and improve the insight we have on HSE financial performance.  It is widely understood that the current financial systems within the HSE need to be modernised.  Delivering a new integrated financial management system, which will give better information on financial performance, is a very high priority for the HSE.  Although this project will take several years to fully implement, new reporting capabilities have been introduced by the HSE in the interim, for example relating to Covid-19 expenditure and its working capital position.</p> <p>  In addition, the Department will address recommendations from the Parliamentary Budget Office and the OECD to restructure the health Vote to move to a programme budgeting model from 2024.  This will support the implementation of regional health areas, RHAs.</p> <p>  I assure the committee that my Department continuously works with the HSE and other key stakeholders to improve the availability of information and data on financial and non-financial performance.  This is a key focus of our day-to-day business in the Department and will be centre stage as we design and implement the new RHAs.  The introduction of the RHAs gives us the opportunity to reform the way in which we fund the health service, including a pathway to implement population-based funding and multi-annual budgeting.</p><p> I look forward to working with and engaging with the committee on this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022052600002#B00300"><p>I welcome again the members.  I thank the Chairperson and members for the invitation.  The Chairperson has introduced my colleagues so I will not do that again.  He has also referenced a number of papers that we have submitted in advance so I will confine my remarks to a few key areas.</p> <p>  First, there is the annual financial statements 2020 and the financial outturn.  The Covid-19 pandemic placed significant pressure on funding and expenditure during 2020.  The HSE's overall reported income for 2020 is just over &euro;20.2 billion and includes a once-off net additional funding allocation of &euro;2.3 billion, of which just over &euro;2.1 billion was in respect of 2020 Covid-19 costs with the remaining &euro;200 million allocated to winter plan funding.  The HSE's annual financial statements for 2020 record a final audited revenue income and expenditure surplus of just over &euro;200 million.</p> <p>  Next is the annual financial statements 2021 and financial outturn.  The HSE's 2021 annual financial statements were prepared and submitted in line with the required timelines to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  I understand that the audit process is nearing finalisation and is expected to be complete around the end of May in time for inclusion in the published 2021 HSE annual report.  Subject to the finalisation of the audit, it is expected that the 2021 annual financial statements will record a revenue income and expenditure deficit of about &euro;195 million.  The deficit is entirely due to an excess of Covid-19-related costs, including vaccination, and test and trace costs, over available Covid funding.</p> <p>  In arriving at the net deficit of &euro;195 million, the excess of Covid costs over the Covid budget was substantially offset by a surplus on core spending, which was due to the regrettable suppression of some core activity and knock-on delays in progressing new developments largely driven by the pandemic and our need to respond effectively to it.</p> <p>  Over the two years of the pandemic, from 2020 through to 2021, the HSE will have recorded a combined revenue surplus of &euro;5 million or a combined surplus of &euro;65 million over the three years of 2019 to 2022.</p> <p>  The national service plan for 2022 outlines the health and social care services that will be provided to the people of Ireland in 2022 within the allocated budget of &euro;20.7 billion, which included the following.  Additional investment in new measures, including the winter plan, of &euro;310 million.  Additional existing level of service funding &euro;727 million, including: &euro;286 million pay cost pressures which includes funding increments of &euro;39 million; just over &euro;364.4 million existing level of service and demographic pressures; and &euro;77 million in terms of 2022 full-year costs related to Table 4 of the national service plan 2021.  Additional once-off investment for Covid-19 costs of &euro;697 million, including: &euro;497 million for Covid-19 responses, including but not limited to, vaccination, and testing and tracing, personal protective equipment, PPE, and hospital and community Covid-19 responses; and &euro;200 million to cover acute and community scheduled care access, including the use of public and private hospitals.</p> <p>  The national service plan focuses on the delivery, improvement and reform of healthcare services while continuing to manage a Covid-19 environment and is prepared within the strategic context of Sl&aacute;intecare, the HSE corporate plan and the Minister for Health's annual statement of priorities and the winter plan.</p> <p>  I shall outline the financial position as of the end of March 2022, the draft revenue income and expenditure financial position at the end of March shows a year-to-date deficit of just over &euro;250 million or less than 4.96%, with a significant element of this being driven by the direct impact of Covid-19, as reflected in the &euro;224 million adverse variance in Covid-19 reported costs and &euro;26.8 million or 0.6% adverse variance on core-related costs.  However, from an overall perspective, it is expected over the coming weeks and months that our core, which is non COVID-19 activities, will naturally increase and the impact of delayed care will also increase demand for core services.</p> <p>  Finally, I will mention recruitment.  The HSE has seen unparalleled growth in both 2020 and 2021 of an increase of 12,506 whole-time equivalents.  This is in addition to recruitment via third party for staff in our Covid testing, tracing and vaccination services.  In 2022, the resourcing strategy approach is underpinned by a resourcing delivery range.  The minimum point of the range sets out the minimum resourcing target at a net increase of over 5,500 whole-time equivalents, upon which the HSE will be monitored against, in addition to a higher target to allow for our commitment to maximising our recruitment and retention efforts.  This level of recruitment is a net increase when recruitment to vacancies that arise are backfilled.  This requirement, on an annual basis, is just over 9,500 posts.</p> <p>  In the past two years, the HSE has increased its recruitment capacity and capability through investment in national and local recruitment services.  This has secured further resources and skills thereby removing potential barriers to domestic recruitment capacity and capability.</p> <p>  In recognition of the increased global competition for health and social care professionals, together with the ambitious recruitment targets, the HSE is supplementing its already robust recruitment strategies to maximise the national market with comprehensive international recruitment across clinical grades.  I thank the Chairperson and members.</p></speech>

Before we get into the meeting proper I ask him to address the news that we got yesterday.  It was stated in a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday that the average waiting time in accident and emergency units is 14 hours for people over 75 years and in other cases they must wait over 21 hours.</p> <p>  The HSE receives a substantial amount of funding.  As I have said to Mr. Reid before, I am the last person who would argue against that funding but it seems that no headway has been made with waiting times.  What will the HSE do to address this issue in the next two or three months?  I hope that everybody in this room will reach 75 years of age and well beyond that and it is wrong to wind up in the intolerable situation of having to wait 14 hours plus on a trolley or in a chair for medical attention.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the OECD and other bodies have said that our health system is well funded, in particular the acute hospital system.   What will the HSE do in the next two or three months to address the current intolerable situation and what actions will be taken?</p></speech>

There has been a significant major element of that extra funding, over the past two years, related to Covid.  By international standards, <i>The Lancet</i>reports and many other international reports, the response of the Irish health service to Covid is unmatched.</p></speech>

What will the HSE do in the next three months of June, July and August, and before we get into the winter period, to remedy this sad situation in accident and emergency units that are well funded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022052600002#B00900"><p>I know, Chair.  I did say that I was going to address his question from three points.  The first point was that extra funding has gone in and what has been delivered for it, and Covid is one aspect of that.</p> <p>  Specifically related to waiting times, we have seen the experience of what has happened in the first quarter of this year, which has been a major impact on hospital services in particular in terms of Covid.  Although the impact on the community, thankfully, is in a much better place now but our hospitals experienced one of the worst quarters that we have seen throughout Covid.  That has also resulted in, as we have come through the last quarter, a higher presentation of people to emergency departments with a particular higher presentation of people over 75 years of age.</p> <p>  Specifically related to the information in the response yesterday to the parliamentary question, what we are seeing is increased levels of presentation for people over-75.  Obviously these are people who have more complex needs and more care both in the emergency department and progressing through.  That is one of the reasons.  There is also a higher admission rate versus those under 75 years.</p> <p>  Specifically the third point of the question relates to what will we do over the coming weeks and months.  First, we will continuously commit to the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy, which is a major investment in community services to relieve the pressure on acute services.</p> <p>  I have given a number of examples and I shall cite a few.  First, there are multidisciplinary response teams that operate in community services.  There are 30 teams that are now funded to care for older persons and 30 teams are being resourced to care for people with chronic disease illnesses.  Community health networks are largely trying to shift the pressures away from the acute hospital system and emergency departments to give people care in the community, and that also involves the National Ambulance Service to provide services in the community.</p> <p>  Specifically to the third point of the question, which is what actions will be taken over the coming weeks and months.  We are working with each of the hospital sites on an individual and group basis, responding to us and, indeed, in conjunction with the Minister, about a range of actions to be taken over the coming weeks, and particularly as we head into winter months again.  That will involve some elements of doing things differently.  Thankfully, we hope that with where Covid is at the minute we would be able to reduce the need for dual pathways in emergency departments, which puts significant pressure on resourcing.</p> <p>  Finally, to answer the question.  A major element of our approach to capacity and capability is our resourcing strategy, which is all about strengthening and increasing the resourcing.</p><p>We are working in a competitive market, which I will be happy to talk about later on.</p><p> In summary, it is a combination of strengthening the capacity in the community, the redesign of pathways in our emergency healthcare, and the increase of our capacity in resourcing.  My colleagues will-----</p></speech>

To be fair to the Government, we certainly have an input of funding from it that depicts a first-class health service.  Some would say that, although we are investing &euro;21 billion in the health service, we are getting a Third World service.  I understand and accept health is a massive area and cannot be easy to manage.  I am directing this question to Mr. Watt, but if we take what Mr. Reid has said in response to the Chairman&rsquo;s query, that we have over-75s going to accident and emergency departments and having to wait 14 hours, that would probably be reflective of the home care package support scheme not working.  The Government, in fairness, as I have said, has allocated an extra 1 million hours to the home care support scheme but there is no delivery on those hours.  We are now seeing the results of that in our accident and emergency departments.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt is top dog now.  What specific actions has he taken to ensure that vast allocation of funds results in the delivery of a First World health service?</p></speech>

There are many different dimensions to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  In very straightforward terms, the agenda is to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare and the reforms to ensure the increased capacity to deliver on extra activity in the hospital across all of the different areas of responsibility.  It is also to ensure there is a shift to the left and, as Mr. Reid has mentioned, that more care is provided in the community and closer to people&rsquo;s homes.  It is to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare and the reforms, and to enhance the overall value for money, productivity, effectiveness and efficiency of the system.  That is what our Department is doing in terms of working with Mr. Reid and his team in driving the reform agenda across the health system.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the health system is well funded and there are resources there.  We need to ensure these resources deliver better for citizens.  The Deputy mentioned the issue around emergency departments, as did the Chairman, and everybody acknowledges that is not acceptable.  There are also issues around waiting lists that are too long and where people waiting too long for treatment.</p> <p>  Everybody shares the analysis and the answer is we are implementing Sl&aacute;intecare and driving the reforms.  Everybody supports those reforms and it is welcome we have a clear consensus on that.  Our job is with the Minister, the Government and the various teams we have in the Department to deliver on that reform agenda.</p></speech>

The question was what actions has Mr. Watt taken to ensure the implementation and that there is an efficient use of the allocation of funding?</p> <p>  Let me be clearer and we will move on to the issue of mental health.  Some &euro;23 million was allocated.  This has been widely reported in the newspapers but I do not want to go there.  Where I want to go is that, at &euro;23 million, we have growing waiting lists in our health service, particularly in the area of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Mr. Watt mentioned the leadership, policy and direction in his opening statement.  I can only see the direction going one way: backwards.  I ask in relation to that &euro;23 million, if Mr. Watt can tell me what actions he has taken as the Secretary General, on a huge salary, and that is as much as I am going to say, to ensure that allocation of &euro;23 million extra delivers the service that reflects a First World mental health service.</p></speech>

The &euro;23 million refers to the new service development, and the increase in mental health spending for next year is &euro;55 million to &euro;56 million, so there is an increase across the board.  In effect, that goes to improve services and a large part of it is devoted to the recruitment of staff.  It is our job in the Department, as part of the Estimates process, ultimately to negotiate and finalise the settlement on each of the budget lines, including mental health.  That money is then allocated to the HSE and distributed to the different service entities within the HSE.  Our role in the Department is to negotiate the budget, set the overall policy, and then to engage in oversight of how that money is spent and the services are delivered.  Our role is one of oversight and the HSE is in the business of actually delivering the services.</p></speech>

A, would Mr. Watt say he has identified the problem and he does not know what to do about it?  B, would he say he has not identified the problem?  C, would he say he is on a large salary, gets paid regardless and just does not care, because we are seeing no improvement in the health service?  I have asked Mr. Watt about two areas, CAMHS and the home care support scheme, and what actions he has taken to implement the 1 million extra hours that have been granted by the Government.  To be fair, the Government is doing its bit.  We are not starved of funding but we seem to have a Third World health service with growing waiting lists.  Is it A, B, or C?</p></speech>

The challenge within the health system, as we all know, is that there are increasing demands every year on foot of demographic change, primarily, technological change, and the greater availability of procedures and options for people to improve their health and well-being.  Our role in the Department, along with our colleagues in the HSE, is to improve the services, and that is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  I contend, and we can discuss it this morning, that very significant improvements in services are taking place this year.  On waiting lists, it is proposed there will be more activity in this area than we have ever had where funding has been allocated.  The hope and expectation is that we will start to see waiting lists coming down, notwithstanding the difficulties caused by Covid-19 in the first quarter of the year.</p> <p>  Our job is to work with the Minister in driving change and reform within the health system.</p><p>That is what I and my colleagues do daily. </p></speech>

In the D&aacute;il, when I question the Minister for Health, or the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions, and I say we have increased the number of people waiting on home care support by more than 100 since an extra 1 million hours were provided, the Taoiseach responds by telling me these 1 million hours have been given.  Mr. Watt is the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  Will he tell me what actions he has taken to ensure the delivery of these 1 million hours?  If not, I suppose we could just regard whatever is said when the Minister or the Taoiseach stand up, or even whatever is outlined during the delivery of the Budget Statement, as complete and utter spin.  I am making this simple for Mr. Watt.  What action has he taken in this regard?</p></speech>

There is a challenge this year in delivering on the targets set out, and this is primarily a recruitment issue.  It is about recruiting staff into the area to deliver the services.  A group has been set up to explore how we can improve recruitment.  We and the HSE are involved with that undertaking.  Concerning the issue of home care, then, there is a commitment and the Government has allocated money.  Last year&rsquo;s provision was the highest ever and there has been an increase in the hours again this year, and we are delivering on that.</p></speech>

I have heard about the problems, but what I am not getting from Mr. Watt are the solutions.  I say that because I believe the expectation of this committee, and of the public, is that we appoint people to positions to solve problems and not to be telling us what the problems are all the time.  We appoint people to come up with solutions that reflect the fact that we have doubled the health budget and we now have the fourth richest health budget <i>per capita</i>in the world.  There is no other way to put it.  I thought that statistic referred to Europe.  It is worse, however, because it is global; yet we are probably reflective of a Third World service.  I again ask Mr. Watt, as the problem-solver and Secretary General of the Department of Health, what actions he has taken or what has he brought to the table?  I must ask if he feels that he is in the appropriate position.  Will Mr. Watt tell me the actions he has taken that will deliver on the 1 million hours and the 23 million hours it was widely reported-----</p></speech>

I am only using that as an example.  This is reflective of the situation across the service.  If the Chair wishes, I could go into the issue of the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, and the debacle regarding the child disability network.  We do not have a full child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, team anywhere in the country that is reflective of the budget.  The concept of the child disability network teams is a joke.  I had a case concerning a child aged nine whose application for a wheelchair sat on a desk for nine weeks.  I have also dealt with anorexic patients, of whom there are some 23 in Wexford, and a paediatric dietician has not been added to the CAMHS service.  I was also contacted by a clinical nurse specialist with 13 years' experience and who was moved from one CAMHS unit to another.  There was no explanation.  That clinical nurse specialist sat for two weeks with no handover process, no files and no computer and it was impossible to see patients.  He was then escorted out by a security guard when he returned to get his belongings.</p> <p>  These are the questions the public wants answered.  This committee and Mr. Watt should be working together to get the answers.  The only difference is that Mr. Watt is paid a large salary.  This is not to be derogatory; it is just a fact.  It is a salary that got much publicity.  Therefore, I am asking Mr. Watt what actions he has brought to the table to ensure delivery of all these things.  I am asking this because if I was given &euro;1 million to go from A to B, and, having received that money at A, I arrived at B with no money, I would want to be able to give an explanation, rather than just saying it went down a black hole.  This is what I am asking.  On behalf of the public, represented here by the members of this committee, what actions has Mr. Watt taken to ensure delivery of the service that warrants &euro;21 billion?</p></speech>

There is significant change and improvement in the system across a variety of areas, which I think we can all acknowledge.  Of course, our health system, like every other health system, has ongoing challenges and our job is to do what we can with the money we are allocated to address those challenges.

I ask this to ensure that Deputy Murphy will have some idea in respect of progress being made.  Would that be helpful to the Deputy?</p></speech>

I know what a Third World service is like.  We are recognised as having the longest life expectancy by any OECD measure.  It is important for the record to state this in the context of public perceptions.  We are trying to recruit and to retain people in a public service.  It is a health service that has many challenges, but some of the references to us having a Third World service are not correct.  They are not borne out by life expectancy and or by cancer care or cardio care.  We accept we have radical challenges-----</p></speech>

I will focus first just on the redeployment of HSE nursing home staff.  Back in December 2021, the Department of Health published the value for money review on nursing home care costs and its corresponding response to the recommendations.  I think there were nine recommendations outlined.  Recommendations Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are related to the examination around operations, agency staff and costs within the public nursing service.  The rationale around recommendation No. 5 stated that the biggest driver to cost differentials is staffing levels, and public nursing homes have approximately 2.5 times as many nurses to residents as private nursing homes.  Recommendation No. 6 outlined that an extensive review, an audit process, would be established and the HSE care staff are not contracted to specific nursing homes, but instead to community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  It was agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE that the recommendations would be reviewed and combined with the deployment of the single assessment tool and other existing work streams to inform the development of any new service models.  My first question is directed to Mr. Reid around the HSE care staff being contracted to CHOs rather than individual nursing homes.  Is there a system to allow for staff to be easily transferred among public health nursing homes?</p></speech>

The reality is, we are not awash with staff in our community nursing units in general.  In terms of that part of our services, we are challenged much of the time.  People often want to work close to home, so our community units are in local areas.  Generally, we have a mix of people who are employed directly within facilities and, in more recent times, we may have employed them within a CHO.  However, people can move.  They can be called upon within an area.  In terms of nursing homes in the private sector, the HSE does not deploy staff in that way.</p></speech>

There are two different things going on there.  In terms of the ratio of nursing, which is what the Deputy is referring to in the first point, we have a higher ratio.  Historically, we have seen that within our public units, we often take a different type of person.  We will often take people who are more complex.  We are looking at that in terms of the investment that has been made that has been referenced in terms of what has happened within the health service in the past two years as we contract beds elsewhere and look at how we actually manage the different types of needs.  People now are living longer, have more complex needs and multi-morbidities.  We have a need for different types of skilled staff.  We certainly learned this during Covid in terms of our Covid response teams and we are trying to ensure we can support the broader area through our specialist staff.  Generally, within the HSE, be it older persons' or other services, we try to focus on the higher acuity.  We have higher nursing and staffing ratios.  That is confirmed and there is no dispute around that.</p></speech>

Within certain areas and certain parts of the country, be it older persons' services or, indeed, any services, it is much harder to recruit.  It depends on the service.  I would also note that in terms of carers, as everywhere, we are very challenged in getting the care staff, either within the community or in community nursing units.</p></speech>

Effectively, we have looked at all of our approximately 7,000 beds in the public nursing homes, be they long-stay or short-stay beds, in terms of what is open, closed and whether they are closed temporarily or permanently.  As Ms O'Connor said, the value for money, VFM, report was very clear.  For every 100 beds in the public sector, there are more staff overall.  The mix of nurses is higher.  While we pay our nurses the same as the private sector, the salaries for healthcare assistant staff who tend to have higher education qualifications are higher in the public system.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  The report also looked at the-----</p></speech>

I apologise.  I am getting there.  The first step in looking at that is obviously to examine the beds.  We then have to do two key pieces that the VFM report outlines.  One is that we need to introduce the interRAI assessment tool across the health sector, which is a standard assessment tool.  We have plans to recruit 128 assessors by the end of the year, with the first 26 being recruited in July.  So far, we are on track for that.  The other piece is we need to close out with the Department is a longer piece of work to do, within the safe staffing framework, including figuring out the right mix of staff between healthcare assistants and nurses for different complexities of patient.  That is a big issue that came up in the expert panel report on nursing homes in mid-2020 and it was picked up again in the VFM report.  There is nothing in the VFM report that necessarily says that the level of staffing in the HSE is inappropriate.  If anything, it is likely the private sector nursing home staff will have risen and need to rise-----</p></speech>

On the HSE treasury management, the cash balance held by the HSE at the end of December 2020 was in the region of &euro;812 million, which was an increase of &euro;458 million on the 2019 balance of &euro;354 million.  The HSE states that this is equivalent to holding 13 days' cash for its normal day-to-day operations.  I certainly find that figure astonishing.  The HSE also stated in its advanced briefing, which we thank the witnesses for, that it would typically hold, on average, three to four days' cash for the year.  The above balance was due to the final drawdown from the Exchequer based on the estimated year-to-year cash requirements.  Can Mr. Reid outline the reasons behind the large increase in the HSE cash balance at the end of 2020?</p></speech>

As the total budget goes up, particular as it did in Covid, where it accelerated rapidly and necessarily so, there was also a significant move to make payments through non-pay.  In other words, many more suppliers were engaged.  The HSE has been very clear that it has no desire to hold more cash than it needs, as long as we have enough cash to meet our liabilities.  Those ten to 13 day cash figures, the &euro;600 million and &euro;800 million, they are at the end of the year, literally for one or two banking days.  For the rest of year, as I said, we average about three and a half days, which is just under &euro;200 million.  That is the figure agreed with the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>It is of no benefit to the HSE.  We do not earn interest on it, nor do we pay negative interest, which is very important.</p></speech>

It is the first opportunity for us with all of them present to acknowledge what has taken place over the past two years.  Some of the witnesses were more visible in the battle against Covid than others.  That speaks to the hundreds of thousands of people in the HSE, in particular, those working in hospitals and as carers.  I acknowledge that now that we have a little bit of distance from Covid, although it is far from over.  </p> <p>  I will be tougher than Deputy Murphy.  I will not give the witnesses multiple choice options.  I will speak about reports in February 2022 with regard to additional funding being provided by Government for mental health services.  A recording took place by officials in preparation for an internal departmental budgetary meeting.  It is an alarming prospect, given the cyberattack that happened last year, that illegal recordings can take place within the Department.  I am interested to hear about that.  There certainly was a view in the reporting that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, had almost recklessly allocated additional funding and that there was no real attempt at departmental level to try to spend the money in that year.  There was a very cavalier attitude to how that additional money had been arrived at and that there was no basis for it.  There also seemed to be no urgency as to how it might be spent.  With the witnesses having been given time to reflect on what happened, do they think that was a fair representation of the attempts by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to try to allocate additional money for CAMHS?  My understanding is that those requests came from service-delivery elements of the HSE and this was not a notional figure dreamed up by a Minister of State seeking headlines, which was certainly the tone of the reporting.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and other Ministers make their case for money.  That is their job and what they are there to do.  As part of the cut and thrust of Estimates, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, defends her corner as one would expect and argues for her case.  In terms of the nature of the engagements, the way the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, went about her business was perfectly fine.</p></speech>

Is there a perceived acceptable level of time or lag before that sort of money can be delivered into service delivery?  There is a real frustration, especially in mental health services.  Perhaps I might be better directing this at Mr. Reid.  The money does not seem to be the problem here.  Of course, recruitment is an issue, but we have people who are desperately seeking mental health services, particularlly children.</p></speech>

In terms of mental health services, CAMHS and budgets overall, we have certainly seen increased funding in the period 2012 to 2021.  There has been increased funding of &euro;452 million extra in that period.  In that time, we have recruited 1,500 extra staff into mental health services.  I know the Deputy is asking specifically about the focus on outcomes.  We have been specifically focused.  We are seeing increased numbers of teams in CAMHS across the board.  Yes, there is a challenge in recruitment, which I am happy to take separately.  We have seen, as part of that over that period, reduced admissions to both CAMHS and mental health services.  We have built capacity over the past few years in mental health overall.  It is about shifting the delivery of services and the future vision away from congregated settings.  A major part of our investment funding goes into moving people more into supported care services.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am wrong about some parts of the country, but I still find it alarming that on-call consultants are available in adult out-of-hours mental health services, but the same on-call consultants are not available for child mental health.  They are both paid the same amount of money.  I cannot understand why both sets of consultants do not provide the same service.</p></speech>

Part of the challenge is the numbers in terms of having people available on call and rostering of consultants.  The reality is that we are trying to grow that model in terms of crisis support.  Our goal is to try to keep people away from the acute services.  Some of the investment in mental health has gone into that in terms of supporting other agencies to provide services.  Our role is very much at the specialist end in terms of secondary and tertiary care by our community teams.  We know that we have young people turning up at emergency departments and the paediatric hospitals.  We see more of that post-Covid than we ever have.  We are looking at how to respond in a far more integrated way.  The reality for us is that we are very challenged in terms of recruiting consultants into CAMHS.  We have some gaps and this has been well-aired previously.  We have locum consultants coming in-----</p></speech>

We need to have a service that can respond to people out of hours, as well as in hours.  If one responds out of hours at present, it will be a paediatric response in terms of paediatric hospitals.  Clearly, the preference would be to have that specialist support available but it is about being able to get sufficient numbers of people.  The reality is that the numbers out of hours are very low.  When it happens, it is very serious, but it does not happen very often.  Our priority is to be able to staff our teams during the day.</p></speech>

It is incredibly serious for the families affected.  I was very pleased to be the third speaker this morning because it was after 10 a.m.  I understand the HSE capital plan was published this morning at 10 a.m., which means the witnesses can answer my questions on it now.  I was very pleased to see a couple of projects in particular.  I was pleased to see improvements in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital which has had many problems for a long time.  The new ward block and high-dependency unit in Cappagh hospital was very much appreciated, as was the Finglas primary care centre, for which we have long waited and which I want to progress.  I understand there is funding for purchase of the site for the centre, which has already been concluded.  We are reporting in May for the 2022 plan and yet, there is no line of sight as to whether there is funding for its construction and building in 2023.  Do we need to move towards the idea of a multi-annual capital plan?  It seems mad that we are purchasing a site for primary care without clarity on funding.  Perhaps the witnesses will tell me now that there is clarity on funding and that the primary care centre will be built in 2023 or, certainly, that funding will be in place for it.</p></speech>

It is generally a three-year cycle of plans which has brought on the likes of primary care centres throughout the country.  It is designed based on a three-year plan.  If we commit to the design of something, we can complete the execution of it.  That is the case for the primary care centre.</p></speech>

We have a schedule of primary care centres to go through implementation over the coming three years.</p><p>I cannot comment on that specifically.

I will address one other point regarding the capital plan.  There is funding for the Beaumont convent site.  I was surprised to see that the site had been purchased because it had been zoned for housing by Dublin City Council.  There is an issue with paying money for land that is not zoned for the possible intended purpose.  Mr. Reid may think that permitted use is possible.  Will he address why that site was purchased and whether, since there were many discussions about different valuations, he believes value for money was achieved with the site?  Why did we purchase a site that was zoned for housing?  Does that counteract the Government's intention to deliver supply?</p></speech>

I cannot give a guarantee because it is reliant on recruitment.  We hope that we will have graduates come through our system over the summer.  The Deputy will be aware that we have previously closed some of those beds during the summer.  The demand for CAMHS beds in the summer months is 40% lower every year.  The number of beds in Linn Dara has decreased by 11.  We are recruiting and trying to get those beds open again for September.</p></speech>

We constantly hear about difficulty recruiting, which is mentioned in the HSE document.  The Taoiseach stated in response to parliamentary questions that there is not a resourcing issue but that it is a management and recruitment issue.  I am reading the document the witnesses provided.  There is monthly reporting of staffing.  They would have had knowledge of an issue well in advance.  I imagine a mental health service is a highly stressful environment to work in when under-resourced.  The national service plan bases its estimate on 10,000 staff for 2022, yet the HSE resourcing plan sets a target of 5,500.  Do the witnesses comprehend why people would see those as fake targets?  I know there are challenges with recruitment.  They do not receive the service that they expect to receive.</p></speech>

We see them as real commitments relating to funding and resourcing that we want to live up to.  I addressed the issue of 5,500 or 10,000.  Since January 2020, the staffing level in the HSE has increased by 14,700 to 134,500.  That is a 12.3% increase.</p></speech>

In the discussions with the Department, as we were formulating the plan and knowing what is happening in the competitive national and international market, we put in place a number of strategies to forecast what level we see ourselves getting to.  Our view is that it was best to state what the market was telling us at the start of the year.  The market was telling us that all the disciplines would probably require about 5,500.  We are still striving to achieve more than that.  Thankfully, as of the end of March and April, we were above the 5,500 mark, recruiting just over 600 per month.  We would like to reach 10,000 but we are reflecting on what is happening in the market.</p></speech>

We engage with the Department regularly, using the oversight arrangements referred to, and look at the recruitment profile.  We will make an assessment at the end of May and in the early weeks of June of just what that looks like as we plan for the rest of the year.  There will be a dialogue and discussion about the appropriate use of those funds.  The CFO might give a technical example, but that is what we are doing in practical terms.</p></speech>

If it is put to a once-off use in agreement with the Department, that does not take it away from being available once staff are recruited.</p></speech>

As Mr. Reid mentioned regarding the targets, there is an ambition to recruit 10,000 staff and the budget is based on that.  The service plan provides for 5,500.  A better approach to budgeting and planning in future would probably be a multi-annual approach to the recruitment and wage bill.  It is probably too ambitious to have a point estimate for each year.  It is probably best to state that we will recruit 15,000 over the next three years and money that is not spent this year can then be allocated to 2023, but there is still a commitment to increase the numbers.</p></speech>

When it comes to the substantive points that people make, I would want to see concerns being addressed.</p><p>If there are issues of disagreement between ourselves and the HSE, for example, we would obviously address those and we have a way of working together that delivers on the objectives.  I take the substantive comments as important.  It is something we have to reflect on and learn from.  </p><p> On the recruitment issue, there are significant lessons to be learned reflecting the reality of the labour market in which the HSE operates.  In many cases, the staff are not available or there is uncertainty about our ability.  As Mr. Reid mentioned, it is quite a startling number.  Before we add any additional people to the system there has to be 9,000 replacements so that is the first thing to do.  </p></speech>

The issue of fundamental errors and what exactly is a prior year adjustment was in that discussion.  The key point to note is that since that change happened some years ago the making of prior year adjustments has been more common because it is not only for fundamental errors, which these errors were not.  These are not fundamental errors.  In the past you only did a prior year adjustment if the error was so gross as to destroy the truth and fairness of your accounts.  This prior adjustment does not fall in any way into that category.</p></speech>

On the managerial structures and work undertaken within the Department, I understand the ministerial-management advisory committee, min-MAC, meetings are quite significant in the decision-making process, and briefing junior Ministers and Cabinet Ministers on work in every Department.  Since Mr. Watt became Secretary General, how many of those meetings have taken place?</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Donnelly joins that meeting on occasion, on a monthly basis.  During Covid, given the issues in relation to Covid we had a meeting at 12 noon on Monday and then myself, the Minister and Dr. Holohan and Dr. Glynn and other management board members, including Fergal Goodman, would have had a meeting at 3 in the afternoon.  We had what was basically a rolling min-MAC, you could describe it.</p></speech>

In the post-Covid situation we have changed our working patterns and obviously the Minister's working patterns have evolved.  The Minister then has meetings with the Ministers of State as appropriate.  The assistant secretary or principal officer in those policy areas for which the Ministers of State are responsible would join in those discussions.  They would take place as necessary.</p></speech>

If the Minister would like to discuss a particular issue, then the appropriate officer in the Department, who could be at any level but primarily principal officers and assistant secretary, would apply.  I do not get in the business of deciding who goes to meetings in the main.  That is the Minister and his private secretary would organise that.</p></speech>

We accept that during Covid decisions had to be taken.  Some turned out to be the wrong decisions and we have to ask the questions.  The <i>Irish Examiner </i>did a lot of work on the story about the &euro;450 million of unused PPE.  What safeguards did the Department put in place when trying to acquire that?  I appreciate that there was a rush and that a lot of difficult work had to be done very rapidly, and we did not know where things were going with Covid but it is an unmerciful amount.  A sum of &euro;450 million is by no means a small amount.  I want to get an insight into what actually happened there. </p></speech>

It is more an operational issue.  We had commissioned a review because we wanted to look back and see what were the learnings in relation to that.  The review was published by KPMG.  I think we circulated previously the outcomes of that.</p> <p>  We do have to go back and take a bit of context.  What had happened all across Europe was that the EU procurement rules were suspended or put in abeyance.  Manufacturing plants across the world were closed, particularly in China.  The market had collapsed.  Forces were at play that I have referred to previously, which accommodated piracy where when you secured an order someone else came in and paid multiples of that order.  Things like surgical masks went from about 67 cent each to over &euro;11.  That was the context in which the market was operating.  We used the Irish international agencies, including IDA Ireland and our ambassadors all over the world, to help us secure orders.  As a nation and as a health service, we performed extremely well by comparison with even some of our very close neighbours in Europe and beyond to the extent that other countries were coming to us about PPE.  However, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  We had to pay a price in multiples.  A small amount of supplied kit had to be exchanged back to China and there was other PPE distributed to the system that was not fit for purpose but had not necessarily been procured through our own procurement processes.  They were done through other people with best intentions for donations.  We have set out our learnings.  This was a market in which people were working 24-7 to secure PPE.

We await the outcome of that work.  It might be something that the committee will look at again.  I am sure we will.</p> <p>  Returning to some degree of normality outside of the context of the pandemic, I refer to cross-border initiatives and schemes.  Many things in our health service are not working and, unfortunately, people are forced to travel.  It is shameful that in 2022 that people are still crossing to the UK and other countries in their droves for healthcare.  I particularly refer to cataracts.  What is the HSE going to do to reduce the number of procedures required?  We get many calls in our office.  Unfortunately if they want to go through the public system, the waiting times are ludicrous.  It is something that I feel ashamed of and I would like to see a lot more work being done.</p><p>Can Mr. Reid give us any update or reassurance about what is being done in that regard?</p></speech>

There is a dual pathway from other administrations that avail of some of our services in terms of healthcare.  We have, with the Department and through the Minister, secured &euro;200 million of funding for the HSE this year.  That is an access to care fund that is primarily focused on increasing the capacity in the public system, utilising some extra capacity in the private system and developing new pathways to make it more efficient and effective, get more people through and get them their care.  That is a published plan with ourselves and the Minister.  It is extra funding to increase capacity across outpatient waiting lists, inpatients and day cases, GIs and scopes.  That is our approach to it.  We would like to see this addressed but we do have to avail of that capacity in the interim.</p></speech>

One person was in contact with us who is waiting quite a number of months now and undergoing intensive cancer treatment.  It is outrageous there would be people waiting months for that type of urgent help.  What work is being undertaken in the Department to deal with that?</p></speech>

The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, is based in Finglas in north Dublin and that is where they are processing those.  I am very happy to take up the particular case the Deputy has raised.  There is an emergency acceleration system.  We generally have increased resourcing significantly over the past few years in the PCRS centre.  The turnaround times have been good.  They would process lots of other issues in terms of GP and pharmacy claims.  I am very happy to take up the particular case the Deputy raised.  There has been significant extra resourcing built up to a very strong capacity in our PCRS centre and quite good performance levels and turnaround on medical cards.</p></speech>

I will finish with some questions about the National Ambulance Service.  It is coming up repeatedly. I am a rural Deputy for a rural constituency, like many other committee members.  The wait times for ambulances are increasingly worrying.  We are getting reports into our office of people having to wait in excess of an hour and in some cases much longer.  It is deeply concerning considering the budget of the HSE and the health service is approximately &euro;20 billion.  I do not feel we are getting good value for taxpayers' money in that regard.  Is work being undertaken to improve that particular matter?</p></speech>

Yes, we have a particular focus on the National Ambulance Service to bring forward to the Minister an overall capacity strategy to strengthen our capacity both in terms of capital funding that we are doing for extra fleet but also resourcing, which is part of our key plan this year, to put extra resources into it.  There are significant challenges because of our emergency departments, which have a knock-on effect on our ambulance availability, especially with some of the challenges we have in the acute hospital system and the wider demands our National Ambulance Service has taken on in the community as well.  In summer, we are finalising and have seen a couple of drafts already of a strategy that will seek to put extra capacity into our National Ambulance Service.  We will be presenting that to the Minister very soon.</p></speech>

I refer to figures for community care and public nursing jobs.  I have raised this previously.  I note that the exit figures out of the HSE were 3,722 to December 2022.  I presume the exits out of community services are part of this 3,722.  That figure is 3,305.  Has any real analysis been done as to why there is that level of exit by people from the community services?</p> <p>  We still are not making any significant progress on nurses working out in the community, although I know there are plans for this year.  I have raised the fact we will have a far larger elderly population, which is increasing as we speak and will increase dramatically in the next eight years.  I am not sure whether we are doing long-term planning for having more people working in the community.  Compared with the figures for December 2014, the real increase in public health nurses has been minimal compared with the increases across all other sectors.  I have raised this at previous meetings and will continue to raise it.  The HSE might give some idea of the planning on this issue.</p></speech>

We are certainly seeing more people leaving now in terms of our public health nursing workforce, and that is a concern for us.  On community services, one of the things that is shifting with enhanced community care, ECC, is the development of an approach around nursing teams.  We are challenged and are having considerable work to recruit clinical specialists for the community.</p></speech>

Someone else raised this.  I have come across HSE staff who have raised concerns that no one is asking the questions as to why people are leaving.  Is it because they have young families and the appropriate hours they require are not being given to them?  I have heard that people who have young families are not being accommodated at all.  These are really well-trained nurses who suddenly find they are being given hours they cannot be available for.  There is no adjustment being given at all.  Why are we not doing detailed exit surveys?</p></speech>

Just to make a couple of points on strategic recruitment and to reassure the Deputy, as he asked us, that we are very much looking at our recruitment.  Our figure of 5,500 for this year has put a particular focus on community resourcing and trying to get that shift into community resourcing.  We have our annual staff survey that picks up a lot of the issues we might pick up in exit surveys.  I will ask our HR director to make a comment on how we are trying to track some of these issues.</p></speech>

We have more than 42,000 nurses employed across the HSE at the moment.  In the area of public health nursing, the number of public health nurses in training has also increased in recent years.

There are a number of things to mention there.  On our retention strategies, as I mentioned, we have 42,000 whole-time equivalent nurses but many more in terms of actual employees.  We are very keen to offer flexible working, to the point the Deputy made about working hours that suit individual.  We have been very keen to that fact over the past couple of years.  At the moment, over 30% of our workforce have part-time or flexible working hours to meet their needs at certain times during their career when that is appropriate.</p><p>We do offer those strategies and initiatives in an effort to retain and grow our workforce.</p></speech>

I know of a number of HSE hospitals where the use of theatres is limited.  There is one hospital where patients are not allowed into theatre after 4 p.m.  A consultant in the north-west region advised me that she had been told that if a patient is not in theatre by 4 p.m., that is it, and the operation has to be cancelled.  Has that issue been looked at?  If we have a situation where a theatre is closed from 4 p.m. right through until 8 a.m. the following morning, that is not a good use of the space.</p> <p>  I want to raise another issue in relation to operating theatres.  I am aware that some private hospitals are now using theatre assistants, in other words, people who are specifically trained up to provide back-up support in theatres.  Is the HSE going to look at that with a view to ensuring that we have an adequate number of staff to man our operating theatres?</p></speech>

Generally, the findings of that were that it is all about looking at the whole process throughout the hospital and how theatres can be utilised more effectively, including in respect of the hours of use.  We are currently in discussions with the RCSI about running an equivalent process across a number of hospital sites with a view to rolling it out further across the whole system.  That will involve, for example, getting process engineers in to look at the whole flow of the hospital system, with a view to increasing hospital utilisation, and to look at the work practices associated with theatre utilisation that can strengthen their efficiency.  As part of the access to care plan, funding of &euro;200 million has been provided this year.  It looks at new pathways for care, which-----</p></speech>

As Mr. Reid said, we are doing a piece of work looking at theatre efficiency generally.  Trauma theatres run well past 8 p.m.  We are funding the use of elective theatres as best we can through the access to care programme, to drive as much activity as we can to catch up on backlogs.  I hear the example that the Deputy has referenced.  I would be interested in getting more detail.  However, I am not aware that that is a general situation.  In fact, I am aware that there is a strong demand for additional theatre capacity and a great desire on the part of our surgeons to use it.  The Deputy raised a point about theatre assistants.  The HSE has looked at that.  The process was somewhat interrupted by the duration of Covid, but it is an area that clinically we would like to develop.  As the Deputy has stated, it would be a sensible addition to drive more throughput through theatre.  There has been some work done recently looking at utilisation and the possibility of further enhancing theatre utilisation.  That piece of work is being supported at the moment.</p></speech>

I welcome that.  There are two issues that I wish to raise.  One concerns the amount of funding going into public nursing homes.  Such funding is most welcome.  I am wondering if we are looking at efficiency in public nursing homes and the cost of running them, compared with what it costs to place a patient in a private nursing home, for instance, under the fair deal scheme.  In a private nursing home it costs around &euro;1,000 per bed per week, whereas a public nursing home, it costs around &euro;1,650 per bed per week.  While I welcome the provision of funding, I think we also need to look at efficiency.  The second point I wish to raise concerns-----</p></speech>

The Department published the report of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Nursing Home Care Costs at the end of 2021.  That included a comparison of costs in public and private nursing homes.  There is a programme of work flowing from that, including in our service plan, which looks at precisely what the Deputy highlighted.  As we know, having more nursing staff correlates well with delivering better quality care.  The fact that the public system has more staff and a richer mix of nursing is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, getting the right balance between the two is absolutely part of that piece of work.  We are looking at the issue.</p></speech>

I understand that huge demands are being placed on public nursing homes because the buildings are not up to standard.  As we are bringing the buildings up to standard, should there not be savings made at the same time?</p></speech>

We only reimburse our public units up to a certain cap.  If there are costs beyond that, we do not reimburse them.  We are very mindful that if we are over-reimbursing in the public system, we are potentially taking resources from the private care system, where we could get more patients into beds.  We are very mindful of the issue.</p></speech>

What will be done to try to make sure that people are getting assessments of need and the therapeutic services that they need?  In my constituency, I have one child whose parents were told by the HSE that there was an assessment of need done on 10 May 2021.  I questioned the parents about this and they were confused because no assessment had been done.  However, I appreciate the letter I received from the HSE on 18 May that acknowledges that disability services acknowledged the error in the previous response that stated an assessment of need was completed on 10 May 2021.  This assessment did not take place and disability services apologised for the error.  The parents know the assessment did not take place because they are the parents of the child.  They are looking for the assessment to get a diagnosis in order that they can get therapeutic services and get the child into a school where the child will get the support that they need, as well as all of the therapeutic services that might make the child and the parents' lives easier as they try to navigate life with autism.  That is a problem which I hope Mr. Reid will acknowledge.</p></speech>

A recent court case set out very clearly that our process was not complying with the legislation.  Some 10,000 assessments need to be reassessed based on that.  We have very significant issues to deal with.  We are working very closely with the Minister and have been doing so for the past few weeks on how we will approach it.  This includes an engagement he and I kicked off last week with a range of stakeholders about how we will do this very differently.  It involves extra recruitment which is a challenge.  We are looking at recruitment profiles and how we can look at the qualifications for people needed to come into the system.  However, I fully accept it is a significant challenge.  We will have to redesign the whole process around assessment of need.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Reid to speak to me in practical terms.  I have a child who is waiting 26 months for an assessment.  When is he likely to get an assessment under the new plan?

I am sorry to cut across Ms O'Connor.  That may be so in some community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  The witnesses will be aware that the Ombudsman for Children is doing a report on the consistency across CHO areas, which is due to be published in 2022.  Certainly, in my own area of CHO 6, it is not so for the volume of parents who are contacting me.  I am involved with Ballyowen Meadows Special School in Loughlinstown.  It is a very interesting place to get an assessment more broadly, because children are coming from a range of CHO areas.</p><p>I met the parents, teachers and the principal some weeks ago.  Clearly, there are very different experiences for children and families depending on the CHO area they are in.  Therefore, while I appreciate that what Mr. Reid might be saying is accurate at a macro level, I assure him it absolutely it is not so.</p></speech>

The reason we went down the road of the preliminary team assessments, PTA, was to try to do a shorter assessment.  The challenge we have with assessment of need, AON, is we have different durations of assessment.  For some children the assessment goes on for a very long time.  Our resources get tied up in assessing and we cannot provide any intervention.  It was an attempt to try to rectify that and to be able to provide intervention.  The Deputy spoke of the challenge being about a child getting into school to get the necessary supports.  We are very challenged in carrying out assessments that relate to children's education.  In our discussions with the Minister, it is about trying to square that circle somewhat.  We have our staff working in disability services assessing all the time, not providing sufficient intervention, which is actually the bit that matters to the families, and teeing them up for educational supports.  We would argue our role in education needs to be looked at a bit and how we work with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, system in providing those supports.</p> <p>  What we know from the PTA is that we focus on the child's needs.  There is a big emphasis on diagnosis to be able to access supports, but the important bit is how we address the needs.  They are slightly different.</p></speech>

It is not an either-or thing.  It is very much both and they do not need to contradict each other and there is no need to have a stream that delays or impedes the delivery of therapeutic services, which is all that parents want.</p></speech>

Our priority is to get children into intervention and to be able to provide supports to them and their families as early as possible because, as the Deputy knows, the earlier the intervention, the better for everybody.</p></speech>

We know the availability of speech and language therapy and psychology is a huge issue in some areas, particularly for children with autism diagnosis.  You might go to a service where they have a physio, but that potentially will not be as significant for someone with autism.  We are looking at that in terms of how we can recruit.  We are challenged in recruiting in some of those disciplines.  It is also part of the work we are doing to try to level the playing field a bit.  There is no doubt we have a challenge in bringing health and social care professionals in for disability sector.  The reality is the disability sector is a hard place in which to work.  When we try to recruit young staff, they do not always want to go there.  They will want to go to primary care, hospitals or whatever.  Our recruitment for disabilities is tied up in the broader recruitment challenges we experience.</p></speech>

We have inconsistencies across our CHO areas in resourcing, communications and culture.  We have to make real difference in changes.  I personally have acknowledged that with the team to the Minister.  We have to make a cultural difference.  That is the challenge the whole system is working on daily.  It is a very challenging environment and I want to show my support for staff who do work in the area because we want to retain them and we want to secure more people in.  Like many aspects of our service, however, we have real cultural issues that we have to change in communications and patient experience and then going back.</p></speech>

A few people will not show up.  Deputy Carthy is taking Leaders' Questions, Deputy Munster has a bereavement and there are a few other gaps.  I will try to get people in a second time.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Reid focus on the dental scheme?  I will deal with the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, first.  The scheme does not exist in many counties.  Nothing I will say is meant personally.  I realise there are problems.  We have a system that grew up from a certain place.  That is what we have and we have to change it.  Only 660 dentists were active in the scheme in March.  That is 1,000 fewer than four years ago.  Of those who are active, it is very difficult.  It does not exist in some places.  In Laois we have given up on it completely.  Will Mr. Reid clarify this briefly?  I ask him to keep his answers short, please, as I do not want to cut across him.  In Laois and Offaly and across the country, if a medical card patient cannot get in under the DTSS, can he or she go to the health centre?  Is the HSE obliged to provide emergency treatment for them?  Yes or no?</p></speech>

It was just to clarify that.  There are negotiations going on and I do not want the officials to announce what is going on but we are dealing with thousands of private businesses because each dental practice is a private business.  That is fair enough.  I am not hung up on that.  It is the business they are in.  They have all come together and they have an association with substantial leverage.  They have the HSE, the Department of Health and us where nothing will move until they decide to move.</p><p>They will say they have justice on their side and they are not getting enough money and perhaps there is some merit in all that but it has been a problematic as long as I can remember and now it has reached the point where it has collapsed.  We can accept that.  I am not blaming anyone here for that but the system is not working.  Maybe Mr. Watt can come in on this.  Has the Department considered recruiting directly employed salaried dentists to work in the HSE to provide emergency services or services to medical card patients?  Is that happening or has any consideration been given to it?  I am thinking about Sl&aacute;intecare in particular. </p></speech>

It approved a substantial increase including the reintroduction of the scale and polish and an increase in fees which I understand have come in from 1 May.  There is significant extra funding but there clearly is a problem which is two-fold.  There is a shortage of dentists more generally.  We have been in discussions on how we can increase the number of dentists and train more dentists.  The Chairman's question about salary is interesting.  That has not been the approach that we have taken heretofore.</p></speech>

That decision was in respect of the additional money that the Minister was able to allocate to the scheme and how it would be spent.  From that consultation the Minister has made a decision.

That is what I am concerned about.  The system has been problematic going back years.  It is about Government policy but Government policy is now to move to Sl&aacute;intecare.  Mr. Watt and I know what Sl&aacute;intecare is about: it is a public health system.  I do not want to be too ideological about it but it generally means that we would directly employ dentists who would be obliged to see patients.  It is also about where graduates come out of training that it would be attractive and they would see a career in dentistry within the public system.  Not all of them want to be running a business.  It is the same with GPs.  Not all GPs coming out of training want to run their own practice.</p></speech>

Health professionals and common sense tell us that it is about a stitch in time and early intervention.  Failure can mean bad dental health and general health further down the line.

If people come into a system that is overloaded they are not inclined to stay because they are overworked.</p> <p>  So, with dentists, at this point, at Secretary General in the Department and CEO level of the HSE what is being done?  What is being said to the Government?  The Minister for Further and Higher Education Research Innovation and Science comes in to this too.  We need to train more dentists.  Are we only offering them short-term contracts when they come out of training and they say "Get lost with that, I'm off to Australia where I can get a permanent job"?  What is happening there?  Are they not going into the system?  Are we telling people in the universities that there is a career path here for them?

The public ask me what has happened to the system.  People in the midlands raise it with me but it is replicated across many counties.  There is a budget that comes across from the Oireachtas and the Department of Health and it goes to the HSE.  I know there is no sticking plaster and it is about the pipeline.  We have identified that we have fewer than half the school dentists that we need.  Is there resistance from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about training?  Is there resistance from colleges?  Yes or no?</p></speech>

Many of the areas the Chair has spoken about this morning can be driven by demography and other factors can impact on the demand.  Something that I have focused on, and Mr. Reid is very much aware of this as we have had many conversations about this, is for us to have better workforce planning and align the educational attainment and the number of people doing undergraduate training and then placements after their undergraduate training in the hospital system.  I know the committee is stuck for time so we can circulate a note showing the different areas where we have increased and are increasing the numbers.  For example, from September, the number of medical undergraduates will be increased by about 60 and there are plans to increase it further.</p><p>The Minister for Health and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are working on this.  We have engaged with the medical schools.  We are now thinking of what to do about the dentistry schools and a proposal is with us.  It is an historical issue and we can start to address it now to improve the situation in four, five or six years.  As Mr. Reid mentioned earlier, in the interim, we have to retain the people in the system.</p></speech>

We are trying to address these shortages.  It is a function of the pipeline of people who are currently doing training.  They will be available in four or five years.  It is about our ability to retain people and bring them back.  A variety of issues are involved.  We need to provide more opportunities, particularly for young people who have completed the leaving certificate, to go into medicine, dentistry and a variety of specialties.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is committed to that and he and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are working intensively on that, particularly on initiatives for this September and September 2023.</p></speech>

I would like to touch on a number of areas.  I will be brief in order to get through them in the limited time available to me.  To touch on the issue of assessment of needs that we were discussing a little while ago, the redesign in the HSE that is being spoken of is welcome, but a definitive timeframe for when that will be published would also be welcome.

We are fortunate that we have services in CHO 6, with St. John of God, St. Michael's House and a number of other service providers.  That is excellent but there are delays in simple resources and facilities.  One involves a child who has been waiting for over six months for a wheelchair.  It is not anything bespoke.  It is a standard wheelchair.  There has to be a better turnaround time.  I assume there was a good tendering process, with these being brought in and delivered to families who need them.  Is there a reason for such an inordinate delay for something as simple as a wheelchair?</p></speech>

The Deputy says it is a straightforward wheelchair.  I do not know what the story is there.  There has been an avalanche of requests for aids and appliances recently.  That massive demand may be a factor.  I would have to check out the specific case.  We have some issues with supplies.  It depends on the specifics of the wheelchair.  We have some issues with supplies and a challenge with the volume of requests and assessing people for equipment.  I would need to know the details.</p></speech>

It seems to be a maze for those families.  We need to clear a pathway.  There should be a helpline to ring and information about the services and entitlements that people will be afforded.  If something niche or bespoke is required, people understand that there will be a delay.  I cannot understand such a delay for such a basic necessity as a wheelchair.  The answers I have got about why there is a delay have not been clear.  I will liaise further with Ms O'Connor about that.  To me, it points to a bigger problem.</p> <p>  We have an issue with residential care and respite places in CHO 6, which I understand happens nationwide.  How are we progressing with purchasing and staffing properties for residential places?  I understand the issue with staffing extends across the country.  Mr. Reid said that resources are not an issue for staffing and recruitment, but getting people into those positions is the challenge.  How are we faring with residential and respite care?</p></speech>

We often focus on assessments of needs and often do not focus on the other end of disabilities, which can be serious.  We have seen a significant increase in demand for residential placements.  Critically from our perspective, post pandemic we see that some families have just had enough.  Many people are coming forward, having gone through potentially two years of day services being closed and struggling with challenging behaviours at home.  We know that it is often a severe challenge for ageing parents.  We see some difficult situations for people with high complexity cases.  We are struggling to get residential places.  It is easier in some areas than others.  We are completely reliant on all those funded agencies that the Deputy referred to.  Regarding the cost of placements, we know we have to provide for many people.  If I think back to many years ago, if a placement cost more than &euro;100,000, it was a big news story.  Many of our placements now cost between &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million.  We are challenged to find places that have sufficient staffing.  Like the HSE, those voluntary providers and funded agencies are equally as challenged.</p> <p>  One challenge and discussion we have had with the Minister is about developing houses.  We are looking at how to do that better as part of decongregation and as part of respite.  In theory, the HSE should be building houses.  We are looking at how we can work with local authorities.  It is working well where we provide them with support.  It is a mixed bag, to be honest.  We are very challenged in Dublin, especially in south Dublin, with regard to anything to do with property, even for providing accommodation for staff to attract them.  It is a different picture around the country.</p></speech>

I am aware of a framework being discussed by the HSE and providers of certain continuous glucose monitors, CGM.  It is taking a long time.  There was a previous attempt in 2017 and 2018 to get approval for a particular monitor.</p><p>That has an impact on those with diabetes.  I do not expect Ms O'Connor to have the information right now but if she could come back to me on that, we need to have a definitive timeframe, given the fact that it is at least four years in discussions with the HSE, and also on the LTI list.  The supports and adaptations for the CGM monitors also need to be included on the LTI list.  </p><p> As I am conscious of time I will turn to the value for money aspect for nursing homes.  In the documentation it states the cost of providing service in a public nursing home was two-and-a-half times the cost in a public nursing home.  What is the update now that report has been published?  What will we see in changes of the funding model?  What is the thinking within the HSE on the Value for Money report?</p></speech>

It indicated that the average cost in a private nursing home was about &euro;900 a week and we are reimbursing public nursing homes with about &euro;1,600 whereas the costs are more like &euro;2,000.  Specific recommendations flow from that Value for Money report some of which feed back into two other reports, the Expert Panel on Nursing Homes and also the NTB Price Review.  As we said earlier, there is no mystery as to why the HSE's public cost of care is higher.  That is not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the richer mix of nursing staff and so on.  However we are doing a bed census at the moment which is nearly finished on all of our 7,000 public nursing home beds, long-term and short-stay care.  Some of them are closed.  We have to see which ones we can reopen, which need to stay closed and so on.  The aim is to set out a national framework by the end of the year for what the appropriate level of cost should be for public nursing homes, how beds should operate and the overall model.</p></speech>

Because the cost of the public sector is higher than the private, that report looked at costs from 2019.  It made it clear that those private nursing home costs were likely to have increased during Covid-19.  The Expert Panel Report indicated that perhaps they need to increase staffing levels to some extent, in some cases.  The gap will narrow between the units.  Some units are particularly challenged because beds were closed and the number of staff cannot be reduced just because beds are closed.  It depends on where the beds are closed.  The same cost gets spread over a smaller number of beds and the cost per bed goes up.</p></speech>

In regard to the waiting lists and the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, in April a total of 7,221 patients were on some form of public waiting list to be treated or assessed by a consultant.  How is the NTPF assisting in those figures or is it not assisting with those numbers?  Also, the last time the HSE was in, we spoke about the cyberattack.  It is obviously of huge interest to everybody that we would be well prepared and resourced to head off any other such incident.  However, the recruitment of the head of the national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, was outstanding at the time.  I understand that the salary had to be changed and another offer made.  Where does that stand now?  </p> <p>  Finally I notice in Vote 38(F)(1) on page 9 of the appropriation accounts for 2020 there was a reduction in expenditure in regard to the payments for those affected by thalidomide.  Why was there a reduction in that?  Hopefully that issue and the cause for those thalidomide sufferers is coming to a resolution after, not years, but many decades.</p></speech>

We are working jointly with the NTPF.  That is part of the incremental extra funding with a total of &euro;350 million extra in this year's service plan, &euro;200 million to the HSE and a proportion to the NTPF.  It is working jointly with us on the reduction of waiting lists which we committed to reduce this year.  Just to say that first, if I have not fully addressed it. </p> <p>  On the cyberattack, I need to differentiate.  I am assuming the Deputy's question relate to roles to be recruited within the HSE?  I know he said the NCSC was-----</p></speech>

In particular the cyber report related to senior roles within the HSE for which we are in the process of finalising an external recruitment.  In the interim we put a contract for services out to address a whole range of the actions on the cybersecurity plan.  We are about to finalise that and appoint the procurement team which will in the interim give us those two specialist roles on a contract for service basis along with the wider supports for the actions to set up.  Finally on cyber issues, I can assure the Deputy that we were not just waiting on those roles.  We have taken a whole suite of actions on security and protection.  I always try not to say them publicly but I want to reassure members that we have taken a whole set of actions on it.</p> <p>  On the third question about thalidomide, I cannot comment on that but will try to come back on it.  </p></speech>

The NTPF is allocated &euro;150 million which is an increase on previous years.  The expectation is it will contribute to around 280,000 cases.  If that number on removals from its contribution is not correct, I will come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

As part of the waiting list initiative we are looking at driving additional activities.  Like all parts of the system, the NTPF was affected by Covid-19 in the early part of the year.  We are back up thanks to the efforts of people in the public system in referring patients and because of capacity now available in the private system we are back up to the weekly targets of removals, working with the NTPF.</p> <p>  On the thalidomide issue, that had to do with slower than expected drawdown due to the mediation process being slower because of Covid-19.  It is &euro;15,000 lower than was projected for the actual spend in 2020.  </p></speech>

We contribute to that as do all Departments in terms of improving our preparedness and investing significant investment now required to increase our resilience.

One of the issues is the delay in the delivery of projects.  In 2020 there was &euro;833 million to deliver what is a substantial annual capital programme.  On current staffing, if we take for instance the CHO 2, the Galway estates team and the technical team that is there to deliver projects, there are only seven technical staff.  Do the witnesses believe the number of consultancy services we use and HSE staff within the estates and the building division is adequate to deliver on the annual capital plan?</p></speech>

Our estates project teams, and I do not have the numbers to hand, have delivered internally within the HSE very significant projects in particular over the past year or so including the National Forensic Mental Health Services Hospital, the National Rehabilitation Hospital with 120 extra bed units and a number of other big strategic projects.</p><p>They have a good track record in delivering. </p><p> Specifically on resourcing, yes, we are resourcing them further.  They do need it.  There will always be the balance between in-house expertise and what we can recruit internally and the use of contracted agencies, which we are doing.  I am very familiar with the demands particularly on the Galway team.  I have been chairing a call for the last few weeks with the Galway national and local teams on some of the significant projects that we have in Galway.  </p></speech>

In order to get faster delivery on projects, for instance the emergency department, ED, in University Hospital Galway or in Mayo University Hospital, why are we not using external consultancies to deliver on these projects?  If you look at detailed appraisal, planning and design, appointment of project managers, procurement, construction commissioning, we are getting timelines of over 60 months to deliver projects.</p></speech>

We do use significant external expertise and are doing so in Galway.  It is expertise that we could not build up within the health system ourselves.  That is not unusual for a public service.  We are a health service.  Our core model is health delivery.  We do have expertise in-house and we are strengthening it but we will always use significant external expertise.</p> <p>  On the pipeline delays and particularly with Galway, which I am very familiar with, there are significant planning issues that we have to work through.

For the Department of Health, anything over &euro;100 million goes to Cabinet for approval.  Anything below &euro;20 million seems to fall off the radar altogether.

There is an extra assurance process for projects over &euro;100 million.  They have to go through the external assurance process set out by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials can explain how it works in more detail.  The Government would have to sign off on it as well, because of the scale of the project.  We have a list of projects set out in the plan.  The HSE has published it.  We, along with the HSE, then monitor the delivery of those plans.  There are allocations this year for projects that started two years ago, ones that started last year and ones that are commencing this year.  It is a multi-annual plan.</p></speech>

On getting the business case, getting the insurance and getting the detailed planning, that has been reorganised in terms of the Department's new assistant secretary who joined the Department and is responsible mostly for capital now.  He is driving that.  He is trying to push through the different gates faster. The people in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can explain how that works in more detail.  There is a delay from the time that we can say something is a good idea, and there is a concept to build something to then develop the business case, go through the assurance process and so on before you actually get to the procurement.  We are trying to accelerate all those stages so that once it is decided that something is a good idea and we go through the cost-benefit analysis and have a clear view of the benefits and costs, that we can then get to procurement as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Some of the remarks would not go down very well and would be uncomfortable for many of my team who are here and who had to experience it.  We had dialogue with the Department.  Whether recorded or not, we always have very robust challenges both within our own team and the Department.  It is always very respectful, I should say.  So, yes, some of the commentary hurt but on the substantive issue, I believe that what happened this year in process for forecasting 5,500 people was actually the right process to say upfront, so the Minister is informed and the national service planning process is informed in order that we can make the right decisions earlier in the year rather than at the end of the year.  The intent of the process was to say what was happening in the market and the likely outturn that we would all review that which we are doing at the moment.  So I think the process was the right one.</p></speech>

Not everyone who blows the whistle is right but take Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the treatment of the person who subsequently left the HSE.  That is a concerning indication for me.  What is Mr. Reid's approach when people raise significant issues?  I was less than impressed.  There is a real serious issue of accountability.  There were media reports about the State Claims Agency in recent days.  The damage to the child and his or her potential is the key thing.  But there is concern about accountability, oversight and management.  What is Mr. Reid's attitude? How does he deal with it?</p></speech>

I met staff, in all the teams down there.  There have been some changes.  I met the parents of some of the children affected.  It was quite an emotional moment for them to feed back their experiences.  I met the look-back team involved, which will carry out the look-back review.  That was for me to get a deeper personal understanding.</p></speech>

Specifically, in relation to the person who raised the issues, they are of very significant concern to me.  There is a process in place for people to come forward with those issues and we encourage that.  That is the subject of a very formal process under the relevant legislation that we are continuing.  That process has commenced and the person who relayed those concerns is directly engaged as part of the process.</p><p>That is a very formal process that we triggered and I cannot comment on that in any particular detail but I did comment.</p><p> The Deputy, like many other Deputies at this Oireachtas committee and others, has quite rightly raised the issue of accountability.  She asked me what we have done about it.  In the very early stages of my tenure in this role, we brought a paper to the HSE board and looked at the issue of accountability.  There are a few strands to what happened that we must strengthen.  First, when we carry out significant reviews into what happened, or into the harm that happened to some people using our services, we tend to go into a cycle that involves carrying out the review and assessing whether somebody was at fault for what happened.  We go about it sequentially.  We are looking at that process to make sure we do it.</p><p> Very briefly, accountability in the HSE and the public service is a function of a range of issues.  First, is the performance management process in place?  We have to strengthen our game in that regard.  Second, are there very clear lines, roles and responsibilities across the service?  We are doing very significant work on that.  Third, when incidents go wrong, what is our process if a discipline process has to be taken?  Fourth, there is the whole issue around regulation.  This involves working through the regulatory health grades that we have and the right regulatory bodies when things go wrong.  There are a range of issues that tackle accountability.  I know that publicly it comes down to whether someone is fired or held responsible, but we have to take a very multidisciplinary approach.</p></speech>

There is supposed to be an open disclosure approach.  Obviously the State Claims Agency is the one that deals with it.  On the financial side, where are the settlements referenced when they are made?  I presume they are referenced in the budget of the Department of Health.  In terms of the last ten years, can the HSE give us a report on when the claims crystalised, the amount concerned and any learnings?  People do not want financial settlements and did not want the injury to happen in the first place.</p></speech>

Obviously, Mr. Reid is very aware of the decision to close the Owenacurra centre.  Much of that work probably took place during 2020.  I wish to raise this issue with him   A number of anomalies were evident in the process of making decisions on what was planned for the patients who resided at the facility.  Nine people remain in the centre.  Unfortunately, following the decision to close, there is no pathway forward for the current residents in terms of relocation.  How does the HSE plan to decongregate?  Following what has happened at the Owenacurra centre, I am quite concerned about the provisions that have been to provide more suitable accommodation and meet needs in the mental healthcare settings that are operated by the HSE.  Does the CEO think the HSE failed in terms of how it went about making the decision to close the Owenacurra centre?  For future reference, when decisions are being made to close down mental healthcare facilities, I urge the HSE to plan properly and invest in more suitable settings as it sees fit.  I say that because the HSE decided to close the Owenacurra centre but it did no work on the relocation of the service users.  Unfortunately, the remaining nine residents do not know where they will reside in a year's time, which is an unacceptable situation that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I know the Deputy is very familiar with the issues concerning the Owenacurra centre.  The assessment that our teams made found very significant issues around fire, asbestos, mechanical and electrical issues and space issues.  The biggest issue was the whole structure of the facility around daycare and residential services.  The rooms and the space that people had were not fit for purpose.  People who visited the facility or attended for day services had to practically go through residential areas or people's homes.  So the facility was completely unfit for purpose.  On the first part of the question, regarding the HSE's commitment to the Government policy of decongregating and securing sufficient facilities and accommodation, I have seen some of the residential facilities and one knows what good looks like when one visits some of these facilities.  We are actively and anxiously working with the remaining residents and their families to secure appropriate accommodation that suits and facilitates their needs.  We will continue to work very closely with the remaining nine residents and their families.  Very good progress has been made with other residents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022052600002#R01100"><p>My point relates to the decision-making process.  There are many facilities around the country that are similar to the Owenacurra centre.  These are HSE-owned and HSE-operated mental healthcare residential facilities.  Each facility is different and provides different levels of clinical care.  A decision was taken to close the centre, but no decision was made on what should happen to the residents.  Some residents have been moved to nursing home care.  We have had a lot of engagement with the families involved and, unfortunately, there are degrees of disagreement between public representatives and the families involved.  I think the HSE failed to plan where to locate the residents and did not put in proper work to engage with families.  Before the HSE's decision was made public, people discovered in July 2021 that the facility would be closed.  People were left in limbo for a number of months.  The HSE has changed its story on multiple occasions, which has made it very difficult for me, as a Government Deputy, to explain the situation to people.  For future reference and for the remaining residents, the HSE needs to plan properly when facilities are being closed.  In this particular case, there is still no concrete plan - many months later - for what will happen to the existing residents.  I believe they should be allowed to remain.  The number of patients at the facility has been reduced.  The remaining residents should be allowed to stay on until the HSE brings forward a concrete and decent plan.</p></speech>

It may be his view and I respect that, but I disagree with what he has said about the engagement with families.  I very fundamentally disagree with his claim that we changed our story, and with what he said about the process that was put in place, the assessment that was made of Owenacurra and the follow-through and detailed engagement with families.  Many families and many residents have progressed very well.  We will continue to work with the remaining residents in terms of finding suitable and appropriate accommodation.  We are looking in the locality in terms of the potential purchase of suitable accommodation and residential space.  It is difficult but we are working very locally to, potentially and hopefully, secure appropriate accommodation for the remaining residents.  I assure the Deputy that our local teams have very significantly engaged, and will continue to engage significantly, with the families of the remaining nine residents.  It is not an appropriate setting.  The Deputy is correct that many other settings are not appropriate, and the future is decongregation.</p></speech>

I will raise the issue of the elective hospital.  I note than only &euro;200,000 has been put into the capital expenditure for 2022 in this regard.  It still has not been signed off on.  We are still waiting for decisions on it.  According to the emergency department figures in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and Mercy University Hospital, it took twice as long for people to get access to services as it did for people in any other hospital facility in the country.  This highlights the urgent need for a new elective hospital.</p><p> The second issue I will raise is the time period we are talking about.  Will the Department give consideration to engaging in a public-private partnership, PPP, on the basis that the hospital would be delivered in a faster timeframe?  This is an emergency situation.  There has not been a new bed opened in the Cork and Kerry region in the past 30 years.  This is something we need to prioritise, particularly in light of the figures released today with regard to the emergency departments in Mercy University Hospital and CUH.</p></speech>

The final business case will go through the assurance process.  It is expected that it will be cleared with Government before the summer recess.  Significant work has already been done with regard to design.  The project will go for procurement in the autumn.</p> <p>  The project has not been considered for a public-private partnership.  I understand that it is to be a fully Exchequer-funded project.  In my experience, there is no evidence that PPPs enable projects to be procured faster than traditional Exchequer funding.  In actual fact, it may make matters more complex and further delay the project.  It is our view and the current view of the Government, which may, of course, change, that this will be funded purely by upfront funding from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

If there are options available to increase capacity in the short run, we would of course look at those.  There is capacity through the NTPF to access private beds through the fourth safety net agreement.  We have recently been accessing an average of 1,500 to 1,700 beds in the private sector every week.  There are also NTPF purchases on top of that.  There is very significant purchasing from the private sector.  With regard to beds, there have been beds added in the Cork area.  Some 56 beds were added in CUH in 2021 and more beds are planned for this winter.  Mr. Woods might be able to add to that.  Another 42 beds were added in Mercy University Hospital.</p></speech>

It is clearly beneficial to have additional capacity, particularly for the planned activity that needs to be done to address access to care.  It is with that in mind that those dialogues are ongoing.  That is built into the access to care plan and the resources available for that.  We are in dialogue on that and we will use any space that can be made available through that process.</p></speech>

At the moment, there is something in the region of &euro;3.7 billion outstanding.  Unfortunately, situations like this will arise in a health system but we have to work towards reducing them.

To clarify, a substantial part of the figure for overall clinical claims relates to catastrophic cases in the maternity area.  We are taking steps to improve that but the evidence suggests that the greatest issues there relate to the operation of the Courts Service rather than to the incidence of claims.  The Irish maternity service is as safe as any other in the world and safer than some.  The issue is the cost of claims under the legal system and the legal process rather than the piece that is within the control of the HSE or the health sector.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that we are a high spender on health.  That is good but we need to find out where money is going.  As I mentioned to the witnesses from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt's former Department, last week, what matters to us and to the public is what happens in between the money going in - perhaps it is sent up to Miesian Plaza in an articulated lorry as it is a significant amount - and services coming out the other end.  That is the puzzle.  I know it is not simple, that there must be management systems and that there are processes in place.  If you go to a meeting with HSE managers, you will hear all about it.  There is a budget and then there are the services.  I focused particularly on dental services.  The witnesses might provide me with a detailed note on that.</p> <p>  On this integrated financial management system, at a meeting of this committee on Thursday, 12 June 2014, the Secretary General of the Department said: "I am pleased to advise members that a detailed business case for a new finance operating model, including the procurement of a new integrated financial management system, IFMS, for the wider health service has recently been submitted to my Department."  He went on to say that it had to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which, as I understand it, rejected it.  I do not want to go back over that too much.  Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin went on to say: "Finance reform is the highest non-clinical priority of the HSE", and on the same day the former CEO, Tony O'Brien, said: "As the Secretary General noted, the finance reform programme is a key element of overall system reform in the health service."  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office recommended this in 2014.</p></speech>

I know very little about how computers work on the inside.  I can work them from the outside.  Mr. Watt might answer this question.  What is the budget for that at the moment?  Where are we at with it?  The years 2020 and 2021 have passed and we were supposed to have some shape on this for 80% of spending.  Here we are in 2022 and it looks like this will go well into 2025.

I just want to mention that because sometimes I think we assume that the difficult business of allocating and delivery will somehow be made markedly easier or better when we have the new financial system; it will not.  The new financial system will provide us with more timely information on an I and E basis to align better with the cash position each month and provide more granular detail on what is happening.  However, the central challenge still remains.  We are improving it in advance of the financial system.  I do not I want it to give the impression - I am not saying that the Chairman does - that in some way we do not know where the money is going, we are not getting value for money or we cannot link money inputs and outputs.  We can, but we need to get better.  The system may help but it will not be a panacea in addressing that.</p></speech>

I just want to go beyond what Mr. Watt said.  We are not waiting for the IMF test.  We can draw a linear line right now on the breakdown of our operational spending.  Some 32% of it is on acutes we can follow through.  Some 17% of it is on PCRS and reimbursements.  We can follow through with really good metrics.  About 5% of it is nursing, NHS, schemes and home supports - about 8% to 10% in total on screening.  For about 92% of our activity, we can follow through and demonstrate a linear follow through.  Yes, there are some that are more complex.<br/><br/>Regarding whether we are seeing any extra services for all this money, I made a comment to a Deputy earlier that we can certainly demonstrate all of the Covid benefits because <i>Lancet</i>has recognised it.  Equally, we can show we are having more AD presentations.  There is more help going into the system.  There are more supports for GPs.  There is more access to GP diagnostics in the system.  There are more public health nurses.  There is more recruitment.  There are more older persons schemes.  There is more community intervention.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses and the staff from the Department for joining us today.  I acknowledge the work done in the past two years.  Hopefully, for all our sakes, we are out the other end of that and can get back to more normalised things, giving people in the health system the opportunity to make the reforms that are needed.  I acknowledge the work that has been done.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff is for attending and assisting the committee today.  Is it agreed to request the clerk to seek any follow-up information and to carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting?  Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting?  Agreed.</p> <p>  With the agreement of the committee, we will resume in private session after lunch to deal with housekeeping matters before moving into public session to consider correspondence and any other business of the committee.

Before we move to the minutes, during the discussion this morning with the HSE and the Department of Health, Deputy McAuliffe referred to a matter on which he wishes to make a further statement.</p></speech>

These have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters in respect of the minutes?  If not, are they agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p> <p>  On accounts and financial statements, no accounts were presented to the Oireachtas Library between 16 and 20 May 2022.  We will return to this item at our next meeting.</p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p><p>The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  No. 1230 B is from Ms Helen Hall, chief executive, Policing Authority, dated 5 May 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Policing Authority on 7 April 2022.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this correspondence and to hold it over to today.  No. 1251 C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 19 May 2022, and is a related media article.  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy flagged this for discussion.</p></speech>

This piece of work was about a homicide review.  At present, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for crime statistics are produced under reservation.  Policing plans are constructed based on a range of different things, including crime statistics.  However, if those statistics are under reservation that is a problem because there is a reliability issue.  It is far from ideal.  I believe we have to refer back to the Policing Authority and ask it for a comment on this and how it stacks up with the response we got.</p></speech>

There were people who refused to sign off on the report on the grounds that it contained unreliable data and they say they were subsequently excluded from compiling a report on the issue for the Policing Authority.  It may not be the Policing Authority.  It may well be the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na writing to the Policing Authority.  However, I just feel the information on the public record is not correct.</p></speech>

We should ask GSOC if any of the protected disclosures that were made were against GSOC itself.  It would be useful to have a clarification regarding those that were assessed by an independent or external consultant and, if so, the cost for doing that.  Sometimes it is useful and important that things are done externally.  It is just to get that information to give us a more complete understanding of it.</p></speech>

Section 102(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 requires the Garda Commissioner to refer matters to GSOC that appear to the Garda Commissioner to indicate that the conduct of a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person.

There are tables in it, but I take your point.  We will ask for that.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1246 B is from Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, director general, Central Statistics Office, dated 18 May 2022, and provides information requested by the committee regarding CSO data sources for the non-profit sector.  We requested this information in the context of the termination of the Benefacts database, which we discussed with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last week.  It is clear from the CSO's response that the data it received free of charge from Benefacts were a valuable data source for the CSO across a range of areas and "helped the CSO fulfil important statistical reporting required under EU legislation".  In the absence of the Benefacts data set, the CSO states that it will need investment across a number of areas and even then, under EU statistical legislation, it would only be in a position to make aggregate data available.  Unlike Benefacts, the public would not be able to access information on individual non-profit institutes.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  With members&rsquo; agreement, we will also request sight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's value-for-money review or business case of the Benefacts database, which the Department has stated was a factor in its decision to discontinue funding the database.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On this matter, as I recall the previous discussion about this, it was less than &euro;1 million per year.  I think it was &euro;0.9 million for the last year of its operation.  It appears to be a relatively small amount of money.  I note the correspondence and what the CSO said about it regarding the benefit it was to that office.  It seems that the reason for closing this down and terminating the arrangement that existed has had major consequences.  The amount of money being saved is very little.  As I recall as well, the area it was looking at, the voluntary sector, has a spend of &euro;14 billion.  Was it &euro;14 billion of a spend in total?</p></speech>

We had a system that was working well and was being well used.  What is coming back from the CSO is explicit about the benefit.  The CSO is also saying that Benefacts data addressed many of the coverage issues that the CSO had in respect of the not-for-profit sector.  Essentially, it had positive outcomes from EUROSTAT audits.  How are we going to provide EUROSTAT with the same level of information?  It was satisfied with the information that was being provided.  We could see how it compared.</p><p>For example, one could have funding streams going to one particular organisation from multiple sources.  That kind of oversight was easily found.  It was a heavily used database.  Once it is closed down, just repopulating it or backfilling it would be very hard to set up again.  It does appear, however, that now there is the potential for complete duplication.  Another Department now wants to set up something similar but less comprehensive.  The Indecon report commissioned in 2017 highlighted that the benefit outweighed the cost.  The first few pages of the Indecon report tells us that.  It said that if it was to be decommissioned there would need to be a transition arrangement to make sure that there was not a gap.  All of this was very black and white.</p></speech>

The note went on to list the information supplied, the use of that, and the different headings and the variables.  It is very detailed information.  The briefing note also stated: "The Benefacts database has helped the CSO to fulfil important statistical reporting required under EU legislation..." and lists the various compilations.  From the public point of view, I do not see the logic in the termination.  I suggest that, along with writing back, we would note and publish the correspondence, and that we would also write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request sight of the Department's value for money review and business case for the Benefacts database, which they used to discuss its continued funding.  In that correspondence we could point out that we have this information here from the CSO, which is just one body that would use the database, and highlight that it is an enormous benefit to the CSO.</p></speech>

We could have the Department of Health and the HSE in every week because there are so many streams of things that we would really like to get at.  There is one particular paragraph in the CSO 's correspondence: "Use of the Benefacts database has helped the CSO to establish the universe of such organisations [We are aware that section 38 and section 39 organisations is outsourced] and has enabled the capture of all non-HSE income and expenditure of these organisations for inclusion in the System of Health Accounts, ensuring that estimates for health expenditure in Ireland are comprehensive. "  That in itself is of value.  I get the impression that there are people who are happy to see this closed down because it would limit the amount of information.</p></speech>

That is one thing we can do.  If the Deputy is suggesting we should go beyond that, and I believe that we should, then we need suggestions.  What can we do in relation to raising this?  Will we bring it to the attention of the Minister and the Department of the Taoiseach?  It is a relatively small amount of money in the context of the overall spend.  If it is oversight of the voluntary sector, which takes in a lot of the bodies that are funded by the HSE and various other-----</p></speech>

Okay.  We will ask for the Department's response on that and ask them if they are aware of this.  We will also bring some of this information to the Department's attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1247 B from Ms Mary Hurley, Secretary General, Department of Rural and Community Development, dated 18 May 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding the public funding of Benefacts.  The Secretary General states that the termination of Benefacts was a matter between Benefacts and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and that the Department of Rural and Community Development was but one of many stakeholders.  However, the Secretary General then goes on to outline that &ldquo;under a separate initiative, unrelated to anything previously developed by Benefacts, the Department of Rural and Community Development is exploring options for the establishment of a centralised grantee database for the community and voluntary sector&rdquo;.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  When I see words like "exploring options", it could all be a long way away.

The Department has confirmed its availability for that meeting.</p> <p>  At our meeting last week we also agreed to schedule a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

Separately, there is also an outstanding chapter from this year on the assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies, which presents an opportunity to engage with the Governor of the Central Bank and chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> On Deputy Catherine Murphy's proposal to examine the latest accounts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the three-year reform programme for the passport service, if we are bringing in the Governor of the Central Bank regarding the insurance compensation fund, which is a single issue, I suggest we also discuss the issue of credit unions with him.  We dealt with this matter recently and there are outstanding issues concerning the credit union movement.  The Central Bank is the regulator and the oversight body for credit unions.</p></speech>

I signed off on the financial statements for Horse Racing Ireland for 2020 only on 28 April of this year.  The standard procedure is that the financial statements would be presented to Government before being presented to the D&aacute;il.  There is that process and the Chairman may need to engage with the Department to get a view from it on that.  It is a long time since the end of the period of account.

If the Chairman were to seek to raise an issue with the Department, I suggest it should be its level of oversight of when funding is provided.  The Department will tell the Chairman that the organisation is a separate body and that the Department provides the grant aid but it is the oversight that is the problem.</p></speech>

There may be other elements of that Department we should be examining.  There was an investment programme in the Passport Office, some of which has delivered dividends, for example, in respect of automatic renewal.  However, there are other issues with the passport service.  There has been a problem for the past year and it has become a bigger problem recently.  I accept a very large number of passport applications have been made.  We should ask what are the returns on the investment that has already been made and whether it represents value for money.  Many applications are rejected on the basis of the photograph submitted.  It is accepted by the technology but not by the human being dealing with the application.  That raises the question as to whether the technology is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

Passports are a problem and a number of things have happened.  We all forgot to renew our passports because we forgot we would ever need to leave the country again when we were dealing with Covid.  Hopefully, we have reached the end of that now.  I know from replies to parliamentary questions that the Department has a programme of reform and investment in place and is recruiting extra staff.

We have members present in the committee room.  Apologies have been received from Deputies O'Donoghue and Griffin.</p> <p>   The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, have published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community from March 2022.  Face masks should continue to be worn when people are moving around the campus and during the meeting except when speaking.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community and I ask for members' full co-operation on this.</p> <p>  I propose that we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings held on 11 and 12 May 2022, which have already been approved at a virtual meeting.  We must do this for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Our next business will be the committee's engagement with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with such direction.  Before we hear from the officials, I propose we publish the opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I extend a warm welcome to Mr. Bill Callanan, chief inspector; and Ms Anne Marie Dillon and Mr. Aidan Moody, senior inspectors at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I suggest Mr. Callanan should make an opening statement for approximately ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members, with each member having approximately ten minutes.  If people keep to a ten-minute slot, there will be time for supplementary questions.  I invite Mr. Callanan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne Marie Dillon, senior inspector in the pesticide controls division, and Mr. Aidan Moody, senior inspector in the pesticide registration division.</p> <p>  I note the committee has raised some specific questions on the sustainable use of pesticides and I will provide some information on those matters later in the statement.  We are happy to provide further information if required.  I would like first to provide some context and information on the regulatory framework for authorisation and use of plant protection products in Ireland and on the current requirements regarding pesticide use in public areas.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the competent authority in Ireland with responsibility for the authorisation of plant protection products, including herbicides.  Pesticide active substances contained in plant protection products are approved centrally at EU level based on detailed assessments prepared by member state regulatory authorities and a rigorous peer review process managed by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA.  Products are subsequently authorised, or not, nationally by the relevant competent authorities in accordance with scientific evaluation and decision-making criteria specified in EU Regulation No. 1107/2009 and taking account of local agri-environmental conditions.  The Department is guided by the scientific opinions and conclusions of EFSA in regulatory approval issues concerning pesticides.</p> <p>  In regard to the use of pesticides, it is important to note the scale of pesticide use in Ireland is relatively low compared with many other countries, as evidenced by an estimated average application rate of 0.67 kg/ha of utilised agricultural area, UAA, which is among the lowest in the EU.  Ireland is also making good progress in reducing chemical pesticide use as measured by EU indicators.</p> <p>  Controls on the use of pesticides are implemented under the sustainable use of pesticides directive, Directive 2009/128/EC, which has been transposed into Irish law by SI 155/2012, European Communities (Sustainable Use of Pesticides) Regulations 2012, as amended.  The directive specifies various measures to address risks to human health and the environment, including requirements for training and certification of pesticide users, distributors and advisers, and inspection and certification of pesticide application equipment.  The use of integrated pest management, IPM, which includes alternative approaches and techniques to chemical use, is also promoted.</p> <p>  The current position regarding use in public areas is that public bodies or others may decide to use approved products if they comply with all the relevant provisions of the sustainable use directive.  It is stipulated that pesticides should not be used in areas used by the public unless a risk assessment has shown that their use is necessary and appropriate risk management measures have been put in place.  Non-chemical methods should always be considered in the first instance if they are suitable to deal with the weed or pest issue of concern.  In cases where pesticide use is deemed necessary on the basis of the risk assessment conducted by the user, products that are authorised for professional use can only be applied by a professional user who is registered with the Department.</p><p> The European Commission is finalising a proposal on a new sustainable use regulation to replace the sustainable use directive.  This is expected to be published before the end of June.  The Department will continue to engage proactively with other member states on relevant matters, including additional provisions concerning pesticide use in public areas.</p><p> Regarding the questions addressed to the Department by the committee concerning various enforcement and awareness-raising issues, the following points should be noted.  The Department's role is to implement the regulatory system for authorisation and use of plant protection products.  This does not include recommending or trialling particular products or techniques beyond the requirement that all professional users must use an integrated pest management approach in which the potential for using non-chemical methods must be carefully considered in the first instance.  An enforcement plan for pesticides is implemented as part the Department's overall multi-annual control plan.  The plan is risk-based and includes inspection of local authorities.  The Department is also actively engaged in awareness raising with a range of stakeholders to help them comply with requirements for the sustainable use of pesticides.  Examples include: presentations to local authorities, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and other stakeholders; the provision of information and updates to a range of key stakeholders; and the provision of extensive information on the Department's pesticides website, including guidance on best practice and responsible pesticide use and risk assessment templates for users.  This information will be reviewed and amended as necessary when further details of the Commission's proposal on a new sustainable use regulation become available.</p><p> The Department is committed to implementing the requirements around the sustainable use of pesticides to minimise the use of chemical pesticides.  A wide range of actions are undertaken to achieve this objective, including the implementation of a planned programme of enforcement activities and the provision of extensive advice and guidance to stakeholders.  EU indicators show that good progress is being made in reducing the use of chemical pesticides.</p><p> An integrated pest management approach is critical to achieving the sustainable use of pesticides.  All professional users of pesticides, including local authorities, must always consider in the first instance if there are suitable non-chemical alternatives that can be used.  In cases where pesticide use is deemed necessary, authorised products must be used and users must comply with the product label instructions for permitted uses.  Products are authorised by the Department on the basis of scientific evaluations and risk assessments demonstrating safe use without posing an unacceptable risk to humans, animals or the environment.  The Department is guided in this process by the scientific outcomes from the EU assessments and peer review processes for pesticide active substances, including in particular the scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority.</p><p> My colleagues and I are happy to answer whatever questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned the time of year.  While that is important, pesticides are used throughout the year.  This year, we focused on raising awareness earlier in the year and have given presentations on the requirements to, for example, a Cork local authority and the OPW.  We also engage with other end users, such as greenkeepers on golf courses, and we have attended a conference of the Association of Turfgrass Professionals Ireland, whose members include greenkeepers and people who maintain the turf on football pitches and so on.  We put as much information as possible on our website.  We include guidance on particular types of use and ensure that this information gets out.  We also engage on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis with stakeholders who have questions on any particular aspect of the requirements.</p></speech>

We all know the amount of work that Tidy Towns groups around the country do.  Is the Department encouraging local authorities to get in touch with them regularly?  They may not be using pesticides, but they are doing some work for councils.</p></speech>

We regulate and provide guidance but it is up to local authorities whether they want to use glyphosate.  A number have decided not to.  We do not have the regulatory basis to tell a local authority that it should not be using glyphosate.  However, we are clear in our guidance that a general approach to all pesticides should be to ask whether they need to be used, how their use can be minimised and whether alternatives are available.  All of these questions must be part of the decision-making process.  We give guidance on that, but we do not have the legal competence to do anything other than suggest that these pesticides not be used.  That is a matter for local authorities to decide.  Some have made that decision and others have not.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  Do they agree that there is a new awareness among the public &ndash; communities, local authorities, Tidy Towns groups and environmental groups &ndash; about trying to avoid using most of these sprays, particularly glyphosate sprays, given the serious questions around them?  This has been my experience.  Is it that of the witnesses as well?</p></speech>

The objective of the sustainable use directive is to minimise their use to only when they are required.  This is generally recognised by all users and the public.  There has been a significant reduction in the amount of pesticides being used, which is a positive development.  In our role, we have a responsibility not only to point to reducing pesticide use, but also to ask whether it is safe to use, which is a critical question that has to be answered.  Significant risk assessments have been done in this regard.  By "safe", I mean from the point of view of the user, the environment, animals, non-target species, etc.  A great deal of work goes into the safety assessments.  We differentiate between safety and the clear message, which is to reduce the overall use of pesticides and consider whether there are alternatives.</p><p>That is an awareness both at public level and, I presume, among the local authorities.  Certainly, from our perspective, that is the message we would give out.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the clarification.  From the input we have received today, it is pretty clear in my mind.  I thank the witnesses for attending and for giving us the opportunity to bring to an end any ambiguity.  My knowledge is pretty limited, to be honest.  Awareness raising is an important part.  I ask the Department officials to highlight the importance of engagement and awareness, and perhaps also what they do.  We have a piece of work to do around the responsible use of pesticides, in particular in public parks and public amenity areas.  The important point is we need to bring people with us and educate people.  I thank the witnesses for today's contribution.</p></speech>

I also thank Mr. James Walsh, who brought this to our attention.</p> <p>  Mr. Callanan covered a lot in the opening statement.  A point I did not think about until Mr. Walsh raised it was spraying around public parks, children's playgrounds and so on.  Is there any way to put up signage before this is phased out?  In fairness to Cork City Council and Cork County Council, they are working on it and some of the municipal districts have taken this on board and will not use pesticides.  Is there a way of putting up signs to say, for example, that they will be spraying in two days' time in a certain playground as an additional warning for people?  If people are unaware they could be treading on sprayed grass or weeds when entering a playground, they will not be aware they could be taking some of these pesticides home.  That is my question.</p> <p>  I want to add a word of congratulation.  We have had awful problems with Japanese knotweed and I know it is an expensive and slow process to get rid of it.  Even on the railway lines in Cork, especially this year, I have seen that the treatment and extinguishing of Japanese knotweed has been successful, which is to be welcomed.  That is a separate issue but I want to put it on the record.</p> <p>  To go back to my question, is there a way for us, as legislators, to put something in place so there so should be signage or some kind of notice around public parks and playgrounds to warn people that pesticides are still in use and to take caution while they are in use?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022052600002#C00700"><p>The OPW, in its guidance, includes the identification of signage when it uses pesticides in public areas.  I am not sure if that translates into similar use by the local authorities.  Let us be honest about it.  Signage can be a valuable indicator but it can also be a point of continual challenge and focus.  From our perspective, before a product is certified as approved, we have to be able to stand over its safety. The critical element from a Department point of view is the confidence.  We are very open and transparent in terms of that process, which is very rigorous.  Before any signage, I would think that is the piece on which we have to be very clear and unambiguous.</p> <p>  We are guided by science in regard to the approval process.  There is a regulatory system at EU level which requires member states to take on a percentage of chemicals where there is a renewal of those safety assessments, and the Department does that.  That is divvied out among member states and each member state has a legal responsibility to do a certain number of products.  A huge workload goes into those.  I know from Dr. Moody that the evaluation of one chemical can involve 10,000 or 12,000 pages of individual documents.  That process is then overseen and feeds into Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, approval, which then feeds into the EU decision-making process.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very much guided by that in terms of science and, therefore, safety has to be paramount in regard to products.  Whether there are signs or not, our mantra is the overall affirmation of the safety associated.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Callanan tell us what proportion of local authorities&rsquo; records are checked and how much time typically goes by between spraying and when the records are inspected?  Does the Department have its own targets in terms of the rate of inspections and the timeframe involved?</p></speech>

Bodies like the local authorities must have a professional user who is trained in terms of the application.  Consequently, they have a standard with which they must comply.  When we do checks, it is based on a risk assessment type model where we do not check everybody - we just cannot - but we do a check of a percentage.  There is a requirement on the professional user to have a standard of record-keeping that we will then assess at inspections.  I will ask Ms Dillon to talk about our inspection regime in this regard.</p> <p>  As I said, we have done 45 local authorities over the past ten years, so we are looking at about five a year.  Every single local authority that uses it is required to maintain these records and have the appropriate systems in place, aligned with the guidance we have provided to it .  As with any professional user, we assume compliance and we do a percentage check to validate and verify that.</p></speech>

These would be taken as a random sample unless there is a particular issue we need to follow up.  Over time, each local authority will be included as part of that programme or that rolling inspection process.  From the point of view of records, they must maintain those records for a number of years and, therefore, we can look back if that is part of the inspection process.  They have to maintain them.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

Is the Department not concerned about the wide use of spraying of pesticides?  It is taking place widely and some local authorities have told the committee they do it because of the lack of alternatives.  Is it not something on which the Department should be taking a lead and recommending they move away from pesticides?  If someone does not take a lead on this, nothing is going to change.  We have seen some of the responses from local authorities, some of which have said they are going to keep using pesticides while others have said they have tried different stuff.  It worries me the Department is not recommending that local authorities use products like Foamstream or whatever else is available.  Is that something on which the Department could take a lead?</p></speech>

There was a man at the committee two weeks ago who gave a couple of different alternatives to what the councils are using.  Is it something on which the Department should be taking a lead?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.599" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022052600002#C01500"><p>In terms of the alternatives, there is a requirement in the first instance to ask if there is a need to use this . It is the first principle question that anyone, including the local authorities, must answer in any risk assessment.  The objective is to minimise.  What I want to be clear on is the difference between us confirming it is safe versus the requirement to minimise its use.  In minimising the use, there is a requirement to look at alternatives and to ask if there is a need to use this.</p><p>I assume that in local authorities' adjudication they have to consider whether what they are doing is just a tidy-up, which would be contrary to Senator Buttimer's point that people's knowledge and awareness have changed in this regard, as against whether they are creating a flooding issue or something like that.  They have to manage local areas.  As the Chairman has identified, there is also the management of invasive species, including rhododendron.  That has to be part of local authorities' decision process.</p><p> We have invested significantly in support for research organisations to look at alternatives to pesticides.  Those are biological, that is, they are biostimulants and biological agents, which are growing in use.  We have to recognise we are in a very mild north-western part of Europe, the climate of which is quite conducive to certain diseases of crops, making sprays necessary.  For example, &euro;2 million has been given to a UCD-led project looking into biostimulants and alternatives.  Another &euro;763,000 has been given to the economic and policy analysis of climate change, EPIC, programme, which is about IPM guidance.  More than &euro;1 million has been given to a UCD project called protecting terrestrial ecosystems through sustainable pesticide use, PROTECTS, which is all about looking at those alternatives.  To be fair, however, while there are a lot of alternatives in respect of disease management, the avoidance of fungal infection etc., there are not as many alternatives in respect of herbicides except natural cultivation, whether by hand or shovel or whatever other type of management.  Biologicals are not as available in herbicides as they are in pesticides.</p></speech>

Our main worries, and the worries that have been raised with the committee, are that local authorities are spraying footpaths to get rid of weeds, as Deputy Buckley said when he spoke about parks and playgrounds, and that people are using those areas and bringing those agents back into their houses, which is dangerous.  Local authorities should explore alternatives in that regard.  One of the reasons local authorities have given, which is no reflection on the witnesses as they probably cannot do anything about this, is that there is not much of a price difference between the products and that it is a matter of getting the machinery to carry out the work.  The Department, however, should encourage local authorities when treating playgrounds, pitches and so on, as opposed to crops, to use alternatives.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Moody to comment.  The Chairman mentioned alternatives to sprays such as foams.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aidan Moody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022052600002#D00400"><p>As for the Department's regulatory function in respect of pesticides, the remit of the Department is in respect of authorisation or otherwise of products and enforcement of controls relating to the use of products, including sustainable use controls.  As part of the authorisation process, the decision as to whether products can be approved is taken in accordance with the EU regulatory system for pesticides, which is widely acknowledged to be the most stringent in the world.  That process involves a detailed scientific evaluation of a wide range of information and includes multiple risk assessments to determine potential impacts on human health, animal health and the environment.  In accordance with that process, products can be authorised only if it is demonstrated they can be used safely for the intended uses and there are no unacceptable impacts on human health, animal health or the environment.</p> <p>  However, just because a product passes the authorisation process and is adjudged to be safe does not mean it has to be used.  The EU system takes a very precautionary approach, in particular to use of pesticides in public areas.  As my colleagues have said, the current legal position on use in public areas is that if a more suitable, more environmentally friendly alternative is available and the user has determined it can do the job, that alternative must be used, even if there are other authorised products that are safe to use.  In other words, if there is a viable alternative that has been determined to do the job, it should be used first before any consideration of use of pesticide products.  That is the legal position.</p> <p>  Getting back to the question as to why the Department does not recommend particular methods, it is not the Department's role to recommend particular products or methods.  As a regulator, we have to be seen to be impartial in how we implement the regulatory system for approval and the controls relating to that.  We will raise awareness that alternatives should be used where possible if they can do the job, but we are not prescriptive in that we do not say a particular method or product has to be used.  That is not the Department's role.  However, we prepare a wide range of advice and guidance to help stakeholders to make those decisions based on their own assessments as to what is most appropriate to the circumstances they face.</p></speech>

What changes do the witnesses anticipate from that?</p></speech>

We anticipate it sometime in July.  We will engage with it to see what the implications arising from it will be and make updates accordingly and as necessary.  It is difficult to say.  As Senator Buttimer identified, the direction of travel is such that there is a greater awareness as to how to minimise use and, critically, whether we have a system here that will approve and ensure the safety of products when they are needed and their appropriate use.  A key message I wish to relate is that the direction of travel at European level is to reduce overall use.  The overall farm-to-fork target is to reduce by 50% the amount of pesticides used.  I articulated in my opening statement that our direction of travel is such that we are reducing substantially the volume of pesticides used.  Everybody who uses them must ask whether there are alternatives to their use in the environment we are talking about.  Subsequently, the responsibility on us is to be able to ensure whatever is authorised is fully safe for use in any environment, whether professional or amateur, whether indoor or outdoor, that that guidance is available to users and, finally, that we are implementing the regulation fully.  As I said, that includes the requirements for sprayer testing, registration of users and registration of those who are retailing, distributing etc.  All those are in place, but there is an ongoing evolution of this area as time goes on.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

I do not know the timelines.  When we get a new regulation, it has to be discussed.  Consequently, we will update our guidance, as we do in any other regulatory area.  That would include booklets etc.  I have responsibility for the nitrates directive.  We have just introduced new regulations with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we will translate those into guidance for farmers this year.</p></speech>

It is important to ask questions, but we are in a completely different place in 2022 than we were years ago.  Biodiversity is now the key word and the new word in all local authorities.  Schools and Tidy Towns are really buying into biodiversity, and that applies to rural as well as urban communities.</p><p>There is a new debate starting in these Houses on the importance of our bees.  The general population have laughed at this for years.  They did not think it was important.  There is debate going on now about the importance of the bee population.  I see it going on right around me in my locality and in every county.  Any local authority that is still using weedkillers is probably pulling back even if it does not have to by law.  In certain circumstances they will pull back.  The other thing is that with the materials being used for playgrounds and things like that now, you never see weeds coming up.  I am involved in a lot of community projects, including playgrounds.  The newer materials just do not allow weed growth to come up.  Everything is moving in the right direction but we have to keep an eye on it.  If there are concerns, we must deal with them.  I accept that.  However, I feel we are in a far better space than we were years ago.  The Department cannot do every inspection under the sun but the way it is being handled is quite acceptable to me.</p></speech>

I will give examples of where we are supporting this generally.  We work with the National Biodiversity Data Centre and we are a significant contributor to the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  We have funded somebody to work with the agriculture sector on pollinators in the general environment.  Under our rural development programme we have a specific locally led project around the Kildare area for pollinators and their development at farm level.  I fully agree that everybody is more aware of this issue and we need to continue that journey by building education and awareness.  We are very open to providing whatever support and assistance we can in that direction.  For example, on our campus in Backweston, which houses the authorisation process, we have had a new approach over recent years where we do not mow public areas in the centre for biodiversity reasons.  I think "No-mow May" is the term used.  It is great to see that.  Even on our own campuses and farms we are a lot more focused on the achievement of biodiversity at all levels.</p></speech>

All the materials are up on our website if members want to look at them.  Our clear guidance is that, for any risk assessment, the question is whether we need to use a product.

The first, No. 4/22, relates to revising employment conditions for stamp 3 residence permit holders and is in the name of Ms Tracey Milledge.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment responded to the petition in February.  This response was forwarded to the petitioner, who in turn replied.  Her reply was forwarded to the Department, which replied on 19 May advising that partners and spouses of critical skills employment permit holders have the right to work without a permit and the employment permit is subject to regular reviews.  She also advised that the Department of Justice has met with the stamp 3 partners and spouses group, for which Ms Milledge is an administrator, and that the issue of workers' rights under the stamp 3 visa falls within the remit of the Department of Justice.</p> <p>  The committee recommends that the correspondence from Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, be sent to Ms Milledge for comment and to please respond within 14 days, and that correspondence from Dr. Quinn, along with Mrs Milledge&rsquo;s petition, be forwarded to the Department of Justice with a request for a response within 14 days.

The second petition, No. 14/22, proposes to raise the Defence Forces&rsquo; upper age limit and is under the name of Mr. Stephen Martin.  The petitioner considers that current upper age limits for joining the Defence Forces are very restrictive and, as a result, there is a risk the Defence Forces are missing out on suitable candidates who are keen to join but are currently above the age limits.  The Department of Defence responded providing information on current age limits for general service, technicians, cadets and certain specialist positions, and advising there are no current plans to change the limits set out.  The secretariat forwarded the correspondence from the Department of Defence to Mr. Martin and received a reply from him setting out the various reasons he thinks the age limit should be reviewed and raised, including understaffing.  The petitioner stated the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, acknowledged in a D&aacute;il debate on 12 May 2022 that the "Permanent Defence Force is currently under strength by just over 1,000 personnel" and to reach the level of ambition the Defence Forces are aiming for would "require an additional 2,000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500".</p> <p>  The committee recommends the correspondence from Mr. Martin be sent to Ms Jacqui McCrum, Secretary General of the Department of Defence, for comment and to please respond within 14 days.  Do members have any views on this petition?</p></speech>

There is a shortage of members in our Defence Forces.  I understand where Mr. Martin is coming from.  There are people in their late 30s or early 40s who want to go into the Defence Forces but they are engineers, mechanics or painters.  These are services that are needed within the Defence Forces and these people are well able and fully qualified to do the job they have been doing.  It would be no harm for the Department of Defence to look at this and try to take a common-sense approach.  Not everybody has to be 18, 19 or 20 going into the Defence Forces.  We have people with a profession who could be utilised and take the stress off certain parts of the Department.  I look forward to the response in two weeks' time.</p></speech>

None of us is in any doubt that there are people in that age group who could take up a position in the Defence Forces, although maybe not on the front line.</p><p>There are positions whereby we could increase the staffing level of the Defence Forces.  Do other members wish to comment?  No.</p><p> The next petition is No. 25/22, from Mr. Patrick Lynn, who calls for chefs to be added to the critical skills list now to save Irish hospitality.  The petitioner considers that chefs should be added to the critical skills occupations list to support the Irish hospitality sector in its recovery.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment responded by advising, among other things that all chefs are eligible for the general employment permit since 2019 and must have a minimum remuneration of &euro;30,000; that the critical skills occupations list is the State's premium permit that is used to attract highly skilled employees to take up residence and employment in the State like medical professionals; and that ICT or financial practitioners must have a minimum income of &euro;32,000 with a degree and &euro;64,000 without a degree.  The Department also set out F&aacute;ilte Ireland's role in helping the hospitality sector to recover.</p><p> The committee recommends that the correspondence from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment be forwarded to the petitioner, Mr. Patrick Lynn, for comment and to advise him to please respond within 14 days; that we contact F&aacute;ilte Ireland about his plan to help employers in the hospitality sector to meet the challenges of recruiting and retaining staff, and to please respond within 14 days; and that Mr. Lynn be invited to attend a meeting of the Committee on Public Petitions to discuss his petition.  Do members have views on the recommendations?</p></speech>

In my own county and region it is very difficult to recruit and retain staff.  As the Chairman will know, in many respects it is an employees' arena in terms of jobs.  One of the reasons it is difficult to recruit and retain staff is because some hospitality work involves working unsocial hours.  People can choose not to be away from their families at night and work straight days or whatever.  We need to do everything that we can to help the sector because hotels and restaurants are struggling.</p> <p>  There is one chink of light.  I know of a wonderful family-run hotel in my area.  They work so hard and they have found it very difficult to recruit all staff ranging from floor staff, waiters and waitresses and they have found it extremely difficult to recruit chefs.  The owners of the hotel were asked to take some Ukrainians and give a few rooms over to them.  Thankfully, one of the Ukrainians is a chef.  She is a wonderful young lady and she now works in the hotel.  There is a slight language barrier but they are getting over that.  That is a little chink of light but the industry is in crisis with trying to recruit and retain of staff and I am very concerned.  Owners of two businesses wrote to me to inform me they now close their premises every Monday and Tuesday because they cannot get the staff and they cannot expect their current staff to work seven days a week.  That is going to happen throughout the country.</p></speech>

The industry is at breaking point.  We are all aware of businesses that are trying their best to after emerging from Covid and everything.  Some businesses have been swamped with customers, thanks be to God, but the industry is in a critical state when it comes to recruiting chefs and cooks.  Therefore, it is worth inviting Mr. Lynn in on this and exploring it a bit more.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I extend a welcome to Ms Helen Holmes, vice chairperson of the Dublin 12 Campaign for Autism Inclusion, Ms Linda Whitmarsh, co-chair of the Cavan Monaghan Parents Committee, and Ms Nicola Hart, member support team leader with Down Syndrome Ireland.</p> <p>  I remind committee members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically present on the campus of Leinster House.  I ask members who are joining remotely to confirm whether they are on the campus prior to making their contributions.  For anyone watching us online, witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely due to unprecedented circumstances, and I ask people to bear with us if any technical issue arises.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending and giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  At this point, we do not have clear guidance on whether privilege extends to them.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Without further ado, I ask Ms Holmes to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am a parent of a child with additional needs and the vice chair of the campaign.  I wish to acknowledge the input of our chairperson, Ms Margaret Jane Lowndes, who contributed to today's submission but is unable to attend.  The Dublin 12 campaign was set up in 2018 due to the frustration of parents about the lack of school places and services in our area.  We advocate for equal opportunities in education and services and for raising acceptance for children with additional needs.</p> <p>  According to the HSE, the PDS model for children and young people is a HSE programme that aims to achieve a single national approach to delivering disability services.  It is a fairer way of providing services for children with disabilities and the pooling together of all resources.  As a result of that, the children's disability network team, CDNT, is a family-centred model supported through an individual family service plan, IFSP, outlining what the goals of the child are and how best the teams can support the child and his or her family in achieving these goals.</p> <p>  While the above reads well on paper, the real experience of parents to date is different.</p><p><b></b>In Dublin 12, our Children's Disability Network Teams, CDNTs, are split into two locations, one in Dublin 8 and one in Dublin 12.  Unfortunately our area was one of the last to be reconfigured and was also delayed further when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020.  The delay with the reconfiguration left families with nowhere to turn for support or help.  The most vulnerable in our society were forgotten about leading to extra stress in an already worrying and unprecedented time.<br/><br/>Based on our own personal experiences and those of many of the families in Dublin 12, I will go into some key issues experienced as well as our collective recommendation on how the services could be improved for our vulnerable children suffering without services.<br/><br/>On some of the key issues, number one is communication.  Initial communication between the HSE and families detailing the dates for the reconfiguration was infrequent and generic.  No specific dates were provided.  Families struggled with uncertainty.  The communication was, and continues to be, extremely inconsistent.  Some families received correspondence while others did not.  Parents have also reported last-minute cancellations from CDNTs.  To give a recent example, one family waited in a reception area to attend their appointment and were called by the same reception to say that their appointment was cancelled.  We hope it does not come as a surprise to many that many of the children needing these services struggle with routine disruptions.  An experience of this nature is very distressing for a child.  The disregard for the impact on parents taking time off work to attend is also of note.<br/><br/>Family forums, as recommended by PDS, to be used to discuss issues within the CDNTs, are still not established and will take another few months to be set up.  Parents need their voices to be heard now.<br/><br/>On inconsistencies, different approaches are used depending on the CDNTs that families attend.  Some parents have been allocated key workers and have attended an initial meeting with them.  Others are inexplicably without this service.  Some were asked to bring their children to these initial meetings, others were advised to leave their children at home.  Some of the CDNTs are offering play therapy and interventions for children and some are more focused on giving parent courses.  One CDNTs has a messaging system in place for appointments and reminders and the other does not.  A consistent approach, process and service is needed across the board.  <br/><br/>On staff resources, all teams in the area are suffering from lack of staff and this has been communicated as an excuse for the delay and lack of services.  Staff recruitment and high turnover is a major issue.  There appears to be no coherent plan to improve this trend.  There is also a worrying trend of newly recruited staff leaving very quickly.  There are a number of vacancies across the two teams covering Dublin 12, including three psychologists, two physiotherapists, two speech and language therapists, one occupational therapist and one dietician.<br/><br/>High turnover is a huge concern as is lack of continuity in the process.  Services have to start over to accommodate knowledge transfer to new hires.  There is disruption to  the relationship formed with children who thrive on familiarity and routine.  Recruitment to the roles appears takes a long time.  Staff illness and extended leave are not covered by anyone.  Insufficient capacity is built into the teams to prevent the impact of staff absences.<br/><br/>On waiting lists, we surveyed 25 parents in April 2022.  Of the 25, 20% have had an initial meeting with their key worker, 8% are attending a parent course, 16% attend a mix between play therapy and interventions, and 56% families are waiting without services.  At present the waiting time for a &quot;new&quot; case to access the services is two and half years.  There is no respite or home help available during these extremely difficult waiting periods.  In our survey, we also asked parents if they had to privately bear the cost of therapies their child required.  The average cost per household was &euro;4,000 for a single child and over &euro;9,000 for multiple children.  As early intervention is so critically important, parents have had to struggle to find ways to fund these services privately.  Private services have waiting lists and many are over-subscribed, so waiting lists are often closed to new clients.  Given the rising cost of living and inflation, many of the private services have recently increased in cost.  Families are struggling and having to make difficult priority decisions between mortgage, rent, household bills and their child's needs.  It is a very hard place to be as a parent.<br/><br/>On recommendations, we recommend that a relief panel of therapists be put in place to cover illness and long term and extended leave.  There should be automated text messaging for confirming, amending and cancelling appointments.  Occupational therapists and speech and language assistants should be trained up and sent into the CDNTs to support therapists.  We need to look beyond Ireland to recruit expert staff and provide appropriate incentives to attract the required talent.  A system facilitating funded access to private services where public services cannot be provided within a reasonable timeframe should be implemented.  This is not dissimilar to the concept of medical card access to a private GP but applied to the required disability services.<br/><br/>In summary, the roll out of the PDS appears positive and was welcomed as a new modernised disability service.  However, for many families, it is a frustrating system to navigate.  As the committee knows, the idea is to bring fairer access for each child and their family but the reality is there are no therapies for children and the emphasis is put back onto parents to be the therapists for their child.  Parents are brought in for a meeting to set goals as part of the individual family service plan, IFSP, and must decide their child's top three issues.  These form the foundation of the plan.  Deciding as a parent is very difficult.  You are left to appraise your own child.  How can you choose when your child is complex and needs an array of help?  Parents are steered away from requesting any direct intervention therapies for our children.  As parents, we want to be empowered to support our children but we cannot do this alone.  We need the expert therapists to do what they trained for and provide the services, frameworks and education necessary to families.  Children are left to regress and families are left distressed.  There is no one to step in to help and, as a parent, you feel deflated and that you have failed your child.  Who supports parents' mental health as they continue to fight for what their children need?<br/><br/>Unless you live with a child with additional needs, you can never truly know the impact the absence of services have on the child and family.  I ask the members today to consider if it was their child.  What would they do while they challenge the system and watch their child regress?  Would they be happy for their three-and-a-half-year-old nonspeaking child to wait until they are six years of age to be seen and supported?  I thank members for their time and the opportunity to speak today.</p></speech>

My husband and I are the co-chairpersons from the Cavan-Monaghan parents committee.  We commenced our committee five weeks ago due to a level of frustration because we only had singular voice.  We felt we needed to get the parents together and to have our voices heard all together, united.  I am here today to highlight several issues we have with the disability services.  Due to the continuing deterioration of services not only for our children but for all children of the State, we have reached out to some of the strongest and bravest members not only of our county, but of the entire country.  We have all continued to fight for our children in silence until now.  I am just an ordinary mother with extraordinary children, but I am tired.  I feel alone and very scared for their future.  My fear is not of their diagnosis but of the lack of support and services that our children are waiting so long for and truly deserve.</p> <p>  I am here as a mother of three boys, two of whom are awaiting services, and I am here on behalf of our committee.  Our joint stories are one of heartache as our children grow in front of our eyes towards the possibility of residential care due to dismal staffing levels and poor oversight.  Until the ratification of the UN&rsquo;s optional protocol is achieved, the cry of our children will continue in silence.  Our eight-year-old son has cystic fibrosis.  He has received two hours of intervention in the last three years, with one hour of speech and language yesterday, just on the back of all this campaigning.  He has had no public assessments and had a private assessment in which he was diagnosed with an intellectual disability.  He is autistic and nonspeaking.  As per my previous submission, he was refused early intervention six times.  My son has no continuity of service with multiple therapists just on the phone and has received only two hours of intervention.  His regression was unbelievable during the Covid-19 pandemic and we were never offered substantial support other than a phone call.  It was extremely stressful on us all as a family.  Our other boy is ten years old and he is waiting four years for an assessment for dyspraxia and just recently ASD.</p> <p>  The lack of staffing in the disability services in our area is causing considerable stress on our family and on our children, and they are suffering from this lack of continuity and services.</p><p>The stories of our committee carry the same message, with long waiting lists.  A recent poll we did of our committee members involving 23 families showed that 18 had been waiting two years or more for services, four had been waiting just one to two years and one had been waiting a year.  We have a child who has been waiting seven years for physiotherapy in primary care; a family who are waiting in limbo as their child's needs are deemed not complex enough for a CDNT but too complex for primary care; a five-year-old who has been on a waiting list for half his life, that is, two and a half years; non-speaking children who have been waiting over three years for speech and language therapies and assessments; and a boy with cerebral palsy, ASD and multiple other diagnoses, who has had six sessions split between occupational therapists, OTs, and physiotherapy, not one full individualised session since 2019 and no speech and language therapy.</p><p> A National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services in Ireland, which under chapter 9 shows a guide to workforce planning from 2014, includes progressive disability services.  We have checked these figures and their veracity with the services and they agreed that they were correct.  As per that document, there should be 37.5 therapists.  The current staff in Cavan CDNT comprises 10.5 therapists, one OT, three speech and language therapists, two psychologists, 2.5 physios and two social workers for 630 children.  There are 11.5 roles vacant, so the team should be fully manned at 22.  As per the HSE policy, however, the number should be 37.5.  That is still not sufficient for efficient intervention for a population of 76,092.</p><p> The population of our neighbouring county, Monaghan, which we also represent, is 61,386, according to the 2016 census.  At present, the number of staff posts in Monaghan is 32 but the CDNT comprises 24 therapists, with eight vacancies.  There is a big difference between the population and the staffing level.</p><p> One of the main issues our committee faces locally and nationwide is families being sent from their own counties to different counties due to land boundaries close by and to entirely different community hubs.  That is an example of the postcode lottery.</p><p> As for recruitment, the pay differences and unequal contracts between section 38 and section 39 workers is a huge issue that needs to be addressed.  There has been no international recruitment such as in nursing.  No allocation allowances or specialist posts have ever been proposed to retain our staff and there have never been any grants or even final year pay for student therapists or an increase in the number of places in third level education for those therapists.</p><p> The National Treatment Purchase Fund is not being availed of due to an inability to verify the qualifications of private staff, yet our services use private therapists, even on weekends, when complaints reach boiling point.  Our family has spent &euro;15,000 in the past two and a half years on one child and we are not in a position now to do the same as his care needs are quite high, and with the two boys I have to take a step down from work.  We just cannot afford the private therapy any more.</p><p> CDNTs are supposed to be for complex cases only, yet they have 20 children with non-complex needs there.</p><p> There is no local client or parental involvement such as family forums, completed service satisfaction surveys or audits to quantify stakeholder experiences so there are no ratings or patient or parent satisfaction reports.  It seems that if we had parent satisfaction reports, they would not show great satisfaction.  If it were like the HSE, we would be able to complain to the service and we would be inundated with complaints.  Perhaps something would happen then.</p><p> There is no recognition of a drop-down qualification such as that of a therapist assistant who could work under the direction of the therapist to bridge the gap for these children who have been waiting so long and to take pressure off the therapists.</p><p> We have fought to keep our eight-year-old with cystic fibrosis alive and now we fight to gain independence for him and a good quality of life without us and to promote the speech of a voiceless, precious child.  Only now, having fought so hard, is he beginning to get appointments he needed three or four years ago.  The passage of time haunts me as we cannot get his lost time back.  The only thing necessary for the triumph of complacency is for good people to do nothing.  I plead with the committee not to allow this complacency to leave a stain on our children.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairperson and the committee for inviting me here to speak.</p> <p>  Every year around 150 babies join the population of people with Down's syndrome living in Ireland.  Babies and children with Down's syndrome need therapies to help them reach their potential.  According to our recent research, almost half of all children with Down's syndrome had no therapy at all last year.  Even when they do get therapy, it is not at the intensity and dosage they need.  Down's syndrome is diagnosed before or immediately after birth.  Early diagnosis means there is no need to wait for babies to start showing developmental delays and there is the opportunity to provide targeted therapy from birth, with potentially life-changing results.  Why is there no plan for that?  Before the pandemic, in 2019, the average number of speech and language therapy sessions for a child with Down's syndrome was five - not five a week or five a month but five in a whole year.  That is well below the dosage required, according to research, and it has only got worse.  Two thirds of children with Down's syndrome received no speech and language therapy at all last year, according to our research, and in some community healthcare organisations, CHOs, the proportion was more than 80%.</p> <p>  We have been told that money is not the issue, so somebody needs to figure out what the issue is.  Why are we spending money on services that are failing to meet the needs of our children?  As recently as the 1980s, the average life expectancy for somebody with Down's syndrome was 25 years; it is now about 60.  The HSE, by failing to provide therapy in childhood, is kicking the can down the road.  That is not just impacting the lives of children with Down's syndrome right now; it is storing up social and economic costs for the future.  People with Down's syndrome are often underestimated because of their communication difficulties.  Without effective, individualised therapy, they can become increasingly frustrated and isolated.  Failure to provide therapy has huge impacts on access to education, on social inclusion and on quality of life, and those in turn impact physical and mental health.</p> <p>  Therapy is not happening because the system is simply not working.  Resources are spread so thinly that they are far below the level needed to be effective.  Statutory assessments are being resourced from the same pot as therapy.  When one has to be provided and it is considered that the other would be nice to provide, it is very easy to see what will happen.  Parents get phone calls from therapists asking them to describe their children's progress in order that unmanageable waiting lists can be triaged.  Most families are offered indirect therapy, such as parent training, despite there being no evidence that this effects change on speech and language skills for children with Down's syndrome.  Therapists are leaving, some because the service they are asked to provide does not line up with professional ethics.  We saw what happened when the HSE ignored the ethical concerns of therapists about the revised assessment of need.  The State has a responsibility to provide effective therapy to support development and to prevent further disabilities under Article 25(b) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.  That is not happening.</p> <p>  Focusing on speech and language therapy, we also need to consider the discriminatory nature of the system.  Children with developmental speech and language disorders who do not have intellectual disabilities are offered direct therapy.  There is no suggestion of moving to a less direct model for those children.  However, children with a speech and language disorder associated with Down's syndrome face much longer waiting lists, which may be triaged based on a phone call.  They are extremely unlikely to be offered therapy.  That is State-designed discrimination.  Children with Down's syndrome have the right to receive the same range, quality and standard of healthcare and programmes as provided to other people.</p><p>This is a breach of Article 25(a) of the UNCRPD.<br/><br/>The HSE has said that one of the issues is that there are not enough therapists to fill posts.  However, most teams are not openly recruiting.  The allied healthcare section on the HSE jobs website recently had only two areas recruiting senior speech and language therapists to work on disability teams.  It is disingenuous to say there are no therapists out there if one is not actively looking for therapists or incentivising them to return to the workforce.<br/><br/>We have been told that the issues we are raising are temporary while the HSE makes the system better for everybody and that we somehow fail to understand that.  We understand that our children are not getting the therapy that they need.  The HSE has failed to take into account both the needs of children and families and the research evidence.  As a consequence, the State has failed to meet its obligations under Article 25 of the UNCRPD.  We need to stop putting the lives and futures of hundreds of children at a disadvantage by failing to provide therapy or providing advisory services that are not based on best evidence and have little or no chance of changing outcomes.<br/><br/>Last year was the 50th anniversary of the founding of Down Syndrome Ireland.  We found some archived magazines from the early 1970s and the biggest issue then was lack of therapy.  We failed children 51 years ago and we are still failing them now.<br/><br/>I will leave the members with a couple of quotes from parents of children with Down's syndrome.  One parent of a preschool child said: &quot;I firmly believe not one therapist could pick my son out of a line-up and even if they could they'd struggle to tell me anything about his strengths, interests and challenges&rdquo;.  A parent of a young teenager said:</p><blockquote>	We have and are receiving no service, and I do not expect this to change.  They are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic again.  Nothing ever improves. </blockquote><p>To summarise, we need the following: a real commitment to meeting the State's obligations under Article 25; a complete overhaul of the recruitment and retention processes, which are not fit for purpose; an increase in staffing to the levels recommended by professional bodies; the provision of separate, additional and ring-fenced resources for assessments of need, and a change in the law to make provision of services a statutory requirement; individualised therapy provision at dosages high enough to make an impact rather than just parent training or short blocks of therapy with long breaks in between, neither of which have been shown to be effective; therapists routinely employed in education to work as part of the school team to facilitate access to education; and an end to discrimination by increasing therapy for children with disabilities not by reducing therapy for others.</p></speech>

I have so many questions that they would take up the entire meeting.  First, I shall ask about regression during Covid.  Ms Whitmarsh mentioned that there was an unbelievable amount of regression and I wonder would she be comfortable elaborating on the matter.  We have heard so much about the impact that Covid has had on children with additional needs and the accompanying mental health issues.  What would have made a difference during that time when we were told that the schools had to close?  What can be done now?  Is there anything that can be done to address any regression?</p> <p>  Next I want to discuss the two options for children, which are primary care and the children's disability network teams.  I have been told that the less complex cases are supposed to go to primary care and the more complex cases go to the teams.  Ms Whitmarsh has said that some cases have fallen between both of them, which is a concerning situation.  How many cases has this happened to?  If a child is on a list then there is some hope that he or she will receive some sort of therapy and interventions sometime, and sooner rather than later.  However, if a child is not on any list because his or her case falls between the two options and people cannot decide which option is most appropriate then such a situation is really concerning.  Those are my initial queries and if time allows I will mention a few more issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Whitmarsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#D00400"><p>In terms of regression during Covid, one of my boys is Finn and he has always had a lot of complex care needs.  He needed his therapy and intervention years ago.  During Covid, as the schools were closed, he completely got out of his routine.  Everything was topsy-turvy and it was so hard to keep him regulated and focused.  As a family, we took him for walks and did everything that he enjoyed.  One hears stories about how bad the HSE is and how services are so awful yet if one had come to live with us during the time of Covid one would have discovered that it was an absolutely horrific time.  It was the worst time that we have ever experienced, and worse than all of his hospital admissions due to cystic fibrosis, because Finn got into a routine of having faecal smearing episodes.  At night time we would have settled him in bed but later when we went into his room to check on him we would discover that the walls, floor and the child were covered in faeces.  These episodes lasted for three months.  My husband and I are strong together but seeing our child standing in his room and covered in his own faeces took its toll.  I resorted to ringing occupational therapists and begged them for assessments or an appointment for Finn but we just got a phone call from someone who outlined strategies but we had already done all that.  Had Finn intervention beforehand then maybe these episodes would never have happened because he would have been able to regulate himself and we would be able to deal with that.</p> <p>  We found it hard to deal with these episodes for three months whereby we had to clean his bedroom every night and sometimes two and three times a night.  It was only later that we figured out what was going on.  I mean that these episodes happened because his oldest brother went to bed a little bit later and as a result Finn wanted to act out.  However, as Finn is non-verbal he could not tell us that.  Had he got an intervention, and speech and language therapy, when he needed it, when he was four or five years old, then we would not have found ourselves in such a position and where we are today.</p> <p>  Early intervention is so vital and is part of Article 25(b) in the UNCRPD but that has not happened.  I will always regret that Finn did not get early intervention.  That regret keeps me up at night along with worrying about what will happen to him when I die or when my husband and I are no longer around.  We also regret that so much time has elapsed without interventions because Finn only said the word "dad" last week.  We wonder if Finn had gotten an early intervention would he have said the word "dad" four years ago.</p> <p>  What can be done now?  Finn came out of the period of Covid and that took a lot of work.  We wonder how much better he would be had he received services in time.  In fact, the services were too late to benefit him.  We, as a family, went through an awful, hard three months and even his brothers saw that.  It is hard for a whole family to experience that and explain it to our other children.</p> <p>  One of my children is waiting four years for primary care and another boy has waited a long time for assistance from the children's disability network team, CDNT but recently got services.  One of our committee members has a child who has been recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  The child's name was put on both the primary care list and the CDNT list in the hope of getting services quicker because the availability of services is so bad.  Being placed on both lists should not happen.  I mean if one needs one service then one will be placed on the primary care list and if one needs multiple services then one is placed on the CDNT list.  That member of our committee was told that if she needs to get a private assessment then to do so but ring the HSE back so they can take the child's name off the lists.  So that is what is happening in my county at the moment.</p></speech>

We are not providing early intervention speech and language therapy.  We know from research that even delaying therapy for three months has a negative impact on outcomes yet we have children on waiting lists for two and three years.  We have children who were born during Covid who did not get the benefit of mother and toddler groups so missed early interaction.  Now, as we emerge from Covid, there is no therapy in sight and these children are already at a disadvantage.  Such situations simply store up problems for the future.  If one has a child who cannot communicate in any other way than through behaviour then that is going to cause problems in education, social integration etc.  Not providing early services when needed will result in problems being stored up and they will be more costly to solve in the long-term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#E00100"><p>Our area was not reconfigured during that time so it was even more of a stressful position.  Previously, we would ring and we would be told what was happening or coming down the line.  A worrying trend I was told about in regard to my son, in particular, is that there were no therapists because they had been seconded to testing centres and help in response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  I understand that was an unprecedented event.  Similar to what Ms Whitmarsh describes, we got a phone call to check how we were getting on and saying a social story could be posted out.  It was not helpful at the time.  As well as trying to be a child's teacher and doing homework with the child, we were expected to do occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and all of that.  There was no end in sight, as members know, and we did not know how long the first lockdown would be.  As the ladies mentioned, there does not seem to have been any forward thinking about what would happen when we were back up and running and where the capacity would be to support these children, who already have significant delays and have been regressing further socially, academically and in many other ways.  There was no forward planning and we continued with the existing model, which did not take into account what would happen in a pandemic and its consequences.</p> <p>  It is a question of what we can do and there does not always appear to be forward thinking.  That is where we are let down and we seem to go around in circles, putting out small fires all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#E00200"><p>I thank all the witnesses.  I am utterly depressed, although I do not why I am more than normal, after listening to these testaments.  The story that has been painted is just so utterly bleak.  In whatever way we can, we must try to give hope as well as support to families in this position.  I thank the witnesses for their honesty and courage in coming to tell us their stories.</p> <p>  I have a few comments and questions.  I have heard about Ms Holmes several times from my colleague, Senator Ardagh, and she speaks very highly of her and MJ and the work they do.  I live in Kildare, which is part of community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 as well, and I am only too well aware of the issue from the families I work and deal with in Kildare.  I know exactly what they are facing.</p> <p>  Families are waiting two and a half years and the witnesses have all noted the importance of early intervention, and that is shocking.  There is no mention of respite or home care.  I noted in particular that families are steered away from requesting any direct intervention therapies.  Will the witnesses expand on that a little?</p> <p>  I will put my questions together.  The survey mentioned by witnesses indicates 56% of families are waiting without services, and there is absolutely no way anybody could ever stand over anything like that.  Will the witnesses comment on July provision?  I certainly know that in my area it is very difficult to get schools and special needs assistants to deliver it.</p> <p>  I know Ms Whitmarsh met the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, last week.  Fair play to her and her husband for setting up this group because it is very important that families are able to talk to one another, share and advocate.  She mentioned the need for such a process and the lack of those types of family forums.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is going to all the areas and listening to families, which is very important.  She has not come to my area yet but I believe what she heard is grim.  Nevertheless, these views must be heard by everybody, including the HSE.  I know the HSE did not even send representatives to one of those meetings, which I believe was in Cork.  That is appalling.  We must absolutely call the HSE out on that.</p> <p>  I have listened to what the witnesses described as happening to them during the Covid-19 pandemic.  They had to give up jobs and do not now have money for private treatment, which is beyond belief.  One of the children has only received one hour of intervention in the past three years, which is appalling.  He is non-verbal and is not getting those supports.  What would be the best practice schedule for intervention in that case?  There was mention of people going to counties but how does that work with respect to transport and costs?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Hart for her contribution.  My brother, who has Down's syndrome, is 47.  When he was born, he was the ninth child in the family and there were two more after him.  My mother brought him to private speech therapy twice a week.  It was a considerable distance from our home.  As children, we were all encouraged to help and be part of that therapy.  He is an absolutely amazing man now and the heartbeat of our home.</p> <p>  It seems that 47 years later, things are basically exactly the same.  Cathal was born just four years after the Down's syndrome association started to fight for these people.  It shocks me that things are still so bad but it is so hard to get change.  With an early diagnosis, there is no reason plans cannot be put in place in terms of an intellectual disability database etc.  That is unforgivable.  We know the excellent work carried by the Down's syndrome organisation in Kildare, with literacy programmes and a horticultural programme.  They are going through every single imaginable hoop in trying to keep those services open for young adults.  It is a volunteer group.</p> <p>  We need to sit and listen but we must also bring recommendations.  I thank the witnesses for the recommendations they have made.  As I have said, I am just beyond despair but perhaps the witnesses will comment on what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#E00300"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about us being steered away from direct therapies but I can just speak from my experience.  The progressing disability services model is family centred and it is about empowering parents.  It is a needs-based process and a parent attends to discuss different issues a child is having.  We are absolutely steered away from requesting any occupational therapy or speech and language intervention directly.  I know this because I made a request and was told direct therapies and intervention will only be given if they are part of the family service plan.  To have it in the plan, there must be agreement with a key worker, which in my case is a senior psychologist.  We have to try to fight our case to get any kind of therapies.  We and other parents in the area have not been able to get those therapies yet.</p> <p>  My son is autistic with pathological demand avoidance.  He is now seven and half years old and was diagnosed at two and a half years.  In five years, we got one block of floor time.</p><p>That includes a speech and language therapist and occupational therapist who got work just before the Covid pandemic.  I could see a significant difference in him following those therapies.  There was a difference for us because I could come back from those sessions knowing what the therapists had demonstrated would work in different scenarios.  I could bring that back into the home and work with it.  The other witnesses have gone through the data.</p><p> It would be nearly impossible for the current staff to see every child that needs to be seen.  The issue is not having parents sitting there and perhaps going on parent courses.  Each child is different and unique.  We are fighting for the therapist to show us what to do and to empower us.  There is no problem with bringing that into the home or the school.  We need the experts who went to college for four years or more to help us as parents and to enable us to help our own children.</p><p> We did a survey of 25 families in the area.  A family member sent us a letter the family received from the children's disability network team this week in respect of the little boy I spoke about earlier.  He is three and a half years old and is non-speaking.  The team will see him when he is six.  That is open-ended.  It is a generic approach we are used to.  We are given periods of years and told teams will see children in 2024 or 2025, but there are never specific dates.  As parents, we know that date will go further back.  It goes back to asking what parents can do to help their children.  Private therapy is so expensive as it is, but it is an absolute luxury to be able to get onto a waiting list.  People on the list are afraid to give up their place.  Parents say they are doing a block, that it is costing a certain amount and that they are terrified to lose the spot, because then they will have absolutely nothing.  There is a significant impact on people waiting for services.</p><p> Dublin 12 is split into two areas.  One person who contacted me did not know which children's disability network team area she would be in.  I got her the two numbers and said she would have to call them, since it is based on the area she lived in.  As a result, things moved a little quicker for her because there was shock about a child having slipped through the cracks.</p><p> A survey was recently published about special schools and July provision.  There are 126 special schools in Ireland.  Only 26 provide July provision.  My son, Adam, attends a mainstream school with support from special needs assistants.  I am told the teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, have their own families and they do not want or need to do this July provision.  The main issues are that there are no incentives for staff and that teachers and SNAs received payments late in the past.  They had to go through hoops, submitting all the forms to get their money.  There is not enough incentive for them to do it.  People are left to find their own tutors.  Everything we speak about with regard to therapies and tutors falls back onto families, who have to deal with a lot of stress and pressure as it is, but they want to see their children succeed, so they do what they have to.</p></speech>

When you have a child with additional needs, all you have is hope there will be improvement and that services will get better.  Every parent in the country is in despair about the way progressing disability services, PDS, is at present, because it is not getting any better.  We hear the forgotten voices of children.  No one seems to be getting the required and deserved services.  We had a meeting with two Ministers during the week.  There is still much to be done.  Much good work has started and will continue.  Staffing and recruitment are the main issues we need to address.  There were 10,000 preliminary team assessment, PTA, assessments of needs.  This information was given to us by a Minister.  Only 54% of these people are receiving intervention, which comes to 5,400.  That seems great, but 4,600 are not receiving intervention.  There will be further issues with the illegal assessments of needs.</p> <p>  Following our meeting, a key issue seems to be that there is a lot of shock among the Ministers and everyone else.  The stories being told are not what it is actually going on in reality.  There is a bit of a blame game between the HSE and Government, saying it is not in their area.  These children are not just figures.  We should not just say we will see what happens and that we will wait to see how it goes.  They need therapy and intervention now.  My child should have got his intervention when he was three.  He was refused early intervention six or seven times even though people say early intervention is key.  There is no early intervention in our area.</p> <p>  Article 25(c) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states there is an onus to "Provide these health services as close as possible to people&rsquo;s own communities, including in rural areas".  You cannot get any more rural than where we are.  Families in an area close to us have to drive 40 or 50 minutes to another area.  Some might not have cars and they have to go to a different county.  There is no support or community hubs for them, which is against the protocol.  It is so unfair that these parents have to go out.  They do not meet people.  The children's disability network teams in any area we have been in are empty.  There are no children there.  We were there for a session yesterday and our child was the only child in the building.  The sessions are fantastic.  Yesterday was my second session.  I learned a lot in the session, including where to go.  When a child is non-speaking, you have to research everything.  There is the stress of wondering whether I am doing the right thing for him.  Only getting intervention after screaming and shouting is not sufficient.  We should not have to go public with our stories.  This should just be an entitlement for these voiceless, forgotten children of our country who need it.</p></speech>

That is what is needed.  My background is in speech and language therapy.  We know working with parents works if you are seeing them regularly, so you know the family and the child and is able to coach continually.  Coaching parents to help their child is not a once-off event.  You needs to reach the family at least weekly to support them properly.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on Senator O'Loughlin's comments about adult services in Kildare.  People with Down's syndrome are the group with the highest identified incidence of early onset dementia.  It arrives 20 to 25 years earlier than in the general population.  Things that prevent dementia in typical people are ongoing, continuous education, social interaction and physical exercise.  We are not giving people the kind of start in life to develop communication which promotes that kind of social interaction and pushes them towards a path of independence rather than a path of dependence.  When we are setting up charities, such as the horticulture and literacy maintenance programmes in Kildare, we face barriers at all sides when trying to get funding to continue.  That is not for young adults or school leavers.  Some of them are now in their late 20s or 30s.  That is the next issue coming down the road for parents.  We are not just failing people at early stages, we are setting them on a different pathway.  When we try to do something about that for those young adults, who are hitting middle age now, that is pulled away too.</p></speech>

They have given us an insight into how they are living through this process and the issues arising, which are horrible.  This committee has had many meetings and is determining the best way to progress disability services.  Having listened this morning, I believe the frustration of parents of children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome relates to the fact that everything is being talked about although things are not happening on the ground.  The children&rsquo;s disability network teams were set up.  Will the witnesses give me an idea as to whether the deckchairs have just been changed on the <i>Titanic</i>or whether services have been improved as a result of the reconfiguration?</p><p>The other issue I have relates to the statement of one of the witnesses that she was in the waiting room when she received a telephone call stating her appointment was cancelled.  If a person has a caseworker, how in the name of God is that caseworker not communicating on a basis that really and truly means the person knows what is going on, rather than finding out in a waiting room?</p><p>My third question relates to intervention services.  I see that only one hour of intervention was given to a certain child over the past three years, with no assessment.  This type of thing is happening.  These failures within the State manifest themselves in homes throughout the country.  Could I have the delegates' views on that?</p><p>Why, in the opinion of the delegates, are therapists so hard to get?  When we do get them, why do they not stay in the system?  Is it that the system is broken?  Do therapists lose hope when in the system because they believe they cannot do anything with it?  We are being told at Government level that it is not a question of money and at HSE level that it is a question of the recruitment process, but surely we need to ensure we have the professionals in place to carry out the early interventions and do all that needs to be done to ensure the children get the services to which they are legally entitled, not just the services they deserve?  Could I hear the delegates&rsquo; comments on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Whitmarsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I feel the services are worsening.  There is no communication at all with the team.  You have to ring constantly to ask where your child is on the waiting list.  For three or four years, the answer is that your child is a priority.  My child was a P1, or priority No. 1.  He was a P1 because he had been on the waiting list for more than a year and because we had seven consultant letters sent to the CDNT on our behalf.  If one consultant letter is sent, your child should be P1.  My child was a P1 six or seven times because all his cystic fibrosis consultants and consultants in paediatrics, autism and intellectual disability referred him for interventions.  I do not know how it can be said a child is a P1 seven times if he or she still has to wait three to four years.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  The system is completely failing the children of this State.</p> <p>  With regard to recruitment and therapists, there is no international recruitment.  We have been asking about this and it has been brought up in the Seanad.  The WHO&rsquo;s Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel keeps getting mentioned but that is non-binding.  Trade missions have been carried out before.  LinkedIn seems to be relied on heavily when recruiting staff, whereas going to another country to recruit should be considered.  In the past, we brought in a large number of nurses from the Philippines and India.  Trade missions work but they are just not happening.</p> <p>  When the Government was asked about this, one of its answers was that the Magee campus of Ulster University produces speech and language therapists.  However, they cannot come from the North to the South because they have not done a dysphasia course.  Furthermore, the Government&rsquo;s answer is not an answer because only 23 speech and language therapists come from Magee campus per year.  There are 580-plus vacancies in the 91 CDNT teams.  Twenty-three speech and language staff will just not be sufficient.</p> <p>  The pay gap between section 38 workers and section 39 workers is also a huge issue.  There was pay restoration in 2019 and 2020, with &euro;7.7 million spent in 2019.  If speech and language therapists are given a choice to work with children in whom an immediate improvement will not be seen and are to be paid &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 less than others, will they opt for that job?  I refer to the main reason for the inability to retain section 39 staff.  In Cavan, it is a big issue because we have only 10.5 of those workers.  There has been no drive for an allowance for complex needs workers.  The budgets are in place.  There are budgets for staff but staff are not being got.  Why, therefore, do we not keep the staff we have and introduce an allowance for complex cases and give job guarantees?  Newly qualified staff cannot work for CDNTs if they have not got paediatric training.  Why do we not have a bit of foresight and provide this in college?  Students could do some of their thousand placement hours in paediatrics so they could work for CDNTs when they graduate.</p> <p>  There are many other issues I could get into but I will let everybody else give their answers now.</p></speech>

The HSE jobs website indicates very few areas are looking for therapists for network disability teams.</p> <p>  I live in Wexford.  There is a very limited service in Wexford for parents with children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  I do not believe a single job has come up that I could have applied for.  I am a CORU-registered speech and language therapist with 30 years&rsquo; experience of working with people with disabilities.  I do not believe there has been a single job.  Where is the HSE recruiting?  If it is not recruiting internationally or nationally, how can it say there are no therapists?  Unless something dramatic happens, it will be very difficult to retain therapists.  A team of ten that should be a team of nearly 40 has a caseload four times greater than it should be.  That is depressing.  Every parent who comes in through the door is going to be angry.  There are so many other jobs available to therapists.  They could go into the private sector or community care, where there is not the level of despair that there is in disability services.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Whitmarsh in that our feedback from families is that the transition to progressing disability services for children and young people has disimproved services.  The service has opted much more for the consultancy and parent-training model, which has no evidence to back it up.  Is it at such a low level that we are almost wasting money.  Money is being spent on therapists who have so little time.  There are good therapists.  This is a systemic problem, not a therapist problem.  Money is being spent on people who are able to have so little contact with families that you almost question whether it is worth it.</p> <p>  I have been talking about senior therapist recruitment.</p><p>As for basic grade recruitment of therapists coming out of universities, a basic grade panel is opening now but therapists are graduating at this stage.  I know from a colleague in a university that all the final-year graduates there already have jobs and the panel has not even opened yet.  That is an entire graduating class that will, potentially, be lost to the Irish system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#H00200"><p>In respect of the reconfiguration, it feels like the goalposts are being moved for parents.  The system was one way and we were promised all the shiny new things that would come along with the new progressing disability services, PDS, programme and the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, but they have not transpired.  It is now a more challenging system to navigate.  It seems to focus on a family-centred model, which is really good, but there is no therapist to back up or support parents to run that.  We are kind of left in limbo.  The issue arises where children are put on a list on the basis of priority.  Who wants to hear whether their child is priority number one or number four?  That just angers parents further.  A parent's child is his or her child and that child is entitled to services but, as we know, the lists are not moving in the proper order.</p> <p>  There have been issues even with parents whose children were at the top of the priority list.  One parent who attended an intervention recently with therapists on Armagh Road was asked to bring home the child because the child had behavioural issues.  If a psychologist, an occupational therapist, OT, a speech and language therapist, SLT, and a disability manager are telling a parent that he or she will have to come back without the child, what kind of hope does that leave the parent regarding what kind of services are going to come?  That parent is undergoing a block of parental courses every week.  She is going through it and trying to get some strategies to help her son, but her son is in desperate need of intervention and respite, as are the wider family, yet they are being turned away.  There is nobody there to help them, and that is the last thing we want to hear as parents.</p> <p>  From the campaign&rsquo;s perspective, we met the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in February.  She assured us money was not an issue in respect of therapists and that there was plenty of money in the pot, with the same old story about recruitment.  I do not know where the recruits are being placed because we are not seeing things happening as quickly as we would like them to.  The recommendation referred, in particular, to OT and speech and language assistants coming in and supporting the therapists, which would take a little pressure off.  The parental course I am attending is, like many of them, hosted by two senior psychologists.  I cannot help but wonder every week how many children these people could be helping while we are attending the course.  As other guests said earlier, there are some fantastic therapists out there and this is not meant to bash them.  There are some very understanding therapists once you get into the system, but it is about getting in to see them and getting the support.  There is sometimes an undertone that suggests the disability manager has been told to run cases in a certain way.</p> <p>  As well as meeting the Minister of State, we suggested there should be more administrative assistance in the CDNTs.  In some cases when family plans are being drawn up, the senior therapist has to type up notes, which leads to a further delay in the process.  That has since been improved and the feedback taken on board, particularly in my CDNT in Cork Street, where an administrative worker now looks after much of the stuff, which is fantastic.</p> <p>  We were able to contact a therapist who had recently left the HSE.  That person had not been there for long but paperwork was a big issue.  The therapist had been spending their time drowning under the paperwork, rather than being out there helping the children.  That issue is systemic and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  To return to the case of the child whose appointment was cancelled, what fuelled the matter was that, unfortunately, the disability manager was unaware of where the staff were.  Somebody had called in sick, which happens and is understandable but I do not think somebody would call in sick ten minutes before they are due to start their working day.  There is usually a bit of notice.  In that example, when it was suggested another OT could take over, the receptionist had to inform the disability manager that this person was also out sick.  A disability manager should know where his or her people are on any given day and be able to make amendments through a messaging system, which should be in place.  There are messaging systems everywhere and it is not complex software to install.  Such a system would be valuable in that it would avoid upsetting children who might not want to be there and wasting people's time.  The appointment might involve a big change for the child and the parent might have prepared him or her for it with social stories or visual aids.  If the plan is then changed, that can have a significant knock-on effect for parents that will be felt beyond that day.  The child could have a meltdown that will last for up to two days because of that change.</p></speech>

I was very interested when Ms Holmes stated that more administrative staff are needed to support therapists and to let therapists focus on their expertise.  That is something we should take up given that if a therapist is involved in administrative work, that is a waste of a valuable and scarce resource.  Moreover, we should take up with the Department, the HSE and the Minister the issue of international recruitment, which can and should be done.  We should not try to put barriers in the way but rather should have a can-do approach.</p></speech>

It has been very enlightening to hear on-the-ground experiences regarding the lack of supports and services.  We have an awfully long way to go as a country to get a level of service that is in any way acceptable.  I am substituting for Senator Seery Kearney during this meeting, who has spoken at length about the advocacy work that Ms Holmes&rsquo;s organisation does in Dublin 12.  Senator Seery Kearney wanted me to put on record that community's thanks for the work the organisation does, because it is extremely valuable.</p> <p>  That leads me on to some questions for Ms Holmes and Ms Whitmarsh relating to funding.  How are they managing the funding of their organisations?  Clearly, it is challenging and the advocacy work they do is critical.  Are they accessing HSE funding or are there other supports for their organisations?  I acknowledge Ms Whitmarsh's organisation has not been up and running for long.</p></speech>

We try to source experts such as OTs, SLTs and psychologists ourselves, negotiate a fee with them and bring them in to talk to parents to help them fill that gap.  Parents are very frustrated waiting around, so we try to help out as much as we can.  Next month, a speech and language therapist will come on board to run a couple of workshops with the parents, which will be brilliant.</p> <p>  There is a cost to that.  Families are going through difficult times, like every family in the country at the moment with the rising costs of everything, and we try to keep the costs as low as possible. We do not receive any HSE funding, so we approach local agencies such as Dublin City Council or Dublin South City Partnership to see if they can support us with anything like that relating to education and empowering parents.  Otherwise, if the cost is too high, it means the parents bear the costs and they are not always able to do that.</p></speech>

I will try my best.</p> <p>  I am not a campaigner; I am just a mum.  We started our campaign five weeks ago.  It started as a Facebook page for support that we were putting resources up for speech and language therapy and OT.  My frustration and hearing everyone's story started this campaign five weeks ago.  We had a local meeting and got parents to attend via social media and everything like that.  We are campaigning to try to get awareness in services.</p> <p>  We do not get any funds or support from anyone.  We are not providing a service for people apart from support and advocacy, and listening to them, which is important.  In terms of funding, it would be nothing even though last week was a hectic week in preparation for this week and we have a presentation in the audiovisual room next week.  From a working point of view, last week I put in at least 40 hours in campaigning and sending emails.</p> <p>  The HSE is actually referring people to our committee.  This goes to show how the progressing disability services, PDS, system is.  I know it is funny but it is not funny.</p></speech>

My husband and I campaigned previously for the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi and along with other campaigners, we got it for our child.  It is not that we want to campaign but I have to do it.  I cannot sit back and do nothing.  It is failing all our children.  I can see the failure in my child.  I only want to help people.</p> <p>  As I said, we started the email campaign.  I am sorry if I am repeating myself.  I thought it imperative to tell parents about the assessment of need route, that if one goes privately, as we did, one does not get a service statement.  One of my main issues was to tell people that.</p> <p>  Then we started a your-service-your-say campaign for everyone on our committee and social media to put in his or her complaint.  Via that, we have received three or four referrals from the HSE.  As regards support, it is just something where we are supporting one another.</p> <p>  Maybe down the line, we will have little coffee mornings and have inclusion mornings for the children but we will never be a charity or a committee.  I am only doing this because I do not want other people to have an eight-year-old who has only received one hour of services in March and one yesterday because I am pushing.  I do not want that to happen.  This is what we need to stop happening.  Get the children who are three years of age and four years of age their services now.  For example, we have a five-year-old on our committee and he has been waiting two and a half years.  That is half his life.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>  It is parents, such as me and my husband, who are put in these situations with children with additional needs.  It is fight or flight.  Parents are exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally and financially, but we are the type who, if we want to help people, will.  We are only coming together and creating a little community and inclusion and somewhere where people can talk and guide their frustrations.  We are campaigning on their behalf, not only for our child but for everyone, locally and nationally, and raising these issues because they are so important.</p> <p>  We will never be a charity.  The HSE may refer more people to us but we will accept them because we only want to help people.</p></speech>

She regrets that she is not in a position to attend today.  That is why I am substituting for her.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for their presentations and for their attendance here today.  It is hard for me, like others, to listen to the first-hand testimonies they are providing.  It is so much harder for them, looking after their children and providing support and advocacy for other parents in a similar situation.</p> <p>  Their insights are incredibly valuable because they are based on first-hand experience.  Their analysis in terms of what needs to happen is important.  The Government and the HSE need to hear that.  Many of their proposals absolutely make sense.</p> <p>  It is regrettable that many of their proposals could be applied to staff right across the HSE.  There are major problems with recruitment and retention right across the board.  That is most sharply felt in relation to disability services.  Actions must be taken in that regard.  There needs to be, first of all, an assessment of the requirement right across the board with all therapists.  There needs to be proper workforce planning.  Staff need to be treated with respect.  There are pay issues, undoubtedly, in relation to the section 39 organisations.  They have been talked about for years.  It is about time that the political system responded adequately to this.  It probably represents one of the biggest failings at political level in relation to how services are run in this country.  Of course, not only is it a breach of children's rights, it also holds back their development.  As our guests well know, years lost in childhood can never be regained.  As I say, it represents the worst State failure over recent years.</p> <p>  I thank them for all the work that they do.  I have to say I am in awe of their energy, persistence and resilience in all of this.  As parents of children with special needs, they should not have to do this.  They should not have to go public on their own personal stories and they should not have to be forced into a situation where they must go private to access basic essential services.  It is a measure of how wholly inadequate those services are.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention are key issues in all of this.  I was struck by something Ms Hart said about therapists leaving the service because what they are expected to do in providing the service does not line up with their professional ethics.  Would Ms Hart talk to us a little more about that, please?</p></speech>

One cannot shorten this to the point where it is one or two professionals in a very short space of time having to make a judgment that will have a huge impact on the ongoing services for that child.</p> <p>  I would not work in a system that expected me to phone parents, ask them to describe how their child is doing over the phone and try to decide a priority list to bring into the clinic on that basis.  I would not work for a system that expected me to only deliver indirect therapy when I know that there is no research evidence to back that up.  That is unethical.</p></speech>

Presumably, that creates major ethical issues for the individual therapists.  It is one of the main drivers then, if therapists or anybody working in the health service feels that they are failing their clients or patients.</p></speech>

In an environment where bills are going up and where there are all of the other pressures on staff and their families, it is difficult to say to the system that is employing them that this is not ethical but I do not believe that the services, as they are being delivered at present, are being delivered in an ethical way.</p></speech>

That is a damning statement for somebody with Ms Hart's level of experience to say.  There are many statements that have been made here today that should be stopping senior politicians in their tracks in terms of the kind of priorities that they afford to different areas that need political attention as well as funding.  There are funding issues there as well.  It is not enough to say that money is not the problem.  There are funding issues but there are also serious management issues involved and a question of people at a senior level taking responsibility.</p></speech>

She commented that the passage of time haunts her.  It is a shocking that she has been brought to a point where she says she is haunted by that with respect to her own children and others.  Parents should not be put into that situation.</p><p> Ms Whitmarsh talked in her presentation about therapist assistants.  To what extent are those posts available?  What is the HSE's attitude to creating those posts?  How do our guests feel that would improve the service?</p></speech>

The norm these days seems to be that vulnerable children are waiting for two to three years for therapies.  I spoke about therapy assistance.  There are family support workers in some of the CDNTs, who seem to help the therapists and do a bit of play with the child and go through a bit of occupational therapy.  I feel that if there were therapist assistance, it could be an add-on course for someone from a social work environment or background.  We should make these supports available.  Even with regard to things such as augmentative and alternative communication, AAC, devices, we could have therapist assistants for speech and language who would deal only with devices.  My little boy has a device to help him speak at the moment.  It has broken many times.  He has resorted to using YouTube, but that is another matter altogether.  I have contacted the speech and language therapist a number of times via email and phone call about this device.  It is taking time from her that she could be spending with other children.</p></speech>

It has been kind of ignored.  The matter has been brought up a couple of times.  I feel that therapist assistants would be brilliant for everyone.  In the case of a speech and language therapist, that person could focus on the devices and bridge that gap.  The same would apply to occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  Such people could do the paperwork to take the pressure off the therapists so they could provide actual intervention to the children.</p></speech>

My final question is for Ms Holmes.  All our guests are saying that the number one issue is the shortcomings in the therapy area.  There has been a failure to manage that area and ensure our most vulnerable citizens have access to the essential therapies they need.  However, the secondary point I am picking up is the fact that the HSE's communication is absolutely appalling and I wish to ask Ms Holmes about that.  Is she aware whether the HSE is doing anything in particular to improve its communication?  She talked about the importance of family forums.  Have her local CDNTs been in contact with her about establishing such forums?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#K00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We are fortunate and unfortunate in a way.  Dublin 12 is split between two CDNTs, which means we can see the parallels because we have parents attending both CDNTs.  Different issues, such as the messaging system, have arisen.  I told others that I got a text to cancel an appointment and another parent was able to tell me she does not get any such thing.  Instead that parent has to ring and confirm the appointment is going ahead.  There are different strategies that depend on the CDNT in question.  For want of a better term, there are strengths and weaknesses to both.  One of the disability managers has been proactive and has held many meetings on Microsoft Teams and Zoom to update parents, which is great.  There are, of course, some parents who will not get those updates because they do not have email addresses but word of mouth can spread.  We can tell other parents to ring wherever they are attending to find out what is going on.  My experience is that one of the CDNTs in my area is quite proactive in dealing with communications.  It may be the case that the CDNT in question has employed an administrative assistant, which takes a lot of the pressure off.</p> <p>  We keep raising the issue.  As I said, there is a group of parents who meet up.  That is how we are able to inform and empower each other.  I am able to tell parents during a session what is going on for my child in one place and someone else can say that is not the case with regard to another child.  We are putting the onus back on parents and telling them they need to contact the disability manager or key worker and ask the questions as to why something is not happening.</p> <p>  We are eager to establish the family forum.  At our most recent review with one of the disability managers, we were told it will be another four of five months before that forum is set up.  There does not seem to have been any mention of it in the other CDNT.  That said, we are sending emails to try to find out the situation and keep the pressure on.  We need forums set up as soon as possible.  Parents need somewhere to be able to feed back their own experiences of dealing with the services.</p></speech>

I have a nephew with Down's syndrome to whom I am very close.  I have seen some of the failings within the system.  I know that something as small as orthotics have become big issues.  We are privileged to have the Delta Centre in Carlow.  I do not know if our guests are aware of the facility.  My nephew attends the centre, as do many others.  It is a great facility.  I work with disability services.  The centre provides a great quality of life for those who attend and they do things like going out on a Friday night with their group.  That is important.  My nephew is in his 20s, as are the others with whom he is pally.</p> <p>  I find that getting a work placement for someone with a disability, whether Down's syndrome or something else, is an issue, even for a few weeks' work experience in a garden centre, a little restaurant or whatever.  How do our guests find that situation?  I feel that needs to be addressed better with regard to all services.  There are always issues that we absolutely need to address.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been to the fore and has met many disability groups in recent weeks.  I know she is listening to all the concerns, which is what we need.  That is important.</p> <p>  Ms Holmes spoke about getting services, including therapists.  There is a two-year backlog in Carlow for children waiting for different services and therapists.  That has become an issue.  We cannot blame the Covid pandemic but it has played a part because it has disrupted disability services.  At the moment, I am working with four or five families and trying to get them respite care.  Overnight respite services were gone for the two years of the pandemic.  I can only speak for my areas of Carlow and Kilkenny because I am well aware of the services there but I do not know if the same applies to other areas.  In my area, day respite services for families started a few months ago.  I know the same is being done in Wexford.  It is working well but I feel families also need to have overnight respite as well.  That is another issue on which our guests might come back to me.  Are they aware of any overnight respite facilities?</p> <p>  There are considerable issues with regard to delays in the system.  There is some funding available but not all that is necessary.  We must make sure that we keep staff when we have them.  We need to know why we are unable to get these services back up and running as quickly as we need them.  I always feel that timing is crucial when it comes to children's treatment, as our guests will know.  That is the case whether in the case of an assessment for autism or for a therapist, or whatever else.  Timing is crucial.</p><p>When there is a backlog and the child is going to school, the school is looking for a report the parents do not have.  That has become a huge issue.  I understand there are flaws in the system that need to be addressed.  In a way, I am giving more information than I am looking for.  The witnesses will know all about Carlow before they go home.  Is there anything else they might be able to fill me in on?  Families are so good.  Covid has been extremely hard for children with some sort of a disability so well done to all of the witnesses.  They have been brilliant.  The Government must now put funding into these services.  I am a firm believer in that.  We need to get these children in as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Some of it comes back to the same thing.  It is about getting the early intervention going and getting therapies through school, not just as a pilot programme but actually integrated into the school system.  I do not know why we need pilots for everything.  Some 80% of children in Australia get their therapy in school.  Why are we still putting children out?  Why are we not employing therapists in education?  That then hopefully steers people onto a pathway where they may be looking towards further education.  We are working with the ETBs to get more accessible courses and some of the Down Syndrome Ireland courses into ETBs.  Those might be courses that help develop employment skills.  We would then work with employers to get easy-read contracts and other things to facilitate that process.  It all starts at the beginning with getting the basics right.</p></speech>

Regarding employment, we have a fantastic local initiative called WALK that the committee might have heard of.  Senator Seery Kearney would be well aware of it.  It gets employment opportunities for adults with intellectual disabilities and runs respite as well, which is fantastic.  That is extremely difficult for people under the age of 18.  Pre-Covid, parents would have accessed some form of respite and home help and that has gotten back up and running.  In one case where there are behaviour issues, a parent who was looking for respite was steered towards thinking about residential care for her son.  What kind of system is that, when we are not even willing to put the tools and supports in place to help a child thrive?  The answer given was residential care.  This child is seven years of age.  His parents are well aware that when he gets older that may be somewhere he will need to be but why is everything else not tried first?  I cannot understand in this day and age why residential care is being recommended for a seven-year-old.  It is very upsetting.</p> <p>  In respect of therapists, we have found something with a lot of the families that are accessing any form of service, communication or support from the CDNTs.  We have not done a poll on this but I think the results would be quite interesting if we did.  A lot of these families have had to go down the legal route.  They are getting certain things because they have engaged with solicitors and had a court case.  There are statistics on how much money the HSE spends every year fighting these court cases and kicking the ball down the road.  It is the children, families and adults who are left to suffer.  That seems to be the mindset.  That mindset and the system need a big overhaul.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022052600002#L00400"><p>I apologise for not being here earlier; I was at a different committee meeting.  I have read the opening statements.  I do not want to go over questions that might have been asked so I will make more of a comment.  It was depressing reading all the statements.  It seems relentless.  Every time people like the witnesses come in here, we feel we have such an uphill battle of unmet needs.  We know that because we hear it continuously and speak to people.  Every single day of the week we speak to people about their heartache and the torture involved.  It is not only the job of looking after their child but the job of engaging with services.  The toll, heartbreak and torture that puts on a family is incredible.  Ms Whitmarsh spoke about the regression of her child during lockdown.  Unfortunately, that is not unusual.  It is an incredible shame that we are in this situation.</p> <p>  Something came onto my desk this week and I wanted to know if it is common.  I am talking about letters coming from the HSE telling parents their child has been on a list and asking them to confirm whether the child should still be on that list.  Tasking a parent with diagnosing or assessing their child is horrendous.  To put that medical or professional job onto a parent - not that they are not capable - is uncalled for and it is happening over and over again.</p> <p>  There are so many blockages in the system.  We need an entire shake-up.  The system is not working because it is broken.  There is no support for staff who want to shine.  I know a person who was told to settle down when she asked if she could give free yoga classes to some of her clients in a different service because it might make other staff members look bad.  That is horrendous.  This is happening in our HSE system.  I do not have much of a question but I just wanted to tell the witnesses that they have this committee's support.  We listen to them and we are constantly depressed by what we hear and are pushed and urged to do more.  Go raibh maith agaibh.</p></speech>

The work they are doing is commendable.  I should not have to commend them for looking after their children.  That is the job of a parent.  The job of the State is to deliver rights and services.  What we have heard today, and for many years, is that the State has failed and is still failing.  I know the Dublin 12 campaign group very well.  They are a tremendous group of people who have come together out of frustration, as have other organisations.  Most community organisations usually come from frustration with the State for not delivering but in this case it is even more horrendous.  The State is basically asking parents who have their hands full to give up more of their time to advocate for their own children and also to try to help other children.  The last time we met, at the protest outside the new school in Dublin 12, parents had heard that day that the HSE was going to give them some courses or a few tips to help them along the way while they waited for the service, or even an assessment, to be delivered.  I could feel the parents' frustration on that day.  They had been waiting and waiting.  They presumed the new special school in Crumlin would do the devil and all, as they were promised.</p><p>It is great it is there and that we have an educational facility.  We will try to fix it, as we try to fix everything.  The parents ended up having to come back out on the streets to gather and express their frustration at still having no services and no therapists - in effect, it had gone backwards at that stage.  The frustration was palpable on that day and a few times since, when parents contacted me to ask what they can do and where they can go.</p><p> Ms Whitmarch said the HSE was referring people to her.  That happens across the board and, in some ways, it is an acknowledgement of the HSE's inability to deliver services.  It is also an expression of Ms Whitmarch&rsquo;s expertise and the expertise of the other parents.  However, that should not happen because it is wrong.  It is a disgrace.  While it is testament to the empowerment that has happened, it should not be the case.  If we can fix that in any way, we will do it.</p><p> Parents contact me on another issue.  There was recently a concentration around special school at primary school level and there now seems to be a greater shift towards secondary school.  Over the years that I have been a Deputy, many of the parents, who are often quite elderly, had a frustration as to what happens in later years when they are not strong enough or are in ill health.  They ask what will happen to their child.  They ask what services will be there when the child finishes secondary school at the age of 18, where they will go and where is that progression.  Will the HSE have caught up with the parents or with the child, who is an adult at that stage?  What services are missing at that stage for late teenagers and those going into early adulthood?  The witnesses might be able to help us on that.</p><p> I commend the work of the committee and in particular the witnesses and those who are using their time to help others and help their children where the State should be delivering a service.</p></speech>

We have a long way to go on inclusivity and not just in regard to working for these children.  I had an eight-year old standing with me in a shopping centre, waiting in a queue.  He is quite noisy and he is quite overwhelmed, and I have no option but to bring him in.  Adults are staring at him.  What hope do we have to include him and to get him to live an independent life when there is still so much that has to be done around awareness and inclusion?</p> <p>  On the issue of respite, in Cavan we only have respite of one week for children and one week for adults, which is not good enough at all.  Our committee includes the parents of a 15-year-old girl.  She has intellectual disabilities and chromosome deletion and has very high, complex needs.  She only recently went into respite because she can be quite aggressive.  It is not her fault; it is her needs.  The parents are begging for respite and begging for help.  They seem only to get the respite for two days every ten weeks and they cannot cope.  Because that 15-year-old&rsquo;s needs are so high, when she goes into respite, instead of having four clients there, there is only one other client.  Instead of it being the highest standard of respite to care for the highest needs and to have four people with the highest needs, that girl is not getting the respite she is entitled to because of her complex needs, if members know what I mean.  Something has to be done.</p> <p>  Senator McGreehan referred to unmet needs and spoke about it being relentless.  Therapists are giving me advice without ever seeing my child, without knowing what he looks like.  As someone said, they would not be able to pick him out of a line-up.  These are voiceless children, literally voiceless as they are non-verbal.  It is the most harrowing thing about having a child with additional needs - you have to put yourself out there and you have to fight.  It is a constant fight and a constant battle.  The thing that haunts you is the passing of time, the regrets and also what is going to happen when you die.  Is this child going to be in residential care?  What way is he going to be treated?  How is he going to feel?  Are they going to know to leave his curtains open at night as he likes the bright lights in the night sky and the moon shining in at him?  Is he going to have that rural environment and be looking out at the cows?  Of course not.  That is what haunts us the most.  This beautiful child that you would do anything for has got additional needs and sees the world in a completely different way.  He is helpless and so am I because the HSE is tying our hands, with no intervention and no support.  There is no foresight even to have the clinical staff on the workforce planning committees instead of having managers, who are fantastic but they may not have worked with a child in 15 years.  We need to have people on the ground who know what is going on and know how bad things are so these children can progress.</p> <p>  I feel that the longer a child is waiting for intervention, the closer they are getting to residential care.  My husband always makes this analogy about PDS.  All of the parents are running for the same loaf of bread.  We are all running to get these crumbs for us, for our children and for our families.  This is what we are all doing now.  It is about us all standing up together and saying we are not going to take that piece of bread from them.  We are going to go to the bakery and demand that they make more bread because that is what has to be done.  With all the help and support, we will get there and it will take time.  However, let us not have another family of an eight-year-old who is non-verbal waiting three years and having to go as public as I have to get one hour of services yesterday and an hour in March because I went to a TD.</p></speech>

We do have some therapy services in some of our branches but those are funded by parent contributions and people shaking buckets.  That is who people are being referred to.  That should not have to be the case.  The call was not from the Minister themselves and I have to make that clear; it was from the constituency office.  However, when someone is phoning a charity that has to fundraise to provide the basic services those children should have, that is appalling.</p> <p>  The transition to adulthood is a huge issue.  Members heard me talk earlier about the difference in life expectancy for people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome in particular.  There is usually some funding year-on-year for school leavers to access HSE day services but if someone does not take up that funding as a school leaver, it is very hard to find a pathway in at a later stage.  If someone had a decent service and is doing well and has gone through mainstream school or is in a position where, rather than looking at a day service, they are looking at further education or maybe employment, families are not doing that because of fear.  If someone does that when they are 18, then when they are 30 and their parents are another 12 years older, and the person is another 12 years older and their needs might have changed, there is no way back in to those services and there is no pathway except the school leaver pathway.  That is a disincentive to people to go and be included in society.  It is a structural issue that needs addressing.</p> <p>  We are seeing heart-breaking cases.  I have had phone calls from parents in their 80s who are looking after children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome in their 50s who have early onset dementia and they are being told there is no residential place until somebody else dies.</p><p>I would not want to be in that situation in my 80s.  I do not believe any one of us would.</p></speech>

Our campaign has been going for four years now.  As he will know, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has been a great support to us from day one.  We appreciate all of his help.  He comes out to the protests and always answers our queries.  It makes us feel like someone is listening, which is a great thing.  I never thought I was going to be the parent who goes out and protests, who makes the phone calls and who has to, for lack of a better word, fight with people to get scraps of services for my child.  That appears to be the way the system is moulding parents.  You are basically told that, unless you shout the loudest, your child will not get anything.  That is okay if you are somebody who can be out there with a campaign or who is on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and who has a backing, but what about the parent at home who cannot get out to these meetings to show support?  They may want to but have no one to do it.</p> <p>  Many parents are in situations like mine.  Since I was 20 years of age, after college, I have always been in the workforce.  When Adam was given his diagnosis, a decision had to be made as to what was best for our family.  That meant surviving on one income so that I could be at home to support Adam.  We spoke about this situation a little bit.  I refer back to what we said about the difference the assistance of an occupational therapist or a speech and language therapist would make.  There are many parents like me who are home carers and who would love to get back to some form of education.  I am a parent with a background working in finance but, because this whole world has been opened up to me through my son, I wish I could make an impact and difference.  I do that through the campaign but I would like to do something longer term and to get some education in that area.  That is food for thought.</p> <p>  Another thing that strikes me today, which members will have seen on their news feeds this morning, is the Department of Education's emergency response to the shortage of school places.  This is causing absolute uproar and panic among parents and campaigns this morning.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, came to our area.  By all accounts, she is really eager to listen to stories.  The stories that struck parents most on the night were those from elderly ladies who spoke about the struggle of caring for their adult children.  A parent told us all about the fantastic work they do in the community but it is very upsetting, when starting out on your journey, to think you will still be fighting this battle with the system and having to stand up every day when you are in your 60s, 70s and 80s.  That is not how the system should work.</p></speech>

Those of us on the committee are here each Thursday morning hearing testimony from families, carers and people with additional needs.  This morning's contributions have been very forceful and very strong.  As Chair of this committee, members of which have a great passion for improving services and standards of living for people with disabilities, their carers, their communities and their families, I will say that this morning's testimony has challenged us greatly.  As I said when I was appointed Chair of this committee, there is no doubt in my mind that a future Taoiseach of this country will have to apologise in the D&aacute;il Chamber on behalf of the State for the services provided for people with intellectual disabilities.  This already happened to some degree last week with regard to the two kids who were awaiting second level education.  There are challenges out there and difficulties and obstacles that must be faced.  Some members spoke about it not being a question of money.  There is a certain attitude out there.  Ms Whitmarsh alluded to it when she spoke about the world staring when she has her son with her.  Over the past decade alone, we have come an awful long way as a society with regard to social issues but we have to go further immediately with regard to people with additional needs.  We have to challenge society to do that.</p> <p>  Ms Whitmarsh talked about the therapist assistants or assistant therapists - whatever the term is.  That title does not exist within the HSE but it is a powerful thing we should all be pursuing.  Special needs assistants in schools have made a great impact with regard to school services.  It is something that needs to be done.  I meet parents and I see on a personal level the challenges and roadblocks that exist.  There is no doubt the Covid pandemic has had an awful impact.  The two years of the pandemic and the first lockdown had a very big impact on people with additional needs.  The July provision is coming up soon.  There is adequate funding for it but the system is not capable of delivering it.  It is not an issue of funding but that the system is not capable of delivering this provision.  It is the same in respect of therapist recruitment.  If a multinational company were coming to Ireland, would we be able to go to the embassies and recruitment fairs to bring in the necessary workers?  What do we have to do?  Do we have to pursue the concept of therapist assistants so that more people of all ages can get more therapies?  Those are the challenges.</p> <p>  Respite services were available four or five years ago but they are now an absolute luxury.  It is now family funerals and different seismic events in families' lives that are being covered by respite care.  That was not the case before and we must return to that.  The State is and has been failing people with disabilities and we have to challenge that.</p> <p>  As a committee, we are charged with ensuring the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities is being implemented, but we have to ensure the optional protocol is not being debated in any Department or subject to any administrative measures.  We have to make sure we are stoking that fire.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Holmes, Ms Whitmarsh and Ms Hart for their evidence and testimony this morning.  I ask them not to be strangers to us.  If they think we are failing in our job as a committee or if there is additional information they think we need to have, they should feel free to send it to the extremely hard-working team behind us who are doing an amazing job.  I thank members for their sincerity in what they are doing.  I ask them to reflect on what the witnesses have said to us.  We will try to raise these issues at every possible level.  I genuinely believe that, if enough noise is made, there is capability to deal with them.  As I said before, it might not be enough to bang the drum.  The percussionists need to get on the stage to make sure we are highlighting the issues the witnesses are facing every day.  I again thank the witnesses, the members and our team for being here this morning.</p></speech>

Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.  If joining on Teams, I ask members to mute their microphones when not speaking and use the raise-hand function to indicate.  I ask members to note that in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus and when in close proximity to others, and be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to public health advice.</p> <p>  Before we go any further, our Chair, Deputy Ivana Bacik, cannot be with us today.  She has Covid.  We wish her a speedy recovery.</p> <p>  Today we are having the first of our meetings on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on care and social protection.  I welcome our witnesses, Dr. Ursula Barry of UCD, a member of the expert group to the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, who is joining us on Teams, Dr. Emily Murphy, senior researcher, health inequalities, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and Professor Mary Murphy, Maynooth University social sciences institute, and thank them for their time here today.</p> <p>  I have an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, them or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I call on Dr. Barry to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I wish good health to Ivana that she will soon be back in place.</p> <p>  The theme for my opening statement is about putting care at the centre of Irish society and what that would involve.</p> <p>  The care economy is central to every discussion on gender equality in Ireland.  This is primarily because there is a significant care penalty, mainly affecting women, with negative effects on women's level of unpaid work, income from paid work, career development and entitlements to social protection.</p> <p>  Everyone, at different stages of life, cares for others or has care needs provided by others.  Care is part of all our lives at some point.  Care is essential work encompassing the social infrastructure on which our societies are built.  It includes looking after the physical, social, psychological, emotional, and developmental needs of one person or more.  It is also true to say that care and the economy are intertwined and care is increasingly recognised as a significant economic issue.  In practice, economic relations influence the quantity and quality of care provided in society and the care systems through which it is organised but the care economy is not valued, or is seriously and systematically undervalued, both on our island and also at a global level.</p> <p>  Demographic change, economic crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic have put care more centrally on the current policy agenda.  Unfortunately, it is also quick to fall off the agenda.  For example, the EU Covid-19 recovery plan, which was allocated a significant amount of funding in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, has allocated 30% of its expenditure to the digital economy, a further 30% of expenditure is allocated to the green economy but there is no ring-fenced allocation to the care economy.  Ireland's submission on the recovery plan pays scant attention to care.</p> <p>  Applying a gender equality perspective on the economy and society means placing the care economy at its centre.  When that happens mainstream assumptions about economic activity and economic well-being are challenged.  There are key assumptions which are reflected in the United Nations system of measuring economic activity that all of countries adhere to and that determine how economic activity is measured and not measured, both in Ireland and internationally.</p><p>Under this global system, the measurement of GNP and GDP is based on market economic activity, that is, activity that passes through the market and, therefore, carries a price.  This model of economic activity does not recognise interdependence, through which much of our economic activity is organised.  It also casts dependency in a negative light.</p><p> Within mainstream economics, "value" is used to refer to anything that has a price in the marketplace.  In this mainstream economic model, many activities are not counted.  These are the unpaid, frequently hidden and uncounted care, community and volunteering activities that bind our society together.  This means that the majority of women's economic activity is not counted in the global system, as most of this unpaid activity is care work, and that a significant amount of the economic activity that women do is hidden, invisible, unmeasured and devalued in economic data.  According to the International Labour Organization, at a global level, three out of four hours of unpaid, unmeasured activities are carried out by women.  As a consequence, economic statistics used to inform policymaking and policy priorities are narrow and gendered because only those activities that are counted are fully taken into account when policy priorities are determined.  This means that women's economic activity is marginalised and not prioritised in the system.</p><p> What does this have to do with applying a gender equality lens to the economy?  It has to do with understanding the implications for women in particular, who carry out the vast majority of these unpaid and undervalued activities.  When we look at Ireland, we see a starkly gendered care system: 98% of full-time carers are women; Ireland has the third highest level of unpaid work in the EU; and, on average, Irish adults spend more than 30 hours per week on unpaid care provision and housework.  Research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, by Dr. Helen Russell has revealed that women spend double the amount of time on caring than men - 10.6 hours for men and 21.3 hours for women - per week.  Women do nearly three times as much housework as men, reporting an average of 20 hours per week while men report an average of seven hours per week.  This is a highly gendered system.</p><p> Linked to this is the gendered care penalty.  The care penalty imposed on women in Ireland is substantial.  Women's lower earnings in employment, access to care breaks and shorter working lives generate a series of complex issues that shape their economic lives: economic dependence; lower lifetime earnings; lower pension entitlements and other social protections; greater poverty as lone parents and in old age; limited access to labour market schemes; a narrower range of employment and educational opportunities; little recognition of the value of economic activity; less control of time, particularly leisure time; and restricted opportunities for political and cultural participation.</p><p> Rigid gender roles are failing men also.  While men in general may benefit from a patriarchal dividend, if we might call it that, based on the unequal division of caring, rigid gender roles are for many men linked to imposed disengagement and marginalisation from care and caring.  There is evidence that some men are creating the opportunities for greater involvement and many more would like the opportunity.  Within the wider policy system, though, there is a definite low priority attached to supporting men within our care economy.  Without more gender equality in the care economy, gender equality at a societal level will not be achieved in Ireland or globally.</p></speech>

As a starting point for understanding how we as humanity meet our social needs generally, let us think of three mechanisms: distribution in the marketplace; redistribution through the state; and the reciprocal interdependence in human relationships that Dr. Barry spoke about.  Our fundamental issue in Ireland is that we have a totally imbalanced care system where the market is delivering up to 70% of childcare and 85% of elder care.  The problem is not so much the model of the private actor delivering care, but the placing of the profit-making motive at the centre of care provision.  We tend to commodify care and focus on its exchange value and what profit we can get from it as an activity.  This shifts care towards a market ethic, which has fundamental impacts on how we understand care and relate to one another as potential receivers and givers of care.  This is the issue that I wish to address.</p> <p>  Focusing overly on the market for delivery tends to amplify the structural inequalities that exist in care burdens and care penalties, particularly in the context of the Irish political economy, which has one of the highest levels of low wages in the OECD.  The sense that gender inequality is focused in the low-wage care sector is amplified by the structure of that sector.</p> <p>  I am arguing for a better balance, which can be summed up in the idea of a shift to a "careful" State, that is, a State that places care much more at the centre of how it understands how its society and economy need to operate.  Such care would be universal and valued and a care ethic would underpin it.  It would seek gender equality and gender neutrality and recognise reciprocity.  We can use two policy tools to develop this approach to care, namely, universal basic services and participation income.</p> <p>  Before discussing these, I will define "care".  The word itself is deeply problematic in the range of activities it has to cover.  There are 40 shades of green and the Inuit have 50 words for "snow", but we only have one word for describing all care and social reproductive activity.  These stretch across many sectors - health, the care we are discussing today, education and even nature if we want to broaden it out to the essential front-line activity that keeps us alive.  There are many ways of defining "care", but I will focus on a narrow definition of it that has to do with child, social, adult and elder care that is provided directly.</p> <p>  Dr. Barry spoke, and I am sure Dr. Murphy will as well, about the negative consequences of the current model.  Its fundamental logic is not care, but profit.  Paradoxically, the model of economic activity does not recognise the reciprocal interdependence at the heart of our relationships even though we are dependent on those reciprocal interdependent relations.  Women in that context are seen as an infinite elastic resource of care provision, as we saw during the pandemic.  I do not need to draw graphic illustrations of this.</p> <p>  We are arguing that we should try to rebalance away from the market towards State and society, although I am not romantic about the State or society.  We need only look at our recent history to know that both let women and children down badly, and are still doing so in many respects.  I am not arguing for a romantic vision of the State at the centre of care or of turning to society.  Rather, I am arguing for a balance and recognition of the fact that there is considerable diversity in State provision, private provision and forms of social provision.</p> <p>  The "careful" State would value and practise care as a right that everyone gives and receives across his or her life cycle.  In this sense, there would be gender equality because there would be a more equal distribution of care giving and receiving.  There would be a balance across market, State and society.  There would be two key tools.  A universal basic service would see the State taking a proactive role in regulating care for a wider variety of care providers, including different models of ownership than we have at present.  The State would legislate to provide a much richer range of ways to approach care giving, recognising different forms of social economy and non-profit private sector delivery.</p><p>There are a lot of good examples of where they have done this in other countries.  The State would have a much more expansive regulatory role than it does at the moment.  Its role in regulation is usefully focused on compliance at present and that is because of the serious issues we have had in quality of care.   With Big Start it has moved into a more fundamental role of regulating for wages and for funding the wages of care workers, which is welcome.  However, I would see that the role of the State as the regulator needs to be imagined far beyond what it is at present, particularly to regulate the shape and structure of the care sector to be much more creative and innovative than it is now because the different models of company law and the variety of options that care givers have are limited when you look at it.  The State also has roles as planner, monitor and funder in this model.  All of those roles need to be expanded in the Irish context.  Big Start is a good example of how to start that and the role can be developed and expanded to get better balance and to ratchet down the role of for-profit private delivery in the care infrastructure.  Norway provides a positive and practical example of what universal basic services, UBS, would look like.  Norway: maintains a strong regulatory role in quality; funds 85% of childcare costs; caps fees for affordability; has good regulatory governance; limits profit; and requires a governance process where all actors have to collaborate in and co-organise care.  There are good practical examples where the Irish State could take a lead.</p><p> The second prong is participation income, which goes back to reciprocity and interdependence.  We must find a tool in the welfare system that enables us to value and support care participation in the home, the community and social relations.  That is recognising that care should never be totally private or public.  There is always a huge demand for care to be rooted in our reciprocal social relations because that is what we do.  We must also be respectful of our diverse family forms in how we manage care.  An income support that values and recognises that care is needed and I am arguing that it could be framed as a participation income that would be available to people who are doing a wide range of socially valued activity that is broadly enabling care and social reproduction in our society.  That would  complement a universal basic service, UBS, because not everybody would want to be or should be in one of those services.</p><p> A participation income could demarketise and decommodify care, taking it away from being a market value.  It could also free up people&rsquo;s time to enable them to engage more voluntarily in the caring roles that a lot of us want to do.  Many of us want to care more but we simply do not have time, money, resources or enablement to do so.  There is a way of approaching income support that could build on care provision.  Ironically, because the Irish welfare state is so categorical and because it still has so many different types of welfare payment, it has payments that recognise care.  The seeds of what I am talking about are well embedded in the Irish welfare state and in some of our old approaches to labour market programmes.  We are not starting from scratch in any of this; there are tools in place that we can build on and these ideas have been discussed in the 2006 report on supporting lone parents, in the recent climate justice report by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and in the climate action plan.  Therefore it is not as far-fetched or romanticised as it might sound as an idea.</p><p> We can focus on how to help women as a feminised concept or we can have a feminist approach to the debate, which seeks to put gender equality at the centre of it.  It is important to frame care outside of those marketised rationales and to begin to get the language of ethics of care, public services and income support outside of the male breadwinner model we currently have.  Defining care as an essential public service is part of that but we must also recognise that reciprocity and interdependence at the heart of our relationships.  The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality did a lot to begin to frame care in that direction and demonstrated demand for that State-led care in Ireland.  It made recommendations for investing 1% of GNP and for higher taxes or a care tax to make a reality of the recommendations.  It also recommended a constitutional reframing of how we understand and value care.</p><p> We have done a lot in this and it is welcome that the committee is focusing on trying to put together the compass towards a policy mapping that would get us from A to B.  I would hope the committee would take its work in that direction.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation.  On behalf of TASC, I am delighted to speak on issues around care and social protection.  I will focus on two inter-related aspects of care in Ireland which TASC research has covered in detail.  First, how we value care work in the labour market and second, how care work is allocated in Irish society between men and women, given the current systems of childcare provision in particular.</p> <p>  The value given to care in the labour market and in monetary terms is low.  It has been low for decades and although Covid-19 measures have highlighted how reliant we are as a society on access to childcare in particular, there is still too little being done to raise the value of the sector in Ireland.  Across Europe, care workers in various areas of care, be it early years, older age or disability, tend to receive low wages and be in precarious jobs with low levels of employment benefits.  This is clearly evidenced by incomes alone.  Figures vary by country but compared with average incomes, the income of a typical care worker ranges from between 50% and 80% of average incomes.  In Ireland, a 2021 Pobal report has shown that early childcare workers in non-managerial positions earn only &euro;12.45 per hour on average.  Similarly, a TASC report by Dr. Robert Sweeney on the care economy from 2020 documents an hourly average wage of around &euro;12.80 per hour among adult care workers and care assistants.</p> <p>  Professor Murphy touched on the fact that the care assistant and early childcare occupations serve as examples of where we need greater investment into innovative job and training models to enhance productivity and skill levels among care workers, rather than assuming an inability to promote greater productivity in face-to-face services such as these.  Such long-held assumptions ensure wages remain low and curtail advancement possibilities in any care economy.  If we were to raise the wages, productivity, skills and job conditions in caring professions, then we might also achieve another aim of further gender equality, which is to encourage more men to take up care work.  Paid care work is still predominantly carried out by native and migrant women, though increasingly, by migrant women.  Breaking down the segregation of women into care occupations must be a goal if we wish to value care work equally within Irish society.  Studies looking at how perceptions of value in occupations change have demonstrated that gender segregation means that men and women will tend to place greater symbolic value on occupations that are their same-sex dominated occupations.  Therefore gender segregation in the labour market begets greater normative value for women and men sorting into gendered caring careers.  As such, it is essential that conditions of work for care workers are negotiated through collective bargaining to see wages rise, and further, that Government subsidies be provided for in-work training possibilities that will generate productivity and skilled jobs.</p> <p>  The next point I wish to make is that for the care sector in Ireland to meet the future needs of a more gender-egalitarian economy, there must be universal access for households to public and high quality childcare provision.  There is a specific need for Government to increase its spending on early childcare provisions and to move from privatised care provision towards a fully integrated public early years childcare and education system.  Let us look at the two main schemes available in Ireland, the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, and the national childcare scheme, NCS.  Most spending in Ireland goes towards subsidising free preschool childcare through the ECCE.  In 2019, the Government spent close to 0.16% of GNI on the ECCE and almost 0.08% of national income on the NCS.  State funding has been on an upward trajectory over the last few years.  However, at the current rate of increase we are decades off reaching the target set by UNICEF for countries to allocate 1% of national income to early years care.  The lack of appropriate levels of State investment in public early years and childcare provision has a detrimental effect, specifically on women&rsquo;s and lone-parents&rsquo; engagement in the Irish labour market, bringing further disparities in pay, savings and wealth security over a lifetime.</p><p>As Dr. Barry mentioned, if we take just one marker of this inequality which manifests in a pension income gap - the difference between male and female pension income &ndash; currently the gender disparity in annual pensions is estimated by EUROFOUND to be 29% in Ireland.  TASC would argue therefore that there is an urgent need to address these aspects of valuation in care sectors to achieve greater gender equality. </p></speech>

There are lots of questions that I want to ask.  It is very hard to decide where to go.  In terms of the future, there seems to be a mandate for change.  We heard from people who have been involved in the assembly that the citizens were really open to a reimagining of care.  They were open not just to investing more in care, but doing it very differently.  On the idea of having a public childcare system, or a very strong public element to the childcare system, I ask the witnesses to comment on the importance of the childcare system being universally accessible.  We know that some of the concerns around childcare at the moment are in respect of community childcare access.  The idea is that childcare should not be something that is simply for parents who are working or in education, but something that children should get from the beginning.  It also gives people the space to have opportunities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the idea of care not just being an addendum to work and employment but something that we collectively value in itself.  Dr. Emily Murphy of TASC mentioned the employment area.  I ask the witnesses to comment further on the importance of progression pathways to enable those in the care sector to plan a five- or ten-year career, ensuring that it gets better, their pay increases and there is a career ladder.  I think that a lot of the time people feel that a career in care work gets to a point where it hits a plateau and remains there.  That leads people to think that they cannot spend 30 years working in the sector, for example.</p> <p>  I was really interested in Dr. Barry's comments around value and how value is calculated.  We did not have a survey on wealth information for a long time but the deprivation index was a reverse way to see who did not have wealth, namely, lone parents among whom there were extraordinarily high levels of deprivation.  Similarly, there is a time poverty issue.  I ask the witnesses for their thoughts on the mechanisms required to ensure that care is valued and captured and how we address that.  I refer to valuing care in terms of the support we can provide, including through initiatives such as the participation payment and others and how we can ensure the value of care is captured in our economic and social modelling.  As Dr. Barry mentioned, there has been a shift on that and a new semester process is happening at the European level, where we are meant to be looking at new measures of society and new approaches to measuring GDP, ensuring that other indicators are considered aside from GDP.  I ask the witnesses for their thoughts on that.</p> <p>  On Professor Mary Murphy's comments, I like the idea of participation income moving forward.  One issue we must address on which we have a mandate from the citizens concerns those who have suffered historically as a result of the way we have treated care, the social protection system as it is now, and individualisation in the social protection system, specifically.  For example, many women will not be able to access a full pension and will not be able to get even a basic pension because they will be means-tested and their partner's wages will be taken into account.  Changes that were made to the social protection system for lone parents in Ireland did not recognise lone parents balancing care responsibilities with other work, certainly after the child reached the age of 14.  The issue of income disregards is one that the citizens specifically raised.</p> <p>  On pension reform, we have heard about the idea of acknowledging care within our pension system.  The problem is that there is talk of acknowledging an extra ten years of care within the system, but there is a proposal to push the requirement to 40 years of contributions.  We go from having a requirement of 30 years of contributions with ten years of care recognised, to a requirement of 40 years of contributions with 20 years of care recognised.  We are effectively in danger of ending up in the exact same position where many women will not be in receipt of a full contributory pension.  That is another area in which perhaps a universal measure would be best.  </p> <p>  Even though I would like the philosophical work on care to move forward, I am also conscious that the citizens gave really good granular recommendations on social protection policy.  Another issue to be addressed is the legacy of the marriage bar.  How do we untangle the issues around the single breadwinner model that is still a little bit embedded in our social protection system, and introduce one that really recognises both care and work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.735" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#G00400"><p>I thank Senator Higgins.  The idea of reimagining care is an important one.  I have been focused on the idea that we really need to grow our welfare imagination.  We are very caught in the practice of tweaking or making small incremental changes to our present welfare system.  We often get ourselves into knots because it is very complicated to fix a broken system.  It is a sticking-plaster kind of approach.  On going back to basics, as it were, and trying to address both the historical injustices and some of the contemporary injustices being imposed at the moment, such as the changes made in relation to lone parents, the Senator mentioned pensions and equal and individual access to social welfare.  To my mind, there are two key principles that we need to move forward in that area.  One is decoupling the relationship between welfare and work, as in the record of paid work that a person has.  Right now, a principle of our contributory system is to recognise the contribution made primarily through paid work in the form of paid contributions, but some form of credited form of contributions, recognising a limited form of care work.  I think that is probably a wrong starting point for the recognition of some of the pensions.  I would look towards a system such as that in New Zealand, for example, which has a residency-based universal pension right, which does not look at the relationship between work and welfare.  That is a really important principle not only in relation to the entitlement, but also in relation to not forcing people down a very narrow road of getting a welfare payment on condition that they orientate their life towards paid productive employment.  I think decoupling that allows for more types of participation.  That is where participation income can be quite imaginative.  It tells people that we value social activity and paid work is one form that we value, which is fine, but we also value many other activities, such as democratic activity, ecological activity and care activity, in particular.  Participation income decouples the welfare payment from the requirement to work in the paid economy and recognises a much broader range of socially valued work.  In that sense, it is not basic income because it is looking for reciprocity back from the person.  It is looking for participation and engagement in society and some form of socially valued activity but involves really widening out the basis of what we can do.</p> <p>  The second principle is about universality, which has to be about an individual right, moving away from the household-testing of income, which is very hard to do when we are dealing with a limited set of resources and we are trying to tackle poverty issues as well.  It is about getting the balance right in respect of whether we want some level of categorical targeting.  It is about whether we want the system to be universal but with some aspect of targeting within the universality.  There are mechanisms to do it.  Various countries have experimented with the different ways of really getting nearer to a universal entitlement to the payment.  There are some interesting proposals from Anna Coote in the UK, for example, on a minimum income guarantee.</p><p>Instead of screening in only the poorest, using the income test rather than a means test works to screen out only the wealthiest.  You are trying to pitch the payment at a very high level of distribution of households, as an individualised payment, yet are not trying to get it to everybody.  Therefore, you might screen out the top 20%, for example, as being eligible.  That would be a start in trying to reconfigure towards a more individualised and more universal type of approach to who is entitled to income support.  There are ways and means to do so but we should imbed in the system the fundamental principle of an individualised approach.  We could start with the present system and it is imbedded.  For example, administrative individualisation is one way to sneak it into the system.  We really need to get there in terms of our approach to means testing, which is really mean, versus income testing with which one can be much more imaginative and pitch it higher up the income levels that households might have.  In that way, then, you can begin to individualise the income that people get when the household is entitled.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ursula Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#H00200"><p>I completely agree with what Professor Mary Murphy said about the universal approach.  I also agree with some of the new ways to think about universality where one can put a cap on the wealthier section of society benefiting from a universal approach.  In Ireland, there is a huge need for, and priority should be placed on, a universal pension system.  We do not need to have an employment-related pension system and a pension benefit system or pension allowance.  We need a universal pension system that integrates those two things together and that is one of the most important things around universality.  Also, men and women should have equal access to a universal pension, at whatever level it has been set, at a societal level.</p> <p>  I should point out that there is a high turnover of staff in the early childhood care sector, which is directly linked to the low wage levels and the difficult conditions associated with the sector in which people work long hours, have minimal breaks and where there is little sense of a socialised workplace.  A high turnover creates huge problems all of the time for individual providers.  What is needed is a similar career structure to the one in primary education, for example.  We also need high levels of quality care provided with attached qualifications and a career structure that encourages people to remain in the sector while having a lifetime of career development within it.</p> <p>  In terms of lone parents and what the early childcare system provides, we definitely need to have a system that provides not just for people to access paid employment but allows them to access all kinds of other areas of activity in their lives, which could mean involvement in their community or in education.  One of the gaps in the system concerns access to the grants system.  When a person decides to become a part-time student in further education and third level education, he or she has no access to the grants system.  Lone parents, in particular, are a group of people who would benefit from being able to be grant-supported in order to access part-time educational opportunities.  They are not alone in that regard but it is a cohort that would benefit from grants.</p> <p>  The ECCE system is not based on whether a person is in employment but is based on access to care as an entitlement in order that a person can access the ECCE scheme and then pursue a range of different activities.  The ECCE system is limited to three hours a day on five days a week and for 38 weeks in the year.  In Ireland, therefore, people who want to access a range of employment opportunities must add on to the ECCE system any paid hours within the cr&egrave;che facilities or whatever childminding system is being used.  ECCE is not a stand-alone system.  It is also not sufficient in terms of its hours and comprehensiveness, by which I mean it is not sufficient in terms of more expansive involvement in a range or wide definition of economic activity. </p> <p>  Finally, Commission President von der Leyen's has committed to introducing an EU care strategy by the end of 2022.  It would be interesting to see whether the kind of supports that have been associated with Barcelona, which instituted and supported the kind of ECCE system that we have here for early child care, are introduced, whether a much broader definition of care is introduced and whether the EU care system is more comprehensive.  If so, then that would be extremely valuable in terms of how the funding system worked.  For example, in Ireland there is a huge need to have supports from both EU and national levels for a process to decongregate the elder care system because congregated settings were shown to be highly vulnerable in lots of ways.  I mean that although the settings are congregated, they create systems of isolation.  We need both investment by the State and support from the EU to decongregate elder care settings into much more community-based systems.  When we talk about universal care, we do not need a completely top-down centralised State services system.  Universal care can be community-based services that are provided by local government, as in Scotland or wherever, yet support elder care and child care.  We can have models that involves participation in various different ways at community level, of which there are lots of positive examples in different countries.  </p></speech>

One of her questions was about building progression pathways.  That would require us to rethink training, and in particular the vocational education training system.  There are examples in the Nordic countries, which for years have had a much more expansive vocational educational training system that includes social care.  Their childcare models are also more integrated with an education system, which Dr. Barry mentioned.  The idea that one links childcare much more with models around a primary school teaching form of care would be one way to do it.  That also introduces progression and gives leadership opportunities, while at the same time gives people a sense of a skilled occupation.</p> <p>  Universal access is very important.  It is shown to be incredibly important in terms of childcare in other countries where one can see, in particular, differences in the employment rates for lone mothers and mothers in couples.  For example, Denmark, as a state, spends a much higher amount on universally accessible high-quality childcare.</p><p>There is a 14% differential in employment of lone mothers between that country and Ireland.  Those are two areas where you can take different models of state expenditure on those care aspects as examples.</p></speech>

I have a question for Dr. Murphy.  TASC's submission states the distribution of care work in society plays a central role in the formation of inequality between men and women.  The fact women provide an overwhelming amount of child, elder and other forms or care means they have often been excluded.  I presume TASC includes in that that they participate in a more limited way, as well as being excluded, or in a more difficult way in political, economic, voluntary, cultural and leisure activity.</p> <p>  I was thinking of interactions I have had with constituents in recent days about finding a childcare place and getting back to work.  If there was a risk, the danger fell to her and not him.  These are young couples who are committed to gender equality.  I am not trying to criticise all men.  When I speak to my constituents, the day-to-day disparity in the assumption of care responsibility between men and women comes up again and again.  I even see it in WhatsApp groups - "Hello Ladies".  Does Dr. Murphy know what I mean?  I see it all over the place in subtle things.  I see women going back to work who find it difficult to ensure the care responsibility they have assumed is now distributed more equally between partners.  It is not the case that because you earn more you do less in relation to family or anything else.</p> <p>  From a perception and social perspective, how do we convince and explain to men who think they are doing gender equality that there is more to do and it is a day-to-day thing?  It is not unique to Ireland as we have seen it across reports from the EU.  Frances Fitzgerald has pioneered work on this in the EU.  I am not saying anything unusual here, am I?</p></speech>

There is interesting research from the UK looking at how much change there was, when people were experiencing lockdown measures, in men doing routine household chores and care work for which women normally take responsibility.  The enforced working from home increased men's participation.  One aspect is being in the home for more time.  The other thing, on the social perspective and how to get men to do more of the routine caring that women do, is that incentives need to be in place.  They would either have to be educational qualifications or pay.</p></speech>

I can see Dr. Murphy struggling with the answer because it is difficult.  I even find it a difficult question to ask because the response is "I do this", "I do that" and so on.  Yet we have a broad problem not just in Ireland but across Europe.  It happens at different stages of life and in different ways.  It is not in all cases but in many, so much so that TASC put it in its submission, the EU is driving policy to highlight it post Covid, and so on.</p> <p>  What role for education, such as a different form of relationships and sexuality education, is in this for the next generation, even if it is too late for the women in my constituency to whom I have been speaking and for whom maybe nothing will change?  If anybody else wants to come in, I would be appreciative of their perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#J00700"><p>I suppose I should come in as an educator.  We should never underestimate the degree to which our current breadwinner system and our welfare, tax and education systems orientate a culture of female care.  Understanding how the present culture is constructed and maintained is important.  Some of the rules we talked about concerning eligibility systems for pensions reinforce in people's heads gendered differences in relation to the household, employment and the role of care.  We should not be surprised that we get the culture we get because we set out to make it in some respects.  That is why looking at the Constitution is important.  All those roles, norms and values permeate through our culture, education, churches, GAA or whatever and how we construct them.</p> <p>  If we look at what other societies have been trying to do, much of the time it is trying to find other policy tools to reorientate the culture, such as forcing the loss of parental leave in the family if it is not shared equally between the male and the female, as a start.  That only works if it is accompanied by other measures to try to change employers' attitudes to facilitating men to take care leave in the workplace.  It is the same with the idea of the four-day working week, which has much gender equality potential but tends not to be pushed in that context.  There are campaigns for a four-day week that are about working less to live more, but then there is a gender equality aspect that is kind of stitched on.  It could be about working less to care more.  Often the joined-up thinking is not there about how some good policy changes can be used to change culture.</p> <p>  On education, we talk a lot about integrating into our education system more focus on sustainability as a cultural shift so that our children and young people are orientated towards climate change.  We do not have that conversation about care but could if we chose to.  We are not quite there yet in terms of looking for the cultural value change.</p> <p>  In the song "The Town I Loved So Well", there is a line "While their men on the dole played [the women's] role" and they "laughed through the smoke and the smell".  That song really annoys me sometimes but there is a deeply embedded expectation of roles.</p> <p>  Some academic research is interesting on cultural shifts that happen when there is a major recession of big cultural change like the pandemic.  They are trying to see if one or two years of a shift in care roles brought about by a structural shift embed.  Some research shows it does not or that there are class differences in how it embeds.  When linked with more education and other shifts in culture, it changes and the shift in the care roles begins to be embedded in household practice when things return to normal.  Other research shows, particularly in working-class situations, that there was a reversion to the normalisation of gender roles when the structural shift went back to normal.</p></speech>

The Acting Chair is probably sick to the teeth of me giving the example of a constituent of mine who was working in a senior commercial firm.  She was a partner in that firm.  Consider the dynamic.  We are trying to get more women across the board in every organisation, especially commercial organisations, which have been so gendered in the past.  She took a three-day week and he remained at a five-day week to address the care needs of their two young children, instead of the blindingly obvious solution, which was two four-day weeks, with all the benefits of equality, pensions, opportunities, participation and the normalisation, in a commercial world, of a man requesting a four-day week for three years to address the care needs of his children.</p></speech>

We tend to have a commodified approach where we expect both parents to find care in the marketplace and both to work full time.  A different way of thinking about that might be two three-quarter jobs as the societal norm, where both expect to play some role in the home and to work for a certain amount of time.  They would also access some care in the care infrastructure that is available.</p><p>I would like to think that is where we could be shifting, but a lot of policy, including working time policy, welfare policy, taxation policy and care policy, needs to be going in the same direction.  I believe that is what Senator Higgins was talking about when she spoke about that macro welfare imagination.  It is a question of what the compass is pointing towards.  We have many good policies but we do not join them up in a vision of what we are trying to create as a culture or an ethic around care.  That is missing from the conversation sometimes, as is what the goal of all this is.  Is the goal a gender-neutral distribution of care between the family, the State and the market?  If it is, what do we need to do?  If we know where we are going, it is easier to start talking about how we get there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ursula Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#K00300"><p>Research across various countries has shown that when it comes to the care burden, which Professor Murphy mentioned, the management and organisation of household care needs in heterosexual couples come down to women, even when both parties in the couple are full-time employees.  There has been very little shift in the management, organisation, identification and hiring of care, so that responsibility comes down to the woman in the couple.  The research on that is very strong.  We recently introduced paternity leave, which is a very good thing.  At the same time, we are still operating on the basis there is six months' maternity leave and a number of weeks' paternity leave.  From the very outset, therefore, we structure care in such a way that the responsibility is assumed to be primarily the woman's.  That shift and change of culture will need time; it will not happen very quickly.  I believe there is evidence in the younger generation of more equal sharing of care responsibilities.  That is driven a lot by men's expectations of having closer connection to their children and child-rearing.  It is not just about women.</p> <p>  Another thing struck me in what Deputy Carroll MacNeill said.  I have been involved in a European level gender equality research network for many years.  One of the things that has fascinated me is that when care is talked about in the Nordic countries, Finland in particular, it is not to facilitate employment but in the context of the quality of care received.  That includes the care of young children.  The care of young children is not seen in the Nordic countries as a means to allow women to access paid work.  Rather, quality of care is seen as in the interests of the children, particularly those in working-class or disadvantaged areas.  It is seen as child-driven, not driven by employment policy.  That is quite an important distinction to make as to how our culture looks at the question of care.  There is less and less confidence the hybrid system people have been thinking may emerge from the pandemic will be the outcome and more and more of a tendency to go back to pre-pandemic normalisation.</p> <p>  However, the percentage of women in administrative or managerial jobs or in professional areas is increasing quite significantly in Ireland.  Women are achieving a level of seniority in those areas.  That will not go away and it will change the nature of the conversation at household level.  It changes the assumption that women's work is additional and looks at women's paid work on an equal basis.  I think that will shift.  Again, there is the matter of time.  Cultural shifts take time.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions from him and a couple from me.  I believe the following questions from Senator Warfield are for Dr. Murphy.  She spoke of the UNICEF target of 1% of GDP spend on childcare.  What is the social and the economic cost of not acting on that recommendation?  We always speak of these things as being a cost, but what is the cost of not increasing that level of investment?  Will Dr. Murphy explain the role she sees collective bargaining playing with reference to her opening statement and the listing of the low levels of pay received not only in what is one of our most vital services, namely, our childcare services, but also in our disability services?</p> <p>  Professor Murphy hit on something very important when she spoke of the compass and the pathway to defining care.  Given the impact it has on so many sectors across our society and our communities, if we do not have that shift in recognition of care, we will not be able to make any progress in a number of different areas.  It is not just one aspect that will be impacted by a lack of that pathway to recognising care.</p> <p>  Professor Murphy spoke of basic State services and the positive impact they could have on gender equality.  Trade unions have highlighted that even if some hybrid working model were to become much more commonplace across society, that would not remove the care burden or the care expectations on women at present, some of which, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has highlighted, have been assumed to be the responsibility of one adult in the household.  If Professor Murphy could address that point, it would be fantastic.</p> <p>  I will put another question to Dr. Murphy specifically.  There was talk of the breakdown of the segregation of women into care occupations and those very heavily gendered roles.  The committee has heard substantial statements from those who work in the education sector on the impact of the lack of availability of options, especially at secondary school level, on determining a career pathway, particularly for younger women.  In Dr. Murphy's experience, what is her opinion on the role of education, that is, not only formal education delivered in a formal setting but also the more societal education as to how we change the concept of the provision of care as a career?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#K00500"><p>I hope I have understood the question.  The point about care expectations goes back to the conversation we had about changing the culture of care and how that needs to happen over time.  To some degree, it is a question of how the conversation about care can be amplified and accelerated in order that the culture can be shifted more quickly.  I mentioned climate change and the degree to which we can see cultural values shift in respect of sustainability and people's personal and political roles in that regard.  One practical example happening on the campuses at the moment relates to consent and the culture around sexuality and personal responsibility for consent.  If we look at what we are trying to do there in creating those conversations and trying to force the pace of a cultural shift that may well be happening anyway but that we want to speed up, there are some quite valuable lessons.  They are not all positive in that it has been very hard to get male engagement among our student population in the consent framework that has been developed.  There are therefore some good policies and practices emerging but it is quite hard to make them work in practice and to get them going.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman referred to the appreciation of the real value of care.</p><p>It goes back to a question that perhaps Senator Higgins asked earlier about why care needs to be universal and the penny not perhaps fundamentally dropping.  At the moment, as Dr. Barry said, we frame it and our understanding in Ireland is as a sort of a labour market concept.  It helps people get back into work and that is a good thing.  The economy needs them.  It is like that old trope about how if you invest $1 you get back $7 with the local multipliers in the economy.  When we look at some of the evidence, however, taking all that aside and trying not to put it into an economic conversation, the question arises as to what the value is to the child of being cared for in a high quality environment and the degree to which care is a basic human need.  It is not even just a human right; it is more than that.  It is a basic need where if it not satisfied, a lot of the other developmental stages that a child might expect to go through into adulthood will never be fully formed or shaped.  It is fundamental to our well-being and how we understand our human society.  From that point of view, it is universal in that every child needs it.  It can be achieved in a number of ways.  It does not mean that every child needs to be in a formal care institution.  However, every child needs an investment in quality care and every family needs support in making sure every child gets that.  In that sense, it is a human right.</p><p> We need to create a cultural change around that understanding of what care is and why it is so important.  Perhaps we still have not quite got there yet.  As Dr. Barry said, our conversation is still very much framed around it being a labour market issue.  However, there is that issue of the cost of not doing it.  I am quite nervous of some of those conversations, to be honest, because they tend to point how the cost is counted.  &ldquo;Present day saved&rdquo; tends to be one of the great indicators for what is saved by not investing in children and we end up in a very delinquent framing of the children who do not get childcare and what happens.  Perhaps the cost of not doing it is more about social cost of not having a fully functioning and flourishing society to which we are all able to contribute and where we reach our full potential as human beings.  The cost of that society is huge if not everybody in society is able actually to contribute as much as they potentially could have at birth.  That is how we need to cost it, rather than go back and cost the number of welfare payments.  The way we do these economic costings brings us in the wrong direction and starts a wrong conversation for why we want to invest in care, so I am careful with those kind of answers.</p></speech>

It is a called the million-dollar man.  They counted up all he cost the state over the years because he did not get the right start in life.  It cost the state $1 million in New Zealand.  It backfired completely because it got into an anti-welfare discourse that this man was costing $1 million, which was never the intended point.  They meant that had this man been given a decent start in life, he would not be needing all of this stuff.  It was an argument for investment, not for drawing attention to the real cost.  Therefore, we need to be careful how we get at some of these things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emily Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#L00600"><p>I would fully agree with what Professor Murphy said on the framing of that.  It can sometimes be difficult to see what is going on with these cost-benefit analyses.  The major thing that comes out of research where there is greater investment would be that in terms of social shifts, which we covered here, which is a cultural shift in how we focus on quality of care, quality of care will be improved if it is built into educational, social and economic systems where it is seen to be invested in.  In addition, while we do not want to overplay too much the &ldquo;You invest here and then you see returns in this way&rdquo;, women&rsquo;s participation in the labour market will also be improved if there is greater access.  This is also important, not just from an economic model, but also culturally.  The next question asked was on secondary school education.  If younger people are seeing more varied roles that men and women are doing in society, this also shifts culture quite a bit.  Therefore, there is an important aspect to increasing women&rsquo;s employment in particular.</p></speech>

There is a man in my constituency who I would know quite well whose career is a carer.  That is his job and what he does.  He would also have caring responsibilities outside of his job.  However, his employer has come to him repeatedly to take on additional work because the clients they work with, particularly older men, would prefer to have care provided by a man.  Despite this, we fail to value that and respect, in some ways, the asks of that older man to have as a care provider somebody to whom he feels he can relate more.  I believe this was touched on earlier as well, but I often wonder if we are doing our men a great disservice in some regards when we do not give them the information or opportunities to value care.  As a society, we want them to do that.  We want, as a society, to change our opinion of care.  However, that does not just involve change in care from a female perspective.  It also involves change in care from societal perspectives, both male and female.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Barry want to come in on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ursula Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#L00800"><p>Yes.  I very much agree there is huge value in focusing on men, men&rsquo;s opportunity to care, men&rsquo;s entitlement to care and then the policies that support men&rsquo;s access to care.  That is very important.  There a constant issue around the idea of what is the downside if we do not provide it.  There was a very interesting piece of work done during the pandemic by Susan Himmelweit and a second author, who I cannot remember.  They looked at the difference between investing in care and investing in construction and the returns.  It was one of those economic benefit models.  Investing in care in highly labour intensive and investing in construction is less labour intensive.  They argued that investing in care created 3.5 times more returns in the economy than investing &euro;1 in the construction industry.  They did a comparison across many different countries.  It was very interesting but it was very much an economic benefit model.  That benefit was seen in terms of employment and the narrow ways in which our economies work.</p> <p>  As pointed out earlier, it is like we value what goes through the marketplace.  For example, Professor Murphy emphasised environmental sustainability.  If we generate a better environment, such as more blue flag beaches or whatever, that is not valued in economic terms because it is not a market-based addition to our environment.  Many things around the environment are not market-based and market-valued.  Therefore, they are, again, marginal to our policy system in the way care is.  We have to look at a wider way of measuring economic and social well-being.</p> <p>  Somebody pointed out that there is an amount of work being done on that by the UN with the human development index.  In Europe, there is a gender equality index, for example.  However, at the same time, the main drivers are still GNP and GDP and they are core to how we value any additional activity, whether it is on care or in relation to the environment.  Until that shifts, at least to a significant degree, it is very hard to see the wider socio-cultural context in which care and the environment are evaluated.  It is hard to see them shifting.</p></speech>

We always talk about much more positive things in this room.  There are two things that I wanted to touch on.  There is much in the recommendations about childcare and caring that speaks to a better society as opposed to just achieving gender equality.  In this committee, we have to think about what we can deliver to focus on the issues of gender equality, which is ultimately our role.  The wording of a constitutional amendment will be one issue.  Perhaps the witnesses have not given it much consideration.  There are recommendations about the proposed wording for how caring is treated.  Have the witnesses reflected on that?  Do they think it is valued within the overall proposals?  We have had many discussions here about creating a hierarchy of inequality by mentioning different groups, which we try to avoid.  We had a discussion about caring and recognising the different types of caring.  Are the witnesses happy with the wording that came out of the report and how caring is reflected by it?</p> <p>  My second question is about the exit mechanisms from caring.  There are many people who provide childcare, care for an older relative or somebody with a disability.  Their circumstances might change and they reach a point where they finish their time of providing care.  Our social welfare system often treats people who are applying for carer's allowance like they are getting some sort of State bonus instead of recognising that they are contributing towards a cost that the State would otherwise incur.  It is remarkable how the HSE and social workers do not automatically link the provision of a carer's allowance with an overall package that is provided to somebody who is exiting hospital.  That is a separate point.  Many people leave caring and want to go back into the job market or some form of training and education.  There is not an easy transition for many of those people.  Have the witnesses given any consideration to that?</p> <p>  I return to the Acting Chairman's point about the representation of men in many professions.  We have talked about teaching and how that impacts perceptions of particular professions by both male and female students.  Whether it involves family members or people being cared for, is there a perception that a gender is the preferred gender for caring?  Have the witnesses considered how education and training boards, ETBs, and other training agencies could proactively encourage more people into those professions that have lower representation?  During the recession, I saw many men who might have been involved in construction or other professions, who never considered caring as an option before, go into it because of changes in the market and really enjoy it.  The Acting Chairman talked about older men perhaps being more comfortable with personal care being provided by a man.  Do the witnesses have practical examples of how we might be able to do that?  I apologise.  There were a lot of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#M00300"><p>I will address the latter part of what the Deputy spoke about.  I have many practical examples, since I spent the past three years looking at the public employment services and at how narrow the model of public employment services, PES, is.  It is focused on quick progression into the first job.  It is coupled with a conditional welfare system that makes people go in that direction.  We have argued for and given detailed proposals for a thing called the model of enabling employment guidance, MEEG, instead of PES.  Enablement refers to the concept that services wherever a citizen comes to the system, whether in the ETB, the Department, Intreo, JobPath, and local employment services, should be able to enable them to navigate their lives.  The services should provide navigational agency and give them the tools to step back.  They can say that they were construction workers but if somebody would discuss it with them, they would consider doing something different if given the space and time to figure out what it means, instead of being told that it has been advertised, that they can get the job tomorrow and then the service can meet its target and everything will be fine.</p> <p>  There are clear proposals about reorienting public employment services more generally in a labour market that will change all the time, with artificial intelligence and with climate transition.  A number of jobs will be emptied out because of their sustainability impact. and we will be creating new forms of employment.  Citizens have to be enabled to manage that transition.  It requires a new take on our institutions in order that they are more enabling, adaptable and flexible than we allow them to be.  Workers in a local employment service will say that they have to do what the computer states and that it says "No" to them.  The conversation they are allowed to have with the claimant is narrow and demands immediate action.  It is about getting onto the next bus; not about telling people about the superb opportunities to reskill, retrain, rethink and reimagine who they could be in the next 40 years.  The work has been done in that regard and there are ideas about how to change those systems to make them better.</p> <p>  There are many examples of other countries with better guidance systems, both in adult education and the labour market programmes, which have a wider view of how one can enable people to get into the right space and to understand how the future will shift.  Obviously, we do not know this fully but we have enough information about sectors that might diminish or those that might grow, as well as what we might need to orient people towards.</p></speech>

I will address the representation of men in care work.  The Deputy asked for an example.  Research has shown that once they are in care work, it is deemed to be fulfilling work for many people.  It is interesting to consider how to encourage more men to take that step towards a care occupation.  It comes back to a question posed earlier about the role of collective bargaining.  To encourage more men to go into care occupations, some of which need to be professionalised further, one would have to change the conditions of the job to make it more attractive.  This includes scheduling, which we have not discussed much, including work hours.  It also includes accounting for the skills required and whether there are professional pathways.  There is a role for education and training, particularly vocational training systems, to increase the perception that there is a career in caring, as opposed to it being a job with bad hours and bad pay.</p></speech>

We would see change if we had home care packages that were linked to better conditions of work.  Home care systems in Ireland have gone backwards.  We have casualised them and have taken them out of the public system and instead we have individual, self-employed people in the care area, with very poor conditions.  The new care packages that the Government has been promising for home-based care need to be structured in a way that would encourage men to enter the care system and open the possibility of men caring for elderly people.  Men from outside Ireland have a high profile in work in the care sector in Ireland, including nursing and home care.</p><p>In Ireland, we have not crossed that bridge to any great extent.</p><p> Another thing we need to think about is the many ways in which we put ceilings on earnings, such as through earnings disregards.  In this regard, a carer is allowed to earn only X amount in addition to that earned from caring.  We need to change that.  There is no reason to establish these kinds of ceilings.  If we use the tax system intelligently, we do not have to put a ceiling on the earnings a person can have alongside the social welfare he or she may be claiming.  These kinds of ceilings need to be broken.</p><p> It was very interesting to note the hierarchies we created within the welfare system during the pandemic.  Those on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, were paid at quite a high level whereas those on the jobseeker's allowance were paid at a much lower level.  It was recognised when the PUP was established that the amount of money in question was needed weekly to adequately support somebody's independent living but the jobseeker's payment is significantly lower.  Now that the PUP is gone, we are back down to the level of the jobseeker's payment.  It is interesting to note how much of a hierarchy we created in our highly fragmented welfare system.</p><p> Regarding the Constitution and care, there was a recommendation on gender equality and having non-discrimination built into the Constitution by way of a clause.  Second, it was recommended that the language of the Constitution be changed so women would not be assumed to be carers or have a domestic role.  If accepted, we would talk in terms of parents, rather than women in this context.  Other kinds of reforms considered were more specific to the statutory legislation and social welfare protection than anything else.</p><p> The third recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly was to have non-gender-specific language and to oblige the State to take reasonable measures to support care within the home and wider community.  It did not state anything more than that because the Constitution is really about framing general principles.  It is up to statute law to get to the specifics, as far as I would understand it.  To get to the specifics of a care system that is well structured and encourages both men and women to share caring responsibilities, it is down to what statutory law provides for; the Constitution is for more general framing.</p></speech>

I have just a couple.  I wish to pick up on where the conversation left off.  If any of the witnesses have further thoughts on the Constitution element, we would be very interested in hearing them.  We have examined the constitutional issues a lot from a legal perspective but, of course, they have significant implications for social policy, legislation and the kinds of measures put in place.  While the detail would not be in the Constitution, the citizens were really clear that they want a reasonable-efforts or reasonable-measures requirement to be imposed on the State in respect of its offering of support.  The citizens' recommendations on care and social protection attempt to envisage or provide an example of what the reasonable measures might be; however, the core aspect is that there would be a requirement on the State and that recognition would not be solely symbolic but, rather, have effect.  That was really clear.  If any of the witnesses have thoughts on this, we would welcome them.  It is significant because the exact wording has implications.</p> <p>  The implications in the past were such that there was, under the protections of the Constitution, a different requirement for lone parents than for those who were married.  I refer to there not having been a core requirement regarding full-time availability on social protection, whereas there was for lone parents once the child reached the age of 14.  This is an example of where we need to look at the big picture and to the effects, which can be very specific.</p> <p>  I have one question on the big picture and a couple on the other element.  I agree on the recognition of care and its importance.  There is a dilemma whereby, although you want the care to be recognised and valued, it is not simply about putting a monetary value on each hour.</p> <p>It is about the latter in terms of employment and, perhaps, participation, but it cannot be about these alone because many of the dividends come out in other places.  We talked about both the dangers and benefits.  The general social benefit is 3.5 times the individual benefit.  In my first question, I was referring to the cost of care.  This is not about the idea of the million-dollar man or that kind of thing; it is more about the fact that, at the moment, care does have a cost.  It benefits society in an amorphous way, in that the overall benefit, which is 3.5 times greater, may not be felt by the individuals giving the care but the cost is very much borne by individuals.  Therefore, individuals carry a huge cost.  In that regard, one of the interesting ways of measuring I have heard about is in terms of time poverty.  I mentioned that deprivation is an issue.  Is it a matter of using social indicators related to levels of deprivation and time poverty as measures if individuals are effectively carrying the cost of care even though society is getting the general benefits?</p> <p>  I am very interested in what has been done in Buenos Aires and a few other places around the world.  They have started measuring time poverty because it interlinks with economic poverty and particularly affects those who are parenting alone.  Have the witnesses thoughts on that?</p> <p>  Rewarding care in the ecological sense represents a really interesting frame.  It is actually crucial.  Rather than just having carbon markets as one blunt measure in respect of the environmental action, ecological care may be a little more amorphous, as was said.  Things like a clean beach or a thriving ecosystem are not as unitable as are carbon markets.  That is why I believe in rewarding people for how they spend their time arises.  The participation piece is interesting because it recognises time as an input into the world, not just an output.</p> <p>  I want to return to the cost aspect and the inequalities in the current system.  I acknowledge we have talked about a universal pension, which is what the citizens want.  However, I am concerned about what is to happen in the interim, or right now.  Even the Pensions Commission report, for example, does not include the approximately &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.4 billion spent on private pension tax relief.  The commission did not consider that; that was a separate area of consideration.  Then we had these conversations about what we could afford or not in terms of care and fixing the care or a universal pension. </p> <p>  In a way, our social protection system is meant to be distributive and that is why the idea of filtering out the very wealthy is fair.  The social welfare system is meant to be redistributive in terms of raising our general social floor but at the moment our economic system it is redistributive upwards, whereby those on the very highest incomes are getting supplemented by way of tax relief on their private pensions to an amount substantially similar to, if not quite equal to, the amount being spent to address the care deficit in the pensions system, for example.  We need to be naming these issues.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the danger if we opt for a 40-year contributory system.  Again, I believe we should have a universal pension.  However, if we move to a 40-year system, with only 20 years recognised for care, we could trap many women again in that they would be paying for the cost of care.  That would be an inequality.</p><p>I want to have that conversation about the universal side of it, because that is where we need to go, but I also want to make sure we as a committee acknowledge and tackle measures that are reinforcing care inequality and putting the cost of care onto women.</p></speech>

The Citizens' Assembly looked at the cost of subsidising private pensions.  There is a lot of discussion about how our public expenditure system works but the costing of tax reliefs is not central in that discussion a lot of the time.  The cost can be incredibly high and therefore the benefits are very high to those in middle and higher income parts of society.  It was also interesting that, with regard to the environment and the retrofitting of homes, the Government decided to establish one-stop shops where people could get all the different things, such as for their attic and windows, and there would be an overall costing and an overall level of subsidisation.  One thing our welfare system does have is a structured system that is clear as to what the entitlements are for individuals or households in different situations.  We definitely do not have a one-stop shop and we could go down that road.</p> <p>  Collective bargaining is important.  At the moment there are discussions about going back into the national wage agreement and looking at the impact of inflation on working people's wages.  Those from the trade union side have said they are also interested in what kind of services would be supported.  It is not just about what the wage levels are set at but what other kinds of public services are supported that would amount to a better quality of life.  The trade unions are quite conscious of that process and I hope that will carry right through the negotiations.  It is quite important that it happens like that.</p></speech>

I used to sit on the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and it was a long battle to get that cost of disability report by Indecon published.  It is being looked at now with regard to those invisible costs that get carried by people who have a disability.  It might be interesting for us to get that report in terms of recognising some of the individual costs associated with care.</p></speech>

It would be interesting to see the breakdown in families in countries where men do more care.  At the moment there is not just time poverty but very gendered allocations of time within families.  It is a very interesting aspect to bring into the discussion.  I would be in favour of that.  As a society, we want to move towards more equal time shares between different activities and not men being seen to do more of an activity versus women.  That would be an interesting change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022052600002#O00600"><p>I will start with the time issue.  There is a concept called temporal deprivation, which Tony Fitzpatrick did a lot of work on about ten years ago.  He spoke about the ways social policy could engage with the concept of time deprivation.  It fits into those kinds of ideas of participation income and recognising the other socially valued ways people choose to spend their time.  These things have logic in their communities and their lives but may not fit in with a very narrow understanding of added value in a GNP sense.  We are getting at some of that with things like the artists' basic income pilot.  Artists are spending their time doing socially valued activity and they should be supported by society, through the State, to do that.  Some of those ideas are starting to percolate through to policy.  It is about rewarding people for how they spend their time.  Translating that from arts and culture into ecological activity or care activity is not such a huge step.  A woman in France, Sophie Swaton, is doing a lot of work on what she calls ecological transition income.  This is time spent cleaning the beach.  She wants to reward people for the ecological time they put into being a good citizen from a sustainability point of view.  There are some lovely ideas that are grouped around the concept of rewarding people for socially useful work.  All of that points towards that participation income space.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right about the tax relief.  I used to think, in my innocence, that if we could name the figure people would be so shocked that it would work.  Now I understand that it is going to take a lot more than that.  There is &euro;2.4 billion going out in the discretionary pension tax relief and that is so inequitably gendered in terms of who benefits from it from a male-female perspective.  However, &euro;15 billion is going out overall in discretionary tax reliefs and it is the same gendered distribution in who benefits from it.  That &euro;15 billion would fund so much.  Even if we reduced it so people were only allowed discretionary tax relief at 15% and they could keep a bit because of the economic arguments, there is still loads that could be done in that space.  I do not understand why that does not have more traction as a political issue because it seems blatantly obvious to me.</p> <p>  Going back to the constitutional question, one of the lessons we learned from repeal is that we should not be putting something into the Constitution unless we are really sure of it.  Less is more with constitutions.  We have learned a lot about that and paid a high price for putting things in.  Having said that, this is clearly an opportunity to put value on care and promote the idea of the State's obligation to care.  Care has a very wide social value because otherwise we would narrow the concept of it.  It is that idea of a careful State.  With the trade unions beginning to ask about services in the context of collective bargaining, there is an increasing understanding that the services and income together make up the package through which people have to mediate their lives.  Universal basic services, participation income and quality wages for care in the mainstream labour market together cover quite a broad spectrum of where we would like the State umbrella to be with regard to care.  That might give some sort of framework for thinking about this.  I will not mention any specific policies but maybe we can think about the concept of the State's obligation to be a careful State and provide the umbrella of services and income that people need to value the time they spend on care.</p></speech>

I will ask one final question before I bring the meeting to a close.  I would like to touch on the &euro;2.4 billion in tax relief for pensions and the &euro;15 billion Professor Murphy mentioned.  This might be going slightly outside the frame of today's discussion.  What is Professor Murphy's opinion on the importance of gender-based budgeting?</p></speech>

Some of the work shows that it is very hard to make it work in a practical way, where there is added value from the process and you can point to things that changed because of gender budgeting, whether policies or budget allocations.  I have some experience of trying to do some gender budgeting and I think there is great learning to be gotten from it.</p><p>I think it gives a real appreciation of the nature of how we design policy and the sometimes implicit gendered distribution implications of a policy, that unless you do gender budgeting or gender proofing more broadly you simply can never understand.  It is really important.  There have been some advances in respect of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the infrastructure of the State in this regard but we are still in the ha'penny place on the level of investment that is needed in it.  Let us consider the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and its level of resourcing to do what is considered to be fiscal proofing.  What kind of infrastructure does the State need to have to really do gender-equality budgeting in a meaningful way so that we can really draw out enough lessons for it to actually impact on the decisions we are making about policy and budget allocation?  There is a lot in that space.  We have some demonstrable shift in what we are doing but we have a long way to go.</p></speech>

Please note that to limit the spread of Covid-19, people are encouraged to wear masks.  Everybody is aware of that.</p> <p>  We rotate the rota at every meeting so that every party gets an opportunity to contribute.  Sinn F&eacute;in will have the first slot, followed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the SDLP, Alliance, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Independents, Aont&uacute; and so on.  Each slot will last for 15 minutes.  Committee members are free to comment on anything they wish.</p> <p>  Today we have the first meeting of our architects of the Good Friday Agreement project.  We will be meeting a range of people involved in negotiations, including politicians and officials.  On behalf of the committee, I warmly welcome Mr. Tim O'Connor to the meeting and thank him for attending.  Mr. O'Connor is a former senior diplomat who was a part of the Irish Government delegation at the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  He was inaugural joint secretary of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh from 1999 to 2005.  He was Consul General of Ireland in New York from 2005 to 2007.  He was also Secretary General to the President from 2007 to 2010.  I met Mr. O'Connor in a few of those capacities.  I must say he is held in the highest esteem in Ireland and America.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  Such witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on that matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p> <p>  Some committee members are attending online.  They will appear on the screen.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  Everybody knows the story there.</p> <p>  I now call Mr. O'Connor to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am honoured to have been asked to address the committee.  It is an important project the committee is undertaking and we are grateful for it.</p> <p>  I submitted a copy of my statement to the committee ahead of time.</p><p>I will go through its main points.  I am a retired civil servant.  I should say that I am from Killeedy, near Newcastle West, in west Limerick.  I went to school in St. Munchin's in Limerick, then onto Maynooth, where I was a seminarian for a few years before leaving.  I taught for a number of years and then joined the Civil Service in 1974.  I was a civil servant from 1974 to 2010.  I spent most of that time working in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In 1986, I started working directly on Northern Ireland when I was assigned to the Northern Ireland division for the first time.  That was 36 years ago.  In some kind of way, I have been privileged to continue working on it since then.  As a public servant, there is no bigger issue to be involved with than the peace process in one's own country.</p><p> As the Chairman will understand, I should make clear that I am speaking in a personal capacity today.  The views that I express are very much my own.  I am not speaking in any official capacity.  I should also declare that even though I am retired, I was called back into field around five years ago, when the Government appointed me to be the Irish Government nominee on the four-member Independent Reporting Commission, IRC, on paramilitarism.  It is a role that I still hold, so I have partial official capacity, but I am here today in a personal capacity.  </p><p> I am happy to talk through my submission to the committee.  There is lots to talk about.  The subject the committee is undertaking is a profoundly important one and a rich one.  To cut to the chase in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, my direct involvement restarted in the autumn of 1997, when the, now sadly, late Dermot Gallagher brought me back into the Northern Ireland division.  I do not know how many of the members here knew Dermot Gallagher but he was a tremendous public servant.  He died prematurely in 2017.  In 1997 and 1998, he was the second Secretary General in the Department of Foreign Affairs, overseeing Northern Ireland.  He was my boss and my mentor.  I want to take a moment to state how profound his contribution was to all of this.</p><p> On the picture I was trying to paint of where we were in the autumn of 1997, some major developments had happened in the course of the previous few months.  Chronologically, Tony Blair was appointed Prime Minister in London in May 1997, in June 1997 a new Government was formed in Dublin, with former Deputy Bertie Ahern being appointed Taoiseach, and in July 1997, the IRA ceasefire was restored.  Talks had been taking place in Belfast since the previous summer but Sinn F&eacute;in was not part of them because of the breakdown of the ceasefire.  With the restoration of the ceasefire and two new Governments in place, there was a sense of a new momentum.  In September 1997 what proved to the final stages of the talks process got under way, chaired by US Senator George Mitchell, with all the parties involved.</p><p> Next, I wish to highlight the centrality of the role of the two Governments in the process.  The key point is that the two Governments, led by the principals, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, worked together.  In my submission, I have listed the various key people involved in the process.  The process was driven at the level of the two Governments, with the principals being supported by their Ministers and officials, with both sides working together.  If I am feeding into the work of the committee, I would say that the lesson and the key point is the centrality of the two Governments working together.  This was physically manifested, during the negotiations, when the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach would arrive and would immediately go to the same room and sit beside each other.  I often used the analogy that they were like brothers.  For me, as a civil servant watching it, it was fascinating.  If we were doing a workshop on negotiation, that would be a key requirement.  Of course, on both sides, as civil servants of the British and Irish Governments, we took our cue from that and worked very closely together.</p><p> On the strategic approach of the two Governments, everybody knew in the autumn of 1997 that we were in a serious process.  I must be clear that there was no great consensus that we were on the march to an agreement.  Many of the members probably know the old joke about the new journalist joining the Northern Ireland press pool.  The old hands, with the cigarettes, would say to the new journalist: "My friend, be pessimistic and you will not be far wrong."  Pessimism ruled, among ourselves as well, but we could not afford to have that dictate things.  I will put it like this: there was no history of agreement.  The Sunningdale agreement had collapsed after a few months.  In fairness, the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 was a very important agreement but it engendered enormous opposition from unionism.  We had never had a situation where all the parties were around the table with a chance of agreement.  The stakes were very high and the likelihood of success was small.  However, there was a view that we had a once-in-a-generation chance.  The old hands remembered back to when everybody was around the table in the Sunningdale negotiations, but that had been 24 years prior to 1997.  That is how long it took to get back around the table.  The stakes were high and we felt that we had to deliver.  </p><p> I like the word "architecture" that is being used by the committee.  The architecture of the Good Friday Agreement was a bit different.  At one level, it was building on previous work, which was an important piece of the architecture.  We were not starting from a blank sheet.  We were building on what had been developed in Sunningdale and in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Some of the concepts were there.  We were also doing some things that were different.  One thing that was different was the level of inclusion.  Every major dimension of society was reflected in the approach.  It is true that the DUP did not attend negotiations, and that was a gap, but unionism was strongly represented.  Of course, the parties representing the constituencies of the combatants, as it were, were around the table in a way that had never happened before.  The process was inclusive.  The agenda that was on the table, which was being driven by George Mitchell and the two Governments, was comprehensive.  I will return to the point shortly when we are discussing themes.  The idea was that most people were around the table and most issues were on the table.  That was a key part of the architecture of the agreement.  </p><p> I note that Ms Claire Hanna MP is in attendance.  I must give credit to the SDLP input from John Hume on the idea of a joint referendum, North and South, which was a critical piece.  It was very novel and powerful.  It meant that there would be a validation of the work, at the end of the negotiations, by the people North and South.  It was a profound idea.  Of course, John Hume's contribution to the architecture was priceless.  I had the privilege of just being around him and seeing him operate and think, as well as keeping out of his way.  If we are talking about architecture, he was undoubtedly a key designer in terms of the concepts that he developed over many years.  I have also taken the liberty to include a note in my submission about Seamus Mallon.  I had the privilege, as a civil servant, to work very closely with Seamus Mallon and John Hume, but with Seamus in particular, because I happened to be the person from the Department of Foreign Affairs who was liaising with him over many years.  Even after we both retired and were no longer soldiers, as it were, we stayed in close contact.  I had the privilege of being with him for the writing of his book and sadly, of attending his funeral in January 2020, and indeed, of giving the eulogy at the service.  Members can imagine what that relationship was like.  I had the privilege of just being around and seeing the contributions made in the process.</p><p>My point is it took a village.  People ask me who was the most important person in the Good Friday Agreement process and I gently say that is the wrong question, because this took a village.  If we are trying to find one person responsible for it, we are on the wrong track.  It took a range of people and at any given time, there were moments where certain people were fundamental and critical to getting through it.  Without that, we would have had no agreement.</p><p> I have listed people all the way through.  They include George Mitchell, Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair, clearly, as well as their Ministers.  There was David Trimble, John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, David Ervine, David McAdams and Gary McMichael.  I saw these people at different moments and there were others as well.  It would be like reciting a decade of the rosary to go through their names.  There were people behind the scenes, and I am not talking about myself.  There is a bunch of people.  The point is there was much input.  What was shared was that this was a big opportunity and we could not let it pass.  That was the sense.</p><p> I also suggest in my note that there was an outer circle of support beyond the village.  The Cathaoirleach's brother, Niall, comes into this and Irish America played a major part in the build-up to all of this and creating the conditions.  I mention Senator Ted Kennedy, Ms Jean Kennedy Smith and Congressman Bruce Morrison, Niall O'Dowd and Bill Flynn, among others.  The danger when we start mentioning names is that people will say they were not named and I appreciate that is a problem.  The role of the community of Irish America, as well as those in Congress, was important.  There is a congressional delegation here now led by Congressman Richard Neal and although he may have been too young then, he has played a subsequent role.  There was also the White House and having Bill Clinton there was critical.  He gave us George Mitchell.  The point is it would be wrong in describing the architecture not to mention this outer circle.</p><p> I should also mention the EU.  John Hume was huge in promoting the idea that the EU is the greatest example of conflict resolution in human history, which is right.  We drew on the EU model both as an inspiration for conflict resolution and as a model for its institutions, with the PEACE programme and the financial support we got from member states and the Commission.  The EU was a very big part of the outer circle of support around us.</p><p> I am very happy to speak to the key issues, although I do not wish to overindulge.  This is what I mean when I speak of the comprehensive nature of issues.  We shied away from nothing when we had key issues on the table.  They included constitutional questions and the three sets of relationships.  It was something that was developed by John Hume, namely, the concept that the heart, there were three sets of relationships that needed to be resolved and reflected institutionally.  There was a key range of issues arising from the conflict, including reform of policing and justice, rights issues and equality safeguards and validation and review.  We built in the idea that there should be an opportunity for review of the agreement if difficulties arose.  I have just mentioned validation.</p><p> There were a number of architectural issues we could not crack and on which we could not get agreement around the table.  Two of these in particular were the detail on North-South co-operation and policing.  They were so radioactive and difficult at the time, it bested us.  The strategy agreed was that we would devise principles around both.  There would be principles around North-South co-operation with the detail being done in a further process down the road with a six-month backstop, if I can use that word.  It was to happen by 31 October so the process would not be open-ended.  People would agree to something without knowing the detail in an open-ended process otherwise.  As we could not get agreement on the detail of policing, it was agreed that a commission would be established, which subsequently became the Patten commission.  The agreement has terms of reference for that commission.</p><p> In architecture terms, it is interesting that sometimes if you cannot crack a very difficult issue, there is the possibility of doing what we did.  We got agreement on the principles involved but, in a way, we made a bet that having agreed the principles, people would not break on the detail.  That is a big risk in signing off but it is what we did.</p><p> I mention in my conclusion the technical fact that there were two agreements on Good Friday.  There was the multi-party agreement, of which I have a dog-eared copy, that involved multi-party negotiations.  It was between the parties and the Governments.  At the back is a second agreement called "Agreement Between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland".  Incidentally, this was the first time this language was used as well and we agreed on how we would refer to each other.  Previously it was the "British Government" and the "Republic of Ireland".  We could not find agreement on words but we agreed to do it like that.  The agreement signed by Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair essentially comprised the commitments made by the two Governments in the overall agreement, particularly around constitutional issues.</p><p> I thank the Cathaoirleach for indulging me.  The main goal of the Good Friday Agreement was to stop the violence and at least give peace a chance.  We wanted to build peace and promote reconciliation.  Any fair-minded verdict would be that it has succeeded so far in stopping the violence.  It has given an honourable and inclusive pathway forward for everybody.  I live in the real world, however, and I know the difficulties that clearly remain.  I call this a work in progress.</p><p> I use an analogy of human health with conflict.  If conflict is a disease, the agreement or deal is a surgical intervention.  There is surgery to deal with the disease.  As we all know in major surgery, it is not just done with the next day and there is a long process of rehabilitation and recuperation.  There can be setbacks and the committee might know where I am going with the analogy.  Sometimes after five, ten or 15 years, surgeons may have to intervene again.  This is what a real and living peace process looks like in all its messy complexity.</p><p> Our generation was lucky to finally find the means and ways to get agreement and I am very happy to speak about the mechanics of the process, including the days and weeks around it, including Good Friday itself.  We came very close to not having agreement.  The difference between having an agreement and not having one is night and day.  I feel very lucky that we were there, having been able to observe it at close quarters and play whatever part I could.  The committee's work is very important and it bothers me a little that we forget what we did.  Just like with human health, if we ignore what we should be doing with recovery and well-being, we will pay a price.</p></speech>

It has been very enlightening.  His integrity and hard work is outstanding, as was the work of his Department.  He acknowledged all his peers in the Department.</p> <p>  What struck me most in those comments is the relationship between the two Prime Ministers of the time, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern.  It was critical and once it gelled, peace flowed from it.  There is something we can learn from that.</p> <p>  On a personal note, Mr. O'Connor mentioned my brother, Niall.  My contribution to the peace process was driving him to meet Ms Jean Kennedy Smith at midnight at the American Embassy on some occasions.</p></speech>

In policing, we have moved on now and things have got so much better.  It is still imperfect but it is a lot better than it had been previously.  Unfortunately, North-South relationships are still extremely difficult.  I am sure Mr. O'Connor is still following politics in the North and knows that the North-South Ministerial Council has not been able to meet because the DUP has vetoed those arrangements.  He will also be aware of the difficulties we are having around maintaining the North-South bodies.</p> <p>  This committee met Waterways Ireland in Enniskillen a couple of weeks ago.  We were talking to the CEO, Mr. John McDonagh, who spoke about the cap on numbers and about the fact the organisation is not able to grow.  He was able to show us statistics on the work that Waterways Ireland is doing in Ireland in comparison with work being done in Spain, Scotland, Portugal or England, which clearly shows the organisation is very under-resourced, both financially and in terms of staffing.</p> <p>  I would have imagined 25 years ago, when we were talking about all of this stuff, that by now there would be a much wider range of areas of co-operation, more North-South bodies, a lot less duplication of service on the island of Ireland and that we would have moved on considerably.  What is Mr. O'Connor's view on that?  How does he see us overcoming the current difficulties?</p></speech>

It was very good of her to come along in the circumstances.  I thank her for her kind comments.  I also have very good memories.</p> <p>  In terms of the Good Friday Agreement, as everyone here is aware, in politics there is always the next thing.  Straight away, one is on to the next thing.  Even after Good Friday itself, on the Easter weekend we got a couple of night's sleep but then it was straight into the referendum.  A campaign had to be run and there was a huge body of work to be done for the referendum on 22 May.  Then we were straight into dealing with the North-South issues.  As I said earlier, there was only agreement in principle.  We just had a shell of what North-South would look like.</p> <p>  I was appointed by Mr. Dermot Gallagher - Lord have mercy on him - to be the foreign affairs person to drive the North-South negotiations on what these cross-Border bodies would be, working with Mr. Wally Kirwan.  I thank the Chairman for his kind words about the Department and about other colleagues.  I am the one sitting here today but there was a whole village of civil servants involved.  A huge amount of work was done by so many of my colleagues.  We had to set off on the road to getting agreement.  Mr. Kirwan, Mr. Rory Montgomery, Mr. James McIntyre and I went off on what we called a "caravan" whereby we went to all of the Departments in the summer of 1998 to gather up ideas for these cross-Border bodies that would make sense and would work out.  In September we began negotiations with the British.  We had to work out what North-South was going to look like and what the bodies would be.  A whole process had to be gone through and that ended up in agreement in March 1999.  Legislation then had to be put through the D&aacute;il and Seanad to bring these bodies into being.  They were then parked for eight or nine months until the difficulties in the implementation of the agreement were resolved.  I am sure Ms Gildernew will recall the sound bite, "No guns, no Government".  In December, Ms Gildernew and her colleagues were about to become Ministers.  Everything came into being on 2 December 1999 - the assembly, the Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the cross-Border bodies.  I was sent to Armagh.  I had to take ownership of what we had designed and go from wholesale to retail, so to speak, by actually setting up the bodies, including Waterways Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  I did that for five and a half years in Armagh.</p> <p>  I was there at the very beginning of setting up all of the things Ms Gildernew is talking about now.  I said at the time that the architecture was really important.  In fact, Mr. David Trimble used that phrase.  History shows, and it is largely agreed, that Sunningdale came down because of the Council of Ireland and the fact there was no agreement on that.  There may have been other issues too but that was certainly a big one.  We got the North-South Ministerial Council and the cross-Border bodies up and running under the Good Friday Agreement.  Mr. Trimble was asked once why we were able to get cross-Border co-operation going this time and not previously.  He said that in the Good Friday Agreement we got the architecture right.  What he meant by that was the checks and balances.  As Ms Gildernew knows, we have accompanying Ministers, all decisions by agreement and so on.</p> <p>  That architecture has broadly worked.  As to whether the glass is half full or half empty, what we got going and what has been established in cross-Border co-operation over the past 20 years has been very important and valuable.  Tremendous work is being done by Tourism Ireland and Waterways Ireland.  For the first time, the island of Ireland is being marketed by a single body.  Tourism has had a very positive impact.  Obviously Covid has affected it but, broadly speaking, tourism is regarded as a major sector.  I am sure all members of this committee can see that in their respective constituencies.  That has been driven for the past 20 years by a cross-Border body, Tourism Ireland.</p> <p>  We used to say there is only one thing worse than not getting what you wish for and that is getting what you wish for.  When the first chief executive of Tourism Ireland, Mr. Paul O'Toole, was appointed by the North-South Ministerial Council, I congratulated him and said, "No pressure now."  In the negotiations we used tourism all of the time as a clear example of an area where it just made no sense to be doing things separately and where it made perfect sense to be doing things together.  I told Mr. O'Toole he had better prove us right, and that has happened.</p> <p>  Ms Gildernew's question is fair.  Have we achieved what we set out to achieve?  Absolutely not.  The difficulties that have arisen, to which Ms Gildernew refers, are not actually difficulties of cross-Border co-operation however.  North-South co-operation has proven itself.  The difficulties Ms Gildernew is talking about are difficulties of wider political architecture because of the Northern Ireland protocol and so on.  The DUP is withholding its MLAs and all of that.  What is blocking cross-Border co-operation is not actually to do with the substance of that co-operation but with wider politics.  I hope that what at least has been established definitively, with data, over the past 20 years is that cross-Border co-operation makes sense and delivers.  I am afraid I will have to kick it back to the politicians because they are going to have to try to resolve the wider political issues.  We know cross-Border co-operation makes sense.</p><p>Deputy Brendan Smith is from the Border region and he knows the value of being able to get at cross-Border co-operation.  The potential was there for 100 years but we had never been able to get at it until the early 2000s.</p><p> That is my long-winded answer.  It is not just about the potential and it has been proven by the bodies and by other things like the all-Ireland electricity market, which is actually outside the North-South Ministerial Council.  The case is made that cross-Border co-operation works and just makes sense, although we still have to get the politics right.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#E00300"><p>It is great to hear Mr. O'Connor's reflections.  Ms Gildernew has touched on a lot of the stuff around the North-South issues that I was reflecting on over the past while and we have talked about some of that this morning.  I am interested in Mr. O'Connor's idea of the checks and balances in the architecture, which is important.  How do we apply the lessons of that to today?  We face very different problems now, when we think about climate breakdown, biodiversity issues, coastal erosion, cybersecurity and all the financial services and data sharing issues after Brexit.  There are huge areas of growth we need to take on North-South, but it appears the architecture is not fit to help us do that.  Whenever a political problem raises its head, it collapses in on itself.  Are there lessons from the architecture that was built 25 years ago as to how we reassess and review that today?</p> <p>  The second point, which I think is very important, is the centrality and the importance of a productive and collegiate relationship between Dublin and London.  We have seen the impact in recent years whenever that is not there, how difficult it then becomes to keep good relations across these islands and what flows from that.  I certainly view that 2007 to 2016 period of roughly a decade as a period when things seemed to go into cold storage.  There was nearly a complacency in London and Dublin that things were okay in the North.  They were getting on, so the governments could sit back and let them get on with it.  I think that was a lost opportunity in that decade or so, and we can see post 2016 the difficulty in reconnecting the relationships and getting that started again.  I take on board much of what Mr. O'Connor had to say about that.  On the back of that, I want to reflect on how we kick-start it in 2022 because, at the minute, relations are strained probably as much as they have ever been strained.  I again thank Mr. O'Connor for his contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.808" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#E00400"><p>They are very fair questions.  With regard to the architecture and checks and balances, we knew in the negotiations that we had no history of co-operation between the two states on the island since 1922.  We had never cracked it.  Here we are, 70 years later, and that is a long time of back to back.  That is a long time of nothing.  Therefore, in design terms, there was a real issue as to how we were going to find a way to crack that and get through.  We kind of knew, and we certainly hoped very strongly, that North-South co-operation and cross-Border co-operation makes sense and will bring the benefits, but we had no way of actually demonstrating that because we had no data and no evidence.  We were saying, &ldquo;Give us a chance.&rdquo;  That is why the checks and the balances were important.  Let us be blunt.  Unionism would always have seen cross-Border co-operation as a Trojan horse for a united Ireland, or that is the clich&eacute;.  Even in the negotiations, David Trimble's position, which is on the record, was, &ldquo;We don't want any institutions.  The Executive in Belfast and the Irish Government will co-operate <i>ad hoc</i>and we do not want any institutional expression of cross-Border co-operation.&rdquo;  That was not acceptable.  In the back-and-forth and in the negotiations, there was agreement and that got cracked by saying we will have a North-South Ministerial Council, there will be an institutional expression of the relationship between North and South and there will be a framework for that.<br/><br/>It was then agreed there would be at least 12 areas of co-operation, six through existing mechanisms and at least six through new bodies.  Why six and six?  It is because that is what the market would bear and because that is what the deal required.  Those checks and balances were then built in.  As a Minister, Ms Gildernew would have been through that and will know the checks and balances.  A unionist Minister is always accompanied by a nationalist Minister and <i>vice versa</i>.  All of those checks and balances were built in.<br/><br/>As somebody who was the civil servant then, I remember executing the first three or four years of it.  Unfortunately, we had the suspension from late 2002 onwards but, between 1999 and 2002, we had 65 meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, from a place of nothing for 70 years.  I am a witness to that and I saw what it was like.  Once we got the architecture going, people just came and it got working.  We had some nice meetings in Enniskillen in Fermanagh.  I can remember a meeting around environmental issues with the environment Ministers, Sam Foster and Noel Dempsey, on beautiful Belle Isle.  I can remember the mood.  People felt comfortable and we could get on with the issues.<br/><br/>There is no debate about Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s point that this could be done better.  What is encouraging for me, as a Southerner who is a nerd in all of this, is the way organisations like IBEC, the CBI and the ESRI are very heavily involved now and are saying in the mainstream that &quot;the island&quot; makes sense.  We are going to have to find a way.  Unfortunately, the architecture has got jumbled, so I am afraid that is back to the politicians, but what we are bringing to the table is that this works.<br/><br/>On the lost opportunity of Dublin and London, in my opening statement I talked about the centrality of the approach of the two Governments.  There is one counter-intuitive point about what happened from 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then onwards to 2012.  There was a view that now that there was an Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland and Ministers had their own mandates, there was a way in which a maturing was taking place.  If we take this as involving Belfast, Dublin and London, then Belfast had to be given the freedom to get on with it.  We can understand that.  We cannot be thinking of London and Dublin as the parents.  It was time to step back and give it a chance to breathe.  There was a bit of that.  Of course, what happened then is that life intervened.  We had the recession and the crash and people dealing with other issues, but there was a benign reason one could say the eye was taken off the ball.  There was a benign kind of rationale there.<br/><br/>Where I completely agree with Mr. Quinn, and I am speaking personally now, is that when the problems arise, as they are arising right now, it has to be the two Governments back together again.  I regret that that is not the case at the moment because when difficulties arise of the nature we have now, they can only be resolved with the starting point of the two Governments.</p></speech>

It is very important this committee does a report, and many of us feel that way.  It is very important we get that insight that many people do not know or understand.  This is the start of that journey.  Mr. O'Connor still has a great insight and it is great to get the insight he has given so far today.  I am talking about his colleagues, as well as those politicians from the different political parties who were there and who made major contributions at different stages.</p><p>What Mr. O&rsquo;Connor said about the village was a great analogy for how the work was done at the time, and he referred to the relationship between the two Governments, east and west.

We need to know from the one period of time on this island when they did all agree what was the architecture, what was happening in the room, how trust was gained, and how was it the case that unionism was now coming forward and saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when before that was never possible.</p> <p>  It has not been mentioned today, but I will mention it, that we used to refer to Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness as "the chuckle brothers".  That key relationship helped to carry the Stormont Executive for many years after the Good Friday Agreement.  How key was that and how has that been lost?</p> <p>  Some would even say today that the Good Friday Agreement is out of date.  I certainly would not say that, but I have heard it said.  What is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s view in relation to that?</p> <p>  I would also like to know Mr. O'Connor's view of the current situation and what is going on in the shared island unit.  If we are to have a shared future, what is his opinion of how that could best move forward?  What relations are needed, even outside of the two Governments?  I know they are a key part of it.  If we are to move on and create something concrete into the future, what form does Mr. O&rsquo;Connor think that should take?</p></speech>

I appreciate his kind remarks.  We are wandering around out there with a lot of stuff in our heads, so it is good to be asked to come back.  Otherwise, this information is just rattling around in my head.  It is great to be with people who care as much as the committee members do.  I very much appreciate that.</p> <p>  The Senator has asked me an important question about the parties.  I will focus on the parties and the politicians.  I am not just saying this because I am in front of a group of politicians, but I chose to be a civil servant who was around politicians for my whole career.  I did 36 years in the Civil Service.  I knew the difference between us.  The politicians have to go out and put themselves before the people every few years, whereas I did not.  Politicians ultimately make the decisions, and our job is to support them in that.  However, there was always an opportunity to challenge them as well and to come up with other ways of thinking.  My point is that the ultimate decisions were not made by the civil servants.  The ultimate calls were by the politicians.  That is where the hard stuff had to be done.</p> <p>  Regarding was happening in Castle Buildings and afterwards, I will tell a story that is not often told.  When you hear the name George Mitchell, everybody thinks of the Good Friday Agreement and negotiation.  Actually, I think George Mitchell&rsquo;s biggest contribution was possibly not during the Good Friday Agreement negotiation, although he was vital to it.  While the committee members will remember this, what is less remembered in the public space is that George Mitchell was called back approximately 15 months later in the summer of 1999.  This was a long 15 months after the agreement, when we were still no further in implementing it.  We were still stuck at &ldquo;no guns, no Government&rdquo;.  Like in "Ghostbusters", &ldquo;Who you gonna call?&rdquo; - George Mitchell.</p> <p>  The two Governments reached out to George Mitchell in the summer of 1999 - this was a full 14 or 15 months after the agreement - to say, &ldquo;George, we need you back&rdquo;.  He came back in early September 1999.  He spent about two and a half months working there, but this was different.  When he was chair of the talks, he had a big team around him, including Martha Pope and a whole bunch of people and staffers who were working with him.  He came this time on his own.  A number of officials of the Irish and British Governments were assigned to him, such as Dermot Gallagher, the Lord have mercy on him, Rory Montgomery and I were assigned as the three officials from the Irish Government.  There was also Bill Jeffrey and Jonathan Stephens from the British Government.</p> <p>  What George Mitchell did over the next two and a half months, which I saw up close, was work directly with the politicians and with the party leaderships.  This was on his own in conversations to force them together.  At one point, he brought them all for a weekend to Winfield House in London, which is the residence of the American ambassador, who was a friend of his.  I was not there.  We were in London and I was nearby, but we were not in the house.  Apparently, over the dinner, he would not allow them to talk politics.  They had to talk about themselves.  This notion was completely unheard of.  Things were still very difficult.  The unionists were not talking to Sinn F&eacute;in politicians at any time.  They would not speak to them in the corridor.  At this stage, things were still very tense at a political level.  However, George Mitchell found a way to start building up some beginnings of trust at human level.  In fairness to all the politicians in the building, everybody knew, as I was saying earlier, that this was their one opportunity.  If it broke down, not only would we be back to where we were, we would be worse off because politics would have been seen to have been tried and to have failed.  There would have been a greater sense of despair.  George Mitchell played a very big role.</p> <p>  Regarding the negotiations, the format was that much of it was done bilaterally between the two Governments, between Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern working together, and with the party leaders and party delegations coming in for one-on-one meetings.  We, as civil servants, might have been running with a draft trying this piece of language or that piece of language.  I saw with my own eyes that that is how the trust was being built.  Everybody had the sense of responsibility.</p> <p>  All the committee members will know what happened at the end, on Good Friday itself.  There was a four-hour crisis inside the Ulster Unionist Party and their delegation.  That was the longest day.  We thought at 11 o'clock in the morning on Good Friday that we had an agreement.  The understanding was that all parties had signed off on all parts of the agreement.  George Mitchell and his team pulled together the final draft, which was circulated to all delegations.  Bear in mind we were all in delegation rooms in Castle Buildings and that we were scattered over three floors.  The understanding was that all the parts had been agreed.  If all the parts had been agreed, then there should not have been a difficulty with the totality.  At about 11 o'clock, we all had copies of the agreement and looking through it.</p> <p>  The next thing, word spread that the Ulster Unionists were in trouble and that downstairs on the ground floor a revolt was taking place.  The view was that it was too much.  There was a bilateral negotiation over the next four hours between David Trimble and Tony Blair, who was on the third floor.  My only contribution to peace at that time was to be on the corridor to see who was going up and down on the lifts.  We had all gone back to pessimism.  We felt it was finished, that we were gone, that we were done for, that we were so close and now it was gone.  At about 4.30 p.m., there was an exchange of a private letter from Tony Blair to David Trimble, which resolved it.  David Trimble had to make a big move.  That is what I understand, although I was not in the room, obviously.</p><p>He read out the letter and he said to his colleagues who were gathered that this was enough and that he would tell George Mitchell to convene the plenary.  He told them that those who wanted to follow him should do so and those who did not want to do so should not.  That is what happened and moments later the plenary was convened, agreement was reached and so it happened.</p><p> Everybody is taking the risk and the chance.  Without that, there will be no agreement if people are not prepared to come into the room and, despite all the difficulties separating people in their fundamental positions, compromise must be reached.  We are in danger of "compromise" becoming a dirty word.  No agreement will be possible if people are not prepared to compromise because the absolute and fundamental positions of both sides are fundamentally contradictory.  We only get agreement if both sides are prepared to compromise in some kind of way and that is what the Good Friday Agreement was.</p><p> I was asked if the Good Friday Agreement is out of date and I go back to the operation.  This is the fundamental piece of surgery.  People say they are unhappy with the Good Friday Agreement so I ask them what their alternative is.  The alternative cannot be just about delivering on the absolute position of one side.  It has to pass the test of the Good Friday Agreement, which is that it was something everybody could sign up to.  I ask those people to come up with an alternative that will get agreement by everybody.  After trying other alternatives, you will end up back with the Good Friday Agreement.  There are issues around it, it has a review clause and there is challenging territory around it in the future, which is for the committee and its members as politicians.  As a citizen, I say the answer will lie in agreement and I am agnostic about it.  We have to find agreement.  I do not start out from an ideological position one way or the other.  Did the people pay a price for peace?  Yes and there are risks involved for the politicians.  Every move they make, especially big moves, have risks involved which could involve a price and you do not know that in advance.  I am full of admiration for the courageous decisions that were taken by people.  It would have been easier and safer to walk away, which is what had happened most of the other times in the past.  The risk was there for everybody to pay a huge price on the day.</p></speech>

His recollections obviously are accurate and I hope he puts them on paper for the future because far too often, we read so-called history books and we can see the inaccuracies in them ourselves.  It would be important that a person like Mr. O'Connor, who has no agenda and who only wants to recall the facts, would do so.  He made such a contribution and he was generous in his mention of so many other people.  Mr. O'Connor's list of people was not exhaustive and he emphasised that.</p></speech>

In P&aacute;irc Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada, Breffni Park and elsewhere.  Mr. O'Connor also mentioned the ceasefire in July 1997 and I remember where I was that day.  I was at the Ulster final in Clones, which Cavan won of course, which was important.  We do not win enough of them but Mr. O'Connor's county is on a high with hurling at the moment and it is great to see such athleticism, quality and skill in hurling.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor mentioned that centrality of the two Governments having a good and close working relationship and that they are understanding of each other's problems.  If that generosity, understanding and synergy from working together is not there, then we are in difficulty.  My colleague, Senator Blaney, touched on how people have mentioned that it is time for a review of the Good Friday Agreement or whatever.  We should never forget the fact that it was a hard-won agreement and that it was endorsed by 94.4% of the people in our State and by 71.1% of the people in Northern Ireland.  That was at a time when the DUP was opposing it.  It won overwhelming endorsement from the people of this country and the mandate that all of us on this island have in politics is to implement the Good Friday Agreement.  It was the only day since 1918 that we voted on the same question on the same day throughout our island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#G00800"><p>Correct.</p></speech>

We know there are difficulties and unfortunately there are aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that are not working.  We can rehash why that is happening but that is not the purpose of our exercise today.  One thing we are missing in the narrative at present and which concerns me is that we do not include in our commentary the huge positives for all of this island from the workings of the Good Friday Agreement to date.  I think of the all-Ireland economy, which is evolving and growing without any electioneering, political sloganeering or flags being waved.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned that business groups have talked down the context of all-Ireland development but the people who create the jobs and enterprises have gone on and created the jobs North and South and on an all-Ireland basis.</p><p>It is great that we have such a movement of people, North-South and South-North, working and accessing services.  The fact that the United Kingdom has introduced the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 is of concern to us because we do not want a restriction on the movement of people on this island.  In my constituency of the southern Ulster counties I see the movement of people North-South on a daily basis and I see so many people who do not have Irish or British citizenship travelling across the Border and working in key jobs, be it healthcare, hospitality or whatever.  That is a mark of the success of the Good Friday Agreement, in that we have the economic development that has benefited every parish throughout our island.  At times we need to reflect on the huge benefits we derive on a daily basis from the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>I hear what Mr. O'Connor says on the role of George Mitchell.  It was inspirational that he was chosen as chair.  He had huge access to the Administration in America and he was one of the senior political figures there.  I am sure that was useful when calls had to be made to President Clinton, Senator Ted Kennedy and others.  I sincerely hope that Mr. O'Connor and colleagues like him put on record their recollections of how the Good Friday Agreement came about, its <i>modus operandi</i>and the many benefits that all of us enjoy from that great work undertaken by Governments and political parties at that time.</p></speech>

I want to be generous to everybody but I stopped the Sinn F&eacute;in group after its 15 minutes and I have let the Fianna F&aacute;il group go on.  I do not mean that in a rude sense.  I have predicted what will be said so I will make sure to balance that later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.831" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#G01100"><p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for coming in.  I could ask him questions for two days and not get all my questions in.  I was prompted by what Mr. O'Connor said to Senator Blaney about the last day of negotiations and the things that came up, particularly with the unionists and the UUP going into conference.  There is a series of interviews that Professor Jennifer Todd and Professor John Coakley did on the negotiated settlement.  One interview was done with Jeffrey Donaldson in 1998 which was interesting and which speaks to some of that.  The reason I am asking about this is the perspectives that people had on that day, the things they were focused and not focused on and how that has informed our experience beyond that.  Can Mr. O'Connor speak to some of those tension points that day?  For example, Jeffrey Donaldson was clear - and you could pick anyone - that there were key objectives like the removal of the Republic's territorial claim over Northern Ireland and decommissioning.  He said they could never really pin the Irish Government on Articles 2 and 3 and that its representatives kept talking in generalities.  He said they were not really engaged in the equality agenda and that they should have had their negotiators in.  He said it was essentially happening without them being involved because they did not push themselves into that agenda.  He said he did not have a problem against equality but that they just did not give attention to it and he gives a sense of it happening around him.</p><p>On concluding the agreement in the final hours, he said that in the early hours of Good Friday morning, Adams and McGuinness walked into a room, held crisis meetings with Blair, Mitchell and Ahern and said they were packing and leaving unless they were given an undertaking that all prisoners would be released within two years and the linkage would be removed between decommissioning, the release of prisoners and the holding of ministerial office.  That created the pressure.  Mr. O'Connor said in his opening comments that he would be happy to speak to some of those questions around the final day and that is my question.  He knows what happened after that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.833" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Concerning the final days, the Deputy is also referring to the way the different issues were handled and the negotiating process.  It was a mix.  It was not the Harvard conflict school of perfect negotiation, where everything took place in plenary.  There were break-outs and private discussions going on.  Parties were different in their approaches.  Some had particular things they were trying to get advanced, covered and protected.  The two Governments and we officials, with George Mitchell, did the overall frame of the document and built up the pieces.  I can understand what Jeffrey was saying there about more input.</p> <p>  On the issues on the day, I was not party to that.  Some of this was at a high political level in terms of the precise nature of the final compromises on the issues the Deputy referred to.  There were huge tensions in the last 24 hours.  President Clinton was involved, as well, in phone calls from Washington, working the phones all through the night, I think.  In the end, whatever was going to come out would be a compromise and nobody would get everything they wished for.  It was not that people would agree to everything but that people could live with everything.  That is where we were getting to</p> <p>  It is on public record what Bertie Ahern had to do in the course of that week.  We are all human beings and live our lives.  In the middle of all of that, his mother died on the Monday.  George Mitchell called us all together on 25 March for a pep talk for the delegates.  All of us crowded into a room bigger than this and what he said went something like this: "I have been with you now for three years.  It's been marvellous.  I have listened to your stories.  They are wonderful stories and I'm sure you have more of them, as well."  He said: "In the meantime, a son has been born to me in New York and I would like to see him before he goes to college, so I am declaring a deadline by which our discussions must draw to an end and decisions be reached."  There was a sharp collective intake of breath.  That began the process with the intensity that was referred to.  We knew then that George's deadline was 9 April, which was the Thursday of that week.  We actually missed it by a day.</p> <p>  On Monday, 6 April, Bertie Ahern's mother died.  He had three days and was trying to cope with managing all of that.  George Mitchell gave a first draft of the agreement to all delegations on the Monday night.  We called it "Mitchell One".  That had an elaborate cross-Border section, which one of the unionist negotiators said they would not touch with a 40 ft bargepole.  We were in immediate crisis.  This was Monday or Tuesday.  Bertie Ahern, in the course of funeral arrangements for his mother in Dublin, was thinking about this and knew that on the basis of the reaction of the unionist party to the North-South piece, we would not get agreement unless there is a compromise.  He made a decision to scale back the level of ambition for the cross-Border, take a risk and get agreement on that, though it would be less than we would ideally have liked.  We had drafted much more.  That was a big risk.  To do that, we are still in the agreement and are going to change Articles 2 and 3 without knowing the details.  All we got in the Good Friday Agreement on the North-South strand is the frame.  The detail would be later.  We had to make the move on constitutional issues without knowing the detail.  That is one example.  I was heavily involved in that.</p> <p>  The issues Jeffrey was talking about there are hugely sensitive.  At a high political level, those compromises were agreed in terms of arrangements with regard to prisoners and decommissioning and the role of parties in decommissioning.  We understood there was broad agreement in principle from everybody by Thursday night or Friday morning on that.  On that basis, we all thought when it was put together in a single document by George Mitchell, we should be okay.  We were not, because when all that came together, Jeffrey and others looked through it and said they would be destroyed, given what they were being asked to sign up to.  From his perspective, they were giving away A, B, C and D and look what they were getting in return.  He felt it would not wash.  He left and others with him, but David Trimble believed there was enough there.  The Deputy asked a fair question.  It is for politicians to decide if this is something they can go with because, as Deputy Brendan Smith said, they will pay a price.  </p> <p>  I was the deputy secretary of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which sat from 1994 to 1996, and we had distinguished international visitors come and talk to us.  There was a big meeting of the board and we had F.W de Klerk.  I cannot really do the Afrikaans accent but will try.  In his speech, he said: "In negotiations, the most difficult discussions are not with your adversary across the table.  They are with your own side."  The discussions going on in the Good Friday negotiations were also in the rooms of the parties.  That is an example of the difficult internal discussion Jeffrey was talking about.  There were difficult internal discussions taking place in all the rooms.  That is a key part of it.  People not in the front line of the negotiations, when the delegates come back to the room and say what they will agree, say "What? Are you kidding me?"  It is about judgment calls, what you can live with and wear and Jeffrey is on the record as saying it was too much from his perspective.  </p></speech>

Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned the people.  The Senator's father, Austin, Lord have mercy on him, was not there on Good Friday but was a key player.  I had the privilege of working with the Senator's uncle, Vincent, who was a councillor and was very helpful to me.</p></speech>

We were right that this was really important.  As I said earlier, the difference between getting agreement and not doing so is the same as the difference between night and day.  However, the journey was only starting because implementation is also a negotiation.  We have been negotiating it ever since.  In a way, we are still negotiating it.  I had a bit of a joke with George Mitchell.  It was slightly smart-alecky but I told him that the Good Friday Agreement was an Irish agreement, in that we signed it first and then negotiated it.  That is kind of what has been going on.  If I was to do it all over again, I would have much more respect and appreciation for the fact that we were only beginning a journey of negotiation.  To go back to architecture, while it would not solve everything because structure is not a substitute for substance, it would be wise to put in place a proper structure to oversee implementation because what happened is that, the minute we got agreement, we all scattered to the hills.  Ultimately, we got the Executive up and running and the MLAs and Ministers went off to do their piece in the Executive and the Assembly.  I had gone off to Armagh where I was working on the cross-Border bodies.  There was also a British-Irish body.  Nobody was watching over the totality of this, however.  It is a great question and one answer is that you have to appreciate that you are just beginning a new process of negotiation and that you need to put a formal framework in place to oversee implementation just as you have for the negotiations themselves.  We did not understand that at all.</p></speech>

What are the differences and the similarities between relationships back then in the 1990s and relationships now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#J00300"><p>Back in the 1990s, it was a big novelty for many people to actually be talking to one another.  There was very little of that beforehand.  We got through the negotiations.  That is what I meant about signing it first and then negotiating it.  There were parties to that agreement who did not speak to each other even up to Good Friday.  Many people found talking to their enemies very difficult.  Paradoxically, it seems that, at many levels, relationships are much better today.  People talk to each other a lot more now than they used to.  While I am out of it and no longer directly involved, my sense is that, even though we still have major challenges, 24 years of this has enabled people to get together.  Deputy Brendan Smith spoke about the successes.  I absolutely agree.  We have been able to get access to get things happening and moving that just were not possible before.  I find myself on this paramilitary commission now.  I have a colleague on it from the DUP and we work very closely together.  We are very good colleagues and trust each other.  There are things that are possible today that just were not then.  I will tell you the truth.  When I was starting off, I had been working on Northern Ireland work for 12 years before I met a unionist who I could actually speak to.  They just would not speak to us because we were the Dublin Government.  We were finally able to get in and build trust and relationships.  Once you build relationships, you can have trust.  When I was the joint secretary of the North-South Ministerial Council, I had two fellow joint secretaries in the secretariat in Armagh over the course of the five and a half years.  Both were from Protestant unionist backgrounds.  Their office was on one side and mine on another but we became really close friends and colleagues so I knew that, if I had an issue, I could go across to Dick Mackenzie and later Peter Smyth and put the issue on the table.  They would not wonder where I was coming from with it and neither would I if they said something to me.  That is what is changing but it does not alter the fundamental issue that we have two competing political philosophies that we have not managed to accommodate.</p></speech>

I refer to the period up to 2016 and the period afterwards, which are not exactly halves.  Things are very difficult now.  I worked as a general diplomat as well and I worked very closely with my British colleagues.  I was the Africa director during Ireland's EU Presidency in 1996 so for six months, I was the leader of the European Union's Africa group in Brussels.  My British colleagues were a key support for me.  We worked very closely together.  The sundering of the European relationship has been very difficult, as we all know.  That east-west relationship is in a difficult space at the moment.  I hope we can get back to where we were and where we want to be.  I greatly value that relationship.  I worked with my British colleagues through all of this with the absolute sense that we had each other's back.  In negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, working with British colleagues was fundamental to everything and, as I have said, we worked closely together in Europe as well.  I am hopeful that we will find a way to get back to that close relationship.  It is fundamental to progress.</p></speech>

It is not in there.  We did not deal with it.  If the Senator is asking me personally why there is no reference to legacy in the Good Friday Agreement, my own totally personal view is that it is because we were not sure this was actually a final agreement.  Legacy comes into play when a conflict is over and when it is being looked back on.  The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated in the context of a desire to get a deal and an agreement.  Discussing how we were going to deal with the past would almost have been a luxury.  We did not have the capacity to deal with it.  When did legacy start to become a political issue?  The answer is in about 2012.  That is 17 years after the agreement.  You could say it is a positive that there is now a general view that the conflict is over and that we now have to start dealing with its legacy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Hanna" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#J01000"><p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.  It has been a real pleasure to listen to him for the last hour or so and to hear all his recollections, all the colour and much of the backstory that explains where certain parts of the architecture came from and how some of the stops and starts came about.  In retrospect, we remember the big dates and the big moments but we often do not remember what caused them or how different problems were resolved.  It is also really important to celebrate the role of civil servants, particularly those from the Department of Foreign Affairs who were there throughout the process.  I know Mr. O'Connor's involvement long predates the Good Friday Agreement and in addition to the political layer, there was a generation of real problem-solvers, who are not so in fashion politically now.  It is now more about how to duck and dive around problems rather than how to solve them structurally.  I heard someone saying that we had architects for years and now have decorators.  Mr. O'Connor talked about an approach of not getting everything you want in the Good Friday Agreement.  That is hard for us to take sometimes.</p><p>It is important to remember that it is also about how we consent to the things that we do not want.  For example, those of us who want a new Ireland have consented to a different constitutional configuration for the time being because that is what the majority of people want at the moment.</p><p> I wish to talk about some of the solutions that the Good Friday Agreement might provide at the moment for some of the Brexit challenges, in particular.  In the SDLP, we like to say it is not an ornament but a toolkit.  Within the strands of the agreement, there are solutions to many of the different problems we face.  I know that one of the concerns that is raised post Brexit about the protocol is the issue of the democratic deficit.  I will leave aside the irony of people bringing down the whole of Government in protest at a supposed democratic deficit on some very small aspects of EU regulation.  I understand that in the years immediately after 1998, there was discussion at the North-South Ministerial Council about how that body could be better used to feed into the European structures.  That fell away during the suspension that happened in approximately 2001.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor could comment on that.</p><p> Senator Currie has a real gift for asking questions that you wish you had thought of yourself.  She asked about changes.  Mr. O'Connor is correct that it is ultimately a matter of approach and ethos.  I have a bit of a hobby horse in this committee about the functioning of strand one.  Does Mr. O'Connor have any suggestions about how best to approach a reappraisal or recalibration of strand one and how the structures could be improved?</p></speech>

As is the case with Senator Currie, the nobility of Ms Hanna's family contributes to what she is doing so powerfully herself.  I had the honour of working with her mother.  I acknowledge that.  We worked closely with all Ms Hanna's colleagues in the SDLP, including in the back room.  People such as Mr. Mark Durkan, Mr. Sean Farren and Mr. Denis Haughey made contributions.  I must mention the back room during those negotiations.  Of course, Mr. Durkan subsequently became a front-room person, deputy First Minister and later an MP.  At the time, he was in the back room.  We were together in the engine room and he did a lot of valuable work around the drafting and the development of the concepts that eventually made it into the agreement.  I thank Ms Hanna for her kind words about the civil servants.  A range of us were involved and we all tried to bring our bit to the table.<br/><br/>I recognise the Durkanite influence in the reference Ms Hanna made to the agreement as a toolkit.  She made an interesting point about the EU section of the Good Friday Agreement in strand two.  To remind everybody, we included the following in the agreement: </p> <blockquote> 	The [North-South Ministerial] Council to consider the European Union dimension of relevant matters, including the implementation of EU policies, programmes and proposals under consideration in the EU framework.  Arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings. </blockquote> <p>As that is included in the Good Friday Agreement, I understand why Ms Hanna mentioned it.  That is not talked about very much.  People might ask what happened to it.  It was a classic example of creative drafting and trying to have something in the text which can be returned to and developed.  People consented, as Ms Hanna said, to that.  I am sure some people were not happy with it, some did not want it at all and others did want it.  The North-South Ministerial Council met in approximately 2002 to try to put some flesh on the bones of what that might look like but, unfortunately, it never went anywhere because the Executive and Assembly were suspended in October 2002 and did not return until 2007.  Ms Hanna referred to the beginnings of considerations to try to flesh out that paragraph.  What would representation from the North-South Ministerial Council look like in the EU framework?  I am giving personal recollections of the situation because nothing was actually formalised but we were starting to kick around ideas.  For instance, a proposition from the North-South Ministerial Council could have been agreed by the two parties around the table, that is, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government, as a position which could have been taken away to Brussels through twin representations, with the British delegation and perhaps the EU advancing it through their channels and the Irish permanent representation also doing so.  Perhaps the two representations together could have sought to advance something in a common way.  That was the kind of thinking that was going on but as I say, it never went anywhere.  I understand why Ms Hanna is pointing to that issue.  It is a formal part of the agreement.  <br/><br/>To return to Deputy Brendan Smith's point, we should remind ourselves that this was the will of the people.  It is not only a piece of paper.  Perhaps we could have spent more money on the document itself but we were being very cost conscious back in 1998.  The agreement is the will of the people.  It was approved in referendums both North and South.  I hear people making comments that they never signed up to it and I am sorry but if they want the agreement changed, they have to go out and get agreement from the people in a new referendum to supplant it.  Until that happens, the agreement is the sovereign will of the people of the island of Ireland.  Ms Hanna is right that linking in with the EU is a part of the agreement and is available for exploration.  It is true that we did not get very far with it but that was the kind of thinking we were doing.<br/><br/>The strand one discussions only took off very late in the negotiations, as the committee probably knows.  Ms Hanna's colleagues were very heavily involved, along with the Ulster Unionist Party.  There was a theology piece that we in the Irish Government delegation had to be careful about to ensure we were not interfering in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland.  Part of the theology of negotiations, including back in the Brooke talks of the early 1990s and the Mayhew talks thereafter, was that the Irish Government could not formally be involved in strand one negotiations.  That was a bit of theology that had to be observed.  Much of the main negotiations on the detail of what emerged in strand one was done between the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party.  The rest of us, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Alliance and the Irish Government, signed off on it.  It was a matter of checks and balances.  There is a lot of ingenuity in that regard within strand one.  It is like anything else.  To return to my human health analogy, things need refreshing.  Things that might have made sense in 1998 do not necessarily hold up 25 years later, although some do.  That is why we built into the structure, to return to the architectural analogy, the review clause in the agreement which states in the event that difficulties arise, operations can be reviewed with a view to resolving those issues.  The review clause does allow for that within the terms of the agreement itself without breaching the agreement.</p></speech>

As a committee, we review and we research.  We are certainly not the committee on changing the Good Friday Agreement.  We are the committee on implementing the Good Friday Agreement.  The information that we absorb over the course of this exercise has to be through the prism of how we move forward with implementation.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. O&rsquo;Connor that the architecture and the solutions are there.  The obligation that is on us all who are lifting up the mantle in terms of political work across this island is to realise the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor made fair comments about political decisions that have to be made, that are currently being made and that are currently not being made in relation to implementing the agreement.  We can see that in the continued opposition to the Good Friday Agreement from elements of political unionism.  We can also see the jeopardy that the Good Friday Agreement has been put in as a result of Brexit and as a result of the legacy proposals to which Senator Currie referred.  Also, crucially, aspects of the Nationality and Borders Act will impact on life here in Ireland.</p> <p>  While Mr. O&rsquo;Connor has made fair comments on political choice, how important does he consider the loss of institutional memory at official level to be?  How that has impacted on the implementation of the agreement?  If there had been officials working on the British side, for example, during the Brexit process and during the moving of the legacy proposals around the Nationality and Borders Act, would there have been the same acute form of impact on the agreement, as we have seen?  How important is that?  I may not be using the right term but what is the impact of that loss of institutional memory at an official level, which is separate and distinct from the regressive political approaches that are being taken?  </p></speech>

I worked very closely with Jim Gibney in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  This goes back a long way.</p> <p>  The Senator poses a challenging question about the loss of institutional memory.  A few points come to mind, one of which is the interaction between political leadership and officials.  What is that relationship?  It changes at different times.  It can vary depending on the personalities involved.  From 37 or 38 years of experience in the public service, I would say that ultimately, the big-picture directions of travel are decided on by the politicians.  I say this with all due respect to us civil servants, who have a very important role to play.</p> <p>  I recall, for instance, the build up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.  Some British civil servants played a critical role in bringing Margaret Thatcher to the signing of the agreement at Hillsborough on 15 November 1985.  I am speaking in particular of people like her Cabinet Secretary, Robert Armstrong, as well as David Goodall who was also in the British Cabinet Office and in the British Foreign Office.  They had institutional memory.  They were key.  Yet, in my experience, the decisive moves always come at political level.  There are clearly big ideological battles going on.  In the current British Government, and they are entitled to this in democratic terms, there is a particular ideological direction of travel being driven.  That is being driven at a political level, in my observation.  I know from my experience, and God bless the Civil Service and anybody who is trying to intervene there.  That is what I would say about that.  </p> <p>  For me, as a citizen, that raises the question about the agreements that have been reached in the past.  What do we make of these, as opposed to the high politics of today, where people have given a mandate to politicians to do what they say they want to do?  I see a conflict of mandates and referendums at play.  I say this because there was a referendum in 1998 for the people in Northern Ireland, the people in the South and for the whole island.  They validated and approved this.  Then there was a referendum in 2016, which was absolutely valid as well.  The implications of the two referendums are in some degrees in conflict with each other in respect of Northern Ireland.  However, they are two valid expressions of the will of the people.  That is my view of what is going on.  I am choosing my words carefully here because I want to be respectful to everybody.  There is a view that is now being expressed and implemented.  It partially calls into question what exactly we agreed to in regard to certain matters in 1998.</p> <p>  I return to the issue of architecture.  I believe we are coming up against the difficulties and complexities of creative ambiguity.  We drafted certain issues on the basis to find an agreement between irreconcilables.  Language has been put together here which, in some instances, is ambiguous.  However, it had to be ambiguous with the constructive view to get agreements.  </p></speech>

I see that difficulty playing out.  To a certain extent, that is where the politicians must say, &ldquo;This is where we are at&rdquo;.  The loss of institutional memory is a fair point but on screen, I think it is trumped by the direction of travel at high politics.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022052600002#L01100"><p>It is hugely important.  Historically, we had been apart until around the 1970s.  In the early 1970s there was still a view from London that Northern Ireland was none of the business of Dublin but by 1972, that began to change.  A Green Paper had been produced by Downing Street that talked for the first time about the Irish dimension.  That was the beginning of more joined-up thinking and of accepting that there was a role for Dublin in some form in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith and Senator Blaney raised the points of the personal relationships at political level.  They are so fundamental.  They do not ultimately resolve the substance, but they give it the best possible chance.  I say this because the politicians will know that they are now talking straight.  They will no longer be thinking, &ldquo;What are they saying?&rdquo;.  This is because the relationship of trust has been built.  In order for trust to be built, people have to find ways to come together.  I am a great believer in the power of institutions to enable people to come together.  It is quite difficult for people who have been historically conflicted to just say that they will pick up the phone, because they will not do so.</p><p>If an institution is created which has the checks and balances and can allow you to be comfortable, and you have to participate in that institution, that is what enables the relationships to build.  That is why - back to architecture - the institutions which have enabled enemies to come together have been an important part of it that would not be available if it was <i>ad hoc</i>where picking up the phone to each other is not going to happen.  That is why I say I saw it myself with my own eyes.  What did the North-South Ministerial Council look like between 1999 and 2002?  There were 65 meetings.  What did it look like when unionists and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers were coming together on the Northern side, which was often the case, of a table and the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister or a Progressive Democrats, PD, Minister on the Southern side?  I was an official watching this.  The answer is it looked very good, because, going back to what David Trimble said, we got the architecture right.<br/><br/>I myself had a principle in Armagh with my team.  There were approximately 30 of us and I said to them that our job every week from Monday to Friday was to manage complexity.  There was a key principle that we operated, metaphorically, up on the wall, which is the principle of no surprises, that we would say what we would do, we would do what we said we would do and then we would tell people we did what we said we would do.  That was a really important way in which we prepared all the meetings and that then enabled relationships to develop because people gradually began to feel confidence that when they were around this table and in this space there would not be surprises.  For example, flags was a very difficult issue for ministerial meetings.  A North-South Ministerial Council meeting would take place in a hotel somewhere in Dublin, around the country, in Fermanagh or wherever, and the thing was if a unionist Minister was photographed under a tricolour: it was bang, got you.  In making the preparations, I remember going to a hotel and talking to the manager beforehand about the meeting come up and saying that it was very sensitive.  I told him we had got to be careful that there are no flags.  He said not to worry as they did not even have a flagpole.  The committee will see what I mean about no surprises because if that happened - I know I am laughing here - if that photograph happened with politicians around, I would be in trouble and I would not have a meeting.<br/><br/>The names of places is another example.  How were we to call a meeting taking place in Derry - Londonderry?  There were all these kinds of sensitivities.  That is why I refer to the institutions.  That has been the European experience as well.  The institutions have created the framework and spaces with which people have to come together.  Then once they are together, things will happen.</p></speech>

I think there was a meeting a number of weeks ago.  The officials are trying to do their best.  Certainly the Irish Government officials are trying very hard and I am sure the same is true of their British colleagues but, and I am not trying to kick the ball back to the politicians, it is still ultimately their call.  We as civil servants can push so far but the call is ultimately at the ministerial level.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile triggered an interesting point, namely, that the institutional framework is really important because when people are not talking to each other organically an institutional framework which they have to be part of allows that cover.</p></speech>

The key - it was probably one of the points Mr. O'Connor made that struck me the most, and Deputy Brendan Smith also made it - was that the agreement and its institutions and its arrangements be in the will of the people.  I suppose the main outcome that we all want to see politically is the re-establishment of the Good Friday Agreement's institutions and that they would be functioning and delivering well for people.</p></speech>

There was fury.  There was hope.  Hope won out then in the end because we had to do this, we could not go on anymore and we had to make that compromise.</p> <p>  For us sitting at the kitchen table in the Cooley Mountains, the Good Friday Agreement was a starting point and not the end point.  It was the starting point to what we would have in Ireland and a re-unification.  It put into that democracy that Northern Ireland did not have beforehand and we were guaranteed that democracy with the assembly and shared power.  That democracy was coming.  We knew we did not have that beforehand.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor mentioned earlier, as I was coming in, the need for maturity.  As someone sitting down here in a privileged position, one is looking and one tries to detach emotion from it.  Does Northern Ireland need to mature that little bit and have a little more independence?</p><p>Our independence in the Twenty-six Counties brought a great level of maturity.  We are a drastically different country than we were 100 years ago or even 15 or 20 years ago.  It is too easy for a party to pull down the assembly.  We cannot do that in the Republic and it cannot be done in Westminster.  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Connor think that there is a level of immaturity or a need for a bit of growth to happen so that is not the case anymore?  We have had nearly 30 years now.  We see problems even in Kosovo with that shared power.  Shared power has limits on it.  There is a review mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement.  I am very curious that if more responsibility was put on the Northern Ireland Assembly, would it grow and would we see a different Northern Ireland that could bring us towards a more pragmatic and better island?  As a Border woman, I do not see a Border.  I see a community and my neighbourhood.  A strong Northern Ireland is a strong Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a point that I have been making out.  I am just praising Senator McGreehan because it is a point that I have been making out in conversations.  I was in London a couple of weeks ago at a meeting and I was just making that very point that this was a big deal.  This is the will of the people.  This is a referendum.  Big changes were made formally that we cannot actually pull back, and we made them.  As I said, Articles 2 and 3 were a fundamental doctrinal change by the South.  It changed our Constitution.  Senator McGreehan is just after articulating that.  When I hear people today saying that they have moved on and do not support the Good Friday Agreement, I say this is a formal sovereign will of the people.  That was a very important point the Senator made that I appreciated.</p> <p>  The maturity question is a more difficult one.  There are checks and balances built into the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement on a basis that those are the safeguards that are given to both sides in a conflicted, contested situation.  Safeguards have to be given to both sides in terms of how implementation is going to proceed.  A safeguard is ultimately a protection, but also, therefore, a safeguard ultimately also potentially becomes a veto.  I am not sure how you can construct a fundamental safeguard without it also becoming a veto.  It is built into the architecture we have.  If I am speaking as a citizen and an optimist, I would always hope and believe that a way can be found to work through the issues, whatever they are, and a way can be found with the institutions.</p> <p>  This goes back to why Brexit has been such an issue.  Our ambassador in London, Adrian O&rsquo;Neill, came up with a concept of a disturbance in the force, which is a Star Wars reference.  Brexit has been a huge disturbance in the positive force of the Good Friday Agreement.  It has brought back into play the whole question of the sovereignty of Northern Ireland and if it is British or Irish.  All of those questions are back in play when we had kind of calmed them down and put them into a very careful, delicate space.  We put a ribbon on them, as it were, and just left them there, and it was fine then.  Everybody could get on then.  Now, however, Brexit has come along and has torn all that up.  The debate is back on.</p></speech>

Mr. O&rsquo;Connor is absolutely right.  It is top of the agenda now and we have to deal it.  However, we have to deal with it in a way that is proportionate.  My biggest concern is that if there were a poll and it were to be lost, that is one awful thing that might happen.  If there were a poll and it were to be won and there was not an appropriate structure in place, that would be awful as well.  The whole debate is on a new level now.  I believe what we need to do is define, if we can get consensus, how such a poll might be called, given the demographic change that is clearly happening.  I do not know if that is a fair question to Mr. O&rsquo;Connor.</p></speech>

That is a very careful, delicate construct of checks and balances.  For every check that is put in, there is a balance.  For every concept, there is a countervailing concept.  It is the cumulative and collective impact of it that actually then reflects it.  All the pieces have to be taken together.  What is happening now of course is that elements are taken and consent is used all over the place in different means.  This was our best attempt.  In the opening sentence of Article 1 it recognises the &ldquo;legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status&rdquo;.  Even an amateur such as myself can look at the first paragraph and see it is about the status of Northern Ireland.   That is a key thing we are addressing here.  The Chair was quite right that those questions are now back in play.  There is now a dispute about what that means.  What did we do in the Good Friday Agreement in regard to the status of Northern Ireland?  Anytime you hear the phrase &ldquo;Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom&rdquo;, what does that mean?  Could we not have adjusted that in some kind of a way in 1998?  That is in dispute as well.  We have this very complex - you could even say convoluted &ndash; set-up.</p> <p>  There is Article 1(v) which states that whichever Government is exercising sovereignty, whether it is continuation of the union, in which case it is the British Government, or the Irish Government in a future united Ireland, that Government has to exercise its sovereignty with rigorous impartiality as between both traditions in terms of ethos, identities and aspirations.  What does that mean?</p><p>That is the language we agreed and put in, however.  If there was to be equal legitimacy in the context of the aspiration in respect of whether it remains part of the UK or becomes part of a sovereign united Ireland, there would have to be reference to a mechanism by which one could trigger that.

He broached the subject of changing Articles 2 and 3.  We said, "What?"  To my recollection, the preparatory work was done by the then Attorney General, David Byrne, along with Martin Mansergh and possibly some other officials.  They went through in detail why it was necessary.  One could then bring in a mechanism to unite the country on the basis of the free consent of the people - North and South.</p></speech>

The Chairman has heard me mention on several occasions that there is a lack of respect nowadays in this country, and possibly elsewhere as well, for experience and corporate knowledge, particularly in governance.  In political life at least, there is a lack of respect for the experience and corporate knowledge that may be out there.  That may be an issue in the public service, from speaking to people who were at senior level in it.  It goes back to the point some would make in respect of Brexit and the associated danger.  Two people who warned about the political consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland were two former British Prime Ministers, Mr. Blair and Mr. Major, who campaigned in Derry together against Brexit.  They put out a clear message in respect of the political difficulties that could arise in Northern Ireland if the referendum were passed.  They had a very good track record in the context of this country.  Mr. Major issued the Downing Street Declaration and-----</p></speech>

They were painful and difficult but they were done in the wider cause of peace.  One could get the impression that the Good Friday Agreement was a piece of rhetoric but that is not the case.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor referred to Seamus Mallon and the shared home place.  Much of what Seamus Mallon was trying to do was to try to create the conditions.  Indeed, the agreement leads with that, although I recognise what Mr. O'Connor was saying about the intention of simply stopping the trouble, as it were, and creating the conditions to move into the next phase.  Much of what Seamus Mallon was saying, however, was about creating a new environment place where people could live together.  In many respects, that has been achieved by many people in Northern Ireland, although that may not be reflected in its politics.  What is Mr. O'Connor's perspective on reconciliation?  He mentioned it towards the end of his opening statement.  I refer to the further steps that can be taken towards reconciliation and building the genuinely shared home place, as set out clearly by Seamus Mallon in his book.</p></speech>

I am delighted she is drawing the conversation back to Seamus Mallon and his book.  I had the privilege of working with him.  He took on the task of writing that book at the age of 80.  Andy Pollak was commissioned to write it with him but he did much of the writing himself.  It was a privilege to walk with him on the journey because one had the feeling it was probably a last will and testament, as it turned out to be.  The book was published six or seven months before he died.  He did a book tour in the summer of 2019.</p> <p>  Part of the reason I mention that is that this was the sum outcome of a lifetime working on these issues.  The view to which he had come towards the end of his life was this concept of the shared home place.  I keep going back to the point that at the heart of our conflict or challenge, whichever way one wishes to describe it, are two fundamentally opposing political philosophies that, in absolute terms, cannot be reconciled.  That is the truth that operates every day.  They are two fundamentally opposing and contested philosophies.  Within Northern Ireland in particular, it is expressed, therefore, on a piece of territory.  In political and philosophical terms, Northern Ireland wakes up every morning utterly contested.  Seamus was trying to grapple directly with that.  The answer at which he arrived is that it is not a victory for one philosophy and a defeat for the other.  It is actually finding a way we can all genuinely call this place home.  The idea of the shared home place is very powerful.  What does it mean?  It is a challenging concept for everybody.  In his book, he wrote that at that late stage in his life he was not sure that 50% plus one would give the kind of agreed Ireland we need.  That is a very difficult and challenging concept.</p></speech>

I can understand if people here might ask if that is not moving the goalposts.  There is no easy answer to that but I am simply saying it.  I am not speaking for Mr. Mallon but my understanding is that his absolute ideal is a united Ireland in the classic sense, but he wants an agreed Ireland even more.  These are the very challenging questions ahead for the next generations.  I am an old guy at this stage, but these are the questions that will be coming now.</p></speech>

The fact is that of the 18 Members of Parliament elected in the North, ten of them attend our meetings, but the eight who do not are the people we need to talk to most.  It is to engage in a manner with which they are comfortable or to find a formula with which they are comfortable and do not feel under threat.  We want to share the island with them.</p></speech>

It is very challenging, and I do not have the answer.  I have chosen to spend my career trying to work in conflict resolution and trying to find accommodations between the contradictory, and it is very challenging because it is also the case that both aspirations are absolutely valid.  It is Article 1, the equal legitimacy of the aspirations.  That is a fundamental principle.</p></speech>

I looked at what my father said, which was, "This is the first day of the rest of our lives, the first day of the rest of our history".  One could really feel the hope.  It reminded me as well of the last episode of "Derry Girls".  How do we keep that alive?  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile talked about the institutional memory, but how do we keep that hope, to which we must return, to keep people completely invested in the Good Friday Agreement?  How do we keep that alive 25 years later?</p></speech>

It was a beautiful line from the Senator's father.  I am an old guy; I will be 70 years old this year.  It is up to the Senator's generation.  We have to find the way.  At least my generation found a way.  For one moment hope and history rhymed.  We found that moment, as the Senator's father said.  Therefore, that means it is possible and can be done.  Seamus Mallon also said it is for each generation to write its own history.  That means the Senator's generation is going to be, and the Chairman can stop smiling-----</p></speech>

We have to find ways.  What is really important, if we are wise, is that we must create the structures.  It is back to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's point about the institutions.  It is very important to find the structures to be able to bring people together to have those conversations as well.  When people have lived apart, crossing the divide is very difficult.  Most people will not do it.  That is why convening is a very important thing.  Senator McGreehan talked about being a secondary school student listening to and watching everything happening, but it had a big influence on her.</p> <p>  This generation has to find ways to act now.  One can say that is politics, and that is true.  However, in addition to representative politics, and only a very small number of this generation make it through to the high offices the members of the committee hold, we must have a wider range of people involved in the discourse.  I am the optimist and see the glass half full.  I think enough people care about this place.  At the end of the day, we know it is going to be about finding a way to share it.  That is why I believe that victory on one side or the other is not going to be the future for us.  We have to find a way.  Part of the answer to the Senator's question is that we are going to have to find more ways of giving people the chance to come together to be able to talk about it.  Just intervene and create the structure.  Leaving it to be organic is probably not going to cut it.</p></speech>

The committee will consider the review of the planning legislation that is currently being carried out by the Office of the Attorney General.  We are joined by officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, including Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning; Ms Mary Jones, principal officer of the planning legislation review unit; Mr. Eugene Waters, assistant principal officer in the planning legislation review unit; Mr. Paul Hogan, principal planning adviser; and Mr. Colin Ryan, senior planning adviser.</p> <p>  As everybody will be aware, the planning Act we use at the moment is more than 20 years old.  It would be safe to describe it as a labyrinth of amendments.  It crosses over with so many environmental laws and European directives, and decisions made within that Act have an impact on our daily lives, everything we do, places we live and how we travel around this country.  Decisions made under that Act will affect us in the future.  It is probably timely to review the Act.  We look forward to considering the progress of the review.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Graham to make her opening statement on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>

As the Chair outlined, I am joined by Ms Mary Jones, Mr. Eugene Waters, Mr. Paul Hogan and Mr. Colin Ryan.  As the Committee is aware, the planning review is one of the actions contained within Housing for All, which highlights the fact that Ireland is fortunate to have a planning system that enables considerable public participation but needs to build on that to ensure our planning legislation is fit for the modern era.  As the Chair said, the Planning and Development Act 2000 has been amended many times and, as a result, can be somewhat impenetrable for the public and practitioners alike.  This review, led by the Attorney General, is the most comprehensive review of planning since the Act was first drafted.  Its key aim is to ensure the provisions align with policy and are more accessible and streamlined from a legal perspective.</p> <p>  There are a number of key principles guiding this aspect of the review, including avoidance of unnecessary change; increased clarity and streamlining of the legislation; a chronological format for processes with clear signposts to other sections or legislation; to improve coherence and usability of procedures; completeness of transposition of EU directives; adherence to constitutional requirements; and respect for the role of the public.</p><p>Overlaying these principles are a number of key policy aims that were set out in Housing for All.  They are to ensure that the major debate, particularly on the scale of housing requirements to meet needs in line with the objectives of compact urban growth and environmental sustainability, is focused on the plan-making rather than the planning application stage and in this way to facilitate greater clarity and long-term visibility in planning outcomes.  It is also to ensure that adequate account is taken of the needs of the future population of new and expanded communities, as well as the needs of existing communities, and that appropriate account is taken of the nature of planning decisions, which require careful balancing of public policy, public participation and environmental issues.</p><p> Turning to how the review is being carried out, the initial work of the review is being advanced by a working group, largely of legal experts, established by the Attorney General.  They have identified 14 topical individual work streams and they present reports on each of these aspects to the Department as the work advances.  Initially, this involves a first pass through the relevant legislative provisions to identify if change is required, for example, whether the provision is still valid, if it is located in the right place in the Act or if it needs amendment.  The Department inputs to this consideration, leading to a further elucidation of the matter and ultimately to a relevant draft.  The working group is aiming to have the revised Bill finalised by September this year, to enable completion of the work by December 2022.  To aid the Department&rsquo;s consideration, we have established a number of groups: an interdepartmental group comprising Departments with specific roles in respect of the consenting regime; an operational group to consider the practical impact of any suggestions, including the County and City Management Association, CCMA, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Environmental Protection Agency; and a planning advisory forum comprising a wide range of stakeholders.  The terms of reference of the planning advisory forum and its membership have been provided to the committee for information.</p><p> Generally, in all these groups the Department presents a paper on a theme, which outlines the present position, gathers the issues being raised by the review and poses a number of key questions for consideration to assist the Department in formulating its policy response.  The papers that have been prepared to date are on three essential components of an effective planning regime: the planning and plan-making process; the consent process; and enforcement.  More recently, the planning advisory forum has considered a paper on the corporate provisions in the legislation relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator.  We envisage that further broad areas for discussion will be the topics of environmental assessment and judicial review.</p><p> It is important to note, as the committee is aware, that this process is advancing contemporaneously with other legislative and reform work.  For example, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 dealing with substitute consent is currently before the Seanad, and work is advancing on a general scheme of a Bill to introduce urban development zones and land value sharing.  These will ultimately be incorporated into the new planning and development Bill.  In addition, the Department is working with the CCMA on the issue of planning resources for local authorities, and we touched on this when we were before the committee to discuss urban development, and with the board on its resourcing needs.  We are also working on the digitalisation of the planning service, which is important for both public access to the service and the efficiency of the planning service.</p><p> One of the first papers is on plans and guidelines, which we provided to the committee.  I will give an overview on that.  The paper we circulated mirrors the paper presented to the planning advisory forum.  As outlined in the paper, it is a key policy imperative that the planning service be plan-led and evidence-based rather than developer-led.  This is an essential prism through which we are looking at the efficacy of current provisions.  This work recognises that the county and city development plans and local area plans are a critical underpinning of the plan-led approach and are also a central element of local democracy.  The provisions on plans and guidelines in the revised legislation therefore should: create a solid platform for plan-led growth, protection and renewal; provide consistency in decision-making that reflects national spatial policy; and embed the role of elected members and meaningful public participation in the plan-making processes.</p><p> While the paper tracks through a range of developments in recent times in pursuit of this policy, there are a number of issues emerging through the consultation with the working group and the planning advisory forum on which it would be useful to get the views of the committee.  For example, some of the areas of growing consensus through the various groups are: supporting the commitment in Housing for All that the development plans should give a much clearer sense to the public of the nature and scale of developments in the area, rather than this emerging at planning application stage; that development plans need to be shorter and more concise and clear in terms of the future place-making for an area; that the role of national, regional and local planning policy should be more clearly articulated in the legislation both in terms of the role of the Minister and with regard to the mandatory or discretionary nature of planning guidance; that development plans should be of longer duration, up to ten years, but with a review point; and that consideration needs to be given to the appropriate interaction between local area plans with the development plan, town centre first plans and new urban development plans as part of the process of the public clearly understanding on a timely basis the developmental objectives for their area.  These are some of the themes on which we would welcome the committee&rsquo;s views.</p><p> I thank the committee again for the opportunity to outline the nature of the review process and to commence the discussion on plan-making.  We envisage that other topics and themes could be addressed at future meetings.  We appreciate the time the committee is going to give to this issue.  We are happy to answer any questions members of the committee have either on the modalities of the review or on the paper.</p></speech>

It is long overdue, so it is very welcome.  We want to support the officials in this work.  One of the things that is being cited as a major threat to the Government's ability to address the housing crisis is planning.  It comes up repeatedly as an impediment in the feedback from both the construction industry and other stakeholders.</p><p>This review needs to focus on how the planning process can be improved to de-risk construction or at least reduce the risk involved in it, and to reduce the cost, given the crisis is characterised by the lack of availability, the cost and the lack of affordability.  Will that be captured in the review and will it be a specific objective?</p><p> How is the Department engaging with local authority members on this review?  Councillors and elected local representatives have the challenge of making the county and city development plans, so they can provide an invaluable input into the Department's work.  How is the Department engaging them in this process and review?</p></speech>

One relates to planning for an area and place-making, which is part of community engagement.  The pieces I mentioned earlier relate to the public acceptability of many of the policies.  The Senator talked about de-risking but to bring planning forward, we must ensure we maximise the engagement of the public in the plan-making process in order that there will be clarity at the earliest stages about what the development objectives are for that area.  That is one measure that would bring a significant improvement to planning.</p> <p>  The other is the question of certainty.  As we come to talk about the consent process more, one of the issues we are dealing with relates to timelines.  We have introduced very specific timelines for large-scale residential development, so that is an area of exploration.</p> <p>  Local authority elected members sit on the planning advisory forum, which has been the medium of our engagement.  The forum has had a number of meetings and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, is represented there.  We would be happy to engage further, but that is the engagement process we have at the moment.</p></speech>

The Department might want to include the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, as well as the AILG.</p> <p>  Earlier this week, stakeholders attending one of our meetings talked about the cost of construction.  They specifically raised the thorny issue of the viability of apartment-building.  They were asking, in particular, that at the early stage of any planning process, the viability of the project be established.  Will that be included in the review and is there scope to do it?</p></speech>

Mr. Hogan might wish to comment and, regarding specific proposals for urban development zones, which will be a key area for apartments, I might ask him to talk a little about how we will factor in that issue.  We have a number of policy measures that seek to improve viability.  In approaching the development plan process, it is important that the issue of viability be borne in mind as people look at that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.995" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022052600002#C00500"><p>Parallel work is happening on foot of the heads of a Bill we published before Christmas and we are now carrying out economic evaluation of that with consultants to examine the impact it might have.  It is the land value sharing and urban development zones proposal, which is really a modern incarnation of the Kenny report and how that might be applied to the system as it exists.  That work is happening in parallel with the review and they are very much overlapping.  I expect that by the time we get to the end of that stage, it will be incorporated into the published Bill.  The idea is that there will be potential for a greater level of State intervention in the land assembly process and investment in areas that are identified for development in a comprehensive, planned way.  The starting point was an extension of the Part V model, but it is seeking to extend further the extent of a landholding the State could acquire at existing use value.  As an evolution of that in response to the feedback and analysis the economic consultants have been tasked with, we are open to further evolution or change in that regard and that is something we will have to work through on a policy basis.</p> <p>  The issue of development levies is often raised in regard to viability and that is very much part of the Planning and Development Act.  Development levies generally fund infrastructure and facilities that benefit existing communities and are set by existing councils.  How we can better address development levies through a more comprehensive system that also looks at land and future development is part of the consideration of the land value sharing proposal, and it has a resonance or knock-on into the Act.  The question is whether we should have a two-tier scenario whereby there are levies in some areas and a more comprehensive approach in others, or whether we should try to merge the two in a better way throughout local authority areas for all development.</p> <p>  A great deal of complex work is happening in parallel but this is a core issue for development.  In regard to the sort of development we need to see more of, in our urban areas in particular, the question of viability is key.  We are certainly open to greater consideration of it, but we do not think it should be overriding because it would then start to become a question of profitability rather than viability.</p></speech>

There is no doubt the work the Department is doing on land value sharing is very important and welcome.  The impression I got from the stakeholders was that, separate to that strategic-type change in direction and action to address the land value issue and its contribution to the cost, they were looking for actual changes to the planning process for individual planning applications, but I will clarify that and revert to our guests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022052600002#C00700"><p>I thank Ms Graham for the presentation.  If we want to fix a problem, it is important to understand what the problem is.  One of the great concerns a number of us in the committee have relates to the fact the premise of this review of the Planning and Development Act is starting from the wrong place.  If we have a bit of discussion about that, it might help inform at least the working group and the Department's view of the likely concerns some committee members may have if and when the legislation comes to us.  It is often said, predominantly by large investors and developers, that the planning system is holding back the delivery of homes but that is just not true.  There are 80,000 or 90,000 extant unit planning permissions and the overwhelming majority have not been commenced for decades.  Flawed and all as our traditional planning process was, planning permission was granted and homes were delivered and sold at very affordable prices.  The kinds of problems we often hear being levelled at our current planning system are misplaced.</p> <p>  Where we did start to have a serious problem was where some of Ms Graham's predecessors designed very flawed changes to the planning code under the previous Government, such as the strategic housing developments, SHDs.  Senator Boyhan and I were members of this committee at the time and we warned people over and over again not to go down that route.  We warned them about what would happen and we were, unfortunately, correct.  Many of the alternative proposals we put on the table in 2016 and 2017 have now been worked into the replacement legislation, which we supported.  If people think the replacement of the SHDs with the large-scale residential development process is going to fix some of the problems we have had in recent years, they misunderstand the problems because the dramatic escalation in the number of judicial reviews of large residential developments, something that would never have happened previously, arises from the conflicts created between the mandatory ministerial guidelines and city and county development plans.  Almost all the judicial reviews, JRs, of residential developments have related to material contraventions of city and county development plans and the vast majority of them have been successful.</p><p>I am not saying that to give anybody a hard time but we have to understand that was the central problem.  While those mandatory ministerial guidelines are still on the Statute Book and while conflicts of interest potentially could continue to exist or unfold between policy recommendations of the national planning framework and the new county development plans, we could be stuck in this cycle of legal challenges to developments, which would not happen if the developments were designed properly and in accordance with good planning principles.  I think some of that needs to be part of this review.  There needs to be a little bit of humility from those people who advocated some of the interventions that were made in the planning legislation in the last few years, as to why we are in the mess that we are currently in.</p><p>The Department's timelines are concerning.  I think that in the back of her mind, when Ms Graham mentioned September, she knew herself that she will coming back to us in September.  It is unlikely that a bill is going to be ready by September.  I think too much pressure is being put on officials in the Department to deliver legislation within impossible timelines.  It is a good thing that the Planning and Development Act 2000 is being reviewed.  Modernising that legislation will be great but it is a huge ask.  Even if it is delivered by September, the idea that we could have proper scrutiny and decision in that regard between September and December with all of the other legislation that is outstanding from the Department, is overly ambitious.  It is a point we should make to the Minister,rather than the witnesses.  I think that if we are going to do this right, we must take the appropriate amount of time to ensure proper scrutiny, both within and outside the House, and proper decisions.</p><p> On the judicial reviews, I want to lay down a very clear warning.  If this review ends up recommending the kinds of changes that were in the general scheme, not only will it cause substantial opposition from our side of the House, but it will end up in the courts and it will go all the way to the European Court of Justice.  I want to be very clear about that.  If anything further undermines public participation and our legal obligations under the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive or the Aarhus Convention, it is going to create a huge problem.  Just as we said the strategic housing developments, SHDs, would end up clogging up the courts, the Department could actually end up clogging up its own legislation in a lengthy legal battle by some environmental NGO or perhaps even a Member of this House challenging it.  I warn the Department against that approach.  A much better approach - and I hope it is under consideration - is exactly as has been stated, namely, getting the public and the environmental and other sectoral organisations involved at the earliest possible stage.  If we design out all those problems downstream, we will not have the difficulties upstream.  Likewise, the environmental court is key.  People have a right to justice.  Whether I agree with somebody taking a judicial review or not, they should have that right under international and European law.  The crucial thing is ensuring that when judicial reviews are taken, they are speedily dealt with by judges who have full competence in the increasing complexities of environmental and planning law with adequate staffing.  Rather than trying to restrict access to justice, which was the clear intention of the last general scheme, both in terms of who could take cases and the cost risks, it must be fixed with good quality place-making, exactly as Ms Graham has outlined.  The environmental court must also be put in place in parallel in order that judicial reviews do not become a problem.</p><p> I wish to raise a few additional points.  To respond directly to Ms Graham's question about things that we would like to see in the review, the big weakness of our planning system has always been public participation, because exactly as Ms Graham stated, it is after the advanced nature of the planning application is designed.  I think we have to get much more innovative about public participation in terms of real decision-making about place-making in a way that we have never really fully got to grips with.  If the Department moves in that direction, it will certainly have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  </p><p> We have to revisit the issue around the local autonomy of our local authorities and the elected members to go beyond the minimum standards that are set in Government legislation and planning laws.  </p><p> On the issue of the board, we have to implement the 2016 review fully.  Almost all of the outstanding elements of that are within the purview of the Government and the Department.  The one thing industry representatives said to us very loudly during our session earlier in the week is that there have to be clear statutory timelines for all board decisions and they have to be appropriate.  I think that is something that needs to be looked at.  </p><p> The last point I wish to raise concerns Travellers, because the subject is not in the review.  We had an expert group on the future of Traveller accommodation.  It made a number of very important recommendations that got cross-party support in the last Oireachtas around changes to planning law as emergency measures, in terms of Part 8 planning applications and section 183 land disposals, to ensure that the Dickensian 19th century conditions that our Travelling community live in could be addressed.  It would be a real shame if that is not included in this piece of legislation.  If it is not in this legislation, it is never going to happen.</p><p> I wish to ask two quick questions, which perhaps the witnesses can answer in the second round.  I am concerned about the relationship between the Attorney General's working group and the sectoral group, or whatever it is called, that it is feeding into.  I ask the witnesses to explain how that is going to work.  I am not so sure that I would have a bunch of lawyers redesigning the planning system.  I have more faith in our planners and environmental legal experts.  </p><p> Second, on the documentation, Ms Graham used an interesting word when she talked about the paper that the Department had given us.  She did not say that it was the paper that the working groups is looking at.  She said it mirrors it.  I always get worried when I hear language like that.  I ask for a commitment that all of the documentation that comes from the working group and the engagement with the sectoral groups will be made available to this committee.  Like the Chairman, I would like to see subsequent engagements.  I think we should have access to the same documentation in real time.  We want to play a constructive role in this.  We might have different views.  I think that would be really helpful to ensure that the exercise is fully transparent and accountable, particularly to the committee.</p></speech>

Essentially, the paper that the committee has received is the same paper.  That was one of the Deputy's questions.  We are out of time on the slot.  I will give Ms Graham the opportunity to respond to the points raised by the Deputy.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point on timelines, as referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  The committee has dealt with really substantial, complex and difficult legislation.  We have proven our ability to do that within timeframes that were challenging, and we met the deadlines.  I would not be quite as pessimistic as Deputy &Oacute; Broin to say that we do not have the capability to do that.  The committee is committed to addressing that.  I call Deputy Higgins.</p></speech>

As the last speaker said, the Department has quite a tough task over the next few months.  I wish the witnesses well with that and thank them for engaging with the committee on it.  I note that one of the key principles is increasing clarity and the streamlining of legislation.  An issue that I come across time and again is the lack of clarity and streamlining of decision-making in terms of different local authorities.  In particular, my constituency is an urban one run by South Dublin County Council but we do have a rural area.  We find that South Dublin County Council has very different guidelines in comparison with Kildare County Council or Wicklow County Council when it comes to one-off rural housing.  I would be quite interested to know if the Department's terms stretch to that.  Are there plans for new rural planning guidelines?  How will that fit in with the review?</p> <p>  On local area plans, LAPs, in my own area there are moves to do deliver an LAP for Rathcoole.  We imagine that the census results will show that the area has a population of over 5,000, which is the mark it needs to hit to require an LAP.  There is also a campaign under way to get an LAP for Saggart.  I am wondering, on the hierarchy of plans, how that works.  We have the national planning framework and county development plans.  At this point, where does the Department see LAPs fitting into that?  Do the witnesses think there is a future need for them in urban areas, or should it be looked at from a different perspective?</p> <p>  Our planning system can be slow.  We have heard that from a number of different stakeholders who have appeared before the committee previously.  However, one of the real benefits of the system is that it is transparent.  It absolutely has transparency at the heart of it.  When we are drafting the legislation, we must ensure that we protect that hallmark of transparency, while also ensuring that we minimise any unnecessary delays in large-scale public projects, in particular.  I would be keen to hear the witnesses' overview of that at this point.</p> <p>  I think public participation is critical and we need to encourage and protect that.  However, we also need to tighten up the system a bit from an efficiency perspective.  I ask the witnesses for their views on that.</p></speech>

I think we are almost there in terms of producing the guidelines.  Going back to a point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the review is looking at the role of guidelines at national, regional and local levels from a consistency point of view.  We are looking at the benefits that national guidance should bring in ensuring there is a consistent approach.  We are also looking at the benefits of the subsidiarity approach in terms of implementation at local level.</p><p>That is one of the areas we are looking at in the legislative frame.  In particular, that speaks to what are mandatory guidelines and what are discretionary.  At the moment, in all humility, I think many of our guidelines are probably a mix of best practice and some that are expected to be followed, and that language can be looked at.  That is one of the areas we are dealing with and the transparency piece is important.</p><p> In terms of the local area plans, LAPs, I will ask Mr. Ryan to come in as he has been dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

There is the issue of the tiering and the hierarchy of the national, the regional and the administrative area, be it for a local authority like South Dublin County Council or another county local authority such as Cork.  It is something we will be looking at and we would welcome the views of the committee.  The 5,000 population limit is a bar.  A significant amount of effort goes into an LAP.  This could possibly be looked at in a different way that meets the development needs of a county or administrative area but does not necessarily mean every town over 5,000 requires an LAP.  Some other locations within the county might need a type of plan similar to an LAP, although it might be called something different, because it has to be appropriately assessed and there has to be flooding risk analysis and a strategic environmental assessment, SEA.  There are significant resource implications for these LAPs that might not necessarily be the best direction in terms of focusing our planning system.  We would welcome consideration of this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1007" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022052600002#E00400"><p>One of the issues behind this is to have clarity.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, there are a lot of applications.  Some 30,000 applications go through the system every year and only 10% of them are appealed, with only 8% ending up in judicial review.  That is why a basic tenet of this is no unnecessary change.  Part of our approach is that while there are things that might look a bit complex, people understand them, so we need to be careful about pulling things apart.  That transparency piece is very important.</p> <p>  When we come to the consents piece, it is almost that we can see a flow through the legislation.  It should start with the plan-making piece and it is then into consents and it should be clear where the different consents are.  With regard to the current planning Act, a drafter said to me that when we start to go into letters of the second run of the alphabet, we know the legislation has become difficult.  That is the idea.  People should be able to pick up the Act and understand it or it should signpost them to another area.</p> <p>  The other piece that is very important for both practitioners and the public is the digitalisation of the planning system.  Many errors can be eliminated if the processes are clear to go through, and it enhances public participation if more of that is online.  There is also the resourcing of the planning system.  In a way, there are three legs to the stool that all have to work in parallel.</p></speech>

Being able to do all of this online and pay online would be a very progressive step.  That level of innovation and investment in technology would make the planning system more easily accessible to everybody.</p></speech>

They are clearly very able and full of expertise.  At the outset, I welcome the review of the Planning and Development Act.  It is important people are able to read it.  Clearly, there have been so many amendments and changes that it makes this complex.  This possibly gives us an amazing opportunity if we collaborate and genuinely work together.</p> <p>  I am mindful that, this week alone, there are four or five cases for judicial review down in the courts and in the Custom House.  I acknowledge the bravery and courage of our citizens who have had to put their money where their mouth is and challenge the planning system.  I had a look today at the number of successes and the many times the board gave way and did not contest.  Clearly, the courts are saying something and we are at odds somewhere.  Many of these people have been vindicated but at great personal stress and cost to them.  I am very familiar with a number in my own area who have literally had crowdfunding or where they have literally had their houses on the line to vindicate and make a case.  They are our heroes, they are our citizens, and I will never apologise for defending them.</p> <p>  I have been associated with a number of these very successful judicial reviews.  It is very rewarding when you have beaten the system but it is a tough and hard system and, many times, it is against the citizen.  Let us not demonise the citizen, let us not demonise An Taisce, and let us not demonise those in the environmental pillar, who have every right to make a case for their communities and in regard to the environment.  I want to say that because it is important.</p> <p>  On another point, where are the architects of the strategic housing development, SHD, process?  I do not want to personalise anything but the witnesses know where they are and they know the positions they hold in planning and in local government.  What does that say to those of us who have been Members of these Houses for the past five or six years and who time and time again cautioned the Department, the officials and the planning experts that we had serious concerns?  There was a midterm review of the SHD and they did not listen to us.  I took it down today to have another read but that is yesterday and we have to move on.  I genuinely say that but let us learn the lessons and learn from people who took the time to engage in that process.</p> <p>  I hope this is a new start for us all, and I say that genuinely.  We have to learn from the Mahon tribunal but let us not have a lecture about that.  We recognise this has to be planning led and I acknowledge that the national planning framework, NPF, is the height of the hierarchy, so let us accept that.  Let us put things out there that are correct, let us not apologise for them and let us work down from them.  It is planning led.</p> <p>  We need confidence and openness.  If ever we needed confidence and openness in the planning process, we needed it in recent weeks.  I am not going to comment any further but I will just say that the public does not have the confidence it should have in the planning process and the procedures that deal with the issues that may arise and that will be, it is hoped, addressed.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of An Taisce.  I acknowledge there are challenges around the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and there are particular challenges around local government.  There is daily commentary around the OPR, and while it is not all justified, we have to look at the relationship between the OPR and others.  It is a new office and it is bedding down.  My experience has always been an extremely positive one, and I want to put that on the record.  We in the Houses would be very familiar with the OPR.  That is important.</p> <p>  I do not want to see this legislation used in any way to dampen down on the prescribed bodies.  I do not want there to be a significant additional cost for the citizens and prescribed bodies to engage in amazing work.  I live in an area where people have fought strongly and hard to protect the built and natural environment, with great success, and I acknowledge that work.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge the work of the environmental pillar.  I echo Deputy &Oacute; Broin in that there will be litigation if people feel they are somehow being dumbed down in regard to their own right to engage as citizens in the planning process.  I want to flag the issue of the Aarhus Convention.  We have international obligations in regard to the convention and we need to remind ourselves of that, although I am not saying we are not doing that.</p> <p>  I come back to Ms Graham's opening statement, which is positive.  I want to be positive but I want to get these things off my chest and I want to keep saying them because they are important.  There were five or six issues.  I agree with the point on the completeness of the transposition of the EU directive.  Ms Graham referred to respect for the role of the public and I agree with her 100%.  We must respect the role of the public in engaging in our planning process and respect their representative bodies and their community bodies.  We must see this as part of our overall reform of local government in terms of empowering the citizen.  We are talking about directly elected mayors as a policy for government and, therefore, they have to have confidence in this system and confidence in the regional authorities.</p><p>That is important and she is dead right to point it out.  </p><p> I want to acknowledge the advisory forum, on which the AILG and LAMA sit.  I would like to have more of their members on it.  Other groups such as the CCMA are part of other consultative bodies, but at least there are two members on the advisory forum.  I ask that the Department continues to engage through education and advice in the annual conferences, and to keep upskilling members and keep them abreast of developments.  They are the stakeholders and the ambassadors for this policy.  They are the ones who explain it to the public.  They meet people at the coalface of planning decisions.  That is important, and was echoed by Ms Graham.  </p><p> The statement refers to embedding the role of the elected members of our councils in a meaningful public participation and plan-making process.  There is work to be done there.  I was a councillor for many years and councillors have told me that something is not really our plan any more and it is not the OPR but rather the managers, chief executives or developers who are involved.  There is a bit of work to be done there.  We need to be clear and honest with people about their function and power.</p><p> On county development plans, I agree with the witnesses.  I have had three or four county development plans through my hands.  A period of six to seven years is not long enough; ten years might be too long.  The cycle of local government is five years, which means that there could be someone in a council who would never have dealt with a development plan.  Continuity, public participation and engagement with councillors are important.  Perhaps it should be a period of eight years, but it should be reviewed.  The current reviews are a joke and are not meaningful to any great extent.  The time should be extended to eight years, possibly, but there should be a meaningful review.  </p><p> I wish the witnesses well.  I want to be positive about this.  I see it as a journey and opportunity to engage with our elected councillors and all our stakeholders and, more importantly, the witnesses who are driving this policy, which is basically Government policy.  I hope after all of this we can have greater empathy for one another and greater understanding of where we are coming from.  We live in an economy as well as a society and face challenges.  I have no questions.  I want to work constructively with the witnesses to get a comprehensive and fair, equitable and open policy going forward.</p></speech>

I fully welcome the review in order to make planning procurement more efficient for our society.  However, a key issue I have found in the review is a lack of transparency around the Attorney General's working group to date.  We have submitted parliamentary questions seeking information on membership and terms of reference.  The response from the Department indicated that it did not seem to know the membership of the expert group.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, some of which may have been asked already but I am not aware of that.  However, I welcome the direction and responses of the witnesses.  Can the witnesses performance as to why the review is being led by the Office of the Attorney General as opposed to the Department?  Can they inform members of the membership and terms of reference of the Attorney General's expert group?  This review, as we all know, could bring about significant changes to our planning system.  However, we still do not know who is on the steering group despite attempts to get this information through parliamentary questions.  I believe the process should be open and transparent, as it is an advisory forum.</p> <p>  As was mentioned earlier, it would be useful for the committee to assist in a review if the advisory forum was invited for engagement on the progress of its work.  </p></speech>

Policy rests with the Department.  Legislation will be brought to the committee and rests with the Oireachtas.  While there is a body of work around what might be called a fitness check, as European directives are always framed, that is the legal perspective.</p> <p>  The policy input is from the Department.  The ownership of the legislation is with us, and that is why we are engaging with the various bodies.  We liaise with the Attorney General.  We do not have the list, but we can certainly reflect the view of the committee in terms of knowing who is on the Attorney General's review group.  </p> <p>  We can examine the planning advisory forum.  There are about 44 members on it.  We had one engagement with it.  A lot of work has been done online.  We had a useful round table in May.  It might be useful to consider whether we find a vehicle that suits in terms of some sort of engagement.</p></speech>

There have been some important observations.  Everything we do will be in compliance with EU and international law.  I want to give that reassurance around the Aarhus Convention.  I have it printed off very carefully and understand all of the obligations, but an important part of that is access to justice.  In terms of judicial review, from our perspective that means making sure that it works within the system.</p> <p>  In stepping back from that, we need to ask why cases are ending up in a judicial review.  There will always be a judicial review process and people will have to have access to it but if more people can engage upfront and understand the process, that will mean they will not have to go to court.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  In terms of the 2019 Bill, when the Minister engaged with the committee he indicated his willingness to examine it.  It was not that the Bill was being brought forward; there had been public consultation on it which had not been reflected in what might go forward and the Minister referenced a range of areas he was willing to engage on.  All of that has to be considered in the mix and it is probably an issue we will come to at a later stage.</p> <p>  We discussed the hierarchy being clear as we move on from the NPF.  There is broad agreement around the need for the NPF and its key components but it is taking time to work through the development plans.  All of the development plans aligned with the NPF are not yet through and that means there is, to some extent, a bit of friction in the system.  Applications are coming in against development plans that do not quite align with the NPF.  They then end up with the board and in the courts.  </p> <p>  There is probably a window here.  As we move through this process, I hope you will get development plans that have been through the OPR process and are aligned with the NPF.  Unless there is a policy change, there should be greater clarity and that would be my hope.  The issue around material contravention should be the exception rather than the norm.  At the moment, there are probably some difficulties around that from a timing perspective.</p> <p>  The other point associated with this is that we are working with the Department of Justice on the planning and environmental court.  We have a working group which includes the Courts Service.  That work is going quite well in terms of the practical arrangements for establishing the planning and environment court.  That is certainly in hand.  Any legislative parts will be brought forward through the Department of Justice but it is clear on the needs.  </p> <p>  One of the points that Senator Boyhan made was about elected members.  I may be saying this as head of planning, but the development plan is one the most important role elected members have because it is the vision for a locality and a range of things that will happen in an area over time.  We see it as an important role.  That is why one of the first training programmes the OPR has invested in is in respect of elected members.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions and a couple of observations.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 now runs to 715 pages and the supporting regulations run to 609 pages.  These are extremely complicated.  Even today, I was looking at a Bill related to the Planning and Development Act and thought "Jesus, how many times have I seen this?"  There are obviously different variations on the same issues.  Access to good planning and public participation means that people should really be able to understand the legislation and that it should be simplified.  Is it anticipated that, arising from this review, the Planning and Development Act and the associated regulations will be simplified, shortened and consolidated and that some aspects of them that are out of date will be removed?  While it should be borne in mind that the anticipated timelines are not only ambitious, but impossible, this is still a worthwhile thing to do.  The Act was set down more than 20 years ago.  We have a new and updated national planning framework and many additional complications as a result of ministerial guidelines that override things such as, for example, development plans.  It would be worth having a look at that.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear what the officials had to say about local area plans.  The statutory basis for these plans is almost too complicated.  In Dublin city, for example, a long line of areas are asking for local area plans.  What is probably actually needed rather than specific local area plans, which are a mini version of development plans, is statutory master planning for areas.  Is it anticipated that there will be a way to work somewhat simplified statutory master planning into local area plans?  One of the papers the Department produced looked at a town centre first policy.  Village improvement plans are another big part of that as they would give residents some more of a legal basis to follow up on.  I use the example of statutory master planning because of how, in my own area of Dublin city, we master planned the Player Wills and Bailey Gibson site in 2016.  This plan was to run concurrently with the development plan.  However, the developer, Hines, and Dublin City Council then changed the master plan without consultation with local councillors or local communities.  When the matter went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Hines and the council referred to the master plan for this site, which they had just invented themselves.  There is a real need for some sort of statutory basis for master planning.  That addresses that issue.</p> <p>  Infrastructural planning and master planning is another real issue and challenge.  This week, it has come out that the Department of Education has objected to or made observations on at least ten SHDs on the basis that it does not believe it will be able to deliver the number of school places needed.  That is the Department's prerogative, right and responsibility but I cannot get my head around why each individual planning application is being taken on its own merits while we are not planning around infrastructural projects.  There was a development of more than 900 units proposed in my own area recently.  The site really needs to be developed but there is an issue with schools.  The site available for the school is too small.  In addition, the National Transport Authority, NTA, is building a DART+ project that is to pass right down the road but no stop is to be put in.  There is a lack of connection between statutory agencies that are required to deliver individual planning applications.  How do we knit all of these together?  I do not believe anyone has ever come up with a satisfactory answer to doing that or to making sure it is implemented.  I am not sure how many questions were in there but perhaps we could get an answer on the question of simplifying legislation.</p></speech>

Some of the things are not based on legislation but I will refer to the whole concept of accessibility.  We talked about development plans being shorter.  People access things in different ways.  Some people like pictures and maps.  Others are happy with the written word.  We have to make sure that people can engage with plans in a way that is accessible to them and in the form they want.  The points the Senator made about infrastructure are really important.  Today, we attended a meeting of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, which is involved in knitting in the national planning framework and the national development plan at the national level.  Mr. Hogan and the team have been doing some work aimed at bringing that to city level.  I may ask him to speak a bit about that and also about the education side.</p></speech>

That should happen through development plan processes.  Ms Graham talked about the objective of the review being plan-led.  It is really important that is reinforced because there are mandatory objectives relating to community facilities in plans.  They should be in both development plans and local area plans.  It can happen that plans become out of date or that circumstances change.  One of the things about the review is that, if we have longer plans, we need to be more agile and to have the ability to make changes more frequently in response to changing circumstances without complexity and fuss.</p> <p>  On the issue of statutory master planning, we have obviously had some engagement with the Attorney General's team, particularly on this area of plans and guidelines.  It is very clear to us, and it is certainly the legal advice, that for plans to be relied upon for decision-making, they need to have two common characteristics, in addition to providing for good planning.  These characteristics are public consultations and statutory environmental assessment.  When you start to strip those things out, you move away from a good plan.  As I have said, the content is obviously really important.  As Mr. Ryan has said, this gives a degree of significance and importance to bringing it through a process in the chamber and to the environmental considerations.  These things are not done lightly and they are really important.  The opportunity for others to feed in has to be availed of and the plans have to be flexible for the future.  That is one of the key caveats with regard to longer plans.  The ability to make changes must be ensured.</p></speech>

My computer would not even download it.  It just froze.  The report was 900 pages long.  That is not accessible to anybody who has not done this before.

I first want to respond to some comments that were made suggesting that land value sharing is a modern form of the Kenny report.  I have a very different view on that.  Land value sharing, as it has been explained, is about collecting some of the uplift in land values and then using it for infrastructure.  That is very different from the Kenny report, whose main aim was to effectively cap the cost of development land to ensure that land for development would be affordable, which would then result in housing being affordable.  The two are linked but they are very different.  There is still a need to do what the Kenny report set out to do, although land value sharing is welcome all the same.</p> <p>  On the general point regarding legislation, there is no question but that good legislation is in plain English and easy to understand.  A layperson should be able to understand it.  That has the effect of making it much easier for people when it comes to enforcement or public participation.</p><p>It should also reduce legal conflicts.  We all agree that planning legislation is not easily accessible to a layperson, but many people involved in the system professionally also say they find it difficult and complex, which leads to further confusion, litigation and so forth.</p><p> We must learn from recent years.  By any measure, SHDs have been a disaster.  They have backfired on those who lobbied for the legislation in the belief it would lead to quicker decision-making and reduced costs.  It actually led to the opposite.  It had three unintended consequences, none of which anyone wanted.  It built capacity and knowledge in local communities around how to engage in judicial reviews as part of the planning process.  If the intention was to design a way to equip local communities in this way, the legislation could not have been better designed.  Their capacity has been built up strongly in recent years and it will not be turned off quickly.  I hope a better planning system removes the reasons for people to take judicial reviews.  The experience, knowledge sharing and knowledge gaining encouraged by the SHD programme will not be stopped immediately.</p><p> The legislation also led to a large number of contraventions of development plans.  While the aim of development plans and local area plans is to provide more certainty and clarity, we are now at a point where there is less clarity than ever.  Virtually every SHD I have seen has entailed multiple contraventions of development plans.  While development plans and local area plans might provide a vision of how development should happen in an area, there is now less clarity than ever before where larger planning applications are concerned.  A consequence of this has been the growth not just in uncertainty but also in attempts by some to increase land values through speculative planning, which is not focused on the delivery of housing but on increasing land prices.  This has unhelpful knock-on effects in terms of viability.</p><p> There has been a great deal of commentary to the effect that the planning system is an obstacle to housing delivery, but we need to see clear evidence of that.  More than 80,000 granted planning applications are in the system but are not being built out.  At our current construction levels, that equates to four years of supply.  There are areas in the planning system that need to be improved, we need the legislation to be simplified and put in plain and accessible English, and we need to improve public participation and value access to justice.  We can do all of that and have a more efficient system that provides more certainty.  These are not contradictory aims.  The contradiction between the aim of wanting more certainty from development plans and how there is less certainty than ever now has to be bottomed out.  I appreciate the intention is to do this by getting rid of some of the contradictions between development plans and the national planning framework, which will take time.</p><p> On the proposals to extend development plans to ten years, I have concerns about accountability and transparency.  During the week, I spoke to a few councillors from other parties and groups at a community meeting in my constituency.  One of the more experienced councillors said he felt it had taken three development plans for him to understand and be involved in the process properly and to engage constructively.  It is not that he did not have an understanding up to that point.  He was referring to really being on top of it and reaching a point where he was able to challenge some of the other perspectives effectively.  If the period was extended to ten years and it takes three development plans to understand them fully, we would be talking about 30 years for a councillor to build up that senior level of experience.  There would also be a concern around elected officials' accountability to their communities if development plans were pushed out to ten years.  It would cause many issues and a great deal of distrust.  Depending on how the timings fall, it might take councillors ten years to be involved in the process and then another five before they face the electorate again.</p><p> Following on from the comments made by the Chairman and Deputy &Oacute; Broin, a balance must be struck.  The committee and the wider Oireachtas can deal with legislation efficiently.  Given the importance of this matter and public confidence in it and in light of how the public debate around it has been contentious, it is vital we do not rush through any of the stages of the process.  I am committed to doing this work efficiently and in a time-effective manner, but parts of the process must not be rushed.</p><p> Is the problem of speculative planning, which is aimed at increasing land values rather than delivering housing and for which some landowners have used the planning process, being considered as part of the review?  Is the Department examining the relevant evidence and perspectives?</p><p> Senator Moynihan spoke about the delivery of infrastructure, and sometimes the failure to deliver infrastructure, especially where larger planning applications were concerned.  I have seen this happen.  The lack of childcare places in many parts of the country has been a crisis in recent years, yet we have seen permissions being granted for large planning applications that entail material contraventions and do not deliver the number of childcare cases required under development plans.  This leads to a serious underprovision of childcare places.  There is a cost to this, with people trying to return to the workplace but being unable to get childcare.  Permission has been granted for thousands of homes despite the underprovision of childcare places.  This is just one example of the underprovision of infrastructure.  How much are issues like this featuring in the review?</p></speech>

It is not a fundamental change in the architecture of planning.  Rather, it is trying to support the plan-led approach.</p> <p>  Regarding the activation of land and what is zoned entering production, land value sharing and urban development zones are a key part.  There is also the residential zoned land tax.  In combination, these will focus on ensuring infrastructure is brought forward for areas to be activated.  The zoned land tax will act as a disincentive to leave land idle.  These are important components.</p> <p>  There are a couple of components to the infrastructure piece.  We have discussed it at this meeting in terms of planning.  However, a component we have not touched on but has often arisen at all of the planning advisory forum's groups is the importance of good enforcement and how it can be strengthened.  For example, if conditions have been applied to a permission, are they being implemented?  This is a theme we might come to at a later stage.  To some degree, it has been put to us that this has been the Cinderella of the planning service.  It needs to be enforced.  This is a question of getting the components working together.</p></speech>

A suggestion made by one of the groups that was involved in building homes - not at the speculative end - was that it would be a good idea to include an economic viability assessment as part of the planning process to ensure a project was viable and not just being pursued for speculative or other reasons.  I do not know if that is the exact answer, but there is an issue with the planning process sometimes being used for speculation.  The incidence has increased in recent years.  Uncertainty allows that.  The more the system is plan led, the less one can speculate.  If it is clear from the plan there will be 100 homes on a piece of land, one cannot engage in speculative planning by trying to increase that to 200 and then flipping the site.  This is one of the values of a strong plan-led approach.</p><p>Trying to reduce some of that speculative activism in planning would be beneficial all round, including to the people who are engaged in the planning process only to build homes and infrastructure and who find such speculation and the resource and time delays it causes for everybody else frustrating.  I appreciate there are other measures on that such as trying to prevent hoarding and all the rest, but it is something that should at least be seriously considered in a review of planning and we need to see if something can be built in at that stage which tries to address that.  The point was made that economic viability assessments have been done in the planning process in other countries and they have been successful.</p></speech>

I would be concerned this might create some favouritism towards certain developments that may not be the best type of development if climate change and other matters are taken into account.  We would be going for cheaper developments that may be the wrong developments for the place.  There are a number of aspects.  First, the planning system does not encourage speculative building, but at the stage that much of our construction is at, there are other measures too.  Some of that is around construction costs and modern methods of construction, all of which play a role in trying to make something more viable.  Maybe a range of other fiscal and financial measures would bring things into viability because they are in the right place.</p></speech>

Public confidence has been shaken over the years and in recent times.  I will not go through the SHDs.  They are finished and we have replaced them but public confidence was shaken there.  It was previously described as the local area plan and the development plan.  It is a contract between the people, the local authority and the councillors who pass those plans democratically on how their area will grow.  We should not forget the Mahon tribunal and its findings.  Planners get a hard time and they are held up as the scapegoats and whipping boys in the planning system.  That is unfair because, looking at the Mahon tribunal and the legacy issues from poor planning, it was about political interference in the planning system, not interference from planners.  We should never forget the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, including that the OPR be set up, which was one of the most positive moves we had in planning and I would like to see that role strengthened.</p> <p>  I will stick to observations on the development plan because we are looking at that today.  A consultation on development plan guidelines was undertaken last year and that is completed now.  Is there a departmental review of the input into that?  If that review is available it would be helpful.  Is the review being included in the Department's considerations?</p></speech>

There is no obligation to compile the information in any particular format but most of us who had previously worked in local authorities took the position of doing a chief executive type of report and we summarised all the issues raised, broke them down and responded on what we could do.  Those points found their way back into the final draft we have put together.  It is between my team and the printers at the moment and that is happening independently of the review.  It is a set of ministerial guidelines and it is intended to help or assist the development plan process.</p></speech>

We got a lot of feedback to the approach to plans and it was set out clearly from a public and planners perspective.  It is a guide for everybody who is involved in the process and we did not write it from any one perspective.  That is important in where we are with the legislation we have.  It emphasises one or two important things, such as the core strategy.  We have backed off the specific planning policy requirement, SPPR, approach.  We have taken what is already in legislation and reinforced or reiterated it.  The review is covering plans and guidelines and the roles of different people in the system.  The role of the Minister is important too and the guidelines that come from his or her office have an impact on the system.  In discussing how this should be with the review group, it is important there is clarity on the policy, on the best practice guideline, on the impact that should have on a system when someone is doing a development plan, and how that flows through to a decision.  We are trying to embed all that clarity.  I want to mention how it has an impact on something like the guidelines we have done this year.  The review comes along at the end of the year, and if there is anything at odds, we would update the guidelines, which would be part of the review.</p></speech>

We would be happy to share that and that would reflect views from a number of forums, probably indicating where there was and was not consensus.  That would be a way to get a sense for the thing more easily.

It is a two-year process and sometimes you wonder if it is still ongoing and if it is still the same development plan and issues paper you were looking at a year and a half ago.  Members of the public often put considerable time and effort into going to many of the public consultations and putting together big submissions.  A chief executive's response would be that this should be catered for in a separate plan.  Is there a value in clearly setting out for the public what should be in a county development plan and what it does?  It is not a delivery plan.  It is a land use plan and that is one of the clearest things I have ever been able to explain to people because they think it is a delivery plan.  However, the delivery is done because it is an objective and it sometimes comes from private or public investment.</p> <p>  We could do with something along the lines of the planning leaflets from years ago and which the OPR has just issued.  They provide clear guidance to people about what the planning process is, where the public can get involved in it and what requires planning.  The advertisement that goes in the newspaper informing people they can make submissions to their county development plans involves a lot of legalese and talks about having to incorporate statutory notice etc.  We need to simplify it and bring people into it.  The more we engage with people at the start and get them involved, the better.  Even if they do not like the outcome, at least they have been part of the process and maybe they can better understand why they did not get the outcome they wanted.  Another thing about the planning system is if you get your planning permission or if somebody does not get the planning permission you did not want him or her to get, then the system is great.  However, when it goes against you, the system is terrible and it is all wrong.  It depends on what side of the argument you are on.</p> <p>  On putting objectives in a county plan, I have come across situations where you might have a strategic local objective, SLO, an area action plan or zoning objectives.</p><p>Unless you are very prescriptive about the objectives for that zoning, an application will come in where the applicant has used a great deal of imagination in regard to what was meant.  If it is too prescriptive, that stymies innovation in regard to what the applicant thinks would be the best use for it, whereas if it is too loose and open, it is open to too much interpretation.  We need to find a balance.  The objectives should be binding but they should be written in such a way that everybody will be clear regarding the envelope of design that could be there.  We talk about densities and zoning 45 units to the hectare, or whatever the case may be.  If a number of smaller units are being brought in, however, it might be possible to get more units onto the land.  It needs to be clear for people reading the plan.</p><p> It is often described to the public as "your plan" and the advertisements refer to the public having their say.  Similarly, it is often described to elected members as their plan and it is suggested they should make the decisions on it.  To many elected members, that seems to indicate they can include whatever they want because it is their plan and they do not have to be bound by what is out there.  That then goes to the chief executive, who may recommend not to include a given objective.  Often, senior planners from the likes of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, An Taisce or the Department will recommend to members that they not include an objective, perhaps for good reason, and it might still be voted through at a meeting.  It will then be kicked up the chain to the OPR and Ministers to issue a directive.  There has to be more accountability at local level.  If elected members are going to ignore completely advice from a range of professions, overrule it and vote against it, there should be repercussions.  If a ministerial directive is not issued, there will be a legacy for the next generation whereby if housing is built in the wrong place or the zoning was done wrongly, that is why the roads are congested, why services are unable to be provided or why school places are not available.  That issue needs to be drummed out.  I cannot emphasise enough that there needs to be accountability among people voting on objectives in the development plan.</p><p> Another issue that often arises with applicants is they will state "in close proximity to public transport", which can just mean a bus stop somewhere down the road that does not have a frequent service.  Saying a development is close to a bus stop is not the same as saying it is close to public transport.  There may be a service, but how likely is it that the people who will live in those houses will present themselves for an irregular bus service?  They just will not do so.  It will be car dependency and that is what we are baking in.  We are baking people into commuting, with further transport emissions.</p><p> Finally, I turn to the housing and planning and development Bill 2019, or the judicial review Bill, as we have been calling it.  If aspects and heads of that Bill are included somewhere along the way when we get to the legislative part of this process, I would like that to be highlighted clearly to the committee. When everything was together in one Bill, it was very easy for us to see, and I do not want it to come in in bits and pieces whereby we cannot keep track of it.  We have received many submissions from interested parties on the issue.  We were in the process of going to pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and we deferred it, but we got a lot of submissions from people who are very concerned about it.  We want to be clear, therefore, that it will not come in incrementally in bits and pieces, and I stress that must be the case.</p><p> I thank our guests and hope they will take those observations on board.  We will look forward to further meetings on these themes.</p></speech>

My first point relates to the serious allegations regarding the planning process within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As a result, a senior counsel has been appointed and 200 planning applications are being investigated.  I am sure our guests can imagine the significant delays that some, if not all, of these applications face and the cost implications that could arise.  This is not the first time there have been serious issues with planning in this State.  It is very concerning.  Some of the sites are in my constituency, Cork North-Central, and while I will not discuss them, the issue has been raised with me both locally and nationally.</p> <p>  My questions relate to the preventions in these reforms.  Will they protect against possible conflicts of interest?  Is there an intention to bring forward separate reform that will ensure transparency and accountability in the planning process?</p></speech>

If broader issues arise that we need to take on board, we can do that.  A section of the Act deals with the corporate element of both the OPR and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which we will look at, and that will, I hope, form one of the sessions.  We have had some discussion with, for example, the planning advisory group and it dealt more broadly with issues such as the challenges, the importance of independence and how that can be maintained and enhanced, and the appointment process.  There was a reference to the review of the board in 2016 and the question of whether that appointment process should move from the current panel nomination system to, perhaps, a Public Appointments Service, PAS, system similar to that in other State bodies.  Broad aspects of the corporate issue will be picked up as the review continues and we will be happy to engage with committee members on that.</p></speech>

What I want to ensure, and I hope we can ensure it together, is that we can build back up confidence in the State planning process.  At the moment, there is a lack of confidence and a perception it is not open, transparent or fit for purpose, for a number of reasons.  Some of them are probably legitimate concerns people have and others are consequences of all the issues that have arisen over the years and the perception that now exists.  Will reforms that are being brought in give people confidence in the planning process?</p></speech>

We actually have one of the most open planning systems, with the broadest third party engagement in Europe.  That fundamental architecture, and those fundamental parts of planning being done in a transparent way, with an independent board, with OPR oversight of the development plans and with elected members having a key role in those plans, is at the heart of the planning system.  In looking at the Act, we want to ensure we are supporting that, that it will be fit for the modern era and that, as I described earlier, the parts that are unclear or that need to be modernised will be addressed.  We all have a common interest in ensuring the legislation will be fit for purpose to underpin that planning system.  There have been a number of references to what we have learned over time, such as from the Mahon tribunal, which delivered the OPR as one of the key measures, and a great deal of legislation has come as part of that.  That is an important part of the review.</p></speech>

I am sure the Department will be aware of the Bessborough site in Cork and the continual attempts to build housing on it.  It is a very sensitive site.  Last month, submissions were due and I was made aware of a very concerning incident that arose when a survivor bravely outlined her concerns about the plan.</p><p>This was an emotional and difficult submission for this person.  It was one of a number this lady had made in recent months.  Having to do this takes a toll on people.  The submissions show that the lady received an email from An Bord Plean&aacute;la informing her that because she had not included her full address, her very personal and important submission was disregarded and her money was returned.  There was no clear indication that she needed to do this.  We need to be very aware that when it comes to those most affected by planning, those who might be vulnerable, with disabilities, from minority groups and with emotional considerations in respect of the planning, steps need to be taken to ensure their accessibility is at the fore of the public consultation.  The Department needs to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure, in particular, where planning around sensitive sites such as Bessborough and others, that consideration is given.  Is this something we can look at and deal with?  That lady was very upset and emotional.  If I am dealing with one person, there must be other people who are out there who are affected in similar ways.</p></speech>

I understand completely what the Deputy is saying about people in very sensitive situations making their views known.  As a general principle, how public consultation happens, whether it is at development plan stage or through the consent process, is probably something that we can look at.  Obviously, we are looking at timelines.  However, some of these issues may be more operational than to do with the statutory timelines that are in the legislation.

I know we all want to get out of here.  I bear in mind a few things.  I am conscious that there are processes and separation of various powers and functions.  Yesterday, I issued a call in the Seanad &ndash; we had some amazing feedback from it too &ndash; on the Rory Mulcahy report into Donegal planning.  The issues sitting on the Minister&rsquo;s table are serious.  I am not going to go into it other than to reiterate that I have made that call.  We have had some substantial engagement from people since that call.  I had a letter in front of me yesterday from former Minister Eoghan Murphy suggesting it was sitting on his desk for consideration and is still not published.  That does not instil confidence.  I am not asking for comments on that because it would not be right, fair or proper for me to do so.  However, I just want to put that out there.</p> <p>  This committee meeting, of course, is televised.  It is amazing how many people look in and see it.  The meetings are replayed and, indeed, I replay them.  I send the webcams of these meetings to up to 900 councillors sometimes.  It is simple.  There is a company called VideoParliament that does this.  It will be on our desks within an hour today.  It is always important and it sets the tone and record and accounts for our work here.  I just think that is an important aspect.  I will not ask the Department officials any more on that.  I think we are instilling this confidence.  We have ongoing issues about An Bord Plean&aacute;la and they are going through due process.  It is very important that they are seen through.  I respect that and let that process run its course.  </p> <p>  While looking at the advisory forum, I refer to the CCMA.  I have always had a bit of suspicion and concern about CCMA, albeit not bad suspicion.  It is just that there is so much secrecy around the CCMA.  If you go on its website it is very hard to find out much about what it is doing.  I know where it is getting its funding from, what it is about and what exercises it more than other things.  In addition, I know many people on the CCMA.  I would like to think many of them are friends and certainly they are work colleagues.  It has three representatives on this group.  The CCMA is many times an obstacle and resists many of our elected members&rsquo; engagement in planning.  Many of the complaints that I have about planning come from the members of the CCMA in terms of their frustration.  Many councillors around me rightly or wrongly feel absolutely frustrated in the planning process.  They feel undermined and that they are not assisted as much as they could be.  City managers, by their very nature, if you watch the trajectory of their career, are pretty robust characters.  I say that in a nice way.  It is a difficult job, but they are well paid, in fairness.  I just want to make the point that I do not know why the CCMA had three representatives over two local representatives.  There may be a good reason but they are a very dominant and determined bunch of people, and that is not to cast any aspersions about them.  I just want that sort of balance.  That is what I want to say.  </p> <p>  I want to reiterate the point on the Aarhus Convention.  I mean that genuinely.  I have the Aarhus Convention up on my wall.  I think that much of it that I had framed and I put it up on the wall.  I also have a little section from the Constitution that talks about the empowerment of local government because that is a very important reminder of the role of local government.  Dovetailing with all of what we are doing with the Department&rsquo;s legislation, I refer to whisteblower legislation.  We spoke about whistleblowers' legislation in the Seanad this week.  There is legislating currently going on about it in the House this week.  I see scope there for a lot of public engagement in whistleblowing.  Indeed, the Donegal case came about on foot of a whisteblower.  By enhancing and strengthening that legislation, it will help us as part of our work in terms of the planning. </p> <p>  I just want to go back to e-planning.  Four or five years ago, e-planning was mentioned first in Rebuilding Ireland.  Indeed, I remember when Deputy Coveney was in here as Minister, he promised the devil and all and mentioned e-planning as one promise, with the claim that no one was going to be in a hotel after six months being another.  Any of us would be delighted to get a room in a hotel in Dublin tonight.  However, this was one of the big things we were told by another of the great architects of Rebuilding Ireland, and we all know how that went.  Much of it was a success.  In there, we talk about e-planning.  We talk about the board doing all of this.  We had the board chairs in here.  They said they were full of resources and did not need another bob.  They were awash down there in Marlborough Street.  They could do the devil and all.  We still do not have Plean-IT, IT planning or e-Planning, despite all the promises.  As the Chair knows, we have written things in this committee.  I am in a regular correspondence with the board in relation to this and I do not get much traction.  We can be doing things with this legislation as we are going on.  </p> <p>  The witnesses are the senior officials in the Department and will know more about planning than anybody.  Is there any way we can start?  We will have to have pilot schemes.  We were promised a pilot some years ago.  Let us get this e-planning on.  We do not need this legislation for e-planning at all.  However, and many people have addressed the point, we need e-planning.  If Covid taught us anything, it is how we all have embraced technology.  </p> <p>  There are parts of this country where you cannot even see the coloured drawings or anything on planning application for a protected structure.  Some local authorities tell me they do not have colour scanners.  Some local authorities say they cannot archive their reports.  One local authority told me that it has two conservation officers sitting in what it described as a cloakroom with no window, which is a bit odd.  These are the problems that we have in planning.  </p> <p>  I suggest that officials in a high place, like our witnesses, with much influence, might just see if they can progress this e-planning thing.  We know it should be part of the reform.  Can we hear from the board?  I acknowledge the Department is separate from the board.  What is going on?  Big money is going to the board.  The Department officials might be able to share with me where they think we starting in terms of the timelines?  We will have to roll it out somewhere.  We will have to take the pilot to the planning authorities.  I understand that.  It is a technical thing to get all of that.  However, that is very  important because it will further engagement and public participation with the citizens in planning.  We also will have to upskill people because that will not be an easy thing to do.  I personally like to have a map in my hand.  I cannot see myself ever looking at one.  However, I will learn like we did with MS Teams.  We thought we could not do Teams two years ago but we are now using Teams.  Those are some thoughts.  </p> <p>  I want to finish on this point.  I am passionate about planning.  I genuinely believe that this is a real opportunity for all of us.  I am conscious the Department has a job to do and it is a political organisation here.  However, we have a three-party Government with a very strong Green Party hue, might I say, which I say respectfully to the Chair.  There will be tensions.  I am confident we will get a good Bill.</p><p>I think there is enough constructive traction and tension within the Government and its various constituents to bring about something positive.  We have this opportunity to prove to everyone that we can work together and embrace and take on varying views, so it is not just from the top down but the bottom and top coming together and sharing ideas.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

We are working through local authorities and the vast majority will be done this year.  The board is advancing well on the ICT.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that there were things we were able to do to advance some of that work through Covid, such as bringing regulations in about the requirement to put up planning applications within five days.  One phase is e-planning, which is a front-end piece.  Our chief information officer is looking at the future digitalisation and Mr. Hogan's team does a lot with geospatial mapping.</p> <p>  The Chair mentioned marine planning.  The team is proud of the fact they think they are the first Civil Service department that had a webinar through Covid.  It was tremendous because in that instance, fishermen on boats were able to participate in the public consultation, which was not feasible in a hall.</p> <p>  I was listening on a conference with local government people from Australia this morning.  We were talking about the advantages of that for older or disabled people or those who cannot leave their houses to be able to engage more.  There is a lot we can do and we need to make sure the legislation provides for equality of e-platforms, as well as in person.  We will bear that in mind as we move through.  </p></speech>

The Chair asked if we could see the papers related to this engagement.  The witnesses said they are fed into an overall paper which best captures what it is about.  They can correct me if I am wrong.  I like that but I also like to see under the bonnet and to see the documents that feed into that.  It is a powerful group, which I do not say in a disrespectful way, and it fights its corner strongly and robustly.  It is important we understand where it is coming from.  There is tension between the elected members and city and county managers.  That is not all bad because there is a bulwark there.  I know the Department is engaging with people in a meaningful way and they will not engage fully if they feel everything they say is recorded.  There is a balance.  The witnesses do not have to justify that.  I understand that.  It is about having as much meaningful engagement from these sectors as possible so they are free and it is free-flowing.  They have loads to say.  It is also important how that is reflected.  I do not want any group thinking it is special or to have whispers in the Custom House to the effect that "This is the story but don't say what I said".  I would like a comprehensive summary of where they are coming from, though I am conscious the Department has to keep it open and give people space to feed in to the process.  I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

When we establish these groups, there are transparency elements around what we put up on the site and when documents become available.

Does it mean you need to comply with it or just to have a look at it and provide reasons you did or did not comply with it?  It is a phrase that confuses me in planning, when reference is made to "shall have regard to" the guidance or objectives.</p></speech>

That is the most important use of it.  It has been interpreted for us by the courts and I can only give a court interpretation which would have validity, as opposed to my own.  The interpretation is that it needs to be taken into account and consideration and be looked at, but it can be disregarded.  That is where it is at.</p></speech>

It is a fairly low bar and the courts have held, by and large, that it is not mandatory.  That is an issue when one considers that ministerial guidelines relate to policies and objectives of the Minister and Government.  We have a hierarchical system but some high level elements are optional and others, such as specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs, are mandatory.  That is uneven, needs to be addressed and is being addressed.</p></speech>

We could take this opportunity to tie them up and make it a clearer "you must" or "you shall".</p></speech>

One exercise we did was to go through the Act and look at every reference of "take account of", "have regard to" and "consider".  There is huge variation in all of that and what it means.  It is 100% necessary but the difficulty with "must" and "shall" is there could be no wriggle room.  Deputy Gould had a particular administrative requirement that is black and white, no matter what the personal circumstances of someone are.  It is an example of the definite, black-and-white nature of "must" and "shall", as interpreted legally.  When you deal with primary legislation, that is where it is going.  There is a lot to consider.</p></speech>

One strategic local objective I worked on that sticks in my mind is where we wanted a certain amount of land set aside for a park.  In our mind, that would be one full park.  The developer came along and decided it would be several little pocket parks.  It has not proceeded and I do not know where it is at the moment but if it is too prescriptive, there is no room for innovation, imagination or coming along with something better.  We need to find the balance.  It always comes back to two things with planning decisions: sustainability, which has to be key, and the common good or common interest.  That is where we need to go with all our planning and the legacy we must leave from planning decisions.</p> <p>  The planning system has come in for criticism here today, and planners maybe, but it is participative, democratic and open through the entire process.  From the elected Members of the Oireachtas who pass the national planning framework to the regional plans by councillors, the county plans, the decisions made in those plans, the opportunity to make submissions on applications and to appeal them and through all parts of the planning process, there is involvement.  How do we pull people into it and ensure the involvement is not at the last minute to block or stop, is non-confrontational and that we get it right from the start?</p><p>In terms of the development plans, has there been consideration of more detail on mapping or even modelling in areas so that people can see what is likely to go in on a zoning and the type of thing they can expect?  For some people it is hard to interpret what a colour on a map at 45 to the hectare is, but if one could see that 45 to the hectare could look like one big block or like several things, that helps people to engage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1068" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022052600002#N00200"><p>Among the things we have been thinking about regarding the development plan is that clear and concise piece so that the focus is more on those issues.  We are very conscious that a huge amount of things that go into development plans are a repetition of national policy.  Then there is a debate.  The Chairman spoke earlier about senior planners telling people they should not really go there, perhaps because it is a national policy.  Then it goes through the whole process of the OPR to come back again.  There is almost an entire debate about things that have already been debated at national level and may even have a legislative background at national level.  It is how to get the plan focused on what is really the place-making, and to see what innovation it can have that people can engage with, whether it is in the statutory space or just as part of the engagement piece, whereby they can visually see it.  Recently, some of our discussion is around those strategic objectives.  If people are engaging, how many objectives can one have that people can engage with?  Are there high-level ones that everyone feels comfortable about signing up to, and there may be policies beneath them?  It is the high-level objective that is most important because as one goes through a number of years the plans and the policies may not quite align with each other.  One allows that innovation as long as the main strategic objective, whether it is sustainable development or otherwise, is being met.</p> <p>  The Chairman made the point, and we are probably coming to this in the review, that it should be much more clear what should be in development plans and, probably by extension, what should not be in development plans.  That is probably where our thinking is coming to, and how to frame that.</p></speech>

When I see what councillors get now, it is a pack of volumes.  It is impossible for them to get through all that.  It is very difficult, so I favour streamlining that.  Does Senator Boyhan wish to comment?</p></speech>

I believe the issues paper that is issued has the potential.  I am very familiar with some of these issues papers.  It is about managing people's expectation.  It is a very important thing in anything we do in any walk of life or in any business.  When people are told that it is their plan and they can have what they want, they think of libraries, swimming pools and so forth.  Perhaps it could be the issues paper that is issued in advance.</p> <p>  In fairness, many of the councils do good public engagement.  Unfortunately, with Covid-19 it was not possible to have that level of engagement.  A lot of people like to come to the county halls, the hotel meetings or whatever and see them.  It is about setting out honestly what people can achieve, particularly the public.  The politician is an extension of the public so if the public are putting pressure on the local councillors, they legitimately want to represent their constituents' interests.  Then the politicians do not like bringing back bad news and saying they cannot deliver.  We have to understand the players in the process.</p> <p>  There was a time when there was no issues paper so we have come a long way, but I believe we could set the parameters and it would be helpful.  Everyone is on a learning curve.  Nobody ever knows this business because it is constantly changing.  It is to assist the elected members because they are the conduit between the local council and the public, and somehow it is to connect all those parts.  Perhaps there is room for improvement in that.  We are standardising how we are doing development plans and I think that will iron itself out in time.</p></speech>

We knew this review was ongoing and we all know how complex this area is.  We are very glad to have the opportunity to engage with our guests today.  Perhaps I will engage with Ms Graham further to see how we might have a number of meetings.  We have a pretty hectic legislative schedule now and mid-July is approaching fast so we have only a limited number of slots, but we will do our best to engage on it.  We might look at the other modules or themes the Department is examining and as they are completed we will do our best to engage on it.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for their time and look forward to further engagement.</p></speech>

We will have two sessions today.  In our first session we will consider the potential for double standards in the protections afforded to surrogate mothers in domestic arrangements.  We will also consider the question of protecting the rights of the child and existing children to their history and identity, including their genetic, gestational and social origins.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Professor Susan Golombok from the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge, Professor Deirdre Madden from University College Cork, UCC, and Dr. Brian Tobin, from National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will deal with the issue of privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  There are limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their own domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence that they give.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams that prior to making a contribution to the meeting they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.  </p> <p>  Again, I welcome everyone here this morning.  I will invite Professor Golombok to make her opening statement first because I understand she must leave the meeting by 10.30 a.m.  Then I will call on our other two witnesses.</p></speech>

I would like to talk about some research being conducted at the University of Cambridge Centre for Family Research on surrogacy.  We have conducted four studies in recent years.  The first is a longitudinal study of surrogacy families with heterosexual parents.  The second is a study of gay-fathered families formed through surrogacy which we conducted in the United States.  The third is a longitudinal study of surrogate mothers and their families which was led by my colleague Dr. Vasanti Jadva and the fourth is a study of surrogate mothers in India conducted by my former PhD student, Dr. Nishta Lamba.</p> <p>  In this opening statement I am going to concentrate on the first study but I am very happy to answer questions on the other three.  The study focused on surrogacy families with two heterosexual parents.  The concerns that have been raised about surrogacy families are several.  One is that there is no opportunity for the intended mother to bond with the child.  Another is that the surrogate may remain in contact with the family as the child grows up, which can be seen as a good thing in terms of children understanding their origins but could be seen as potentially problematic in terms of undermining the intended mother's feelings of confidence as a parent.  A third concern is that surrogacy remains controversial, so that families created in this way are sometimes exposed to disapproval by family, friends and wider society.  Perhaps the key question in all of this is the potential psychological harm to children from having been relinquished by the surrogate and whether this is more of an issue if the surrogate is the genetic mother of the child and if money had changed hands.  These are some of the concerns that have been raised about families formed through surrogacy.  Our study was designed to address these issues and look at what actually happens to children born into these circumstances.  </p> <p>  Our longitudinal study involved a representative sample of 42 families formed through surrogacy who were recruited through the Office for National Statistics in the UK, a comparison group of 51 families formed through egg donation to control for the use of third-party assisted reproduction and a further comparison group of 80 families formed through unassisted conception that were matched as closely as possible.  The research set out to answer two key questions.  First, do surrogacy families differ from either egg-donation or natural-conception families in terms of the quality of relationships between children and the intended parents and the psychological adjustment of the children?  We were also interested in how the children themselves feel about being born through surrogacy.  The second question we looked at was how the relationship with the surrogate turned out over time.  It is often assumed that the intended parents would reject the surrogate once they had the baby.</p><p>All of the families had children born in 2000, at the millennium.  It was a very in-depth study and we collected data from mothers, fathers, the children themselves and also the children's teachers to gain an independent account of their behaviour at school.  We used different methods, such as in-depth interviews, observational assessments of parent-child interaction, questionnaires and also ratings of any emotional behaviours shown by the child.  This was done by a child psychiatrist who was unaware of the child's family background.<br/><br/>This study, which is just ending now, was carried out over seven time points, when the child was one, two, three, seven, ten, 14 and finally, just recently, at age 21, when they became young adults.  What we found was that in the preschool years, at ages one, two and three, where there were differences between the surrogacy families and the unassisted conception families, these differences reflected more positive parenting in the surrogacy families.  The children themselves were very well-adjusted but there was no difference between children in the different family types.<br/><br/>When we followed them up at age seven, we found that practically all of the parents had been open with their children about their birth through surrogacy.  There was no difference between the surrogacy families and the unassisted conception families in terms of the quality of children's relationship with their mother.  The children themselves were well-adjusted and they were functioning within the normal range.  At age seven, they did show higher levels of emotional and behavioural problems than the children in the other family types but these had disappeared by age ten.  Interestingly, these findings mirror what is found in research on internationally adopted children.  It seems to be that children in these situations become aware of identity issues at an earlier age than other children, which seems to explain this slight increase in problems around the age of seven, when children develop a more sophisticated understanding of the meaning of inheritance and when adopted children understand the more complex nature of adoption.<br/><br/>When they were 14, we found more positive relationships between mothers and their children in surrogacy families, and we found that from data collected independently from mothers and from the teenagers themselves.  The adolescents born through surrogacy showed high levels of psychological adjustment.  We were also interested in speaking to the children at age 14 about how they felt about being born through surrogacy.  They mainly were not very interested and they would say things like &ldquo;I do not really mind&rdquo;, &ldquo;It does not affect my daily life&rdquo;, &ldquo;I feel it is just normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know it is different but I do not get emotional or anything.&rdquo;  Some were actively positive about it and one child said &ldquo;I feel special and quite privileged really.&rdquo;  Another said &ldquo;I quite like talking about it because it is an interesting fact about me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>At age 21, while we have not finished analysing all of the data yet, the young adults said very similar things.  To give an example of one that reflects the feelings of the others, this 21-year-old said:</p><blockquote>	It is not a big deal to me.  It seems clear they wanted me as a child as opposed to it being accidental or something like that.  I would say it is a positive thing.  I'm happy about it.  I have always been happy about it. </blockquote><p>When we looked at the parent's relationship with the surrogate over time, we followed them up on this issue until the children were ten.  They generally reported very positive relationships with the surrogate.  The frequency of contact between the family and the surrogate declined over time but by the time the child was ten years old, 60% of the surrogacy families were still in touch with the surrogate.  They were most likely to have lost contact with previously unknown surrogates.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the findings of this empirical study of surrogacy families point to positive family relationships and well-adjusted children.  Put another way, just because people become parents in non-conventional ways does not make them less capable parents or love their children less.  It seems, in fact, the opposite is true, and that those who struggle against the odds to have children become particularly involved and committed parents.<br/><br/>I will not talk about the other studies because of time.  I have sent to the committee a document with all of our published academic papers on these topics.  Although I am not showing my slides just now, the final slide shows the cover of my recent book, <i>We Are Family</i>, which summarises all of this research and the experiences of the parents, and has a chapter on surrogacy families and also a chapter on surrogate mothers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1079" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Deirdre Madden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022052600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee.  I am very grateful for the invitation to speak today, particularly in the presence of my esteemed colleagues, Professor Golombok and Dr. Tobin.  I have sent an opening statement that I will run through quickly.</p> <p>  I support surrogacy as a means by which individuals and couples can build a family in circumstances where they are otherwise unable to do so.  I believe regulation of surrogacy is preferable to a prohibitive approach because the latter can have the effect of driving the practice underground, exposing all parties to risk.  We should not, I believe, take the approach of sticking our heads in the sand, thinking that if we ignore international surrogacy, it will simply go away.  I believe global surrogacy is a reality that needs to be carefully considered and managed to achieve the best outcome for children, surrogates and intended parents.  For this reason, I favour pre-birth scrutiny of domestic surrogacy arrangements to ensure that all legislative criteria are met and that legal parenthood would be assigned prior to or at the birth of the child.  I believe this would ensure the child's best interests from the moment of birth are served by clarity in regard to who its parents are.</p> <p>  The 2005 report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, of which I was a member, recommended that the child born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of the intended parents.  Such a presumption would operate by recognising intended parents as the child's legal parents at birth, subject to the surrogate retaining a right to object for a short period.  Any objection could be resolved by a court, which is obliged to prioritise the best interests of the child.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 does not adopt this recommendation and, in my opinion, is not child-centred.  There is no mention of international surrogacy or of how intending parents who go abroad for surrogacy can apply to have their parentage recognised in the State.  It is as if international surrogacy will somehow cease upon commencement of this legislation.  I do not believe this will happen.</p> <p>  I have been invited to speak about the issue of the potential double standards that may result from the difference in legal protection offered to surrogates.  In my opinion, we need to move away from legislating for domestic, so-called altruistic surrogacy on the basis that it is ethical or good and ignoring the reality of international, so-called commercial surrogacy on the basis that it is unethical or bad.  The reason I say &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; is because the reality is more complex.  For example, not all international surrogacy is remunerated.  We need to consider how best to protect all those involved to the greatest degree possible while recognising that we cannot regulate what happens in other countries.</p> <p>  I understand and fully share concerns in regard to human rights of surrogates and any potential exploitation of women in other jurisdictions but we need to be clear on what exploitation is.  I would describe exploitation as taking unfair advantage of someone to benefit oneself.  Payment of money does not of itself make surrogacy unethical or exploitative, in my view.  Under the Bill, an Irish surrogate can be paid reasonable expenses.  When loss of income and other expenses are calculated, this could easily reach &euro;10,000, which is probably not very different from the amount that surrogates are paid in some other countries, excluding the United States, although, of course, this does acknowledge the socioeconomic situation may be different in other countries.</p> <p>  For me, what is more important than the fact of payment is whether the surrogate was in receipt of legal advice, psychological screening and support, understood and freely consented to the arrangements and received all necessary medical care and treatment before, during and after the pregnancy.</p><p>We might worry, rightly, about arrangements brokered by unscrupulous agents who do not look after the interests of the surrogate, but regulated professional surrogacy can be very positive because it can support the parties through the process rather than leaving them to wander through an arrangement in good faith but with no advice.</p><p> In some circumstances, there may be a power imbalance between intending parents in wealthy states and surrogates from emerging economies, and there may well be regulatory gaps through which unethical practices and unconscionable brokers may flourish.  These are the gaps we must be alerted to.  Sometimes people speak of commercial surrogacy in broad and negative terms as involving sharp practices where women are misled or coerced into becoming surrogates and do not freely consent to their participation in the arrangement.  As I stated in my submission to the committee that examined the Children and Family Relationships Bill in 2014 and I reiterate today, we should avoid making sweeping generalisations about women in particular countries or from particular backgrounds as being exploited.  I do not believe, simply because a woman is of lower socioeconomic means, she is therefore unable to make a voluntary informed choice to become a surrogate mother.  That is a paternalistic and discriminatory position that does not recognise that women of all backgrounds and means are capable of making their own decisions regarding what is best for them and their families.</p><p> The challenge is to ensure those who facilitate and bring about these arrangements comply with appropriate standards in terms of providing women who wish to become surrogates with sufficient information, advice, support and medical assistance to enable them to make those informed choices.  This is not dependent on the location in which surrogacy takes place or, to my mind, whether payment is made but rather on the existence of good regulation, oversight of standards and compliance with regulatory requirements designed to all those involved.</p><p> The best way forward for Ireland is to make sure we have modern evidence-based surrogacy legislation domestically so that fewer people go abroad for surrogacy.  Most people would rather enter surrogacy domestically with the support of family and friends in a familiar and safe medical system with the knowledge they are building their family in an ethical way that is supported legally.  However, not everyone has a family member or friend who is willing to become a surrogate for them.  This is an enormous undertaking for anyone, involving essentially a year of a woman's life from conception to post-birth recovery with the attendant discomfort and risk.  There may also be pressure exerted on family members to become surrogates that may lead to difficulties or breakdowns in relationships.  There may be some women who are willing to become surrogates for strangers solely motivated by a wish to help others, but in a country the size of Ireland, the number of such women is likely to be small.</p><p> For those who are not able to avail of domestic services for whatever reason, international surrogacy will remain their only option.  In the UK, the Law Commission has proposed a solution that essentially recognises that domestic and international surrogacy are different and it is not possible to regulate both in the same way.  This is not to say there is a double standard in a pejorative sense but rather to ask how we can achieve the best outcome and provide the best protections in both scenarios, recognising we cannot regulate what happens in other countries.</p><p> Providing a mechanism to recognise automatically legal parenthood for those who travel to countries where surrogacy law protects the rights and interests of children, surrogates and intended parents would encourage people to travel to those countries rather than others that may offer less protection.  As I understand it, under this proposal the Secretary of State would have the power to designate countries or states for which surrogacy arrangements will be automatically recognised if those countries have adequate safeguards to protect surrogate children.</p><p> The current Irish Bill seems to use the absence of a mechanism by which to achieve legal parentage to try to deter people from going abroad.  There are several problems with that approach.  First, and most important, it is punishing the child for the perceived wrongs of his or her parents.  The child's rights should not be negatively affected by the circumstances of his or her birth.  Second, it is not realistic.  Although it may be hoped that the absence of a legal mechanism will act as a deterrent, people will still go abroad for surrogacy.  Irish courts will then have to resolve conflicts between two competing legislative policies, one that, by its silence, condemns international surrogacy as unethical, and the other which, rightly, obliges judges to prioritise the best interests of the child that is born, irrespective of how he or she was conceived.  Third, it leaves foreign surrogates with no protection whatsoever in terms of the kind of exploitation the Government says it is trying to prevent as there will be no oversight or scrutiny of those surrogacy arrangements entered into abroad.</p><p> Finally, a preferable solution would be to try our best to ensure international surrogacy arrangements meet as many of the same criteria as domestic arrangements as possible.  Some of these criteria should be non-negotiable, such as evidence the surrogate has received independent legal advice in a language and manner she can understand, she has given free and voluntary consent to her participation, she has received appropriate medical care and psychological support before, during and after the pregnancy, and the arrangement is in compliance with local laws in the country in which it takes place.</p><p> I am very grateful to the committee for dedicating so much time and energy to listening to and learning from expertise and experience to find the best solution of Irish families and children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1081" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Tobin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022052600002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to join it today.  I commend it on its commitment to addressing the myriad issues raised by international surrogacy arrangements and on its engagement with relevant stakeholders.  I am deputy head of the school of law in NUI Galway and I was invited national expert for Ireland on the international social services regional consultations on the Verona Principles and, more recently, an EU level impact assessment for a proposed EU digital certificate of parenthood that would aim to recognise legal parentage that has been established in one member state across the EU 27.</p> <p>  I have been asked by the committee to speak to the potential for double standards in the protections afforded to surrogates in domestic and international arrangements.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 provides for a range of robust pre-surrogacy protections for gestational surrogates that mirror the protections provided in the Bill's predecessor, namely, the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017.  In regulating the parentage of children born in such arrangements, the State will have to accept inconsistencies between the domestic regime for surrogacy, as contemplated by the 2022 Bill, and international regimes.  If the State only proposes to regulate those international arrangements that mirror the proposed domestic regime to avoid any double standards, most international surrogacy arrangements will not be recognised under Irish law.</p> <p>  The 2022 Bill provides for domestic altruistic surrogacy, but any amendment to this or any future legislation that might seek to regulate, either retrospectively, prospectively or both, the parentage of children born by international surrogacy will have to be willing to embrace commercial surrogacy arrangements.  A way to reduce this inconsistency would be to make the domestic regime more akin to international regimes by allowing for surrogates in domestic arrangements to be compensated to some extent, though this course of action would, admittedly, make Ireland an outlier in the European Union.</p> <p>  Attempting to reduce double standards by requiring a regulatory body like the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority to confirm the domestic safeguards have been complied with before surrogacy takes place abroad have been rejected elsewhere as being impractical in the context of international surrogacy.  It would also be contrary to Part 7 of the 2022 Bill and international best practice for a domestic administrative process to pre-approve the legal parentage of a child born in the context of international surrogacy.</p> <p>  Similarly, ministerial regulations designating certain international services destinations as equivalents and automatically recognising parentage established in such jurisdictions would likely be of very limited effect because few jurisdictions would fully qualify for recognition.  Leaving aside the commercial element, some jurisdictions might qualify as equivalent as regards their pre-surrogacy safeguards for surrogates, such as medical and psychological evaluations and legal advice, but they would fall foul of a post-birth safeguard provided under the 2022 Bill, namely, that the surrogate is the legal parent and guardian of the child at birth and can refuse to consent to a parental order.</p> <p>  The law in some commercial surrogacy destinations in Europe and the US that are popular with Irish intended parents strips the surrogate of her legal parentage prior to the birth of the child and does not allow her to revoke her consent freely after the birth to the intended parents having exclusive legal parentage.  Such laws are at odds with Part 7 of the 2022 Bill and the requirements of international law.  Further, since the publication of the Verona Principles in 2021, international best practice requires, in any event, that a post-birth best interests of the child determination is carried out by a court or competent authority where at least one state does not permit the specific arrangement.  To my mind, any of the above suggestions appear inappropriate in the context of international surrogacy.</p><p>However, it must be remembered that at the centre of these complex legal and ethical arrangements are numerous children currently being raised in this State, whose best interests and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights require the State to facilitate the establishment of a legal parent-child relationship with both intended parents.  However, legislation regulating domestic and international surrogacy should not be rushed.  Going forward, I would agree with Professor Madden that the potential for double standards might best be mitigated by the establishment of a more favourable statutory regime for domestic surrogacy, because the one currently provided for in the 2022 Bill is unlikely to be availed of by many, if any, intended parents.</p><p> Part 7 of the 2022 Bill should be deleted, allowing the remainder of the Bill to be enacted for other important assisted human reproduction, AHR, issues to be regulated and for the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, AHRRA, to be established.  </p><p> In time, a new stand-alone surrogacy Bill that seeks to establish a more balanced domestic surrogacy regime and to regulate adequately the parentage of children born via international surrogacy should be proposed.</p></speech>

Every week we come in here and want to learn and up our game just a little bit more, so it is very good to have such expertise in front of us.</p> <p>  Dr. Tobin and Professor Madden clearly highlighted the double standards we could be enshrining in our law, were we to continue the way we are going at the minute.  If we do that, we will have a kind of back-door, for want of a better description, post-birth recognition of parentage.  We need to recognise the parents.  We have an issue that we have to rectify.  We have give those children the rights they deserve.  That is the basis of this committee.  The rationale of what we are here for is to give those children born the rights that they deserve.  </p> <p>  I was very curious when I was reading Dr. Tobin&rsquo;s briefing document.  I want to understand second-parent adoption a little bit better.  He quite rightly said in his submission that it is not the preferred method but we should align something similar.  These parents should not have to adopt.  I refer to the French method, where it only takes four and a half months.  How are they doing this?  They are calling it second-parent adoption.  How are they doing it so efficiently and quickly and giving those children the rights that they deserve and need?  </p> <p>  My next question is directed to Professor Golombok.  Identity is something we are always talking about in this committee.  It is very important that we all have the understanding of who we are, where we came from and how we came into this world and an acceptance and celebration of that.  In Professor Golombok&rsquo;s experience, how do we do that?  How do we, as a country, regulate to protect those identity rights?</p></speech>

The age at which this begins to happen seems to be very crucial, both from some of the work I have talked about today, but also other studies we have carried out and other colleagues have carried out in the United States as well.  With surrogacy, this is much less of an issue because surrogacy, unlike gamete donation,  cannot be hidden.  Parents are much more open because everybody usually knows that because there was no pregnancy, this is how the child was born.  This is much less of an issue for children born through surrogacy.  However, of course, if the surrogate egg is used and the surrogate is the genetic mother of the child, then sometimes parents are not so open.  We found in our studies that parents had talked to their children about surrogacy but not about the fact that the surrogate&rsquo;s egg had been used in their conception.</p> <p>  In terms of how to do it, certainly one thing we found is that parents were very concerned about talking to their children.  However, those who did so told us that in fact their concerns were unfounded because the children either were not very interested or were curious to know more, but they did not become distressed on hearing this information when they were young.  In contrast, we have heard more anecdotally, but also later in our follow-up study, that it is when children find out by accident or under negative circumstances perhaps, such as parents' divorce, that this can have a much more adverse effect on children's and young people&rsquo;s identity and well-being.</p></speech>

At the age of seven, children are going through a developmental phase where they have, I believe Professor Golombok used the term, a "sophisticated understanding" with regard to their surrogacy.  However, I think at that stage they have a more sophisticated understanding of relationships.  That tends to be the phase when they do the &ldquo;I love you more.  No, I love you more.&rdquo;  They have that awareness of the complexity of relationships.  Does Professor Golombok recommend to us that, as a committee, we should be making recommendations for counselling supports or anything that could go in at that age to particularly support what is a complex developmental phase anyway, and then you add in the complexity of surrogacy onto that?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  In the families formed through surrogacy in Professor Golombok&rsquo;s group, how reflective were they of an international arrangement?  Were they all domestic UK-based surrogate mothers in that?  I am wondering about that comparison.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1097" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Susan Golombok" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022052600002#E01600"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  On counselling, it is possibly the parents who should be offered counselling more than the children.  Certainly in the UK, parents are offered counselling before they embark on this route to parenthood.  At that point, they do not even know if they will ever become parents.  The conversations they have with counsellors about openness and disclosure to eventual children does not resonate with them at that point.  Parents tell us that they would love to have access to counselling after a child is born.</p><p>Maybe it could be quite early in the children&rsquo;s lives, at one or two years, or at the point when parents are thinking about beginning to talk to them about their conception.  That would give parents much more support and confidence regarding how to proceed.  It would carry through to the children because if parents could talk to their children in an easy way in which they could be understood and answer their questions in an age-appropriate manner, the whole process would be much more smooth and parents would not put it off.  Some parents talk to others about wanting to be open or to have been open with their children but find the hurdle so difficult that they tend to keep putting it off.  Then they feel it is far too late and that it would be too much of a bombshell to give the children the information.</p><p> Whether the children themselves might benefit from counselling is an interesting question.  It is not something I have really thought about because I thought about the matter more from the point of view of the parents.  My feeling is that counselling might make their situation seem more unusual or abnormal, so it might not be helpful.  If the conversation happens within the family, it is probably the best way forward.  It is the parents who would benefit most from counselling, and the children would benefit as a consequence.</p><p> On the question on the sample in the study, the participants were all UK families, so we cannot really say anything about children born to surrogates abroad.  As far as I know, there are no studies in the world that have followed up on children of couples who have had surrogacy abroad.  It is something that my colleague Dr. Vasanti Jadva has been thinking of doing but, as far as I know, that has not happened.  I do not believe it has in the US either.  To the extent that we believe it is important not only for children to know they were born through surrogacy but also to have information about the surrogate and, if used, the donor, we believe it is obviously much more difficult, if not impossible, for children if the surrogacy was carried out abroad.  For example, my former PhD student, Dr. Nishta Lamba, studied surrogacy in India and found that families who went from the UK to India had no further contact with the surrogate after the child was born.  This is potentially problematic for the children.</p></speech>

The research was fascinating in the sense that it was so positive.  Becoming a parent in an unconventional way does not make one less capable of loving one&rsquo;s children.  I believe the research was really important, and its communication is so important.  Professor Golombok said the study covered children born at the millennium and followed them up to the age of 21.  Does she intend to continue with this research?  It is important to continue it after the age of 21.  Maybe Professor Golombok could answer that for me.  The research was really good.</p></speech>

The age of 21 represents the final phase of the study because we feel we followed the children from infancy right up to adulthood.  As the Deputy said, the results were very positive.  It would be interesting to follow up further but the most important questions have now been answered.  Also, doing a study for 21 years took up a lot of my and my team&rsquo;s time, and we are now focusing on other issues.</p> <p>  The research has not yet been replicated by another research group.  It is more important for other research groups to carry out other studies than for us to continue to follow up on the children.  In scientific research, replication is always wanted.  It has not happened for some reason in respect of children born through surrogacy, partly because of the lack of funding and partly because it is quite difficult to do.  It takes a lot of time, effort and funding.  Were research funding to be made available, it would be useful to have another study to determine which of our findings stand up to retesting.  We are now 21 years on and attitudes to surrogacy have changed.  Many other things have changed too.  If I were a funder, that is where I would put the funding.</p></speech>

She has long been a campaigner for diverse families.  Her studies and research are based on a very small sample, perhaps of a couple of dozen people.  Given the small sample size, it is hard to arrive at a definitive conclusion.  Page 4 of Professor Golombok&rsquo;s document states:</p> <blockquote> 	Findings are presented of a study of families created through surrogacy arrangements.  Forty-two surrogacy families were compared with 51 egg-donation families and 80 natural-conception families. </blockquote> <p>Surely the best studies of family involve far bigger numbers.  Did Professor Golombok find it was difficult to do the research?  The numbers seem quite small.</p></speech>

The numbers are quite small.  It really comes back to the point I made about the need for replication.  Of course, there are different ways of studying families.  Our approach at the Centre for Family Research, Cambridge, is to do very in-depth longitudinal studies and obtain very in-depth data using many different methods and informants in the family.  Other researchers might survey larger numbers of people.  We need all these approaches.</p> <p>  Given the in-depth nature and reliability of the measures we used, we would certainly have picked up any moderate differences had they existed.  You cannot really make blanket statements about what constitutes a large or small sample; however, for family studies that are as in-depth as ours, you would usually and ideally aim for about 50 families in each group.  As it happened with the surrogacy ones, we managed to recruit only 42 within our sampling timeframe.  However, the 42 were very representative because we were fortunate in that we were able to collaborate with the UK&rsquo;s Office for National Statistics, which is where parental orders are registered when the intended parents become the legal parents of the child.  On our behalf, the Office for National Statistics approached the families and we had a very high response rate.  In some ways, the representativeness of the sample is more important than the number because, with volunteers, you might get only families with an axe to grind or families who are doing particularly well.  Those who are not doing well might not want to take part in research.   Representativeness is one big plus of the study but I completely acknowledge it is but one study.</p><p>The results have been positive but it would be helpful to have more research focusing on larger samples, though then the methods would necessarily be less in-depth.  </p></speech>

I am fascinated by the in-depth work Professor Golombok has carried out, the breadth of her research and its findings.  I am impressed by her clarification in the last contribution that the cohort is a representative sample based on wider statistics.  That information is now on the record, which allays any concerns regarding the sample size. </p> <p>  I was interested to hear that at seven years of age children born through surrogacy were much more advanced in their self-identification awareness than peers and this manifested itself in many cases in behavioural issues which effectively worked themselves out over the next couple of years.  Will Professor Golombok elaborate on that?</p></speech>

These researchers put it down to the fact that internationally adopted children are aware they are adopted, as is everybody else, because they look different from their adoptive parents.  They attributed the increase in problems at this age to having to deal with these issues at a younger age than other children.</p> <p>  In terms of our study, we cannot be definitive about why we found this slight increase.  I should state these children were still within the normal range.  It was a statistically significant increase compared to unassisted conception families but they were not showing clinical levels of problems.  The explanation in relation to international adoption made a lot of sense because the children knew they were born through surrogacy, many were in touch with the surrogate, other people knew, they were being asked questions about it and so on.  Given that how one is conceived can be an important part of one's identity and the story of one's life growing up, it seemed to make sense that having to deal with these issues at an earlier age could play into the reasons for this blip at age seven.  Interestingly, it was a pattern that was replicated with internationally adopted children.  I cannot say for sure it was the reason but, theoretically and drawing on related research, it seemed to make the most sense in trying to understand what was going on.  </p></speech>

There was one from Senator McGreehan.  It was a wonderful, pragmatic question and one I cannot answer today because I am in touch with a colleague in Paris trying to get some accessible information in English about the French adoption procedure with simple adoption.  I like what they call it: simple adoption.  The average waiting time for a decision is 4.7 months, as noted by the European Court of Human Rights.  Hopefully, I can submit information in writing in the weeks ahead as to how that is working in practice.</p> <p>  I appreciate as an academic researcher the arguments in principle against using second-parent adoption as a route to parentage in international surrogacy arrangements.  However, putting pragmatism over principle in the case of retrospective recognition of parentage and getting people and children the rights and legal situation they need, I favour a reconsidered type of second-parent adoption, which I hope I have made clear in the briefing document.  It strikes me there is no need for second-parent adoption to be the same as joint adoption by strangers.  Second-parent adoption throughout Europe always involves a child with a well-established familial bond with the second parent seeking to adopt.</p> <p>  I think I echo some of what Professor Madden was saying when I say I do not think the legislation should go ahead and do what it wants to do in the realm of domestic surrogacy.  I think there is a better approach.  I have tried as clearly as possible to outline that in the briefing document.  I would prefer to see Part 7 deleted because, as Professor O'Mahony said here a couple of weeks ago, the legislation we enact now will regulate this area for a generation.  I would rather it did so in a more balanced way.  In the UK, the Law Commission, in the report it will publish later this year, will include a stand-alone suggested surrogacy Bill.  We should go down a similar route, leaving the 2022 Bill to go ahead and regulate important assisted human reproduction matters and, importantly, set up the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, AHRRA.  I am not talking about a great amount of time, but more time might be needed to get those wanting to forge ahead with a domestic surrogacy regime on board with a pre-conception type of approach to such a regime.  For that reason, a stand-alone surrogacy Bill could be excellent and, as was made clear in the submission, the State could fully realise the true potential of the AHRRA in that regard.  </p></speech>

Other guests have said they do not want a stand-alone Bill.  They are afraid it will take too long and there too many issues hanging out in limbo.

Maybe this committee will suggest viable amendments to the Bill but if not, it looks like it will forge ahead and regulate surrogacy for a generation in this country.  There is a better way and more time is needed.  I do not see the rush.  I sat here in 2014 speaking on surrogacy in the Children and Family Relationships Act.  The surrogacy provisions were deleted from that legislation before it became an Act.  Here we are eight years later and I do not want this to go on for another eight years, but would six or 12 months make a massive difference?  I propose in the interim that reconstituting second-parent adoption would involve amendments to adoption legislation, which is not as big a deal as amending the 2022 Bill or a stand-alone surrogacy Bill.  There are pragmatic interim or stop-gap measures in the form of my recommendations on second-parent adoption or guardianship until we get the surrogacy Act the State needs.</p></speech>

They were brilliant.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on Professor Madden's points in her presentation about the idea of commercial surrogacy and being able to challenge its definition or the belief that commercial surrogacy is, by its very definition, for some reason unethical.  From the very beginning of this committee, and having looked at this issue as a woman who has had different lives in respect of socio-economic background and class, living on the one-parent family payment, being a young mother and having no third level education, I have felt at each stage of my life very much able to consent and to make decisions as to what I want to do and do not want to do with my life.  I have always been very interested in trying to tease out a little more this conversation and the kind of paternalistic feeling I get when these conversations about women's ability to engage in real, informed consent come up.  Could we therefore talk a little about how we begin to challenge that narrative?  I think it is an idea rather than a real thing that compensation means exploitation.  It is not necessarily true.  How do we begin to have those conversations?  We have laws on exploitation, coercion and human trafficking to capture when those things happen, but that does not mean we cannot also regulate for surrogacy that is compensated or that it cannot be ethical.  Can Professor Madden elaborate a little more on her thoughts on that?</p></speech>

It is something I have also been very interested in over the years.  I struggle with the idea that the word "commercial" in this context is almost a dirty word and equals exploitation.  When we talk about commercial surrogacy, we have to say what we mean.  Is it just where a woman is paid?  Does it depend on how much she is paid, the socio-economic circumstances of her life or the country in which she lives?  What if the payment is described as expenses?  What if non-profit agencies are involved?  Looking at all the other people involved in facilitation of a surrogacy arrangement, be they lawyers, counsellors, doctors, clinicians or nurses, they are paid for their involvement in this process.  There are three different ways of looking at this if we think about the issue of payment.  Either the surrogate gets nothing and has to pay for everything herself, which I do not think anybody is suggesting; she receives reimbursement at reasonable expenses and it is up to each jurisdiction to determine how that is calculated based on local economic factors; or she receives vouched expenses plus perhaps a living allowance or a gift to thank her for all she has done to help a childless family.  Some surrogates would not even accept such a gift.  As long as she is not coerced, induced, manipulated, threatened or tricked into carrying the pregnancy, as long as she is giving fully informed, voluntary consent, I wonder how the payment exploits her.  It could be counter-argued-----</p></speech>

I know this is a bit of a stretch, but I am trying to look at the language we use.  Say we were to force a situation whereby non-commercial surrogacy was not allowed or deemed unethical or illegal.  Could we say the inverse would also be true, that is, that to enforce altruism on somebody in a difficult situation can also be exploitative?  That way, the two positions negate each other at the end of the day if we are to balance them out.</p></speech>

I think I mentioned in my presentation earlier whether, when we think about altruism, it necessarily applies in, for example, family relationships, whereby somebody might be put under subtle or maybe even not-so-subtle pressure to act as a surrogate for a sister, cousin or family friend.  That kind of thing can be very pressurising as well.  To me, therefore, money is not the issue; it is about whether the person has the capacity - we must presume they do - to enter into this arrangement, knowing fully what they are getting involved in without any threat or coercion, economic, family or otherwise.  That, to me, is the most important thing when we think about exploitation rather than the money.</p></speech>

Senator McGreehan, I think you had a question for Professor Madden that was not answered earlier.</p></speech>

Every single person in the process is getting paid: the doctors, the solicitors - everyone.  I have four children.  It is not easy.  Is it unethical to expect a woman to do that, to be all virtuous, all grace and all love and to give all that for someone else just out of the goodness of her heart?  Many people use their bodies in many different ways for their professions.  I am not talking about sex; I am talking about sportspeople, models and many other people.  Is it actually unethical not to pay or to compensate a woman for doing such a tremendous thing?</p></speech>

I also have four children.  It is certainly not an easy role.  I see that point and share a lot of those concerns.  As I said a moment ago, if everybody else in the process is paid for their time, effort and expertise, it could be argued that not permitting the surrogate to receive payment could be considered to be exploitative and that it downplays and downgrades the very important role she plays in the process by bringing to term a much-wanted pregnancy and bringing a child into existence.  It could very easily be considered to be exploitative to expect her to do that and to undertake that reproductive labour for nothing while everybody else is paid for their participation.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Madden for giving us the opportunity to have this discussion.  Senator Ruane a number of weeks ago, very early in our meetings, touched on the idea of a paternalistic attitude that women cannot make this decision for themselves because of their socio-economic background or the county in which they live.  While I am not ignoring the fact that we need to put in place safeguards, one of the themes that comes across is that this is a matter of safeguards against intermediaries and what they may be up to and how they may exploit the situation for their own profit and that we need to focus on that, not whether or not the surrogate mother is paid, given that, potentially, she is the only person in the entire process who is not paid and we do not consider the actions of others to be unethical and do not challenge the fact that they are paid because we accept their professional role.  That would also be consistent with the non-sale of children if we are merely compensating people for their gestational services.  That is important, so I really appreciate that it has been raised.</p> <p>  As for intermediaries, Professor Madden's submission sets in place almost guidelines as to how we ensure that a surrogate mother reaches that level of consent personally, and I appreciate that.  I do not have a question about that other than to acknowledge it.  Professor Madden may wish to elaborate on it.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Tobin for his document.  Both witnesses' submissions are pragmatic.  I do depart from Dr. Tobin in his recommendations, as he may have expected I would, in that right now, today, in Dolphin House, in Temple Bar, there are families going into the family court looking for maintenance orders, access orders and so on, where family relationships have broken down and women are trying to get payment support for their children.  I can guarantee Mr. Tobin that not one of those mothers in those courts is the mother of a surrogate-born child because she has no rights.  She is afraid to go to court in cases of family breakdown because we have no legislation in place that would support her and we have completely abandoned those women and second parents, including those in same-sex couples.</p><p>We have abandoned their rights to the child who they have been there for and who they are parent to in the definitions under the Child and Family Relationships Act.  We need this urgently.  We need it urgently because there may be, for example, cases where a father has an illness that potentially will be fatal, those mothers and their children may be left without.  </p><p> To revert to the original statement by the Department of Health, they used words like "emotional" to suggest this is an emotional issue.  They referred to this as being a small group of people as a reason to carve this out, to kick it down the road and to stick their heads in the sand, rather than dealing with legislating for it.  From that perspective, I disagree.  </p><p> I had better stop speaking or I will not give Dr. Tobin a chance to speak.  However, I do appreciate the pragmatism in his submissions.  </p></speech>

My suggestion was to try to get Departments on board to give us a domestic surrogacy regime that would help to mitigate people having to go abroad or us having to accept double standards if more people could do it at home.</p> <p>  In the briefing document, I hope I made it clear that where a domestic regime is restrictive and is discouraging, intended parents will continue to go abroad.  I cannot see very many people at all wanting to avail of the domestic regime as described in Part 7.  That is my take on it.  That is where that recommendation is coming from.  I promise the Senator that it is well intended.  </p></speech>

Both of the witnesses are doing so.  I appreciate that that is not his intention.  My concern is that there are flaws and gaps that have been left as a result of the Child and Family Relationships Act, which undermine same-sex couples in particular.</p> <p>  On the issue of reciprocal IVF, the domestic arrangements proposal is deeply flawed.  We have had several people before the committee.  No doubt, when this legislation proceeds to Committee Stage, that will become apparent.  It is shocking that we had the report in 2005, in 2014 we had the Child and Family Relationships Act and in 2017 we had the original AHR legislation.  Now we are in 2022.  We cannot afford to have this postponed further.</p></speech>

I found it surprising that Part 7 differed in very little respect from Part 6 in the general scheme of the 2017 Bill.  These were five years apart but there was very little difference between them.  I found that shocking.  Like the Senator, I want to see all these practical concerns resolved.  Even in the recommendations about second-parent adoption or guardianship, I fully appreciate that they are not ideal, but let us try to get people the rights they need to care for their children in order that they can get what they need for their children and can be recognised as the parents of the children who are in the State and who are being raised by intended parents.</p></speech>

One of the issues that stands out from what Professor Madden said is that double standards are not always necessarily pejorative.  If we have different circumstances, it is understandable that different legal conditions may apply.  Ultimately, however, and I do not think anyone would disagree here, the committee needs to ensure there are no double standards for children at the end of the day.</p> <p>  The words that one of the witnesses spoke before the committee last week are still in my head.  They said that the best thing we can do for children is to support the certainty of parents and to prevent undermining parents, in order that they can parent effectively.  That is the best thing we can do to support children.  I apologise that I have been thinking out loud here a little.  We need to ensure that, even if we have separate processes, ultimately the children will have the same outcome at the end and they are not affected and discriminated against in any way at all.  </p> <p>  I wanted to explore a question with Professor Madden, who mentioned in a pre-birth assessment and a parenting order.  I do not remember the phrase she used but she referred to the assignment of parentage at birth or very shortly afterwards.  Could Professor Madden talk us through that?  We had some conversations last week about the benefits of legal certainty.  Equally, there was concern that this would not allow for the test of the best interests of the child and that any orders in relation to parentage should be done post birth.  From hearing the witnesses who have been before the many committee meetings, there seems to be a divide in the pre-birth and post-birth issue.  Could Professor Madden talk us through that?  Dr. Tobin&rsquo;s comments on that issue are welcome as well.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Deirdre Madden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022052600002#J01200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  My comments on pre-birth scrutiny and parental order flow from the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction&rsquo;s recommendations.  They seem like a lifetime ago.  They were published in 2005.  I chaired the subgroup of the commission on donor programmes and surrogacy.  The commission recommended that the child who was born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of the intended parents and that this was most in keeping with and consistent with the best interests of the child.</p> <p>  The pre-birth scrutiny of domestic surrogacy arrangements, or all surrogacy arrangements, would be to ensure that in advance of birth, all the legislative requirements have been met.  It is difficult to carry out a test of the best interests of the child either during a pregnancy or after a pregnancy.  We are used to best interest tests in the context of adoption where, for example, there is a child in existence for whom we are trying to find the best environment to live.</p> <p>  However, for a child who has not been born or who has just been born, what does it mean when we talk about the best interests of the child?  Will we have some sort of fitness-to-parent test for couples who have chosen this route by which to create their family?  We need to be very careful about any such suggestion because it could be potentially discriminatory against people who have backgrounds that may be seen as less than desirable.  I would not want to see any prejudicial criteria in existence in that respect.  The pre-birth scrutiny therefore would be to make sure that the woman, for example, has had the opportunity to take independent legal advice.</p> <p>  There would also be the other criteria, which I mentioned in my presentation, namely, that she is given fully informed consent and so on.  Everything should be aligned as regards the legislation.  At the moment of birth, the parentage should be certain, so that the intended parents are the legal parents of the child and do not have to wait for a month, six months or 12 months to have that clarity.  When we think about the best interests of the child, there might be medical circumstances that might arise whereby a consent would have to be given for medical treatment of a child.  The child would at that time be living with the intended parents but they would not have any legal rights to give consent for medical treatment.  There are therefore many practical consequences involved in the kind of parental order that has been suggested in the Bill, which I would certainly not be in favour of.  </p></speech>

I am also of the firm belief that the legislation really needs to go through this time.  There has been such uncertainty over the past few years and for the children and families, we need to give stability and certainty.  When speaking with Professor Susan Golombok, I felt the research on parenting and child adjustment in surrogacy families was highly positive.  We have had families before us and these are really heartbreaking stories.  The parents are so dedicated to the children that we must move on this now.  It is important we get a balance but this legislation must go through this time.</p> <p>  I have some questions for Professor Madden.  Her statement was excellent.  She feels the best way forward for Ireland is to ensure we have modern evidence-based surrogacy legislation domestically, so fewer people go abroad for surrogacy.  Will she explain that a bit more for me?  Another important part of her statement argued that we must consider how to best protect all those involved to the greatest degree possible, while recognising that we cannot regulate what happens in other countries.</p> <p>  This is important and we have all been touched by the witnesses we have heard from over the past few weeks.  Again, it is important that the legislation goes through as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-26a.1141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Deirdre Madden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022052600002#K00200"><p>I will be brief as I know we are up against the clock.  My conclusion is we cannot and should not ignore the reality of international surrogacy.  We cannot require the laws of other countries where surrogacy takes place to be the same as ours.  We must prioritise the rights and welfare of children, the surrogate but also the intended parents, because sometimes their interests and potential vulnerabilities are not prioritised in the same way.  We speak much about protection of surrogates but we must also have in mind the well-being of intended parents, who may have struggled for years to have a family and prepared in every way possible to become parents.  Their interests also deserve protection.</p> <p>  The best solution to my mind is to try to ensure the domestic system we have encourages people to stay here and have their surrogacy arrangement done here.  At the same time, we must recognise that this will not apply to everybody.  Some parents may want the surrogate to be somebody of the same ethnicity as them, for example, and they may wish for the child to be born in their country of origin.  Of course, they could have a family member or friend living abroad who is willing to be a surrogate for them.  Just because the process takes place internationally does not necessarily mean it is commercial in the sense we have been talking about here.</p> <p>  The mechanism by which we do something could be a pre-approval process by a regulator on the basis of an approved list of countries, perhaps, where the regulator has done due diligence, for example, and is satisfied the legal protections are as close as they are to those in Ireland.  Once all the legal criteria are satisfied in the country where the child is born - this may require a judicial process in that country - and the parents return to Ireland with the child, recognition of parentage could be given via court order.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Dr. Tobin states the 2022 Bill provides for altruistic domestic surrogacy but any amendment to this draft legislation would have to be willing to embrace commercial surrogacy arrangements and that is the first inconsistency the State will have to be willing to accept in principle.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Does Dr. Tobin have any objection, in principle, to commercial surrogacy and if not, why not?  Does he believe Irish law should formally recognise commercial surrogacy here and abroad?  Why do most countries ban commercial surrogacy?  Does he share the concerns of the UN special rapporteur on sale and sexual exploitation of children that commercial surrogacy can easily amount to the sale of children and therefore, the practice cannot be in their best interest, by definition?</p> <p>  Towards the end of his submission, Dr. Tobin indicates that in the case of male same-sex parents, the birth certificate proposed would not record the child's mother, and thus the child would have no legal mother at birth.  Every child has a mother, however, so is Dr. Tobin proposing the birth certificates do not properly reflect the reality of the child's parentage?</p></speech>

It should be remembered that we are proposing to set up a national surrogacy register and that, to my mind, is where the surrogate's details should be registered and made available to the child at the age of 16, as it is proposed in the 2022 Bill.  The birth certificate should, where possible, reflect intended parentage, whether is opposite-sex intended parents or same-sex intended parents, but with the surrogate's information placed in the necessary repository, which is the national surrogacy register, NSR.<br/><br/>I hope it is clear from the briefing document - I do not know if the Senator had time to read it - that I am very much aware of the UN special rapporteur's recommendations on sale of children.  In making recommendations I very much try to avoid not complying with her recommendations.  She tells us things like contractual arrangements dealing with legal and physical transfer of parentage, with no right to object for the surrogate are massively problematic.  I respect that and I totally agree with her position, although it does, to some extent, fetter what we can do in legislation.  It can be difficult, practically, to provide for the surrogate's right to object if we go ahead with the recommendation of some activists and academics for pre-birth court orders for the domestic model, for example.  I absolutely do not agree with that.  As I said in my statement, the AHRRA would be an appropriate body for this, and there is evidence for that as well.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I recommended to the committee to take time with this is that I am <i>au fait</i>with ongoing law reform projects in both the UK and New Zealand.  They have been going on in the UK since 2017.  The committee has been given a very short timeframe to do something that is so complex.</p></speech>

My recommendation on taking time and getting Departments on board really comes from a good place.</p> <p>  There is the question of the potential payment of surrogates and I keep an open mind on this.  The UK's Law Commission has put this out in its consultation paper and I am waiting to see what it comes back with.  I do not believe it will come back in favour of letting the market set the payment for surrogates and I am not in favour of that fully commercial model.  There could potentially be a more compensated model.  The briefing document considered Greece and the UK and that is what altruistic surrogacy seems to be, largely, in practice.  I am certainly keeping an open mind as to the potential for compensating surrogates.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Madden and Dr. Tobin for coming to the meeting to share their expertise with us.  Dr. Tobin said we have the tough task of making our deliberations within a tight period of time.  We can only do that because of experts like him, so I thank him.  I was interested to hear both witnesses talk about the need for legislation and regulation for international surrogacy.  That is a key point we have heard repeatedly from experts in this field.  That is our remit, so it is encouraging to hear that again.</p> <p>  Professor Madden spoke a little about the UK experience and about something I have raised in this committee previously, which is the need for as much as possible to be done in advance of the birth.  I know that is difficult when one is dealing with different countries with different rules and regulations, but I fully agree with her on that premise.  Dr. Tobin spoke about the Verona Principles, which was very interesting.  I did a lot of work with the Adoption Authority of Ireland a number of years ago and a question I have put to others previously is whether we should be looking at having bilateral agreements with countries where the Verona Principles are applied.  If we do, is that practically possible, given that, as Professor Madden said, we cannot control whether or how another country regulates?  That is the challenging circumstance in which we are operating.  I would value the input of both witnesses on that question.  What do they think the ideal would be in terms of how we can deal with the countries that do this best?</p></speech>

That is ideally what we would like, perhaps, but it is a long way off.  I spoke in my presentation about the fact we cannot require or expect countries in which surrogacy takes place to have the same legal provisions as ours.  That is simply a fact.  What I would like to see is that the regulatory system we have here would be satisfied that, wherever the surrogacy takes place, the law and practice - practice has to follow the law - in the relevant country provide as close as possible to an equivalency of the protection we have in Ireland.  It will not be exactly the same because the legislation in both countries will not mirror each other, but for all practical purposes, the most important criteria we would like to see in any legal regime relate to the protection of the surrogate, making sure she is informed and has independent legal advice and ensuring she has proper psychological screening and support, medical assistance and the like.  If those are the things we agree are the most important to ensure she is protected, the regulator would have to do due diligence to make sure that wherever the surrogacy is taking place provides that same level of protection.  The welfare of children would also have to form part of that to make sure it is at least equivalent to what would be applicable here.  For me, once all those legal criteria are satisfied in that country and the parents return to Ireland with the child, recognition of parentage in Ireland should flow from that.  That is the system I would like to see.</p></speech>

Few jurisdictions would fully qualify or come close in terms of law and practice to what is proposed in Ireland under the 2022 Bill.</p> <p>  Regarding the Verona Principles, I was involved in a debate in London on those principles over a weekend and even trying to hammer out agreement in that room among experts from the UK and Ireland was difficult.  That is why the principles are quite broad as well.  They are wonderful guiding principles that could lead to something like an international treaty in the area, but states differ from what the principles allow in terms of latitude also.  Like Professor Madden, I would love if there were an international consensus in the form of a treaty.  For the moment, we have to stick by principle No. 10 in the Verona Principles and have post-birth best interests of the child determinations whenever an international surrogacy takes place.</p></speech>

On the behalf of the committee, I welcome to our meeting from the International Social Service, ISS, Mr. Jean Ayoub, secretary general and CEO, Ms Jeanette Woellenstein, director of the international centre of children and Ms Carlotta Alloero, senior liaison officer.  They are all joining us online and I thank them very much for coming in today.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I am required to repeat the note on privilege and housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their own domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I would like to remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm, prior to making their contribution, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  </p> <p>  I call on Mr. Ayoub to make his opening statement please.  </p></speech>

We are very pleased to have the opportunity to share with the committee further insights on the Verona Principles for the protection of the rights of the child who has been born through surrogacy.</p> <p>  The Verona Principles were published in March 2021 after a five-year long consultation process.  Several members of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, CRC, endorsed these principles, along with its drafting work.  The ISS also could count on the support of the United Nations special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, as well as other international organisations that are working on matters related to children&rsquo;s rights and surrogacy.  The ISS engaged on this extensively and recognised the existence of important legal and practical gaps when it comes to respecting the rights of children who are born through surrogacy, despite the increasing recourse to assisted reproductive technologies, including through surrogacy.  </p> <p>  The variety of domestic legal responses to surrogacy has led to persons seeking to have a child through surrogacy making the necessary arrangements in a surrogacy-friendly jurisdiction.  This, together, with the financial benefits that might be gained, has resulted in the casual development of an international commercial surrogacy market with inherent risks of human rights abuses.  It also has led to extremely complex and delicate cross-border problems in terms of safeguarding the rights of the children concerned.</p> <p>  While over the past years, case law has been developing from the perspective of children&rsquo;s rights, neither the convention on the rights of the child nor any other international instrument deals explicitly with this question, leaving the different interpretations open.  Therefore, nearly ten years ago, the ISS called for international recognition of surrogacy arrangements as they affect the children concerned.  In this context, the ISS launched an initiative in 2016 to draw a set of principles that could be agreed on globally to guide and inform policy and legislation.</p> <p>  With the permission of the Chair, I will hand over to my associate, Ms Woellenstein.  </p></speech>

This core group was responsible for regularly reviewing and adjusting the draft in the light of wider consultations.  Consultations took place in Verona, Zurich, Israel, London, Geneva, The Hague, Cape Town and Cambodia.  They have involved a broad group of experts and observers, including the UN CRC committee, government officials, representatives of The Hague Conference on Private International Law, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, the UN special rapporteur, academics, members of the judiciary and practitioners from multidisciplinary backgrounds representing all regions in the world.</p><p>The lived experience of donor-conceived and surrogate-born persons were also sought and received.</p><p> The Verona Principles are divided into 18 interrelated principles that are all drafted from the standpoint of children's rights.  They are inspired by, and grounded in, the provisions of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, its second optional protocol on the sale of children, and other relevant international human rights instruments.  They stipulate comprehensive safeguards and protections for children born through surrogacy that should be established in relevant legislation, policy and decision-making processes.  However, outside the scope of these principles are any ethical considerations as to whether surrogacy in any form should be permitted or prohibited.  Hence the principles should not be used as a basis for condoning or encouraging surrogacy.</p><p> The Verona Principles are based on the premise that no child should be disadvantaged, suffer harm or be punished because of the circumstances of his or her birth.  Compliance with the procedures and safeguards set out in these principles requires that regulation of surrogacy in any form excludes violations of the human rights of children, such as discrimination, statelessness, abuse and lack of access to origins.  Forms that constitute or lead to the sale of children should be prohibited by law.</p><p> The principles are addressed to all states, public and private entities, civil society organisations, professionals and individuals, including surrogate mothers, intending parents and persons providing human reproductive material who are or may be directly or indirectly involved in surrogacy.  It is our sincere hope the principles can assist the committee to hold informed discussions on the complex ethical, legal and human rights questions that are raised by surrogacy.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

We are grateful they are here.</p> <p>  At the core of the Verona Principles are the rights of the child.  In that context, we want to ensure the child knows who he or she is and that the child has that fundamental right to his or her identity and gestational story.  Attendant to that is the circumstances surrounding the birth.  We must acknowledge that this little person is going to live a lifetime with the story of how he or she came into being.</p> <p>  Already this morning we have heard from Professor Golombok regarding outcomes for children and how they cope with the fact they were born via surrogacy within the domestic arrangements of the UK.  The committee heard that the earlier a child is told, the more adjusted he or she is to that fact as part of his or her story.  Aligned to that is the concern we have for surrogate mothers.  There is a need to ensure they are not exploited.  We have also talked this morning about the right of a woman to make decisions.  We should not assume based on the country of origin or their socioeconomic background that such mothers do not have the right to make decisions.  Last week, we heard from the UN rapporteur that it is all right to compensate for the gestational services as long as that compensation is not contingent upon the surrender of parental rights and the transfer of a child.  That is the distinction of sale.</p> <p>  Children in Ireland are extremely disadvantaged by the circumstances of their birth at present.  We are proposing a domestic arrangement but we need to address the fact we are a small population.  Even with the best domestic arrangement, people still travel internationally for what are legal services abroad.  In those other countries, the birth certificates of those babies will in many instances represent the intended parent as opposed to the surrogate mother.  The sort of mechanisms we are looking at, and at which academics have looked before us, include some sorts of pre-conception considerations, a threshold for the circumstances around the surrogate mother, the knowledge and awareness of the parents and the commitment to the identity of the child.  We are also considering pre-birth arrangements so the child is not left stateless and is not left without a parent who can give consent for medical care once they arrive home in Ireland and before the judicial process is completed here.  There would then follow a post-birth transfer of sorts.</p> <p>  Have our guests given consideration to good models?  Are we going down the right route?  I would welcome our guests' comments on the route we should take.</p></speech>

She addressed many aspects that are duly considered in, and key to, the Verona Principles.  I invite the Senator to look at principle 5, which foresees certain pre-surrogacy protections.  The Senator referred to pre-conception and we call those considerations pre-surrogacy protections.  I think the committee is very much on the right path in that regard.</p> <p>  Principle 5 deals with pre-surrogacy protections.  It calls for screenings, multidisciplinary assessments, informed consent of involved parties and a review of the surrogacy arrangements.  It states that all these assessments should be done by independent professionals who have no perceived or actual conflict of interests in the surrogacy.</p> <p>  A distinction is made in these pre-surrogacy protections about the legal issues that should be dealt with to minimise the risk of disagreement concerning the determination of legal parentage post birth.  There are other aspects included that are linked with health issues that should be determined.  The principle calls for psychosocial suitability assessments, ongoing supports and counselling by independent and qualified professionals for the surrogate mother and the intending parents.</p> <p>  There is also a clause at the end that relates to matters the committee is considering now, which is encouraging.  If there are no pre-surrogacy protections in place, there should automatically be a post-birth best interests determination, especially when it comes to the determination and transfer of legal parentage.  Principle 5 will give the committee some important responses to the questions the Senator has raised.</p> <p>  Principle 6 deals with the best interests of the child, which should be the paramount consideration.  It is a strong principle in all decisions about legal parentage and parental responsibility of a child born through surrogacy.  This principle refers much more to the post-birth best interests assessments and determinations.</p><p>Many answers can be found in this principle.  There are also references to international surrogacy arrangements.  Best interest determinations should take place if there is at least one country involved that prohibits surrogacy.</p><p> The Senator raised other concerns.  The Verona Principles are based on the premise that, where surrogacy occurs, it creates and severs relationships.  As such, there should be openness in relationships and, where appropriate, they should be valued and sustained.  There is this element of transparency in many of the principles.  For example, principle 11 refers to the protection of identity and access to origins.  It takes a strong position on access to information and the importance of the surrogate mother as well as the persons providing human reproductive materials.  It calls for the provision of verified and accurate identifying information and for participants to agree to the transmission of that information before entering the arrangement.  It encourages open surrogacy arrangements as an important safeguard for identity rights and access rights.  It also encourages post-birth contact.</p><p> During our discussions and negotiations, we dealt with concerns for the surrogate mother extensively.  There is a specific principle calling for her consent prior to entering the arrangement, during the pregnancy and post birth.  This is principle 7.  Confidence in the integrity of the surrogacy arrangement's circumstances is crucial for respecting children's rights.  This principle on the consent of the surrogate mother also contains certain eligibility criteria to ensure that hers is a self-determined choice and she exercises free and informed decision making.</p><p> I hope that I have responded to the Senator's main concerns.</p></speech>

They are broad, high-level principles, but what has been the experience of countries trying to implement them or build on them through their own legislation?  Part of our work is trying not to reinvent the wheel.  If we could see how others have applied the principles, it would be an important lesson for us.</p> <p>  One of the principles refers to a post-birth interests determination.  This is a conversation that we have been having in recent weeks and I asked the witnesses who appeared just before this session about it.  In some respects, there is a tension between what can be done before birth, what can be done post birth and the importance of legal certainty.  This is a matter that our committee will have to decide on for ourselves.  In terms of their discussions and agreements, do the witnesses have further information on this matter, how did the ISS come to its decision and what were the various contributions and positions involved?</p> <p>  These two questions are broad enough without me adding more.</p></speech>

As he will understand, the principles are aspirational and recall international standards in children's rights.  However, they try to take into account current realities.  If the Deputy reads through them, he will see that some of their provisions deal explicitly with states that permit surrogacy, states that prohibit it and states that simply encounter it.  They are aspirational, but the idea was not to be too prescriptive.  They are meant to take into account realities that exist on the ground as well as some promising practices.  By looking at the various consultations in different regions in the world, we were able to learn more about some surrogacy systems or legislative measures that already have some experience behind them.  The principles are informed by promising practices.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Ayoub has information on whether they have served to inspire legislators and policymakers to implement them in practice, but it might be too early to say, as they were only adopted last year.  Since then, we have been disseminating and promoting them, but we do not know whether they have led to concrete changes and implementations in practice.  Does Mr. Ayoub wish to jump in on this point before I move on to best interest determinations?</p></speech>

The principles were published in March of last year.  Our approach has been to make them aspirational.  We hope that more governments will take on the offer of turning these aspirational principles into procedures and articles of law and vote on them.  I do not know of any government that has specifically asked for our advice on the Verona Principles and how to implement them in law.  There might be some governments implementing them of which we are not aware.</p> <p>  I wish to add something about the consultation process.  It was clear from our-----</p></speech>

Every time we have heard someone insulting or cursing us, we have invited him or her to the table at The Hague, in Zurich, in Geneva and elsewhere so as to take into consideration everything that could be injected into these principles.</p><p>That is why, on the one hand they are good and they are aspirational.  On the other hand, we took the opinion of more than 100 experts during these five years.  Our hope, in very simple and practical terms, is that there would be a reference document for legislators to take on board, adapt and adopt to national legislation, culture, practices and best practice and that we remain as the custodians or guardians of the principles to be able to provide any insights, which is what we are doing today, in terms of what we believe.  We cannot pretend that we have knowledge of all of the differences and arguments in each country.  We are not experts in that but we can provide a reference from our experience of how these principles work and why we believe that every single country should take them on board, adapt and adopt them in national legislation.</p></speech>

The principles are providing guidance to an important working group that is in place in The Hague, led by the permanent bureau of The Hague Conference on Private International Law.  The group is discussing potential future instruments on legal parentage coming from surrogacy arrangements.  We are advocating for these principles because they really highlight the safeguards that should be taken into consideration for any future instruments, safeguards that have not been taken into consideration so far.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Many of the principles as laid out would raise constitutional issues in Ireland.  Principle No. 11, for example, refers to the protection of identity and access to origins.  This is particularly relevant in Ireland in the current climate in the context of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, for example.  It is an issue that is very much on people's minds right now, particularly in the context of the rights of the child.  The Verona Principles were only established last year and there is no concrete evidence yet of people taking them on but I am struck by how many natural rights are included.  Some countries would already be enforcing some of these principles just in terms of the law of the land.  When this work was done, was each country looked at individually in terms of how its current model contravenes the principles?  I ask that in the context of Ireland's current parental order model.  I ask the witnesses to comment on how Ireland's current parental order model contravenes many of the principles and how we can best reform our current model in order to meet the principles as laid out.</p></speech>

Of course, they shared certain concerns that their current legislation was not really in line with the principles but the principles are supposed to be aspirational.  They are supposed to protect the rights of children born through surrogacy.  Many issues were raised but there was always the hope that this might eventually lead to changes in legislation and policy with the aim of protecting the rights of children born through surrogacy.  These concerns were taken into account and they led to changes in the exact formulation of the principles.  As one can imagine, over the course of five years the principles changed extensively.  The wording and the approach were reviewed because we always had this reality check and feedback from practitioners in different Legislatures.  Of course, it is a balancing act.  The principles are supposed to be aspirational.  They are not supposed to be too prescriptive.  That was the approach with regard to the principles and the hope is that they lead to concrete changes in practice.</p></speech>

One must read principle No.15 on transparency in financial matters along with principle No. 14.  The approach adopted is that at a minimum, in order to prevent improper financial or other gain in connection with surrogacy, one needs transparency and accountability for any financial transactions.  Principle No.15 holds that there should be written accounts and that information should be made available to courts and competent authorities with regard to remuneration, especially involving intermediaries.  Remuneration should be reasonable and in line with comparable work in the field.  All of the principles are interlinked and one must read them together.  They do not take a stand on whether there should be remuneration or not.</p></speech>

These principles are a very useful guideline for the future regulation of surrogacy.  In Ireland we have had no regulation at all so we have a lot of families that are in limbo.  I ask the witnesses to comment on dealing with the regulation of families formed through surrogacy retrospectively who are living in Ireland at the moment.</p> <p>  International surrogacy is an incredibly complex area.  As the witnesses outlined, no country has actually taken on board the Verona Principles.  At the moment in Ireland we have no regulation and obviously that leaves a lot of people at risk of exploitation by bad actors.  Is any form of regulation better than the current situation we have?  If, for example, we could not implement 100% of the Verona Principles, is getting to 80% or 90% better than the current non-regulation of surrogacy?</p></speech>

With regard to retrospective regulation of surrogacy arrangements, if my recollection is correct it has not really come up during discussions while we drafted the principles.  We can have a look at the archives and minutes and see whether different positions or debate have come up in this regard.  We will take that question with us and write back to the committee, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Their recommendations do not necessarily differ whether there is no regulation or whether the regulation is poor.</p> <p>  Of course, if Ireland implements some of the Verona principles that would be very encouraging for us but I merely wanted to share with the committee the position on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that no regulation and a poorly regulated system might put children and all involved parties equally at risk.</p></speech>

It is important that we take them into serious consideration and work through them in this committee.  We see on a European level, I hope, that the Verona principles will be the precursor to a European model of surrogacy and a framework that each country can use.  How close are we, in terms of a timeline, to the Commission and the Parliament looking at this and creating that framework based on the Verona principles?</p></speech>

I am sorry.  I am much more accustomed to seeing my associates speak rather than myself because I am not the expert.  I am merely an economist leading this organisation and very proud of its achievement.</p> <p>  The simple answer for me is we cannot give the Senator a timeline.  I will give an example that can probably answer or support some of the comments that were made a couple of minutes earlier.  Ten days ago, we were at a large meeting in Germany where the federal government was celebrating the 82nd meeting of the socio-legal support activities in the country.  In one of the side meetings, I had a couple of high court judges and one child rights expert working with the Ministry of Justice and there was a question similar to what was asked about what if we adopt the surrogacy principles as they are and whether that would be better than having no law at all.  The answer, not necessarily from me but from the group, is that in Germany, probably like Ireland - I am not comparing - that has some very advanced and structured laws in terms of child protection and in terms of human rights, there should be some adaptation, upgrades or transformation of current laws in order for the principles to have a better fit in national legislation.</p> <p>  I am a little traumatised by the European level.  I discovered this organisation through a couple of Hague Conventions, mainly the 1996 Hague Convention.  Then Brussels II was invented and Brussels II bis was invented.  If, today, The Hague Permanent Bureau is working on certain principles, it is not ours to initiate something beyond European and more global on regulations for surrogacy.  I am not sure if the European model would be better or not.</p> <p>  On behalf of our organisation, I say frankly that we were happy and super excited that we were contacted by this committee for an opinion because this was our first government and if that goes through, we will have more arguments for other countries, European or non-European, to push further with supports and the added value they could have in national legislation.</p></speech>

First, it is great that we are the first country.  It goes to show our dedication and commitment to this for the surrogates and the families.  How can we apply the principles in practice to surrogacy arrangements to ensure they are upheld?  That would be the main thing.  How do we ensure this?  How can they guide us on this?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses so much.  I have been listening.  We are going from one committee to another and it is difficult.

We have had continuous reflections on whether there would be a need to develop further complementary guidance.  We have the principles, but would there be a need to go into implementation handbooks or guides that also provide more detail on promising practices that exist in certain country contexts?  This is a constant reflection we have had throughout the drafting process and that we keep on having.</p> <p>  The starting point would be to go through the principles, which I guess many committee members have already done, and maybe identify the concerning areas, for instance, if this would be feasible with the current national legislation or not and what would be needed in terms of changes to be introduced.  On many aspects, the principles are operational.  They talk about procedural safeguards.  They talk about competent authorities.  Would it be feasible to introduce a focal point, an authority, that is responsible for surrogacy matters, that has some prerogatives with regard to monitoring and that could be also the focal point to collaborate with other legislation.  At the beginning, a committee member mentioned that the State is being faced with Irish nationals who still go abroad and come back with a child.  The principles have some good implementation points that the committee can work with but, of course, with additional resources, we would be able to develop much more guidance and go a little further on how to implement concretely the principles.</p> <p>  I am not sure I responded to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It is worth noting that the principles are aspirational, and until such time as they are embedded in an international agreement, we will have to deal with the imperfect and take the principles as guidance.  They will certainly be influential in our thinking as a committee in our recommendations for Irish law, but we must also wrestle with that imperfect.</p> <p>  Last week, we had before the committee a former UN rapporteur who talked about the surrogate mother needing to be recorded on the birth certificate, yet we have the difficulty that we in Ireland cannot prescribe what is going to be on a birth certificate in another jurisdiction, and another jurisdiction may have legal frameworks that allow and oblige the intended parents to be recorded on the birth certificate.  Currently, for parents leaving a country with a baby to come home, there are mandatory reporting elements obliged by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs as part of applying for an emergency travel document for that child.  The parents must contact the health board to notify it that the child is about to arrive into the jurisdiction.  They must then notify the courts to expect that there are going to be legal proceedings and the parents must give an undertaking on that.  We need to have a mechanism, possibly within the Irish courts system as part of that mechanism, whereby there is a mandatory notification at the point of travelling home to oblige registration on a surrogacy certificate or surrogacy register and which aligns with a pre-conception agreement or phase - something along those lines.  That is probably going to be a suggested workaround from me for the fact we must deal with the imperfect and yet want to make sure the child has the right to know everything about himself or herself.  Have the witnesses seen models of that?  In their consideration, how do we deal with the fact we cannot legislate extrajudicially for another jurisdiction?</p></speech>

At the very beginning the principles foresaw that it would be in the best interests of any child born through surrogacy to have the surrogate mother as the legal parent at birth.  Then throughout the drafting process, and having consulted different experts and practitioners, the principles developed and were not at all prescriptive on that point.  If the Senator takes a look at the principles on legal parenthood and parental responsibility, it distinguishes between different state approaches that are possible in this regard.  In the case of states that determine by the operation of law at birth that a person is already a legal parent, then the question is what happens once this legal parentage should be transferred.  The position the principles take right now is to take into account these different approaches and say that, whatever the approach, the child needs to have at least one legal parent at birth and after that we can talk about the transfer of legal parentage.</p> <p>  The principles have developed a lot, and then there is the principle on birth notification, registration and certification.  This is principle 12 where we try to deal with these questions around registration and certification.  As we said at the beginning, we consulted donor-conceived persons and surrogate-born persons.  There were different opinions with regard to their birth certificates.  Some people found it extremely important to have the name of the surrogate mother on their birth certificate, at least the original one.  Others felt it was not important to them because the intending parents were their parents.  We looked at where lessons were learned with regard to the integrated birth certificate, which exists for some adoptees in some states.  For example, in Australia there are forms of these integrated birth certificates.  It is really a birth certificate specific for adoptees and that traces the name and identity of the birth parents as well as the adoptive parents.  This integrated birth certificate model was considered and is dealt with to some extent in principle 12.  This principle says there should be updates of birth records, and of course birth records should always be kept up to date, but there might be a need to develop them further or have an additional certificate for surrogate-born persons.  It is an encouragement to go this far but we know there are different views and positions held by the persons concerned, namely, donor-conceived persons and surrogate-born children.</p></speech>

How does that preserve a child's right to privacy?  For a child to commence school, a birth certificate must be produced.  How is the child's right to privacy preserved in that case in order that he or she is not discriminated against?  I ask because it is the child's story ultimately whether there is a donor.  It is the child who should always have the right whether to disclose such information to others.  If we end up with an integrated birth certificate, that right of disclosure is removed from the child.</p></speech>

Taking into account that birth certificates in some contexts are used for school, health insurance and accessing different services, there should be a separate document the child or person can use freely and that it is not necessarily required for doing certain administrative steps or procedures, especially to avoid discrimination, as the Senator has said.  It concerns not only a person's right to disclosure but also the right to non-discrimination.  It is a right not to share with the world, school or health insurance that this is a person who has been born through surrogacy.</p></speech>
