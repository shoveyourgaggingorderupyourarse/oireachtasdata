Joining us online are Mr. Con Traas of the Apple Farm and Mr. Donal Sheehan of Biodiversity Regeneration in a Dairying Environment, known as the BRIDE Project.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the witnesses to the meeting and thank them for appearing before us to share their expertise.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I now invite Dr. Dunford to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Dunford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#A00300"><p>It is a pleasure to be here and I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  I hope my contribution will be of relevance to the committee's urgent and important work.  When I was thinking about how best to contribute to that work, I felt that the experience we have in County Clare of working with farmers, scientists and others to address environmental challenges in the Burren for over two decades might provide both learning and inspiration.</p> <p>  I will relate a short story first of all.  In the late 1990s, the relationship between farming and environmental interests in the Burren was very broken, much as it appears to be today at a national level.  The main source of frustration at the time was the introduction of special areas of conservation, SAC, designations which farmers felt severely restricted their freedom to farm and to earn a living.</p><p>These designations were intended to curb damaging activities to the greatest jewel in Ireland&rsquo;s crown, the Burren, but how could this be done without the support and engagement of those who owned the land, the livestock and the knowledge needed to look after it?  The first, small step to resolving this dilemma, and a very important one, was taken by local farm leaders, in particular Michael Davern, who felt that, with these new environmental challenges, there also had to be opportunities.  &ldquo;Better to light a candle than curse the dark&rdquo; was the strategy.  This brave local leadership, and there is a great example of it here today in Donal Sheehan, quickly unlocked the support of research institutions such as UCD, Teagasc and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and led to the EU-funded BurrenLIFE project which went on to co-create, with farmers, a blueprint for sustainable farming in the region.  This research and strong local support in turn unlocked CAP funding via the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enable the roll-out of the Burren programme across 23,000 ha of land in the region, and this programme continues today.</p><p> This journey, of which I have been privileged to be part, along with many exceptional colleagues, including those with me here today, is still a work in progress, as it must remain.  However, much has been achieved.  For example, an external evaluation in 2020 found that the Burren programme had generated &euro;33 million worth of landscape and biodiversity improvements, a &euro;23 million boost to the local economy and an additional &euro;9.4 million in payments to local farmers.  Therefore, sustainable management can pay and can deliver for the local community.</p><p> The question is what we can learn from this case study in addressing Ireland&rsquo;s current and deeply interwoven climate and biodiversity emergencies.  The answer is &ldquo;quite a lot&rdquo;, and I would like to distil these learnings under three headings: the pocket, the head and the heart.  With regard to the pocket, we must understand farming is a business but in most cases the farmer is only paid for one of the ecosystem services generated - food &ndash; and often at the expense of others, such as biodiversity, water quality and carbon, for which there is a demand but not a market.  In the Burren, we addressed this by developing a simple scorecard to capture these services at field level on a scale of one to ten, and linking these scores to payments, thereby putting a price on biodiversity and water quality.  Farmers quickly responded, sometimes very innovatively, to this clear incentive, and they were also able to avail of additional capital funding to address particular challenges on their farms, such as protecting vulnerable springs or removing invasive scrub, which further improved their field scores and payments.</p><p> Through this payment for performance system, farmers felt respected, they had more freedom to farm and to innovate and payments were seen as hard earned but fair, unlike the standard compensation and penalty-based approaches.  For the taxpayer, the system offers a guarantee that if a farmer delivers less, he or she gets paid less.  For the policymaker, the system generates real-time data on programme impact, which in the Burren&rsquo;s case has been an annual improvement in the region&rsquo;s environmental health over the past decade, bucking national trends.</p><p> There is no reason such results-based incentives cannot be mainstreamed.  The science is there in terms of scorecards for a variety of habitats, species and environmental priorities, including carbon sequestration.  Thanks to this work, much of it initiated and led by Dr. James Moran, Ireland is considered to be a European leader in results-based payments.  It is vital the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan builds meaningfully on this reputation and this opportunity.</p><p> With regard to the head, to farm for nature and climate, farmers need better research, advice and support, just as they receive if farming beef, dairy or tillage.  That this support is provided at a local level is critical because farmers have such a strong sense of the local but also because ecosystem services are very place specific.  In the case of the Burren programme, having a local support office in Carran has built a strong sense of pride and ownership among farmers and relieved them of much of the bureaucratic burden that often plagues such schemes.</p><p> The third piece of the jigsaw, which is often overlooked, is the heart.  If any of us are passionate about what we do, we will do it better, and farmers are no different.  We urgently need to reimagine the role of farmers as first responders to our climate and biodiversity emergencies.  It is very important we reimagine what farming is about and what it can deliver for society.  We need to encourage farmers to embrace this role wholeheartedly, which is quite a challenge.  In the Burren, a local charity, the Burrenbeo Trust, has run stewardship courses in local schools from which several thousand Burren children, the future guardians of the landscape, have graduated.  Monthly walks and talks, often led by local farmers, and a Winterage festival and school on sustainable farming are among the many initiatives created by Burrenbeo to empower farmers and build bridges of understanding between farmers and the wider public.</p><p> In 2018, with Bord Bia support, Burrenbeo established the Farming for Nature Ambassadors initiative, identifying exemplary farmers across Ireland and sharing their stories through videos, farm walks and webinars.  These farmers, among them Donal Sheehan, are reframing the negative narrative around farming and the Irish environment, reimagining the role of the farmer and sharing invaluable knowledge and inspiration among their peers.  I congratulate Norman and Michael Dunne, who are this year&rsquo;s public vote winners of the Farming for Nature Ambassadors award.  They are amazing tillage farmers from County Kildare.</p><p> If Irish farmers can take more ownership of the environmental agenda and be supported and rewarded, as Burren farmers have been, then we can have real hope of Ireland becoming the green heart of the European Green Deal and of creating a brighter future for our rural people and places.</p></speech>

I work as a lecturer in biology and ecology in the department of natural resources and the environment at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, where I lead the agro-ecology and rural development, ARD, research group.  The group concentrates its work on sustainable agricultural and land use systems, with a particular focus on the Common Agricultural Policy and improving agri-environment policy and practice.  In my presentation today, I wish to concentrate on policy advice for a more integrated approach to land use policy and practice, cognisant of a range of national and international commitment and societal needs.  I plan to focus in particular on the interactions between agriculture and the environment.  It is clear that climate change and biodiversity decline are interconnected challenges which cannot be addressed without building a sustainable food system.  We need to have a more integrated land use policy and practice that focuses on optimising land use and making the best use of our land resources to meet our commitments and societal needs.</p> <p>  We are not in a good place as regards the current state or direction of travel with regards to the interactions between land use and the environment.  We are not at as bad a starting point as some countries but that does not mean we are in a good place.  Based on national monitoring data, we see 85% of our EU protected habitats in unfavourable or inadequate condition, with 46% of these exhibiting a declining trend, while water quality is deteriorating, with pristine water bodies declining from 500 to 20 in just 30 years.  Some 30% of the area of semi-natural grassland monitored has been lost in the past ten to 15 years, and total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions per hectare continue to rise.  There is some positive news at local level, as exemplified by work in the Burren and other areas, where locally adapted pilot projects focused on results-based payments for biodiversity and other ecosystem services, such as flood storage, carbon sequestration and improved water quality, have proven successful through enhanced peatland, grassland and woodland management.</p> <p>  The threats have been identified, the solutions have been developed at local level and, now, the challenge is to scale up the implementation of these solutions.  In transitioning to modern land use strategies to meet societal needs, we must avoid going from production tunnel vision to an emissions tunnel vision approach.  The Government declared a biodiversity and climate emergency in May 2019, an important step recognising that climate change and biodiversity loss are interrelated problems threatening food security and the sustainability of our agricultural systems.  We need to deal with these in an integrated manner.  We must maximize the co-benefits of biodiversity and climate actions and minimise any trade-offs.  The multiple challenges we face to build a resilient food system during climate and biodiversity crises seem unsurmountable to the individual and to administrations, leading to the prevailing situation of inertia and inaction we see today.  Individual farmers feel powerless in face of increased globalisation, consolidation of the agri-industry, complexity of the policy framework and poor market returns.  We need to create a policy framework that is an enabling environment for positive action.</p> <p>  We live in a country with a diverse mix of landscapes, characterised by differences in geology, topography, soils, climatic variation and land cover, with a wide range in land use capacity.  One size certainly does not fit all, and different land types are advantaged to provide a set of particular services, for example, high quantities of food and fibre, carbon storage, flood alleviation, space for nature or amenity and recreational value.  We need to create a system where it is possible for different areas to capitalise on their natural advantages.</p> <p>  The development of the Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan offers an immediate opportunity for positive change.  Recent work detailed in this evidence submission highlights CAP as an opportunity to deliver high-quality food outcomes and enhance farm livelihoods by mitigating our climate and biodiversity crises.</p><p>Biodiversity underpins our food supply, but it is undervalued in our agriculture production system and policy framework.</p><p> Over the past ten years, there has been significant work in Ireland to test and trial locally adapted, results-orientated solutions.  We have designed and implemented integrated agri-environmental results-based payment schemes for a range of biodiversity targets and associated ecosystem services.  That is essentially putting a value on the high-quality habitat areas of the farm that are providing pollination services and carbon storage and contributing to water quality and flood alleviation.  Over the past two years, we have concentrated on the design of the CAP green architecture and how we can build on the success of various pilot programmes, including the Burren and European innovation partnerships, EIPs, models.</p><p> We propose an integrated framework across Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP with three tiers involving increasing environmental ambition and delivery, moving from baseline conditionality in tier 1 to eco-schemes in tier 2 and agri-environmental climate measures in tier 3.  We suggested the tier 3 agri-environment climate measures be divided into two broad streams, one targeted at medium to intensive farmland landscapes and the other concentrated on extensive semi-natural farmland areas dominated by semi-natural vegetation.  This is to ensure more effective, targeted action and to build on the lessons from the EIPs.  In recent months, the published draft interventions for the CAP strategic plan highlight plans to integrate results-based payments and a locally adapted approach into the design of agri-environmental schemes.</p><p> The solutions to many of the land-use challenges we see today lie in better targeting of land use to match the capacity of the land to produce multiple services to meet societal needs.  We need to value people, nature and food within an integrated land-use strategy.  As details have emerged in recent weeks, there are some worrying trends in terms of the weakening of the environmental ambition of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP strategic plan.  We must ensure coherence and consistency across all aspects of the interventions, building on excellent examples of successful programmes to ensure we deliver on climate, biodiversity and water targets.  Co-operation and a farmer-centred model, together with an evidence-based approach, have been key elements in the success of various pilot programmes and must be maintained throughout the development and implementation of the CAP strategic plan.</p><p> In the recent announcement of the 2023 to 2027 CAP budget, we have seen proposals to cap agri-environmental funding per farm at &euro;10,000, with some farms capped at &euro;7,000.  This is problematic as many of the farms delivering the highest environmental performance under the current CAP are receiving much higher agri-environmental supports currently.  An important aspect of the payment structures of locally adapted, results-based programmes to date, including the Burren programme and hen harrier and pearl mussel projects, is that there is no maximum payment ceiling and overall budget management is facilitated by degressive payment bands.  This is critical to ensuring farmers can continue to improve their environmental outcomes.  This is a key feature of results-based agri-environmental programmes to date, which are now proposed as the delivery model for agri-environmental schemes in the CAP strategic plan.</p><p> We have also seen a weakening of the environmental ambition in baseline conditionality, moving from 5% to 4% for non-productive areas and landscape features, and the inclusion of nitrogen fixation and catch crops to meet the 4% target.  As a minimum, we need to align eco-schemes with targets in the agrifood strategy 2030 as detailed on page 10 of the submission document.</p><p> I ask members to ensure we have an environmentally ambitious CAP strategic plan that is coherent across the range of interventions.  Given the extent of the challenges we face in the coming decade, if the CAP strategic plan from 2023 to 2027 does not provide the necessary supports to farmers and reward achievement of results, then we have no hope of achieving our 2030 targets.</p></speech>

I was thinking about addressing reductions in emissions that might be realisable for orchard plantations and general horticultural considerations.  I thank members of the committee for extending me the privilege of addressing them in the context of the potential contribution of the apple-growing sector and the contribution orchards can make to biodiversity.</p> <p>  I have been concerned about a changing climate for many years.  I gave my first talk on it in 1990, while still a student in UCD, to a class of agricultural science students who were in the same class as I was.  It did not feature in the course in those days, and I thought that needed addressing.  Thirty years or more have passed since then and rather than words, actions are needed.  Unfortunately, some of those might not be so easy to do as they would have been if we had started back then, and maybe not so popular.</p> <p>  I have a number of occupations and positions, which include being an apple grower, owner of a small company which manufactures beverages, chair of the Irish Apple Growers Association, lecturer in biology, horticulture, and plant physiology at the University of Limerick, and chair of the Tipperary Food Producers Network.  My position in the University of Limerick allows me to spend time on research, which generally revolves around apple and fruit production and how to do that more sustainably.</p> <p>  I have come here to answer any questions members might have on the ability of apple orchards to sequester carbon and their potential contribution from a biodiversity aspect.  I might also have knowledge in respect of the broader challenges facing the State, particularly the agriculture sector, in achieving targets, and the role that the horticulture sector can play in that.  The horticulture sector has an annual output of about &euro;500 million, making it the fourth largest sector after beef, dairy and pigs.  While there are significant exports of mushrooms, imports of fresh produce exceed domestic production by a factor of three.  There are about 6,000 people employed directly in horticulture and another 10,000 in downstream activities.  From an environmental and social sustainability perspective, as well as food security, we ought to be doing better.</p> <p>  The apple-growing sector in the Republic of Ireland is very small, with only about 5% of apples consumed being grown here, and extends to a little more than 500 ha in total.  At the moment, there is an apple redevelopment group at work under the stewardship of Dermot Callaghan, head of horticulture at Teagasc, along with Bord Bia, the Department of agriculture, and the Irish Apple Growers Association.  Our hope is that this group can set out a roadmap for the expansion of the apple-growing sector over the next decade, and that an outcome of this will be increased apple production, with the benefit of increased carbon sequestration due to the orchard plantations.</p> <p>  Figures calculated by Dr. Ken Byrne, a colleague of mine at the University of Limerick, show that apple orchards in Ireland sequester carbon at a rate of approximately 11 tonnes  of CO2 per hectare per year, which is broadly in line with figures reported in the literature for orchards in other countries and compares reasonably with the gold-standard carbon sequestering land use, which is forestry.  The latter sector sequesters at a rate about 50% higher on good quality lands such as would typically be used for orchard production.</p> <p>  One of the attractive elements of apple production from a carbon sequestration perspective is that it requires good land, so where a new orchard is planted, it is probably on land that would otherwise be used for dairy or tillage.  As well as the carbon sequestration achieved by orchards, there is a benefit in that land will probably be taken from a net emission sector, such as bovines or tillages.  The latter sector is carbon-emitting, at least in the way it is conventionally practised.  Therefore, a land-use change from dairy to orchards has a double benefit in reducing emissions and increasing sequestration.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the potential for land-use change to apples in Ireland is limited.  Apple orchards are highly productive.  the addition of 1,000 ha would represent a significant change to the existing industry and is as much as could be expected in a free-market scenario, given that some people would always want apples that cannot be grown in Ireland and so on.  Such a programme of 1,000 ha would lead to sequestration of 11,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum.  If this represented plantings that would otherwise support dairy, it would provide the double benefit I mentioned but it would still be small in the context of total agricultural emissions, which are about 1,000 times that figure.</p> <p>  Even though our contribution may be small, the apple-growing sector is eager to make that contribution.  Growers feel fortunate to be producing the only food crop in Ireland that is simultaneously carbon-sequestering.  Any policies implemented that support the sector to increase in size will result in less imports, rural job creation, improved biodiversity, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  Some things that will hopefully come up in conversation will be: a ban on below-cost selling; adequate resourcing of Teagasc for horticulture; and succession and encouraging young people into horticulture.</p></speech>

I am here, first and foremost, as a dairy farmer and, second, as one of the people involved in one of the EIPs, namely, the biodiversity regeneration in a dairying environment, BRIDE, project.</p><p>I am a dairy farmer, milking 72 spring calving dairy cows in Castlelyons, part of the Bride Valley area of north Cork.  I will express some concerns I have with the direction our farming and food system is taking, and in particular that the road that we are now on as a result of the Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 strategies is unsustainable.</p><p> As well as being a farmer I am also one of the people involved in the biodiversity regeneration in a dairying environment, BRIDE, project.  This project is one of the many European innovation partnership projects, EIPs, scattered throughout the country, set up to provide templates and knowledge transfer for the wider agricultural community on different aspects of environmental and sustainable food production practices.  It is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EU.</p><p> The BRIDE project was initiated by two farmers and an ecologist who were frustrated by the way our farming system was damaging the environment while farmers themselves were being blamed by the public.  There was a need to showcase a more positive image as well as improving biodiversity and water quality and reducing our carbon footprint.  The system we are on rewards farmers for producing larger volumes of food, and more one produces, the more money is made.  Consequently, there is no value put on the habitats on any farm that can deliver the environmental ecosystem services that can help to create a more sustainable food production model.</p><p> This is fundamentally what needs to change, as farmers are paid to produce food but they also need to be paid for managing the farmland habitats in a way that improves biodiversity, water quality and carbon sequestration.  There is a need to give farmers a continuous signal that there is an indefinite financial value in maintaining and managing these vital habitats from generation to generation.  The current model of getting a payment from agri-environmental schemes for a five-year term is not working as habitats, created from taxpayers' money through the scheme, can be put back into food production when the scheme is terminated.  Habitats have very little legal protection so damaging or removing is a routine occurrence.</p><p> I will speak to the expansion model and my experience of it in an intensive farming area.  The environment has played second fiddle to production and the volume of food produced over the past 50 years with a resultant deterioration in its quality.  Since quotas were abolished in 2015 and even since preparations began for that in 2010, farmers have been pushed to produce more for the same money, with the result being damage to wildlife habitats, biodiversity and water quality.  We are also struggling to reduce our carbon footprint and the public backlash that dairy farmers in particular are now getting is a direct result of the unsustainable food production system we use.</p><p> This same model has done much damage to rural Ireland, with small farmers coming under increasing pressure to stay afloat, with many of them going out of business.  The media narrative often focuses on the "family farm", which sounds good but we need to define this family farm.  It is taking an increasingly larger farm to sustain a family and most farms require one of the partners to work off farm.  This puts more pressure on the farmer to get more work done and milk higher numbers of stock and so extra labour is needed, which is becoming more and more difficult to source.  Once a labour unit is sourced, inevitably more cows are also sourced to pay for the labour and thus begins the treadmill on which dairy farmers now find themselves.  This is the dairy expansion model, not the family farm model and certainly not the "viable" small farmer model.</p><p> The average herd size in the Glanbia area is now over 80 cows so under this figure would be classed as a small dairy farmer.  Farmers in the less intensive farming areas of the country with smaller herd sizes again, supplying smaller co-operatives, are put at an unfair disadvantage when competing against such scale.  In dairy farming, the milking platform, or the land area adjacent to the milking parlour, is the limiting factor to expansion, so to expand or increase production to stay viable, as price for milk to the farmer is more or less static over the years, farmers require more land.  In my area, land rental costs can be up to and more than &euro;300 per acre per annum.  To buy this land would cost a minimum of &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 per acre and more if two farmers want it badly enough.  So to increase herd size by 50 cows would require 50 extra acres, costing a minimum of &euro;500,000.  The smaller the scale, the smaller the chance of being able to get on this unsustainable ladder.</p><p> To give an example of what is happening on the ground with my own case, I have two tillage neighbours, one bloodstock neighbour, one suckler neighbour and two dairy farmer neighbours.  For any of us to expand would mean buying an adjoining farm and putting them out of business.  The only way for me or them to expand is to buy an adjoining farm.  This is the model we are on and is leading to smaller farmers getting out, an ultimate decline in overall farmer numbers and ultimately a depleted rural community.  This model is pitting farmers against farmers, dairy farmers against each other and against every other farm enterprise and as can be publicly seen, pitting farmers against environmentalists and the consumer.</p><p> Everyone is talking about the extra jobs that dairy expansion is giving but nobody is talking about the numbers of small farmers that cannot compete and are going out of business.  Small farmers do not have the purchasing power that large-scale farming brings.  For example, prices are cheaper when products are bought in large orders.  Small farmers cannot compete when it comes to buying and renting land, as there needs to be a minimum land area on which a farmer can make a living; otherwise, we are on the road back to the landlord system.  The minimum milk collection policy in my own area has now increased from 250 litres per collection to 400 litres per collection, and this is just another nail in the coffin of small milk producers.  As this model is totally production-focused and with no incentive to look after biodiversity or any other ecosystem service, farmers are sent the signal to produce more and more to fuel the relentless drive for a commodity product that can be sourced cheaply.  Inevitably more fertiliser is used, more sprays are used on any plant that is competition to the crop, wetlands are drained, hedgerows are removed, woodland and forestry are converted to grassland etc.  This is all done legally, as habitats have very little protection, especially in intensive farming areas where most of the food is produced.  There has been a continuous push on farmers to produce more for less, with a devastating impact on the environment.</p><p> The 10% "space for nature" is a concept that the BRIDE project adopts.  A figure of 10% of the farmed area being prioritised for biodiversity is mentioned in the green deal, biodiversity strategy and food strategy 2030, but no timelines or guidelines have been given on how this will be achieved or where the money will come from.  In practice this will mean some farmers may need to take land out of food production to attain the 10%.  When land is taken out of agricultural production, it should be replaced with an environmental payment equivalent that incentivises the farmer on an ongoing and indefinite basis to deliver the ecosystem services that alternative land uses can provide such as clean water, flood prevention, more biodiversity, carbon sequestration etc.  This payment should be results-based, as in the BRIDE project template, so that farmers can be incentivised to manage their land both for environmental benefits and food production.</p><p> The current Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payment structure should be reformed to include an environmental payment to farmers for this 10%.  This puts a value on the habitats and biodiversity that are being lost and sends a signal to the farmer that maintaining these habitats is important.  It would be a payment from the taxpayer to the farmer for delivering ecosystem services at a time when we have a global climate and biodiversity crisis.</p><p> Ireland's agriculture is at a crossroads.  We are going down the road of increased expansion and racing to the bottom of the barrel to be the most efficient food producers in the world but with the worst environmental record and a farming population that is tired and stressed in that race.  Our future young farmers will have other more profitable and rewarding occupations to choose from with better work conditions if we do not make changes.  Our credibility and the Origin Green credibility is under serious threat and we cannot any longer claim to be sustainable food producers while the public is well aware of the environmental problems that intensive farming is causing.  Time has caught up on poor and lax environmental care over the years because of bad short-term policy.  In recent discussions on the food strategy 2030 document, it has been suggested that "there needs to be give and take" but there has been too much take from the farmers and the environment over the past 20 years; both have been exploited and this needs to change.</p><p> Everyone is kicking the dairy cow numbers matter down the road but we cannot have our cake and eat it.  At the high stocking rates of over 2.4 cows per hectare being encouraged, there will be high artificial nitrogen usage and very little space for nature.  If artificial nitrogen use is curtailed, it would encourage farmers to utilise fertilisers and slurry more efficiently.  Reducing nitrogen use would have a positive impact on our emissions and would not have the negative impact on grass production that we are told it would.</p><p> The BRIDE project has created a template to help farmers achieve a 10% "space for nature" certification entitled farming with nature, which is also an objective of the aforementioned strategies.  This creates a minimum standard that rewards farmers who are looking after the environment.  We have recently received further funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EU through the EIP funding initiative, where we were given over &euro;100,000 to create an app that will measure the quantity and quality of biodiversity on any farm.  This will be the basis of a "farming with nature" standard that any farm in Ireland can have and should be the basis of any food we export abroad.  We are currently liaising with one of the meat processors and it will trial a "farming with nature" certified beef range with a payment being returned to the farmer for this certification.</p><p> There is a diagram in the documentation illustrating the certification we would give to farmers.</p><p>It can be seen from it that farmers are paid for the quantity of habitats that they have on their farms.  In other words, it can be 2, 3, 4 or 5 ha and up to 40% or 50%.  The figure on the certificate giving the additional biodiversity managed area, BMA, is probably the most important one.  In this example, and this is a real farm, the farmer took out 0.066 ha from his 2019 baseline BMA.  He had 3.948 ha in what we will call space for nature, and then he took out 0.066 ha from that total.  That figure reflects the experience of the 42 farmers we have in the BRIDE Project.  Few hectares are being taken out and that is because once the BRIDE Project is finished, those farmers know that if the land is gone, then it is gone from food production.  The BRIDE Project finishes in 2023 and they will have no payment for it.  We can see that farmers right across the board are slow to take land out of food production for obvious reasons.  It is the source of their income, and that is why there is a need to give them a continuous income.  Farmers are not looking to be millionaires, but an incentive must be provided to look after these habitats which are delivering these ecosystem services.</p><p> The next diagram is an example of farming with nature certification.  With the app that I mentioned we are able to go around to any farm in Ireland, map the habitats on the farm and rate them on a scale.  We also score the quality of those habitats.  The 11B figure on the sample certification shows that the farmer has 11% space for nature on his farm and the quality of the habitats is B.  The app can be used on a farm walk and we hope farmers will be able to do that.</p><p> To summarise, we must change from a model of production at lowest cost, where the processors and retailers are forcing farmers down a road they do not wish to go, to a model of regenerative farming, where the farmer, the soil and the quality of the food produced will lead to a more sustainable food production system and, ultimately, a healthier consumer.  This point should be noted.</p><p> We are at a crossroads in dairy farming.  We can down the road of continuous expansion with farms getting ever larger but with the number of farmers becoming smaller and smaller, with all the consequences that would have for rural Ireland.  We are trying to compete with the big dairy production countries of the world on scale, but we are losing out on the quality of food we produce, the quality of our water and the quality of our life and biodiversity.  We must put a value on all these things so we can truly say we are sustainable food producers and proud of it.</p></speech>

This is a timely discussion.  I hope it will be the beginning of a continuous engagement with the committee.</p> <p>  I will start at the end and work back.  I thank Mr. Sheehan for his presentation.  He is effectively saying what I have been saying for a long time.  The reality though is that farmers have been compliant with public policy.  There is little doubt that they followed the different incentives and schemes initiated by successive Governments and which were based around the promotion of and expected demand for produce and the consequent employment created for the State.  Mr. Sheehan has rightly identified that as a race to the bottom.  The only people who have benefited from this process have been the processors and retailers because they have a steady supply of cheap food.</p> <p>  Mr. Sheehan is also right in what he is advocating.  Farmers must be paid for the work they do for the environment and in reducing carbon output.  It is hard for farmers, however, to accept that at a remove until they see the extent of that support.  They are on a sort of a hamster wheel in that they recognise that they must produce more food year-on-year to get an income that will allow them to raise and educate their families.  Until the Government steps in and identifies the extent of the financial reward in this regard, I do not think many farmers will buy into this concept.  That is a real requirement and I would like to hear Mr. Sheehan's views on this issue, including the extent of such a payment.</p> <p>  Farmers are also concerned when they see the potential for other countries and their evident failure to meet the various limits put in place.  President Bolsonaro did not even attend the COP26 meeting this week.  An agreement to end the rate of deforestation has been signed, but it does not apply until 2030.  On the other hand, we are part of the Mercosur deal where Brazil has the opportunity to export cheaper beef into this country.  Would Mr. Sheehan accept that there is an issue regarding international trade agreements in the context of getting farmers on board with schemes here?  Will we also have to step up to the plate and identify the extent to which we are prepared to compensate farmers for the work they are doing on the environment?</p> <p>  I have known Mr. Dunford for a long time and the work he and the lads are doing on the Burren project is a model of excellence.  He identified farmers, such as Michael Davern and others, who recognised the opportunities in this area at an early stage.  I would welcome any further comments Mr. Dunford might have regarding how we might transpose that model which was initially concerned with relatively small family farms, where most of the people concerned were often not full-time farmers, to more commercially-orientated farms.  Does he have any ideas on opportunities for the larger dairy farms to farm more in tandem with nature than what the market has demanded up to now?</p></speech>

Farmers are willing to make the required changes.  We have had farm walks here for the last two months and we have been inundated.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  Farmers are waiting for payments but consumers are also waiting for a signal regarding whether we will make changes.</p> <p>  Regarding Brazil and China, I really do not care what they are doing because that is out of my control as a farmer.  I am doing what I can and the bright farmers are all making huge improvements.  I focus on what we can do here.  That is a lesson we must all take on board.  If we keep going on about what China, Brazil and all the other countries are not doing, we will never get anywhere.  We are in a great position to be able to show leadership as farmers in Ireland and that is what we should be doing.  We should forget about what everyone else is doing.</p></speech>

In other words, should we be ensuring, from a national perspective, that we do not sign up to a Mercosur deal that allows for any amount of cheaper beef coming in here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Sheehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#E00600"><p>I agree 100% with the Senator on that point.  Equally, we must remember that we are importing large amounts of cereals.  I use a large amount of cereals in dairy rations, and much of those cereals are coming from unsustainable sources in countries like Brazil.  Yet there is no initiative for me to use grain from my neighbouring tillage farmers.  That must happen.  We are trying to start such an initiative in the BRIDE Project, where participating tillage farmers will be supplying dairy farmers who are also part of the project with native-grown cereals, instead of importing such feedstuffs from halfway across the world.</p> <p>  On the question of the payment, farmers were given a bad habit when we started paying for the environment.  We had to do that because there was no other incentive to look after it.  However, it has created a habit of perhaps not doing anything until we get paid.</p><p>As farmers, we have to start making changes, especially as that applies to low-hanging fruit.  For instance, we can cut our hedges differently from the way we used to.  We should not use as much pesticide on field margins.  The soft approach we should take is to do as much as we can until it affects our income.  After that, it becomes an issue and I would not expect any farmer to lose money by going green.  However, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit where we can make changes.  We need direction, guidance and advice.</p></speech>

Perhaps Dr. Moran will also have a comment to make.  I thank the Deputy for his comment and support; it is much appreciated.  He mentioned a hamster wheel and the wheel seems to be spinning faster all the time and becoming harder to get off, unfortunately, for many farmers.  I do not like to use the word "compensate" because the whole approach to the Burren has been to reward and incentivise.  "Compensate" can reflect what is wrong, in some ways, which is that we tend to look at the challenges and problems as opposed to the opportunities and the potential.  The magic that started in the Burren was looking at a challenge and reinterpreting it as an opportunity.  We need to do that at a national level.  Anyone following the coverage of COP26 can see there are huge challenges but I keep thinking there are considerable opportunities, particularly for Irish farmers, to exploit and to be rewarded.  There is an appetite in society to reward farmers for the right type of farming activity and increasingly, through the work I do with farmers in the Burren and nationally, I think there is an appetite among farmers on the ground to embrace this new opportunity and way of farming.</p> <p> How do we do it?  The Burren has received a lot of praise.  We work with 300 or 400 farmers.  It is a small project and not everybody is 100% on board so it is a work in progress.  However, gradually over time people see what we are trying to achieve and the benefits for themselves, the generation to come, the local environment and community.  They also see it as a way of respecting past generations of farmers.  Slowly but surely, farmers are coming on board.  The nice thing about our model is not just the money, because the reward is modest enough, it is the freedom to farm and the respect we afford farmers to get on with their jobs.  We try to take the paperwork away from them and to invest resources in them so they can deliver for the Burren and for society.  It is about scaling that at a national level.  The criticism has been always that it is the Burren and involved Mr. Michael Davoren, Dr. Sharon Parr and a few other people like that.  The reality is that the success of the Burren has been proven by projects such as the hen harrier project, the fresh water pearl mussel project and the biodiversity regeneration in a dairying environment, BRIDE, project in Cork.  Those have shown that the basic ideas of rewarding outcomes, providing advice and support at a local level and encouraging and supporting farmers to take the step we all want them to take can be successful.  Mr. Sheehan is doing a remarkable job in the intensive dairy sector, as was mentioned.  The hen harrier project is rewarding farmers for the conservation of a special bird and habitat which previously had been seen as a problem and is now seen as an opportunity that may include a bonus payment flying into a farm.  In Kerry, they are dealing with water quality across whole-farm level.  It is extraordinary.  What we do is in the halfpenny place compared to that project.  It can be done.</p> <p>  We are missing policy support.  The CAP strategic plan is a phenomenal opportunity.  I have worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for many years and we are heading in the right direction but we need to head there faster.  We also need advice and support at a local level.  How can we get that?  We must tap into farmers' knowledge of how to manage the land for nature and ecosystem services.  Another big challenge is trying to convince farmers that this is the future.  This is not sandal farming or wheelbarrow farming, it is about adapting cutting-edge technology to deliver new outcomes.  Society wants us to deliver biodiversity and carbon sequestration, as well as good food, and farmers are up to that task if they are properly rewarded and supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#F00400"><p>To address the question, there are considerable opportunities for Ireland to be a leader in sustainable food systems and to take to the lead on climate and biodiversity action.  I agree that we cannot run the risk of carbon leakage but it is important that Ireland takes the international lead on these matters, particularly at European level and in support of the Fit for 55 legislative package proposal from the European Commission.  One of the instruments within that is to look at carbon borders and ensure that products coming into the European Union have the same environmental standards we expect here.  That will be essential and it is on the radar of the Commission.  Ireland, as a unit, should be taking the lead on that and supporting the Commission in the development of the Fit for 55 proposals.</p> <p>  We must also consider how to upscale the initiatives and the good work that has happened in the Burren.  We were in the same place with CAP negotiations seven years ago.  We faced exactly the same issues when we were proposing an expansion of the Burren.  The arguments were that the Burren is unique and cannot be repeated anywhere else.  Unique individuals such as Dr. Dunford, Mr. Davoren and Dr. Parr were involved.  It is a unique landscape.  From working for years with those people in the Burren, and from my knowledge of what is going on in other places, I can say there are unique individuals in every local community across Ireland.  We have champions in every local community in Ireland.  Each local area of Ireland is unique and has a lot to offer.  If a policy framework can be put in place to harness the power of the local to deliver change, we will have a lot to work with.</p> <p>  The Department, in fairness, recognised in the current CAP programme that the broad-scale national approach to agri-environmental climate action was not going to deliver and was impeded, to a certain extent.  That is why it developed the European innovation partnership model, EIP, to look at how the Burren model can be replicated elsewhere.  That is why we have the hen harrier programme, the pearl mussel programme and the BRIDE project, which demonstrates the approach in a dairy environment.  Nobody can tell us now this will not work in other places.  This works in the BRIDE project, in the pearl mussel areas across the west coast of Ireland and in the hen harrier areas.  We have tried and tested the approach to perennial olives, almonds and vineyards with colleagues in Navarre in northern Spain.  We have tested it in the Montado agroforestry systems in Portugal.  It has been tested through arable systems in the UK.  It has worked every place it has been rolled out as long as the principles that support, incentivise and reward the production of these ecosystem services are maintained.  Long-term payments for farmers must be also put in place.  Local services need to be supported and local partnerships established in order to deliver.  We now have the opportunity to scale this approach in the CAP strategic plan.  </p> <p>  The one big issue I anticipate is that our administrative systems are set up for a national approach, not a more locally-adapted approach.  We have put in place proposals to make this happen and it is now incumbent on us to make this operationally feasible.  That will involve not the administrative system dictating how a programme should work but an administrative system built to facilitate the delivery of this local support and action across the 130,000 farmers in the country.  We are at a cusp here and this can be done, although I do not want to hear anyone anywhere saying this can be done anymore.  We have spent seven years proving it can be done in multiple landscapes across Ireland and Europe.  The proof is there in the BRIDE project that this approach can be taken in an intensive dairy environment.</p></speech>

There is some hampering of the environmental ambition in the EU framework within which we are working, but it has given a lot more flexibility to member states than it had in the previous programming period.  We are now in the final stages of the development of the CAP strategic plan.  I would imagine it will go to public consultation in the next week or so and it will be submitted to Brussels for approval in January 2022.  I presume there then will be a number of negotiations back and forth between the Commission and the Department to finalise the plan.  It will be then rolled out on farms from 1 January 2023.  Essentially, we have the next eight weeks to get this right.</p> <p>  In the draft interventions, we have seen much of what we and other partners have been advising.  I must admit the Department gets a lot of advice from various different sectors and stakeholders whom it must pull together within the European framework.</p><p>The bones are there at the moment.  I am worried that in these last crucial few weeks, key elements of what has been the success factor of these local initiatives will not be in place, including the flexibility of the programme.  The green architecture of the CAP contains three broad tiers.  In pillar 1 there is the baseline conditionality, rules that all farmers getting basic payment must adhere to.  Much of this is basically adhering to environmental legislative standards and broad general guidelines.  They need to be set at a level that meets the legislative proposals.</p><p> In addition, 25% of the funding in pillar 1 goes to these new eco scheme models.  At the moment I am concerned that some of these are basically repackaging of the baseline conditionality rather than a step in the ambition.  I would hope that in pillar 1 there would basically be secure infrastructure across farms that can be paid on the quality of them in pillar 2 in our agri-environmental climate schemes, as has been demonstrated by the good work of Mr. Sheehan and Dr. Dunford in their initiatives.</p><p> When pared back, these three tiers must work in conjunction with each other.  They need to be cognisant of and at least meet our international commitments.  We can make this happen but it will require everybody buying into the vision in the next eight weeks or so and, importantly, when the detail on the implementation of these programmes comes in 2022.  We always say the devil will be in the detail.  We have 12 months in 2022 to make sure that when the details of the schemes are put in place, they work for the farmer, work for the environment and work for society at large.</p></speech>

I missed the beginning of the presentation as I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I would like to get an idea of the payment metrics for ecosystem services.  What is a farmer paid for a hectare at a B rating or for reductions in carbon, biogenic methane or whatever it is?  Is there a settled calculus on this and a settled verification that could allow this to be scaled up?</p> <p>  My second question is about processors and retailers who are driving on the basis of never mind the quality feel the width.  Surely they are susceptible to the same kind of pressures that are now being exercised through the European Green Deal right across the sector?  Should we not be embracing them as part of this to start paying premiums for quality premium sourced materials?</p> <p>  I would like to understand the difference between the BRIDE scheme and some of the EPA and IFA smart farming initiatives which focus on nitrogen, the mix of grasses sown, the manure spreading, the breeding, the health of the herd and all of these good things which are shown to improve the bottom line and certainly reduce the carbon impact.  Are these different things or are they part of the same family of approaches?</p> <p>  I know the issue is now focusing on methane because in the EU inventory it is treated as its value over 100 years, which understates its impact in the shorter 20-year horizon we are actually dealing in.  How is this issue of paying for biogenic methane reduction to be embraced?  It can be done in many ways, including by better breeding and earlier slaughter.  Everyone focuses on herd reduction but that is only one of many areas.  I think the Government has turned its face against herd reduction anyhow.  How are we to address this issue of pricing methane in Mr. Sheehan's view of putting proper incentives in place that encourage more environmentally sound farming?</p> <p>  That is probably enough for the moment.  I would comment, as Dr. Moran did, that border equalisation is very much part of the approach of the EU.  Mercosur, as I understand, is stalled because of the lack of equivalent environmental standards in some of those countries.  This is very much on the radar of the European Union and I think that will also filter into the views of processors and retailers.</p></speech>

Measuring the environmental quality of a piece of land is quite complex.  Its environmental quality can be measured from the biodiversity or nature point of view.  The soil quality and hydrological quality can be measured, as of course can the greenhouse gas balance.  We have tried to capture the complexity of the science and distil it down into a few simple variables or metrics that can be measured on an individual field.</p> <p>  For example, we capture the nature value by looking at the composition and structure of the plants within a field and the overall sward, whether it is improved grassland, semi-natural grassland or other habitats, for example.  Particularly in upland areas, we look at the extent of bare peat.  We know that a greater level of bare peat leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions.  Immediately a higher score will be achieved if the area is totally vegetated with little or no bare peat.  On the other hand, if the area is extensively managed, there is a build-up of this litter level within the soil.  We also measure the litter level that is visible to the farmer.  Those are our soil quality variables.</p> <p>  We also look at water quality.  We look at the risk of nutrient export and sediment loss from the farm.  The pearl mussel project has looked at things like bare ground and the extent of riparian zones for example.  This can be converted into a scoring system on a ten-point scale.  In the same way that farmers, by looking at the tail bone and over the ribs of a beef animal in a mart can give a rough score of what the factory will pay for that animal, they need to be in the same position under a ten-point scoring system to know what the environmental performance of that field is.  We then give a graduated payment level on a scoring scale of 1 to 10.  It is exactly the same as with the Burren project.</p> <p>  The handbook on carbon farming from the European Commission that was published in June contains the variables we have been using for the past five or six years in the pearl mussel project and the hen harrier project.  While this is going on, research projects in various universities ensure the scoring system we have correlates with improved greenhouse gas balances, soil quality, water quality and nature value.</p> <p>  The science has a role in understanding the complexity of this situation, by distilling that complexity down into simple variables that can be measured at farm level, understood by the farmer and, more importantly, are controlled and not subject to the vagaries of weather.  We then link the payment rates to that.  It is quite a simple system when it is broken down.</p></speech>

Farmers with a field scoring less than 5 get nothing.  They get a payment for a score of 5 upwards, and fields that score a 9 or a 10 which have exceptional biodiversity and water quality get a bonus payment.  Therefore, there is a carrot-and-stick approach.</p> <p>  In calculating those payment levels, we looked at the additional work involved in managing the livestock to deliver those biodiversity and water quality outcomes and looked at some of the transaction costs and some of the opportunity costs.  That gave us a figure of about &euro;315 per hectare, which is what we pay for something scoring 10 out of 10.  We work backwards from that in calculating payment levels.  As Dr. Moran said, the science behind it is very complex and very strong, but in the interface with the farmer it is very simple, with them getting a score from zero to 10.</p></speech>

In the Burren, our priorities are biodiversity, water quality and landscape features.  Our scoring card is built around that.  Biogenic methane can be incorporated into scoring cards in other areas.</p></speech>

With our systems, if farmers are invested and rewarded, with part of their payment being linked to the protection of nature, water quality and biodiversity, they will match their stocking rates to the production of these services.  If they maximise their environmental payments under this system, then they will be farming closer to the capacity of the land.  As a result, they will come closer to a neutral greenhouse gas balance overall.  They will be more invested in space for nature and management of land to ensure that there is no risk to water.  With regard to improving the number of habitats that we have woodlands for, for which we have scoring cards too, if farmers want to invest in more woodlands, trees or better hedgerows on their farms, that will improve the overall greenhouse gas balance.  They will not be pushed as much to increase the numbers which correlate with the biogenic methane.  Rather than having a tunnel-vision focus on methane, we need to concentrate the overall greenhouse gas balance coming from a unit area of the farm.  If the farm concentrates not just on food production, but also the production of nature, high-quality water and carbon sequestration, by definition, we will have to move towards carbon neutral agricultural systems.  We are not actually putting a cap on them.  Farmers are incentivised and make logical, rational business decisions to move towards this system.</p></speech>

We map every farm.  We are able to map the land that is in habitats, whether there might be 11% as in the example, or 50% space for nature and 50% for food production.  We score those habitats based on quality.  The quantity payment is &euro;200 per hectare if it is under 5%, going up to &euro;300 per hectare between 5% and 9%.  Once the area hits 10%, it goes to &euro;400 per hectare, and at 20% or above, it is &euro;500 per hectare.  We have to deal with tax because it is only a pilot project.  Once a threshold is reached, we have to include a cap.  If we are looking for a farmer to put in an acre of oak woodland, that farmer will say to us that he or she is milking 100 or 200 cows and is making &euro;1,000 of profit per hectare, so if we can give that farmer &euro;1,000 per hectare, it will be turned into oak woodland.  That is what will happen.  Maybe if we did not give &euro;1,000 per hectare but, to address the Deputy's other question, we could give a payment from the retail opportunity, then the signal from the market will be much stronger than the signal from the BRIDE Project, which would mean that the BRIDE Project will be here today and gone tomorrow.  The signal from the consumer will be there all the time.  It might be small but every time a farmer gets a meat, cereal, beef or lamb cheque, with a Farming for Nature signal from consumers at the end to indicate that they are happy with how the farmer is producing food, that would make a significant difference to the way we farm.  That signal is not there at the moment.  We pay &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 or &euro;500 per hectare, with a cap.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other issue relates to general best practice.  It was initiated by the IFA.  There are no payments as far as I am aware.  It is just general best practice that the IFA promotes among the farming community.

We wanted to simplify it.  Many other people deal with breeding and efficiencies in breeding and operating a dairy farm or other farm.  We concentrate on the environment and biodiversity in particular.</p> <p>  With the way that we look at methane, carbon sequestration or whatever else, we focus on the 10% space for nature.  I always say that methane and carbon dioxide are for the scientists.  If a farm was measured for methane, carbon dioxide or carbon storage, the money would go to the people who are measuring it and the administration to measure it.  The farmer who needs the money to improve the habitats will get nothing.  We should focus on getting everyone in Ireland up to 10% and on the stocking rate instead of on the numbers.  The high stocking rate causes significant damage.  We should focus on bringing the stocking rate down to a sustainable level, where there is the 10% for nature, not as much fertiliser is used, and the methane and carbon dioxide will look after themselves.</p></speech>

This has been enjoyable.  I get what they are saying.  The language that we use is important.  It is about reward, incentivising change and taking a logical approach to make it as easy as possible and to have a financial incentive for people to make these changes, which at the same time will benefit our environment.  It is great to hear Mr. Sheehan's point because I believe in it.  Just because we are a small country, there is no need for Ireland not to show leadership, regardless of what other countries are doing.  With regard to what other countries are doing, it is important to know, when we talk about financial rewards that we can offer, if anything like that is happening in other European countries which we can look to to take advice from, where that type of payment rewards people for engaging in biodiversity and localised ecosystems are being used.  Is that being looked at anywhere else in the world?</p> <p>  The witnesses have discussed financial incentives and how much that would achieve.  That question has been dealt with.  The other question is how we can encourage farmers to take greater ownership of the environmental agenda.  How can we encourage individual people to get more involved with shaping that agenda themselves?  It is often done through representative bodies or through organisations such as the witnesses' organisations.  How do we encourage individual farmers in this country to say that they want to get on board with and move towards this?</p> <p>  If this app was to be rolled out nationwide, would that be a financial burden?  What would the cost be to make that wide scale so that it could be used nationwide?  A witness said that it is up to farmers themselves to map that land through the app.  More information on how the app would work and how it would be rolled out nationwide would be useful.</p></speech>

I will address the first question and will ask Mr. Sheehan and Dr. Moran to address the other two.  Regarding other examples in Europe, Ireland is the European leader in paying for ecosystem services.  BRIDE has moved away from European innovation partnerships for the Burren and hen harrier.  It has moved away from compensating and towards incentivising.  The first result-based payment for ecosystem services in Ireland was developed in the Burren.  It has spread to about 2,000 farmers.  Hopefully in the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, up to 20,000 farmers will be able to avail of this, at a minimum.  We are leading the way but we need to continue to lead the way and to do it well, because this is where Ireland, as a small nation, can be a leading international light.  This is the way forward not just because of the structure of the payments but because it gives farmers the freedom to farm.  Farmers hate being told what to do.  They love using their creativity, innovation and independence to decide how they will deliver these ecosystem services.  We are leading the way.  I thank the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for supporting that over the last CAP period.</p> <p>  The notion of farmers taking ownership is important.  I will gladly admit that I am not a scientist.  Everything I have learned has been learned from working closely with farmers and listening carefully.</p><p>After a while, you begin to appreciate it is not just about the money.  Money is very important but so too is the fairness and transparency of the payment, which is an incentive.  The support in terms of technical advice is also important, but most important of all is the belief this is the right thing and this is the future.  I am sure Dr. Moran would agree that whenever you talk to farmers, they always talk about legacy and leaving the land in better condition.  If we can convince farmers in better condition means land that can deliver a whole suite of ecosystem services and is multifunctional in the truest sense of the word, then we are winning.</p><p> How do we do that?  When we started off in the Burren, for example, farmers thought environment was a dirty word.  They thought there were a bunch of academics and scientists telling them how wonderful this place was and they were just the stupid people left behind.  Listening to the national discourse of late, you hear the same thing.  Farmers feel they are being victimised and they are being portrayed as the ones causing the damage, as the problem and not the solution.  We need to flip that on its head.  We need to say we have a massive problem with our environment, climate and biodiversity but the only solution is the farmers of Ireland becoming the first responders to that problem.  We must get to that point, which will be most effective.  The best source of advice and inspiration for farmers is their peers, other farmers, especially at a local level.  We can see the effect Mr. Sheehan and Mr. Michael Davern have had in the Burren in bringing a whole community along, and that is the way forward.</p><p> Farming for Nature is an initiative we set up a few years ago.  We have identified farm leaders throughout Ireland who are doing great things for nature, producing really good food and are an inspiration to those around them.  It is about opening up those farms and those farmers to other farmers so they can take ideas and inspiration from them and growing it at ground level.  Farmers trust other farmers because they have lived it.  We need to highlight those farmers, and Mr. Sheehan is a great example, who are producing great food but doing so in a very socially and environmentally sustainable way.  We need to flip the narrative around.  That is of great importance.</p><p> Regarding apps, the hen harrier project has begun the development of a field-based app for advisers to capture ecosystem services in the field.  The user punches in the information, it feeds into a system and that determines the score and the payment.  It is a phenomenal system.  If we want to scale these approaches, we need to do so efficiently so that there is minimal cost to farmers.  The apps which have been developed have made things much more efficient.  Currently, they are mainly used by advisers but in future we would like to see farmers themselves capturing their ecosystem services out in the field because we want them to be able to see what they are delivering and to be able to measure it and get paid as a result.</p></speech>

If you look at the <i>rbpnetwork.eu</i>website, you will see Irish case studies all over it but colleagues across other member states are also working on this.  Outside of the European Union, some countries have taken even further leaps as they do not have the framework of CAP to deal with.  Countries like Switzerland, for example, have been doing this for years and have taken a step further by linking the labelling of food to these systems as well.  I hope in future we will use our ten-point scoring systems to differentiate food based on that as well.  It would fit into our Origin Green programme and processors could take that straight away rather than having to build new systems.  They could use the same scoring system and say, for example, that under the national agri-environment scheme or a local agri-environment scheme, 50% of their farms in an area have scores of X and above.  It is a higher environmental product and they can market it thus.  That is a possibility.<br/><br/>In the UK, the development of a post-Brexit agriculture policy is all about public payments for public goods.  We are doing a lot of work at the moment with colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales.  In particular, we are working closely with the Environmental Land Management, ELM, tests and trials in Dartmoor which are taking the scorecard work that has been done in Ireland and adapting it at local level and putting that system in place for the post-Brexit policy.  We are in the lead on this at the moment but we are leading it locally as opposed to nationally.  Other countries are going to pass us out in the next 12 to 24 months if we do not push on with this.<br/><br/>In terms of the apps and the maps, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in conjunction with Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, is producing a national land cover map of the country.  It was supposed to be delivered in quarter 1 last year but is now expected to be delivered in quarter 1 of 2022.  That will be an initial map with an accuracy assessment of all of these habitats throughout the whole country.  That can be easily linked into an app which farmers can pull up and the map can be automatically digitised if it is linked in with the Department's computer systems.  The basis of the land parcel identification system for the CAP payments is the OSI PRIME2 data set, the same basic maps used by the EPA.  Now we are in a position, with mobile app technology, to merge the maps and data from the EPA, the OSI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to overlay them.  This can give a lot of data on farms which will enable farmers to make informed decisions.<br/><br/>In terms of farmers taking ownership of the environmental agenda, as Dr. Dunford said, farmers have been told since they were knee high they must hand the farm on in better condition.  What is better condition?  We need to give a clear signal and agree together, as a society, what is better in terms of food production, environmental protection and meeting the needs of society as a whole.  Farmers can very much take the lead in this debate and contribute to what is better in their particular context on their particular farmed landscape.<br/><br/>One mechanism for this to happen is the European Innovation Partnership scheme, under which partnerships between farmers, their local communities, advisers and researchers are set up.  The partners are on an equal footing and all bring their knowledge to bear to find solutions to problems.  That is our starting point.  We respect each other's knowledge and we build trust on that basis.  We work towards a common vision, recognising that, in any one piece of land, the farmer and farming family who have farmed it for generations know it better than anybody who can be parachuted in for a day or a couple of hours.  We respect that, harness that knowledge and work together to build up from each individual farm, to local communities and on to national targets.  That can be done if we put the framework in place to realise that vision.</p></speech>

Members might be familiar with Jordans cereals in England.  It has a certification system for its farmers who must work to a certain standard.  When we talk about standards and what other European countries are doing, a major problem in recent years has been the greenwashing of our food industry.  If we are going to develop any standard, it must be robust.  We can no longer say a product is green or is this or that unless we are able to robustly stand over that.  Consumers are too savvy now.  They know what they are looking for and the younger generation in particular, who went through national school with seven green flags, are looking for recycling, water quality, biodiversity and so on.  Whatever standard we come up with must be robust.  We need to give consumers confidence what they are paying for and the reward that will go back to the farmer is exactly what it says on the tin.</p> <p>  On the point about farmers taking ownership, my own experience with farmers in the BRIDE project is they are driving on with these improvements.  I was out with my own dairy discussion group, not with BRIDE, on a farm during the summer.  The assessor who was out on that farm for the BRIDE project the previous summer said it was one of the worst he had been on, but when I went out, I could see massive improvements.  There was no pesticide use and the farmer did not even realise how impeccable his farm was.  There was no room for anything.</p><p>The hedges were a bit untidy, which is exactly what you want.  The field margins had got a bit wider.  He never made an issue of it.  We were discussing breeding, milk production targets and so on.  If it had been the year before, he would have apologised if he had a thistle or a bunch of nettles in the field, but it did not bother him at that point.  It was very clear to me that he had got the message.  When we were finishing up the farm walk, a buzzard flew overhead.  I had not spotted it, but I normally would have.  He spotted it and asked "Donal, is that buzzard?"  It was a great signal to me that we were getting in touch with the farmers and getting them in touch with nature.</p><p> The app includes a full list of the species that can be found in the BRIDE project, including a visual picture and the sound they make.  Part of the problem relates to the species that are gone and the species that are in trouble.  The skylark was one of them.  Only two farmers in the whole BRIDE project had these species, but they did not know that they had them.  Again, I was on another farm walk and we saw a skylark when we were looking at the cows.  I asked the farmer if he knew what that was and he said "No".  I told him it was a skylark.  We have a target payment for these species.  If a farmer has any of the target species on his or her farm we give a target payment.  Neither of the two farmers knew what they were.  Part of the problem is that farmers are being blamed for losing biodiversity, but nobody told them about what biodiversity was, they were not told which species were in trouble, and they still do not know.  We have 42 farmers, which is a very small proportion of what is out there.  Some farmers are very tuned in with regard to the species that are there, but many are not.  As well as scoring for quantity and quality of habitats, the app also shows the species to look out for so that farmers can become more in touch with nature on their own farms.  The best part of it is that it will probably engage them.  They will have this on their mobile phones and it will engage them every day so they know what exactly is on their farms.  They will see the improvements that are being made.</p></speech>

It has been very informative for me.  It is very interesting to hear the witnesses' perspectives and experiences.  What they are saying really chimes with our climate obligations.  It is interesting to hear that farmers have a willingness in this regard.  I can see it in my area, and how we can point towards the new opportunities and new ways of farming.  I wonder then why we are not making so much progress.  I wonder why the debate is so toxic.  Perhaps we could get a sense from the witnesses of this.  There is such a commonality in the presentations and a shared analysis around where we are and where we need to get to.  There is a lot of detail that I have not yet got my head fully around regarding the frameworks that could make that happen, including results-based payments and so on.</p> <p>  I have a few questions and I hope to afford the witnesses the opportunity to share some of their frustrations on where they believe the barriers are.  I have a question on scale.  I am conscious that a lot of this is pilot projects.  We have lots of pilot projects and for some reason a lot of it does not scale up.  What are the barriers to scaling up these initiatives?  What needs to happen in the next short number of months for these types of initiatives to be scaled up?</p> <p>  On the CAP strategic plan, what are the witnesses assessment of CAP?  There is an idea that farmers will respond to incentives.  There is an argument that maybe the incentives have been the wrong ones.  Does this reflect the wrong set of values at a European Union level or a national level, and does this continue on in the current CAP?  Is the current CAP large enough or is it a smaller pie than previously?  Is it the case that CAP has been repurposed?</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoke about engagement.  This issue has come up time and again.  During planning for carbon budgets, were the witnesses' organisations consulted, formally or informally, on the development of the upcoming climate action plan?</p></speech>

When we talk about land use in Ireland, with almost 75% of the land either in forestry or agriculture, this controls a lot of the direction.  That is really our common agricultural policy.  For many decades, this has been driven by quality food production at low prices.  It must be remembered that we were coming out of near famine situations after the Second World War when the policy was first devised.  From the 1980s, it was recognised that we were getting into overproduction.  There were wine lakes, butter mountains, grain stores full to the brim and so on.  It was recognised that there were environmental consequences and societal consequences of restructuring of rural areas as result of that policy.  It had been a very successful policy in feeding Europe at low food prices for approximately 40 years.<br/><br/>Then we started to know about the science of the environment, and we are now at COP26.  After the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, we had the MacSharry reforms to try to bring in the environmental component into CAP.  Sometimes we feel like we are on the deck of the <i>Titanic</i>.  We found out a couple of nautical miles back in 1992 that the iceberg is there.  The captains of the ship and of industry are ploughing on and saying that the ship will survive any hit from an iceberg.  That is how it feels at the moment.  We are at COP26 and we feel as though the iceberg is there in front of us.  We are possibly at a situation where we can no longer turn the ship and we are going to career straight into it.  Then it is all about how do we adapt and evacuate to lifeboats at that stage.<br/><br/>The frustration is that the CAP has tried for 30 years to bring in environmental considerations.  There has been very slow progress on that.  One of the issues is that in the preamble to CAP it is trying to work towards a sustainable food system.  When one looks at the preambles it says it is working towards sustainable development goals, it is working towards feeding the European population with cheap food, and it is working towards environmental goals.  In reality, however, they are impossible goals and objectives to achieve all together.  One then gets very much stuck in a situation where, if one has impossible goals or objectives set within a quite rigid structure, one ends up at each policy cycle with a little tweak and sticking to business as usual or at least to inaction.<br/><br/>This is one of the issues we have and we have seen it with our own examples of food harvest.  We will still drive on with production but we will keep an eye on it to make sure we do not harm the environment too much.  Food Wise was about keeping a bit more of an eye on the environment and being a bit more wise about it, but still reaching all of our production targets.  But we did not reach any of our environment targets.  Now in our food strategy we are thinking that now we must start hitting our environmental targets, but we see already - 12 months after the agrifood strategy has been published - that it is out of line with the targets Ireland needs to meet on the environment, and the climate change targets in particular.  I am not answering the Deputy's question very well, but we must understand-----</p></speech>

I often think of the classic example of where we are at the moment.  We have heard a very good example about cutting flock numbers or herd numbers in Ireland.  In 1999 there was an issue of the western hills in the context of a large amount of soil erosion.  Sheep numbers were very high and this was leading to issues.  It was signalled from the 1980s, a decade previous, that something needed to be done to sustainably manage the sheep numbers on the hill.</p><p>In 1999 there was a European Court of Justice finding against Ireland stating it would not get any more agriculture payments in the following year unless something was done about this.  What did we do at that stage?  Rather than managing the incremental management of this, we went over a cliff edge and stock numbers had to be cut by 30% overnight.  I remember being in Tourmakeady at the time as a very young adviser talking to farmers at a rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, training course.  They said when they heard first about this European Court of Justice finding against Ireland, they were not sure what it was all about, but they thought stock numbers would be managed at last.  They said they had one or two shareholders in the area who had 800 or 900 sheep while others had 50 or 60, and this at last would bring that 800 back down.  What happened, they said, was they were all cut by 30%, so the lads who were not doing any damage were cut to 20 or 30 ewes.  They were then off the hill; that was it.  The lads who had 800 were cut to 500.  I am not blaming them as they drove on and followed the incentives.</p><p> I believe we will have exactly the same issue now.  We have had repeat incremental change leading to no real results.  Now we are at the same cliff edge again.  With a wrong move and a stroke of a pen, we can destroy our agricultural sector and make a very bad move.  This is why, at this stage, we need to make a bold move with our CAP strategic plan.  We need to be environmentally ambitious on it.</p></speech>

Even in the past week, I saw something which is very worrying.  We had a 5% target for these biodiversity managed areas, BMAs, Mr. Sheehan is talking about in the eco schemes.  I do not know what has happened in the past eight weeks but it has gone from 5% to 4% at the stroke of a pen where the target in the agrifood strategy is 10%.  That signals we are on the same scenario with out CAP strategic plan.</p> <p>  I may be talking in manner that is a little too frustrated now.  However, in dealing with these issues, knowing what we know, knowing it can work and knowing farmers such as Mr. Sheehan are crying out for some positive moves to make this happen, and given the lack of leadership at departmental level, at Government level, around this table as well and among the farm organisations - I will probably be crucified for having said this - we have to take positive action now.  This is the problem, and it does not have to be at that extent.</p> <p>  One thing about sustainability is that it is all about economics, society and the environment working in harmony, but we must see it from the basic principles.  The economy is a construct of society - it serves society - and we all have to work within the limits of the environment.  This is where we need to get to.</p> <p>  I have gone off on an awful tangent.  I do not think I have answered any of the Deputy's questions.  It is just this level of frustration.  As scientists, as people working on the ground and as farmers, we see and live the issues.  Now we just need the political leadership to make this happen.</p> <p>  We cannot blame Europe.  We are very good in this country at saying Europe makes us do this and that.  We are European citizens.  We are involved in shaping that framework.  The framework this time has been handed to us - back to the member states.  It is as though they said, "Right lads, you sort it out this time at national level", for the CAP to a certain extent.  And what is it?  It is a race to the bottom across all member states worried that if one of us takes an ambition, we will erode our competitive advantage whereas we should be thinking we will take the lead and use that to our competitive advantage to sell our products as high-environment high-welfare products.</p> <p>  This has to involve the industry as well, as Mr. Sheehan said, if some people within it lead on this as well and start differentiating the products.  I do not see why Bord Bia and Origin Green do not differentiate Irish products based on their environmental standards.  We say it is all great, knowing damn well it is not.</p></speech>

I would say there is fear among farmers.  There is a herd mentality.  If you are another dairy farmer or another beef farmer in one of the big groups and there is a fodder crisis, something will be done.  If you are a forester, as has happened with the ash dieback, they will tell you to cut down the ash and bury it or whatever.  It is your problem.  Different sectors have more political clout.  It is safer to be in the big group than in the small group.  That is the reality of it.<br/><br/>As well as that fear, there is a certain amount of disinformation, and it is still being moved around among the farmers through the farm organisations.  I am a member of the IFA and I am a committee member of the IFA.  It bothers me sometimes that stuff they know is not exactly accurate is being put out through the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>to stoke up the fear to get the result they want.</p></speech>

Dr. Moran did well in expressing and limiting the expression of his frustrations.  In fairness, it is complex.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in an invidious position sometimes trying to please everybody, but we definitely need to take that step.</p> <p>  I always try and look at it from the farmer's point of view because ultimately the farmer will make the difference on the ground for the environment or maybe against it in some cases.  How do we convince that farmer?  In the past, payments, as Mr. Sheehan mentioned, have been short term.  For example, it is a five-year payment, and then what happens?  There is no confidence to invest in the future.  As a farmer, you always have to think long term.  It has been short-term payments.</p> <p>  The environmental payments have lacked credibility.  You would have had an adviser a few years ago telling a guy to clear a field and the same adviser coming back telling him to protect it.  Many payments have been to prevent farmers from damaging the environment as opposed to rewarding them for looking after the environment.  There are issues around that.</p> <p>  I would like to highlight the fact it is not only the money.  The policy is the big one.  There is a huge opportunity now.  The CAP strategic plan offers a significant opportunity but it does need tweaking.  Putting a limit on what farmers can be paid to deliver these ecosystem services we desperately want is not a good idea.  If we get more, we should be prepared to pay more.</p> <p>  I point out the fact that probably within farming there are cultural obstacles.  Farming is a very public profession and, right now, within the psyche of farmers, you are judged by your neighbours and your community about how green are your fields and how pedigree is your Irish stock to some degree.  We need to shift that around and get farmers to think that, as Mr. Sheehan said about the weeds, sometimes having a little more biodiversity and capturing a little more carbon - having a little agri-forestry on the farm - are signs of a very good, smart, multi-functional farmer who will leave a real legacy, not only for his family but for society.  That is a major change.</p> <p>  One of the frustrations for me is that the language we are using is all wrong.  It is dominated too much by policy and science and we are not listening enough to the farmers on the ground.  It is quite hard to hear their voice because you really need to get in there and listen.  I am privileged to meet farmers every day and the story I hear is very different and much more positive and open to change than is portrayed generally in the media.  That would be my real frustration.</p></speech>

I thank them.  It has been very interesting.</p> <p>  First, I would say most of us share their frustration.  However, I would say leadership needs to be shown everywhere.  It is not only Government.  The Opposition needs to show leadership, quite frankly, and it is not doing that either.  We are being caught between a rock and a hard place.  There is a toxic narrative that needs to stop.</p> <p>  Mr. Traas mentioned the media and the part they have to play.  Certainly, if you look through farmers' media in general rather than mention one in particular, there needs to be more of these stories.  Definitely, we are hearing the farming for nature stories but we are not hearing enough of them.  It is not enough to say the proportion of people who are in results-based schemes is quite low and therefore we are reflecting what is there.  We know we need to boost that.  Any farmer I speak to wants to get into results-based schemes and, therefore, that narrative needs to come out.  I am leaving them space to talk more about their frustrations, but also, maybe, to broaden it, because we want to do the right thing.</p><p>Anything that can be pointed to specifically that needs to be done, the committee will take on board.  It will be on the record of this committee.  What Mr. Traas has done today has been very valuable.</p><p> Mr. Traas mentioned agroforestry and the role orchards might play on farmland.  When he talks about the app, that relates to very small projects.  I want to make sure that we are getting something that means we can have that kind of diversity around the country, where it is not a ten-point kind of system, although I know that is not what he meant.  That means we have to leave places for orchards and for different things, not just based on land but on the kind of diversity that we need in our food system and soil system, for instance.</p></speech>

It is a good point that there is an appetite.  We had a little project in Clare recently called The Hare's Corner.  We made an offer to farmers in County Clare to see who would like to put in a small orchard or pond or woodland on the farm.  We were overwhelmed with the response.  It was not lucrative, and we were just covering costs.  There is a real appetite to engage if we can create opportunities to do so.  What worries me is that we have made things so bureaucratic.  The language has been so wrong and negative and so penalty oriented, and the voices promoting it have been the wrong voices.  We have done just about everything we can to put people off the kind of engagement that we want to persuade people to have.  We need to work harder on that and the media have a part to play on that.  It seems like the negative voices get heard the most.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been trying to build on with all these projects, the EIPs and the successive pilots is that they have all happened at quite a local scale.  We know the landscape of Ireland is very diverse.  We often forget about how diverse it is.  Different parts of the country have different capacities to produce different things.  The farming example we have here are very different farms producing very different crops, maximising the potential of the particular valuable land that they have.  They are in that direction because one farm is best suited to growing grass and producing dairy products from that and another farm is best suited, say the wonderful microclimate that Mr. Traas probably has, to producing the horticultural products and apples.  We have advocated that the next CAP will include these co-operation projects involving local areas around the country.  We divide the extensive farming areas of the country, where most of the EIPs are based, into these broad eight different landscape types, spread from the very south east up to Donegal.  Starting in January 2022, once the CAP strategic plan is submitted to Brussels, we will begin these co-operation projects - that is the language in the article of CAP - which are essentially local partnership projects.  First, we do a diagnosis of the area and come together with the farmers and local stakeholders and put an action plan in place so that they can design their own bespoke agri-environmental schemes, taking what is available there and what is already developed by the EIPs, their forerunners.  It is sort of what is in the capital strategic plan, but the detail is not in it and the detail is critical to facilitate this to happen for 20,000 farmers.  If that is successful for 20,000 in this stream of the agri-environmental programme when it is rolled out in 2023, within 24 months, by 2025, all the rest of the farmers in the country will be clamouring to have their locally adapted, results-based agri-environmental programme based on these local co-operation project areas as well.  It is a challenge for our administrative system to facilitate this but I think there is will in sections of the Department to make this happen.  If we can support this over the next number of months, it can facilitate this happening across the country.  It is about harnessing the diversity and the power of local knowledge to design systems that will work for their particular locality.  I would like to see the results-based payment systems for dairy environments.  We have them for upland environments, the foothills and the low land flood planes of the Shannon Callows.  We have them in areas where we have to do large-scale landscape scale rehabilitation of our midland peatland landscapes.  The solutions are built at local level through, and facilitated by, policy.</p></speech>

The original idea is to have your planation of forest or trees in a gap and then another line of forest or trees in the space between the trees where you run your conventional agriculture and the rest of the crop agriculture.  I have had inquiries from people asking if they can plant their apple trees as the hedge or forestry in between the crops or livestock.  That raises some practical problems because policy and quality assurance schemes, etc., do not want livestock in the same place as a food crop.  That would be a concern.  It was a possibility 50 or 100 years ago but not now.  What is required is a re-examination of some of the schemes and how to ensure there is food safety and so on.  Similarly, where there is a tillage crop and another food crop beside it, if you spray the tillage crop with fungicide or insecticide or whatever, that may have a drift effect onto your alternative crop.  There are practical issues to be ironed out both around the actual farming of it and the regulation of it.</p></speech>

It has been really inspirational to listen to them, what they have done and the leadership they have shown within their own farming communities.  In this debate, climate change and climate action and agriculture can sometimes seem insurmountable and that there is no solution that will not devastate our local and rural economies but the witnesses have shown that there is a way to do it.  It is great that they can explain it to us and we can point to these as successful projects that hopefully will be rolled out.</p> <p>  Dr. Moran spoke of the cliff face he thinks we face.  I agree but I think the cliff face is probably 2025-2026 when we do not meet the initial targets that are set under the current climate action plan, or its first phase.  If the Government does not have a higher ambition for agriculture meeting emissions targets in that first phase, what will be the consequences?  </p> <p>  Dr. Moran raised something I was going to raise but he pre-empted me, namely, labelling.  When I listen to Mr. Sheehan or Mr. Traas speak about their farms, if there was produce in my local shop and I could see exactly what biodiversity or environmental benefit these local farmers were providing I know that I would pay a premium price for it.  What steps would need to be taken in order to get such a labelling system rolled out?  It would assist a lot of people and give them the information that they need to make the consumer choices that we would want them to make.  </p> <p>  Mr. Traas's situation is one that illustrates how badly wrong we have got our agrisystem in Ireland that the majority of us will buy produce that has been packaged and flown in from, say, New Zealand or South Africa when we are perfectly capable of producing our own high-quality product in Ireland and should be doing so.</p><p>Why does Mr. Traas think that happened?  There was obviously a decision or a trigger or something to discourage or disincentivise farmers such as Mr. Traas from getting into that area.  How can that be reversed?</p></speech>

Reading some of the EU targets, we are talking about carbon neutrality by 2050.  That is the overall target we are looking towards, but in respect of the Green Deal, in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector, the European target is to be carbon-neutral by 2035.  If we are not working seriously now with higher level ambition to 2025 and 2030, working towards carbon neutrality in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector, we will not have a chance of meeting the European target for 2035, which is not coming through in the narrative at all at the moment.  The science says it, the Government knows it and the main Opposition party knows it as well.  We have to meet these targets, and the more we delay action the more difficult it will be.</p> <p>  We should take more positive action now, have an ambitious CAP, for example, set our targets at a higher level of ambition and not roll back as we have seen in the base line conditionality.  We need to drive on eco schemes that deliver positive action.  With many of the current eco schemes, we know that when they are designed they will not do anything beyond business as usual.  There is &euro;300 million per annum invested in that.  That a government would do such a thing is crucifiable.  In addition, we have to stop having what we call indirect climate actions or agri-environment actions.  If we are calling something an agri-environment or a climate action and we are thinking of it as having only an indirect benefit to the climate, it is not climate action.  We have no more time for that sort of stuff.</p> <p>  We need to take an incremental approach towards the targets for 2035 and 2050, but the approach we have taken from the start has been very much delayed, considering we have been such a laggard for so long.  The delaying will only make it more painful further down the line.  If we do it right, based on what we have seen in the projects and the examples given here, it does not need to be painful.  We can build a farm economic system, stepping in in the mid-term with public funds to pay for the targets we want to achieve.  There is no way around this.  If we want to change our agricultural system - and much of it at the moment is based on production subsidies or still tied to past production levels - we need to tie that now to environmental performance.</p> <p>  We are under-ambitious as well in the budget that has been assigned to the agri-environmental schemes to make some of this change happen.  We estimated in some of our initial calculations that we needed a budget of approximately &euro;400 million for agri-environmental schemes.  We have in the budget that was recently published &euro;300 million per annum, so it is about 25% short to realise the vision we have.  That answers Deputy Whitmore's question a small bit.</p> <p>  The labelling systems are quite a difficult matter.  There are many more people who are an awful lot more expert in this within Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is European labelling legislation that has to be taken into account as well.  I know from talking to some colleagues recently that there have been webinars on this, and there is Mr. Sheehan's work with his new European innovative partnership project to see if he can develop labelling in this regard, but it is not easy.  It is more in the realm of business, marketers and scientists.  If, however, the Government gives clear signals that we want to differentiate products, and if the industry takes a lead on this and states it wants a label that means something in respect of environment delivery, the expertise is elsewhere in terms of the industry and the Bord Bias and marketeers of this world to make that happen but, again, the will is needed to make it happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con Traas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#N00500"><p>I will respond briefly to the question about labelling.  I do not have a good answer to it but I can see why labelling is very difficult.  Taking the example of wild Irish salmon and Irish wild salmon, they are two totally different things, but most people will not know that, so the committee can see where this is fraught with difficulty and that to legislate for it is really difficult.</p> <p>  I wish to bounce back on something Dr. Moran said.  The last good environmental scheme we had was REPS.  We have not had one since and the rest were not well designed.</p> <p>  As to why horticulture is struggling, apples is reflective of this.  They peaked in the early 1970s in terms of crop production area and so on.  That was partly because we joined what turned out to be the European Union and it was just so much cheaper and so much simpler to get stuff from abroad.  People stopped growing things at home because it was cheaper to buy them from abroad than it was to grow them at home.  We, therefore, lost many people who were growing themselves.  All the small-scale market gardeners went.  It was not that they went all of a sudden; rather, some got older and retired.  There was no succession so the farm probably went into one of the mainstream types of farming and so on.  That happened over the subsequent 30 or 40 years.</p> <p>  Horticulture is still in quite a good position.  There is 18,000 ha of land dedicated to horticulture.  It is still the fourth largest sector of agriculture in the country.  However, these are problems that growers are discussing.  Members can see we still import a lot of potatoes, but the types of potatoes we are importing are frozen chips.  We do not have a frozen chip processing plant here, and that is just to do with the industrial scale of producing frozen chips.  Those are the kinds of issues there are.  </p> <p>  Deputy Whitmore mentioned apples from New Zealand.  Bringing apples from New Zealand, which is fairly carbon-intensive, is not much more carbon-intensive than bringing them by road from Italy to Ireland, for example.  When one starts digging into the particulars of various types of fruits, vegetables or whatever it is one is moving, it becomes very difficult for people to ever understand what is good and what is bad.  We have a kind of hunch that things from farther away are worse and things from closer are better, but it is a lot more complicated than that.  Obviously, one should never fly any fruit or vegetables anywhere, but a lot of it is not flown.  Much of it is transported in large quantities by ship, where it is chilled.  It would have to be chilled even if it were sitting here in Ireland.  It is, therefore, very difficult for an ordinary consumer to get to grips with what is sustainable and what is not.  I would not know where to start with it, but of course we should have more domestic production.  That should not be difficult, but what comes with that is a certain level of understanding of seasonality.  We do not grow strawberries here for the middle of winter or tomatoes, for that matter.  It is just not possible.  I like tomatoes and I will have them later in the year as well, unfortunately.  It is difficult but at a certain point, unless something like a carbon tax begins to impinge on the price of those products, I do not see that all the labelling in the world will achieve what a simple system of making sure that the carbon price, the carbon attached to a product, will achieve, unfortunately.</p></speech>

It has been a really encouraging session.</p><p>They are not always as encouraging.  Sometimes we feel as though we are standing in front of the sea, telling it to stop.  It has been encouraging to hear our guests' wisdom, the meitheal and the humility in regard to the planet, regarding the earth as a provider and producer that has to keep going.  If the transition were in their hands, we would be very lucky.  It is a pity this is not a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine because their input would be valuable there.<br/><br/>My first question is for Dr. Dunford.  Everybody is talking about the Amazon at the moment.  If it is the lungs of the world, the Burren, ecologically, is the soul of Ireland.  We understate at our peril our respect for the planet and the land.  It is great that farmers were centrally involved with the Burren project, collaborating and driving the issues, as opposed to being manipulated and scared by some of the lobbies.  The incentivising Dr. Dunford spoke about is critical and we will need more of that throughout the island in the time ahead.  It is a no-brainer and could be mainstreamed as quickly as possible.  Is there imagination on the part of the powers that be and the lobbies to look again and co-create something such as in the Burren project, as opposed to always protecting the <i>status quo </i>but really protecting nothing at all?<br/><br/>Turning to Mr. Sheehan, I have family in Cork who talk to me about the magic of Bride Valley.  If a pocket of ancient Ireland remains, Bride Valley is it.  He is a guardian, therefore, of something invaluable.  As he said, responsible farmers are caught in a system that looks and sounds great but that, in reality, is not.  They get the blame for that poor system.  Ireland has so often got on the back of farming to promote our green credentials, and for that, we are in debt to Mr. Sheehan and his colleagues.  The system at the moment is all about financial worth, with no thought for the value of life on the land, whether humans, flora, fauna or biodiversity.  Some land will have to be allowed just to be, and farmers will have to be allowed just to be on that land.  Is there a realisation from the Government, the financial institutions and the farming lobbies to get away from the big buck of industrialised food production that is destroying Ireland's green reputation for the sake of the bigger buck?  What do we need to make that leap of faith together?<br/><br/>My final question is for Dr. Moran.  All our guests have given us a great sense of the small farmer and the producer of food and custodian of the land.  It would light a fire in the imaginations of people who might feel a little hopeless.  It is not just about selling milk to China or worrying about the way Chinese babies should be fed.  It is also about the politics of food.  Does the poor quality of food going to poorer people, with the production getting a small number of people very rich, cost the earth?  Is it time for decent, old-fashioned socialism in our approach to how we farm, eat and live?</p></speech>

Our dream was that the Burren, which is a beautiful little project, would have a big ripple effect throughout Ireland and be taken up and enhanced in other areas such as the hen harrier project, the freshwater pearl mussel project and the BRIDE project.  There is no reason Ireland cannot emulate that at a European level and, as we said earlier, become the green heart of the European Green Deal.  We have unique potential in Ireland to become that.  Nationally, we need what we had locally in the Burren, namely, great local leadership, the enabling of policies, partnerships between scientists, farmers and policymakers, and engagement and belief among farming communities that they will look after their heritage because it is too important to leave it to others.  We need to take that role nationally and that is our hope.</p> <p>  I acknowledge this is a meeting of the climate action committee but I am delighted somebody has raised biodiversity.  Climate change is described as a wicked problem and we need a wicked solution.  Nature can provide that.  It has the complexity to do so if it is managed in the correct way.  Talking about farming and biodiversity is entirely opportune for this discussion.  I encourage the committee to bear in mind they should not focus too much on the single issue of climate but examine the broader issue of both biodiversity and the crisis in food nutrition.  We can resolve all these issues by managing the land in the correct way.  We have the farmers to do that and we need the policies and the support to make it happen.</p></speech>

I do not think they see issues that have a non-financial value.  I keep saying we have to put a value on nature and quality of life.  Farmers are beginning to do that, but for everyone else, the question seems to be what the profit margin is.  Biodiversity, at the moment, has very little potential for a profit margin.  Farmers have to put something on it themselves.  When I go out in the morning, I walk among trees and listen to the birds.  I put great value on that.  We get so many queries from farmers and non-farmers alike.  I have a field of wildflowers that I call a biodiversity plot.  It is on the top side of the farm and I will go there after this meeting concludes.  It is kind of my therapy there.</p> <p>  Farmers are beginning to appreciate that there is and there has to be another way of life.  I spoke to a farmer not that long ago who was only 27 years of age.  He was a manager who was getting out of farming.  I asked him whether it was because of the money but he said the money was quite good.  He said his girlfriend was a teacher, and he was getting up at 6 a.m. and not seeing her until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. that evening.  That is the price of the road we have gone down.  When the Government sees the value of all those things, we will become a better society.</p> <p>  Dr. Dunford spoke to the quality of our food.  We are known as a food nation but we are not able to stand over it.  We can deliver on food quality, quality of life, water quality and biodiversity, but we have to be given the correct signals.  If the Government keeps its focus on this &euro;12 billion of food exports, we will not get anywhere.  I spoke earlier about the space for nature and the figure of 10%. There is a debate currently about whether the figure should be 4% or 5%, which Dr. Moran mentioned.  The lowest figure on BRIDE farms is 6% or 7% and those farmers have increased to 8%.  The average in the BRIDE project is 13%.  A target or ambition of 4% space for nature, therefore, is not even on the scale.  If the average of 13% for nature among farmers in the BRIDE project is assumed to be the average throughout the country - I do not know what the real figure and I do not think anyone does - that is the level we are at with all this biodiversity loss.  We actually need to go well beyond 13%, therefore, and a minimum of 10% is what we are saying.  That would be a great start.</p> <p>  Ireland is in a great position, despite all the reports of habitats being taken out.  We still have many of them.  We are in a position to restore them and we would be well ahead of any other country in the world.</p><p>I worked in New Zealand and two friends from there came over here about six months ago.  They were walking the farm and could not figure out why I had hedgerows because they were taking up space for the cows.  That is what we are dealing with across the world.  That is the road we have all gone down.  Despite everything, we are fortunate that farmers still have an appreciation.  We are in a great position to start restoring these habitats but incentives must be provided.  The Government saying it wants to improve biodiversity and sort out the climate problem is the greenwashing I am talking about.  We need action on the ground.  Above all, we need direction.  It would be fantastic if someone in a position of power and authority were to make a bold statement that we need to change and we are going to change.  Farmers are getting mixed messages.  The reason there is so much confusion and anger out there is that there is no direction.</p></speech>

As scientists, we are loath to talk about politics but we need to engage in it more.  However, everyone must realise when a scientist engages in politics it is only another opinion.  I do not have the same strength of evidence behind me when I comment on international food politics.  There are an awful lot of people in the country who may be better placed to comment, for example, economists who would understand this issue much better.  However, from my impressions of what I see, we cannot leave something as important as our food systems to the vagaries of globalisation and international food markets.  I do not think we have any pretence about this in Europe; we do not do that.  Food production in Europe is not a free market economy.  Much of it is governed by the incentives from the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>  While food production in Europe is not a free market economy, the way the system is set up mirrors some of the worst aspects of the free market economy, for example, driving inequality and unfairness in the supply chain.  Some of this has been put eloquently and much better by Mr. Sheehan regarding the pressures farmers on the ground are under within that sort of a system.  One side argues that this is about European consumers and the health of European citizens but then we drive on and everything is export and profit-led.  We must pull back a bit from the brink.  Mr. Sheehan spoke about putting a value on things.  Where do we put our values?  Everyone talks about the unfairness in the supply chain but we need to take serious action on that by having more money go back to the farmers.  When we are in rooms talking to farmers they always say, and rightly so, that you cannot be green when you are in the red.  The only response to that is that we must create a system whereby the only way out of the red is paved green.  This has to go across our international food politics as well but, to be honest, that is way beyond me.  I will give an opinion on it but it is only an opinion.</p></speech>

I begin with Dr. Dunford and Dr. Moran, and the Burren Project specifically.  The Burren is some distance from my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire but, nonetheless, it is a place I have loved visiting in the past.  I am reading from the evaluation of the Burren programme.  One of the comments that stood out in Dr. Dunford's opening statement was on bureaucracy, the need for the flexible administration of a similar system which needs to be responsive to farmers' needs as opposed to farmers having to respond to the criteria or systems that are put in place.  I hear Dr. Dunford on that.  Giving that flexibility would probably be difficult for us as legislators but I can certainly understand the need for it.</p> <p>  The statement notes that as "a flagship agri-environment scheme, the Burren Programme also maintains strong links with environmental organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in Ireland and Europe."  The REPS was introduced a number of years ago.  In that context, how do the witnesses envisage a programme similar to the Burren programme being rolled out on a more national scale?  Will they elaborate on the need for flexibility?</p> <p>  I do not have any questions for Mr. Traas but I thank him very much for his responses.</p> <p>  I hear Mr. Sheehan, especially in relation to dairy farmers, the pressure they are under and the perception that has been created.  I heard news coverage on COP26 this morning which referred to the pressure on farmers.  In a way, it is pigeonholing agriculture as a whole sector.  That puts off people who I believe genuinely want to work with the land.  It is in their interests to work with the land and ensure it is viable for future generations.  There is an eagerness to improve processes.  Mr. Sheehan's opening statement was honest and frank and one I felt needed to be heard.  I hope we see similar projects to his own BRIDE Project evolve right across the country.</p> <p>  My questions were focused on the Burren programme and I ask the witnesses to respond on that.  Maybe Mr. Sheehan will have a comment or two of his own.  I thank all the witnesses for their time this afternoon.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  He raised two good points around flexibility and bureaucracy.  In many of our protected landscapes, there are many barriers to a farmer farming.  Permission must be secured for this, that and the other and it is beyond many people to farm.  One of the greatest services we offer to our farmers in the Burren is not just the payment but taking care of that bureaucratic workload.  This is what I mean by designing our programmes around the needs of the farmer.  None of us likes doing paperwork but for farmers it is a death sentence and a real deterrent.  We have taken that whole bureaucratic workload away from them so they can get on and do what they are best at, which is farming and delivering the ecosystem services we want.  That is really important, including at local level.</p> <p>  The second point is around flexibility.  When we think about a scheme farmers love and enjoy, the money will be important but the freedom to farm is absolutely critical.  Farmers hate being told what to do.  We had the discussion before about how different parts of the country are different.  Every farmer is different and even the fields within a farm are different.  We need to create a programme which allows different forms of management to take place on different fields within different farms to deliver different outcomes.  The only way to do that is through this results-based approach whereby the farmer is told what we want and what we will pay for from a field and he or she can go ahead and innovate to deliver that.  That is one of the key principles of the Burren programme.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about scaling the programme, it effectively has been scaled from 200 to 2,000 farmers across Ireland who are now involved in result-based payments.  It is the principles that we are scaling.  These are the principle of partnership between the farmer and the scientist, the principle of keeping it local and addressing local issues and challenges and the principle of paying the farmer for what he or she delivers.  There is no problem in the Deputy, as a legislator, enabling that to happen.  The mechanism is already there to enable that flexibility.  It is about deciding what outcomes we want, putting a price on them, putting a local structure in place to support the delivery of that outcome and letting farmers at it.  They are more than capable of delivering.  My message to the Deputy is one of reassurance that this can be done and is being done and we just need to get on and do more of it now.</p></speech>

It is critical that we have an administrative system that enables farmers and gives them the freedom to farm.  The key thing that makes the system work is that we have to be very clear on the outcome and results we want to achieve.  This is based on a scoring system.  All anyone - from the administrator to the taxpayer paying for this to the farmers delivering it - will need to worry about then is delivering the results and whether a particular field has delivered the result and the products.  If the farmers have delivered, they get the payments and rewards for it.  We do not have to worry about going out and checking what month of the year it was done, how many cows were there or whether the land was grazed with elephants or horses or whatever.  We do not have this level of administrative checks.  We have to be able to check that we have delivered on the agreed outcome.  This is the basis of the results-based programmes.</p> <p>  Levels of trust are key in this.  The administration letting go of all of these checks and box-ticking exercises to focus on a result is quite difficult, as is trusting farmers to deliver.  The first thing they wonder is what will happen if they do not deliver the results.  Will they be liable to penalties, audits and inspections?  If the result is not delivered, it is not paid for so there are no problems there.  It is easy enough to state this in principle.  The difficulty for the scientists is to capture all of this complexity about environmental quality in a simple outcome-based system that can be administered and delivered on a farm.  We have shown over the past ten years that this can work.</p> <p>  We must have an adaptive and flexible system.  We have some of the answers now.  We cannot wait until we have all of the answers.  We start with knowing what we need to deliver now.  We have a scoring and payment system on this.  We have an administrator to deliver it.  We continuously monitor and adapt.  We will have more challenges in future.  We do not stay in a rigid system.  If we find something is not working, we have to be able to change it within the system and move on.</p></speech>

He mentioned how he is far removed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire from the Burren and the BRIDE project.  The common thread we all have is that I am depending on him to buy his cereals, meat or milk from me.  We are essential workers.  Despite all of the criticism we get, people should not forget that we are very fortunate to be living in a country where food is plentiful.  We want to produce food as best we can and as healthily as we can.  At the end of the day, we all need to appreciate one another.  There is a way out of this.

I was not going to miss the opportunity to engage with them.  They bring hope to me, as somebody who lives in the middle of nowhere on a small family farm.  One of the reasons I got into politics was my deep concern about farming and the idea of two sizes fitting all, that we have dairy or beef and that is it.  As the song says, there are 40 shades of green and that was based on the variety of our land in Ireland.  It seems we have failed to acknowledge this in some way over many years.  Perhaps we could blame the EU in 1973 but we are where we are.</p> <p>  I work with communities in west and north Clare where I come across farmers who are desperate and do not know what they have to do.  They want to do the right thing.  We have had too many suicides because of farmers being forced to expand and borrow and who are then up to their necks in debt.  It is something deeply disturbing that I have come across in many rural areas.  It is a disservice.  I feel very strongly about this.  It was one of the reasons I decided to get into politics.</p> <p>  The current model is wrong and it is damaging farmers mentally, physically and financially.  It fits a certain cohort of farmers in certain areas but it is not fit for purpose for most farmers in Ireland.  It is devastating.  I am from north Clare and all of the farmers I know come from small subsistence farms.  Farmers will say they cannot live off the current model.  They have to have second jobs.  A neighbour of mine told me his father reared six children on the land.  He has double the amount of land with half the number of children and has to work as a carpenter as well.  It is not as though the model we are trying to change is fantastic and working for people.  It absolutely is not.  It might be working for a very small percentage and we can see it when we look at all the money and the huge percentage of CAP that goes to a very small percentage of farmers.</p> <p>  It is amazing the four witnesses are here and leading the way in the radical change we need to see happening as soon as possible.  There is a big demand and want for it.  I went to 1,000 farmers while canvassing in north Clare.  Only two gave me grief about being in the Green Party.  The other 998 told me they do not hear the birds, they do not know what they are doing and they are being paid very little money but that the quality of their product is so much better than that of someone with 1,000 head of cattle shoved in a shed for 24 hours a day 365 days a year.  They are not getting value for it.  The reason I came today was to ask the witnesses directly, based on the fact they are leading the way and giving me hope, what they would do if they were head of Teagasc or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need to be guided by them more than anybody else because they are on the ground representing grassroots farmers whose voices are not being heard in the divisive, unnuanced debate we see played out in the media and by certain people with their own agendas who are not serving the small farmers.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses because I saw on our family farm at home there was no work and now we have 12 jobs.  It is a 60-acre farm.  It is half a job an acre.  How many dairy and beef farmers can say they are getting half a job an acre from the price they are getting for milk and beef?  I cannot buy a pint of Clare milk.  I do not know why people are so afraid to change the system.  It is really bad.  It does not serve the vast majority of people.  It is very hard to access good quality milk or beef because of the monopolies we see in farming and the industrial models we have been using.  Now we are speaking about exporting pigs to China.  It is madness.  There is a climate emergency.  It is inextricably linked to the biodiversity emergency.  I look to the four witnesses and their expertise to help to guide us out of this.  I believe they have the solutions we need.</p></speech>

I met her two weeks ago on the side of a mountain with about 400 people herding cattle up a hill.  It was a great celebration of farming in the broadest sense.  To answer the question as directly as I can, what I would do if I were head of government, God forbid, would be to invest in Ireland's farmers as the solution to the climate crisis, the biodiversity emergency and the crisis in food nutrition.  They have the potential to deliver.  When I say "invest" I mean pay those farmers who are willing to deliver.  For those who do not want to, that is fine.  That is a different agenda.  Farmers in their droves are willing to engage with this agenda if they are properly rewarded, supported and encouraged.  This is what I would do.  Forget about the term "compensation".  We are speaking about paying farmers for essential services they can deliver for society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#Q00600"><p>I echo that.  We have to invest in farming and local communities as a solution to these issues.  As a society we have to agree on our goals and visions for the land base.  We are very advantaged in an Irish context in terms of food production.  We will always be an export island unless our population grows massively, which is not going to happen.  We can be in a situation whereby we export quality food, perhaps more locally based towards the European consumer who is able to pay more for the quality we are able to supply.</p> <p>  Our land has to deliver much more than food.  It has to deliver air quality, clean water, space for nature, recreation and amenity resources.  It is the basis of our tourism industry.  In rural areas, food and tourism are the main economic drivers on which we are dependent.  They are interlinked.  God help us, people would probably think it was lethal if I were in a position to be able to make decisions.  It would be a case where we utilise the land base for more than just food production and reward farmers and the managers of the land for the range of services and the wonderful potential it has.  When we listen to what is being said about COP26 and the international challenges we are facing, even the national challenges seem insurmountable.</p><p> Every October, we meet in the Burren.  It gives us a renewed sense of hope that when we come together as local communities, we can see what can be achieved in these areas.  We undervalue farmers as offering the solutions to and being the drivers of this.  To support them, we need clear goals, guidance and rewards into the future and not the type of see-sawing we are seeing now in terms of the setting of goals in any one year and then changing them in five years' time.  God knows where they will be with a change of Government cycles.  We cannot have our food systems working like that.  We need clear visions for what we want to achieve.  We need an integrated land-use strategy that gives solutions to climate and biodiversity crises and builds a resilient agriculture system at the same time.</p></speech>

Anything that Government can do to change consumer sentiment is very helpful.  Up to five years ago, it appeared there would be no end to the price pressure and continuous squeeze that was on growers.  That has changed in the past couple of years because demand has greatly increased.  Every supermarket chain in the country, including Lidl, Aldi, Tesco, SuperValu and Dunnes Stores, is crying out for Irish apples.  That has led, indirectly, to a significant price increase over the past two seasons, with price being up approximately 50%.  That is unheard of.  The supermarkets do not like giving growers an increase of more than a couple of per cent per year.  That came about because of demand and because the supermarkets can see that people are paying for it.  People are prepared to pay mid-range to premium prices for the apples that we are growing in Ireland.</p> <p>  I do not know if anybody here watched "Ear to the Ground" in the past few days, on which there was an interview with an apple grower in Milltown who has been growing apples for, more or less, as long as I have.  He said that it this the first time in the past couple of decades that he has hope.  I also have hope.  There is a tailwind coming in terms of people's concept of localisation and better understanding of food production and the cost of cheap food.  There are costs to cheap food other than just the cost paid by the consumer on the day.  The more information consumers have, the better.</p></speech>

On what needs to change, from where I am coming, it is about education.  Farmers need to be better educated with regard to the importance of the environment and what it can deliver.  That has never been explained to farmers.  When people do not understand something they struggle to try to come to terms with it and to make changes.  When REPs was first introduced, it was a great scheme.  Many alternative farmers saw it as an income supplement for farmers who, as described by them, were not serious farmers.  That is still a problem.  There is a cohort of farmers that believe the environment is not that important and that the job of producing food intensively is more important.  We need to get the message out there that the environment is equally as important and that it is not possible to produce good food without a good environment.  As I said, it is about education.</p> <p>  On the advisory service, it has struggled.  Farmers were brought up and trained how to produce as efficiently as possible.  That was the advice given to farmers.  There is inevitably an environmental cost to that.  That needs to change.  The advisory service needs to send out the strong message that the environment is not just for non-intensive farmer and that it is more important than ever than intensive farmers have a story to tell.  If we do not start looking after the environment consumers will, I fear, go elsewhere.  I am totally dependent on consumers and I am always aware of that regardless of policy.  If people do not want to drink milk, my business is in real trouble.</p></speech>

I want to recognise my neighbour, Mr. Traas.  The engagement today has been very positive, particularly from Dr. Dunford and Dr. Moran in terms of their narrative that this is not about farmers against anybody else but about bringing farmers along with us.  It was stated that the best way to do that is to support farmers financially and because that is the right thing to do.  I genuinely believe that farmers understand this.  I agree that we need to bring them on that road in terms of education, supports and what needs to be done but there needs to be a financial element to it as well.  In any scheme brought forward by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine there has to be a financial advantage for a farmer to buy into it.  They are willing to do it.</p> <p>  Reference was made to biodiversity and managing land.  There is no one better at doing that than farmers.  They recognise that and they recognise that their produce is better when it comes from land that is well cared for and well looked after.  In Tipperary, we know that well.  Mr. Traas would know exactly where I come from.  We are tillage farmers at home.  On a personal level, I want to acknowledge the work Mr. Traas does locally in Tipperary.  He is known further afield than Tipperary, Munster or Ireland.  He is known across Europe.  He does a lot of promotional work in relation to tourism for the Tipperary area and a lot of work in terms of Cahir farmers' market, which has a great reputation.  The quality of food is what he is best known for.</p> <p>  Some of my questions are to Mr. Traas in some ways, but also to all of the witnesses.  Many people are getting involved in agriculture or food.  They have the best will in the world to be climate friendly and do all the right things but they are not aware of what they can do or how they can do it.  How can we best educate or support them in doing what Mr. Traas has been doing for 20-plus years?  He has been way ahead of the curve.  A number of years ago, we changed how we worked on our farm.  We were tillage farmers.  We still are tillage farmers but some of our crop is used for whiskey and gin.  We are trying to turn part of our farm into producing from farm to bottle without the product ever leaving the family farm.  That is something new.  My question is how we can do that in the best environmental way.  How can we as a Government support people in how to do that properly, but not financially?  There is a role as well for the local enterprise offices.  They are there to support businesses.  Farmers are businesses.  The local employment offices play a key role in terms of getting businesses up and running over a number of years.  Tipperary is a good area for new start-up businesses.  We need to educate farmers from an environmental point of view in terms of what is sustainable long-term and the role they can play in that regard.</p> <p>  As has been already stated, farmers want to do what is right.  They absolutely hate paperwork.  That is not so true of the younger generation, but they still dislike it.  We need to bring forth more schemes like GLAS that are environmentally friendly in order to make it manageable for farmers to buy into this.  This has been a really positive engagement today.  I thank the witnesses for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con Traas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#R00800"><p>Farmers are pretty much regulated and administrated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Once you start doing something with the product on the farm, such as Senator Ahearn's family has done on the family farm in terms of the whiskey or I have done on my farm, you interact with other Departments.  The LEADER groups and the local enterprise offices are very helpful.</p><p>I was doing something with the local enterprise office only a short time ago regarding a European presentation we were making and much of the talk in that meeting was about programmes that are now coming out of Europe and how the environmental focus is going to be so important to projects that we choose to deliver as food producers.  Farmers are known as food producers.  If we want to access funds, we have to think very quickly and creatively about how we can run an environmentally sustainable business and so forth.  On that side of things, it looks quite hopeful.  In our network in the county, we are going to be fairly quick about seeing what is available to us and that will feed back to the members.  For farmers, they are in a one-stop-shop in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and that, perhaps, makes it a little more difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Dunford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#S00200"><p>The Senator raised some good points and I will be brief in responding.  Where do farmers get advice on how to do that?  They start by talking to other farmers.  This year, the farm information ambassador winners were a wonderful family, Norman and Michael Dunne, who have done extraordinary things on their tillage farm.  It is a substantial 300 ha tillage farm but they have very much reduced their levels of fertilisers, fungicides and other inputs, while sustaining production levels.  Sharing the tried and tested knowledge of other farmers across the sector is something else.  I could name plenty of others around the country, such as Andrew Bergin and Pat Lalor, who have been doing this for years and who have extraordinary results both financially and agriculturally to prove that it works.</p> <p>  The second point I am reminded of is this notion about new entrants.  Another wish I have is that we could make it more accessible to young people who are not currently farming to get into farming.  Access to land is so difficult and every industry needs innovation, fresh ideas and fresh input.  That is a little lacking at present.  It is very difficult for young farmers to access land.  I have met a few of them and what they do when they access land is absolutely phenomenal.</p> <p>  The third point is about the paperwork.  There is a lovely thing in what Dr. Moran, Mr. Donal Sheehan and I are proposing today in our systems.  The European Court of Auditors visited us and they gave us the green light, saying that this type of results-based approach which one can capture using a simple app is a dream for them as auditors because everything is there to access.  One does not need reams and reams of paper and this, that and the other.  This is a very simple system administratively, and it is very important, in terms of our design principles, that it satisfies the needs of the farmer with regard to minimising bureaucracy, as well as the needs of the funder with regard to ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent and is only spent on the delivery of outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#S00300"><p>Regarding raising awareness of what is possible, it is all about demonstrating the art of the possible.  Farmers respect and learn more from other farmers.  There are always going to be farmer champions who take the lead.  Many people will wait and see how they get on first and then follow on from that.  Farmers always need to see that it is possible on their farms as well.  One of the things we have done with the Farming for Nature ambassadors is we have tried to ensure throughout the process over the last three years since 2018 that there are representatives from every sector and land type in the country, ranging from small-scale market gardening to the large tillage farm, from small-scale micro dairy to the large-scale conventional dairy and from all the beef farmers, sheep farmers and organic to everything in between.  There is an example of every type of farm and every type of landscape where solutions can be found.</p> <p>  In terms of building the framework then, when these farmer champions or ambassadors put their heads above the parapet and take a lead on this, the rest of society and the policy have to support them and ensure their reward is financially viable as a result of taking that leap of faith.  I teach the agricultural environment management programme at GMIT and many of the young people coming into the sector need to see what is possible.  Generally, they see what is possible when they see the Teagasc side and from what they see in the farming press.  It is always about more efficiencies and more volume, which is right within our current system.  It is the only way one can go, but they are forced along that route.</p> <p>  Teagasc has a big responsibility in this as our national advisory agency and research and training agency.  It has to demonstrate the art of the possible more across other systems rather than just the conventional beef, dairy and tillage.  It is doing that but it is struggling to change and adapt to it as well.  It has the Signpost programme in which it is setting up 100 lighthouse farms around the country that are leading the way on this.  However, in even a cursory look at that, only six or seven of the 100 farms are in pristine water catchments.  We have gone from 500 pristine water bodies down to 20.  What do those farmers look to within the Signpost programme?  We need to be more ambitious in those programmes about representing the diversity of what is possible.  It is not actually doing down conventional or other systems and the volume, because we will need the volume as well as the quality.  However, we have to demonstrate the variety of what is possible so for young people coming into the sector they can see various different pathways in various landscapes.  When we start to see that in the mainstream farming media, on demonstration farms in Teagasc and in these Signpost programmes, then we will know that change has happened.</p> <p>  It is not that we are going to replace one system.  We will just have more systems and people adapting to their individual contexts and individual farms.  As Dr. Dunford said, all fields and farms are unique, but farmers need to see the options that they can apply in the context that they know best.</p></speech>

I do not come from an agricultural background, but I have been a member of Oireachtas agriculture committee for the last year and it truly has been an education.  However, this session has been even more of an education.  I am fascinated by both the Burren project and the BRIDE Project.  They are very different in that one is dairy whereas the Burren project is small farms and is more suckler farming, I believe.  I am fascinated by the idea of the BRIDE project and that we can have this intensive dairy farming.  I am hearing that there is a possibility we can do that and that if we do it right, there will not be the wholesale destruction of watercourses that we have seen.  Representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, appeared before the agriculture committee a few weeks ago and they told us that we are absolutely not going to achieve our objectives under the EU water framework directive of all our water bodies having good status by 2027.  There is a great deal of scepticism - I am not saying it was from them, but I have heard it in the public domain - about the new nitrates action plan and whether that is going to deliver the improvements and stop the leaching of phosphates and nitrates into watercourses.  I am hearing from Mr. Sheehan with respect to the BRIDE project that perhaps there is a way forward.  That is very positive.  Dairy is the big challenge in Ireland from an emissions point of view.</p> <p>  I hear Dr. Moran's call regarding the CAP strategic plan and the consultation which he told us will start in the next week or two.  Will it run for eight weeks?</p></speech>

It is going to be very short because it has to go to Brussels by 1 January.  That is the trouble we have now.  It is going to be such a short consultation window that unless all the stars are aligned and many stakeholders come together behind this vision, there will not be the possibility to change much in three weeks.</p></speech>

It is a public consultation so everybody who has an interest should feed into that and try to shape it.</p> <p>  I thank you, Mr. Traas, for your contributions.  You mentioned the 11 tonnes per hectare of sequestration.</p><p>Mr. Traas identifies that number as quite low.  In the context of the full emissions in agriculture, one would need thousands of hectares in order to make a significant impact.  There are also the carbon savings from import substitution and maybe diversified land away from say dairy, which is highly emitting, to say horticulture.  It seems that once one adds up some of the impacts of this kind of diversification and production of tillage crops in Ireland, there might be a much greater carbon dividend.</p><p> I am curious about the other opportunities.  Mr. Traas&rsquo;s area is apple farming and generating produce from that.  However, could he speak about other diversification opportunities, particularly with respect to horticulture, that we might have in Ireland?  I am hearing that there might be a significant carbon dividend from that.</p></speech>

There is a certain number of crops, such as broccoli, general brassicas, and so on.  There are also crops that we do not grow here at the moment at a large scale.  These include onions and so on.  While they were grown to a certain extent in the past, they can be a bit tricky to grow here.  As I mentioned earlier, there are things like certain types of potato which are imported.  This is not because we cannot grow them here, but because we do not process that particular type of potato here, or whatever reason.  There are, therefore, many different factors at play there.  We could increase our production three times over, which would be a sizable amount of land, compared to what we already have, which is around 18,000 ha.</p> <p>  The same applies in how much more apples we could produce.  We could produce a certain amount more.  Yet, again, when one is working in an open marketplace, there are certain limits to that.</p> <p>  On the positive side, in the last couple years there have been a few changes in Teagasc.  There has been more emphasis on this.  Just yesterday, it advertised a couple of new posts.  These are permanent positions, one of which is in relation to fruit production.  The other is in relation to the immediate response to the ongoing peat issue.  Teagasc is hopeful that it can come up with a mechanism whereby it can take a few crops, and get them going in a more commercial context.  Then, it will be able to go back to Government and say that it funded those two positions.  Teagasc will also be able to say it has proved it can do this, but it needs technical advice for growers.  The growers are not there, so we first need to find existing farmers who want to switch over to horticultural farming.  Then, we need to assist them in doing so.  That assistance might include anything from finance, because they might need finance to start out, to technical advice.  They will need help in marketing.  As well as this, they will also need buy-in from the whole retail system, such as wholesalers, packers, retailers and consumers.  It is a big jigsaw puzzle.  We have many pieces to put together to make it work.</p> <p>  However, that is where we are starting from because we do not have an industry or set of industries with critical mass.  There are few areas in which we have a critical mass in Ireland, such as soft berries, strawberries, mushrooms, which we actually export, and so on.  They are successful.  We import some strawberries, but we also export some on a year-round basis.  We export massive amounts of mushrooms.</p> <p>  When one looks at crops, such as tomatoes, and so on, they will always need a small land base, because they are so productive.  That will not make a huge difference.  They have their own issues in having to heat glasshouses, and so on.</p> <p>  It is a difficult question to answer exactly.  To go back to the apples situation, we can definitely triple or quadruple our land area.  We will be doubling what we are doing in many vegetables crops.  There is no question about that.  Right now, however, some growers are saying that they need to cut back on what they are doing because they are not making enough money and that it is just not working out for them. They are getting older and less expansion-minded.  They are having trouble getting employees.  Some of the work is fairly tough.  I would not like to encourage it just on the basis of what is good for the country, without good market signals that the price is going to be there to support it.</p></speech>

Would he or any of the other witnesses be able to point us to studies or research that would give us a sense of the opportunity that is there?  I am not necessarily asking that he do so now.  However, if he could send anything into the committee, we would appreciate it.  It would certainly help us in our consideration of the of the topic.</p> <p>  I am interested in what Mr. Sheehan mentioned about the importation of feed for cattle from overseas.  Are there opportunities in Ireland to produce the feed here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Sheehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021110200002#T00400"><p>There are huge opportunities, especially in the last year.  The crude protein, CP, requirement has come down because of the emissions.  In the springtime, dairy farmers usually use an 18% crude protein ration, but that has come down.  We are able to produce cereals and beans, in particular, which is a high-protein crop.  There should be huge incentives there to get tillage farmers to come on board and supply dairy farmers.  That incentive is not there at the moment.  It is an awful pity.</p> <p>  Glanbia did a pilot project a couple years ago where it measured 100 farms for their carbon footprint.  The 100 farms that were sampled came out quite well.  However, what Glanbia did not take into account was the ration that we were importing.  We were in a position to say that while our carbon footprint was low, we were also contributing to the carbon footprint of transport from places such as Brazil, New Guinea, south east Asia, or wherever, by buying plant kernel, coconut, soybeans and so on from those locations.  </p> <p>  There is an opportunity there.  This is regenerative farming where we support other farmers.  That needs to start happening.  Before, dairy farmers, in particular, were just going for the cheapest possible way to produce milk.  There was no account taken of other factors.  For instance, a couple years ago the jersey cow was supposed to be the most efficient to produce milk.  There was a big swing over to jersey cows because they had high protein and high solid content.  However, nobody had factored in that the quality of the bull calf was poor.  The farmer who buys my bull calves depends on me for bull calves.  However, I did not go down the jersey route.  He was annoyed that the quality of the calves was not as good as what it had been before.  There was a situation where dairy farmers were benefiting, but beef farmers were not.  It is easy to say that everyone has to look after their own.  There is a cost to that down the road.  If I cannot sell my bull calves to a farmer and that farmer has to make money out of that, that is going to impact me.</p> <p>  Likewise, I depend on my cereal-producing neighbours so that I can buy my straw from them.  If they are going to go out of business, where will I buy my straw?  Will it come in from abroad as well?  We need to look at the way we produce food in a more holistic way.  The decisions we make should not impact on other people.  It should be a win-win situation for all farmers, and not just for one sector.</p></speech>

I commend him on his opening statement, which was clear and forthright with respect to dairy farming.  I have not seen or heard that kind of commentary.</p><p>Mr. Sheehan is calling out the problem.

Sometimes it is a fairly lonely furrow, so it is good to know we are supported and that members had the patience and interest to listen to us all day.  My parting shot would be that climate is obviously a huge emergency, but let us also think about the food and nutrition emergencies as well.  It is all part of the same problem and the solution is the same.  To my mind, farmers are the solution if we invest in them properly.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

We might have been a bit more honest than we planned or forthright in what we said, but from the session today I think there is hope that solutions can be found.

Perhaps I would say this but I consider this committee to be very progressive and engaged.  It really does want to figure out the problems.  It is very hard-working and has been since its members got together 14 or 15 months ago.  All members, Government and Opposition, have really been fantastic.  In recent sessions we have had non-members of the committee engaging as well because it has been heard across the Houses that we are trying to figure out the way forward here.  This session is going to help us in the production of our report.  We had two previous sessions earlier in the year.  For all kinds of reasons the third session was delayed until today but that might have been quite appropriate because the issue is more topical now with respect to what is in the news including carbon budgets, climate action plans and so on.  Indeed there is also the CAP strategic plan mentioned by Dr. Moran.  It is appropriate we had the session today.  It is really going to help us in the production of our report.  The secretariat is under pressure now with a few reports but this is certainly one we look forward to putting together.  We will issue recommendations and then put them before the Government.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses again.  I also thank members and, indeed, non-members for their contributions.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I need to go through a few housekeeping matters.  I ask any member or witness participating remotely who experiences any sound or technical issue, to let us know through the chat function.  Otherwise, we will proceed.  I advise everybody that as this is a public meeting, the chat function on Microsoft Teams should be used only to advise participants of any technical issue or urgent matter and should not be used to make general comments or statements.  I remind members participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak, and when they are speaking, I ask that, where possible, they have their cameras switched on and be mindful we are in public session.</p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.</p> <p>  Members participating in the meeting from the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene.  They will notice that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge people not to move any chair from its current position and always to maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn except, obviously, when people are speaking.  I ask for co-operation in this matter.</p> <p>  We are in the first of two sessions of our public meeting today.  I welcome Mr. Simon McGarr of McGarr Solicitors and Dr. Fred Logue, principal of F.P. Logue Solicitors.  The purpose of this afternoon's meeting is to engage with them on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill and any general data protection regulation, GDPR, concerns.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to speak, I need to give this advice on parliamentary privilege.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if the witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence about a particular matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Each of them will be allocated five minutes' speaking time.  Due to the time constraints this afternoon we need to try as best we can to stick to that timeframe.  We will have time for questions and answers after the witnesses have spoken, with each member also allocated five minutes.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. McGarr to deliver his opening statement.</p></speech>

I do not intend to presume on the members' time by doing a line-by-line reading of the proposed heads of Bill.  However, I think it is worthwhile addressing some specifics by way of illustration of what I think is a common error of approach throughout.</p> <p>  To start, we should recognise that this Bill represents a proposal for a change in how the State addresses the rights of adopted people.  As recently as 2001, the Irish State was proposing to create criminal penalties as part of access to adoption records, should the records be used in a way the State did not approve of.</p> <p>  The intent in this latest effort to bring the State in line with international human and fundamental rights is described as recognising the importance of a person knowing her or his origins and to achieve this through the provision of access to certain data related to them.  In itself this is a welcome, if belated, change in approach and aims.</p> <p>  If I am to be of service to the committee, it is likely to be in examining the proposed heads of Bill through the lens of the rights acknowledged under EU law by the general data protection regulation.  Therefore, while again acknowledging the improvements of intention and policy this legislation represents, I am afraid I will attempt to make the most of our time by focusing on areas where I think further improvements are still needed to bring it in line with EU law.  I will also discuss some of the legal consequences of passing national legislation which is at odds with the GDPR and the administrative risks and consequences that will inevitably bring.</p> <p>  The first point to make is that this Bill seeks, in part, to legislate for a legal right which is already in existence.  Head 2 goes to great length to attempt to define the documents and data to which it intends to provide access in the rest of the legislation: birth certificate, birth relative information, care information, early life information, and medical information.</p><p>Of course, all of this is simply covered by the definition of personal data set out in Article 4 of the GDPR, as subsequently defined, widely and most helpfully, by the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in the Breyer case.  If personal data means &quot;any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;)&quot;, as it is defined in Article 4.1 of the GDPR, then each of those defined categories of data or records is simply a subset of the general set of all personal data relating to an adopted person.  If a relevant body holds records or personal data relating to a person, and that person makes a request for that data, there is no gap in the current law that is required to be filled.  The GDPR requires that request is granted within a month, as matters stand now.  Failures to comply with the law are failures of administration, not failures of legislation.  Thus, head 12 of the proposed Bill&rsquo;s attempt to legislate away the right of access to birth certificate data of an adopted person is simply not legal under the GDPR.  It would inscribe into national law a restriction on the Article 15 GDPR right of access to personal data, without demonstrating in law any necessity or proportionality for that restriction.<br/><br/>This also goes for the requirement to attend a meeting before a person&rsquo;s data will be provided, as described in the heads of the Bill.  In the case of Gebhard, the CJEU set out the test for any national law which sought to interfere with a fundamental right or freedom of EU law.  The court stated:</p><blockquote>	... national measures liable to hinder or make less attractive the exercise of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty must fulfil four conditions: they must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner; they must be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest; they must be suitable for securing the attainment of the objective which they pursue; and they must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it ...  </blockquote><p>There is a long line of case law that has grown up around this concept of necessity and proportionality.  There is no legislative provision setting out what the purpose of this restriction would be, as it is acknowledged that the record will be granted in all cases.  It appears to be conflating the process of accessing personal data with the process of initiating potential contact with a birth parent.  It would therefore fail on the requirements of necessity and proportionality.<br/><br/>For the same reason, the attempt in heads 5 and 6 to create a list of elements of personal data to which a person would have a right of access is a dead letter, as the general right to all their personal data set out in Article 15 of the GDPR precedes and supersedes it.  Similarly, the restriction in head 7 on the requirement for the provision of birth information to specified relevant bodies is also non-compliant with the State&rsquo;s duties under Article 15 of the GDPR.  It cannot restrict where data is to be requested from.  Any entity, including any State entity, must provide any personal data it holds to a requester on receipt of an Article 15 subject access request.  The same objection holds for heads 8 and 9.  It also holds for head 10, but with the additional issue that head 10 seeks to also refuse to provide information directly to the requester, but instead provide it to a medical practitioner.  This is an additional layer of illegality, in that there is no basis for this interference in the right of access provided for in the statute.  Therefore, it fails the necessity and proportionality test outright by itself.  The final, most extreme example of an attempt to try to legislate away the individual&rsquo;s GDPR rights can be found in head 40, which grossly misapplies Article 23.1(i) to try to set this Irish national law above the EU rights of access derived from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the GDPR.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its time.  I have delivered my speech in what I consider to be record time.  I apologise that I do not have more to say initially but that means there will be more time for questions, which might be useful in itself.</p></speech>

I will be quick as Mr. McGarr went over some of the matters I have addressed in my opening statement.  I have a law practice and we act for quite a few adopted people trying to access their information, so we have some experience of the practicalities and what it is like for them at the moment.  My first thought when I read the draft heads of the Bill was that it was starting from the wrong place.  It is a classic case of "If I was going there, I would not start from here".  The heads are drafted from the point of view of giving people a new right that they do not already have.  As Mr. McGarr has said, that is misconceived because there is an existing right of access to one's personal data, including adoption information.  Even leaving aside GDPR, birth certificates are open documents.  Anyone can go in and get any birth certificate.  These are public documents.  The problem for adopted people is that the barriers to access are not legal but practical.  They do not have enough information about themselves, such as their actual dates of birth and their mother's maiden name, to identify their birth certificate.  That being said, many adopted people can and do get their birth certificates so they are already being accessed.</p> <p>  In addition, the GDPR gives adopted people a right of access to their personal information, including from private and public data controllers, the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla.  However, in these cases access is being blocked, unlawfully in my view, by what I consider to be an unwritten or de facto policy to deny access to most adoption information, and certainly information that would help adopted people find out the identity of their parents and other relatives.  This is achieved through misinterpretation of European law and a policy of applying national law above European law.  Combined with weak enforcement by the Data Protection Commission, the result is that individuals do not have an effective way of enforcing their rights of access to their information.  The point I am trying to make is that these rights exist and will continue to exist irrespective of the legislation because they are EU rights.  There is a risk, however, that if this legislation is passed in this format, it will create a limited parallel system that will create confusion and lead to it being preferred over the GDPR rights.</p> <p>  The drafters of the Bill need to go back to the drawing board and start from the point of view that they are giving greater effect to GDPR rights.  Some of these conflicts I have pointed out have already been highlighted.  First, the material scope is too narrow and granular.  The proposed age limit conflicts with GDPR as there is no age limit on exercising those rights.  The proposed fee in head 3 is in conflict with GDPR because there is a right of access free of charge.  The mandatory information session is a restriction on the right of access under GDPR.  The requirement to give medical information to a medical practitioner is also a restriction.  In fact, there is no reference in GDPR to medical information.  The correct terminology is "health information".  While the non-disclosure aspect of head 13(4) is well intentioned, it will inevitably be interpreted as displacing the right of access.  The restrictions are not being applied correctly, particularly the restriction in head 40, which is a kind of catch-all restriction and is completely outside the way such things are supposed to be done under GDPR. </p> <p>  The European Data Protection Board has produced very good guidance on restrictions of rights under Article 23 of the GDPR so I suggest the drafters read that.  The attempt to restrict the right of compensation is completely incompatible with GDPR.  I am stunned that anyone decided to put that in the heads of a Bill because it is so obviously unlawful.  Where there are new registers or new information created as part of the tracing system, there will be a right of access to that as well.  To avoid all the issues we are seeing, there should be express provisions for the right of access and if there are to be restrictions on it, they have to be set down in the legislation and they have to meet the requirements of Article 23.</p> <p>  Finally, I do not think the Adoption Authority of Ireland or Tusla should be allowed make guidelines that regulate their obligations as data controllers.  There are obvious conflicts of interest there.  All substantive provisions must be in the legislation.  There should not be substantive provisions in guidelines and if there are to be guidelines they should be adopted by the Minister and not by any of the agencies or other bodies that have to give effect to the rights of access.  I thank the committee for allowing me to make this opening statement.</p></speech>

Their opening statements were very helpful, succinct and concise.</p><p>They have really brought clarity to bear on the provisions in the scheme before us.  It was refreshing to listen to them.</p><p> I was involved as a Senator in the previous Oireachtas in seeking to achieve a workable framework to allow adopted people to access their information.  We kept coming up against the same barrier our guests have identified as underlying this scheme, that is, the insistence that information rights would have to be balanced against the privacy rights of natural or birth parents, particularly natural or birth mothers.  There was a suggestion that the balancing could only be achieved through the introduction of a somewhat cumbersome process.  Mr. McGarr pointed out the criminal penalties at one point.  The most recent iteration of the process in this scheme is some improvement but it still starts from the place both our guests have identified, that is, that it is a balancing act.  The right to information is not seen as an unfettered right but as something that must be balanced and, in many cases, is overridden by the right to privacy, which is being used against those who are seeking this information.  The right to privacy is not something that many birth and natural mothers have necessarily asserted.  I thank our guests for their clarity.</p><p> I will ask two specific questions.  What do our guests have to say about an issue we have constantly come up against, namely, that we cannot legislate for access to information in an unfettered away, apparently according to advice from different Attorneys General because we must balance privacy rights?  What do our guests have to say on that matter?  That obstacle has been put in our way and, more importantly, in the way of adopted people for far too long.</p><p> Given the clarity of the approach our guests are suggesting, how should we, as a committee, proceed in our recommendations at this pre-legislative scrutiny stage?  Should we say that there is no requirement - in fact, it is in breach of the general data protection regulation - for us to be erecting these cumbersome bureaucratic obstacles, as I have described them?  Should we sweep that away and start with a clean slate in terms of the right to information?  I would love to hear our guests' views and I thank them again.</p></speech>

In order to answer the Deputy's first question, let us imagine there is no attempt at national legislation on this issue and the requests for access to information are addressed solely under the GDPR.  The regulation provides for the balancing of rights within its framework.  It does not require additional legislation to try to legislate for that balancing.  The balancing of rights in inherent to the GDPR.  We must recognise which rights are being looked at, which rights are being applied and who has rights.  A sequence of questions needs to be asked.  One needs to know who is alive and who is dead because there are rights under European law which accrue to people who are alive and are lost when a person dies.</p> <p>  Like Dr. Logue, I have been representing people looking for information about their early lives, as adopted people.  One of the more odd things I have encountered in the past couple of months has related to the assertion of the rights of dead people and an attempt to read the fact that people who are deceased no longer have data protection rights in such a way as to assert that records relating to dead people are exempt from GDPR, as opposed to the obvious reading, which is that dead people no longer have GDPR rights.  Of course, if the records relating to dead people also relate to people who are still living, those records are still amendable to access under the GDPR.  I am confident that the Dr. Logue will also have tales to tell on this front.  Unfortunately, we have met what sometimes appear to be misguided and occasionally perverse readings of the GDPR in our attempts to try to access information.</p> <p>  The core of my answer to the Deputy's second question is that I think we have an administrative problem.  We have all the legislation that is required but we are lacking the administrative guidance that will see the proper interpretation of the GDPR applied by multiple agencies of the State.   It appears that this is a classic case of a need for a ministerial circular.  A letter ought to be circulated with a guidance note attached which would have a general scheme that could be used by all parties for describing the application of subject access requests for all the records the different entities hold.  Attempting to be granular and saying a certain approach would apply to one kind of record while another approach would apply to a different kind of record, which is the approach in the heads of the Bill, seems to be staring in the wrong place, as Dr. Logue said.  We must find the right place to start in principle and, from that, derive a scheme of approach to subject access requests, whether from adopted people or other interested parties.  That scheme of access must then be applied across all the organisations involved.  Only a ministerial direction note will apply there but it does not require legislation or any additional laws.  It is simply a guidance note for good administration.</p></speech>

It arises from an old case, the I. O'T <i>v</i>. B case, which is being misinterpreted.  That was a different issue.  I have written a paper with Professor Maeve McDonagh, Dr. David Kenny and a few others that some of the members may be aware of.  It sets out why an individual balancing test is not required on a case-by-case basis in any access legislation.  I would refer to that.<br/><br/>In nearly every other EU jurisdiction, there is a system of open access to adoption information under exactly the same legislation, namely, the GDPR.  That included Great Britain and Northern Ireland before they left the EU.  If there is a constitutional issue, the GDPR takes primacy; it does not matter what the Constitution says.  The idea is that the Legislature will set the parameters for the balancing in the legislation.  There is wide discretion for the legislators.  The principle is that the legislators, the democratically elected people who pass legislation, are best placed to conduct that balancing test.  That does not require to be done on a case-by-case basis.  For example, as I said, we have open access to birth certificates.  I am always baffled by the argument.  Everyone knows who their mothers and fathers are, more or less.  That is true in 99.99% of cases.  We do not have privacy as between children and parents, so where does this right to privacy come from?  That is the question I would ask.  We have an open birth certificate register.  I can go in and find out the names of all the members' parents.  It is even more bizarre in the case of adoption because it is easier for people who live locally to somebody who gave up a child for adoption to find the birth certificate of the child because they will know the name and date of birth through local knowledge, whereas it is harder for the adopted person to find that information.  If a right to privacy genuinely applied to the identity of a person's birth mother, those records would be secret, through legislation.<br/><br/>We must proceed from the basis that this legislation is to give full or further effect to the GDPR rights.  We cannot start from a place that assumes this is a new right.  If we do not start from that point of departure, there will be a massive conflict between this legislation and the GDPR.</p></speech>

The Bill states that an adopted person will not be entitled to identifying information about any relative beyond the birth certificate information.  For example, head 2 defines birth relative information as only including anonymous information, and it defines care information as not including anything about the parents or guardians care of a person.  What does Mr. McGarr think of this and how compatible is it with GDPR?  Will Mr. McGarr explain the Court of Justice of the European Union definition of mixed personal data and what that means in relation to this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon McGarr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#D00800"><p>I will fail to give the Senator a proper explanation of mixed personal data, so I will hop past that piece for a moment.</p> <p>  To address the first part of the Senator's question, one cannot limit the definition of personal data more narrowly than it is defined in the GDPR.  Any attempt to do so is non-functional once it is accepted.  It is very clear that the attempt to try to simply legislate away the effect of the GDPR as it clashes with these proposed pieces of legislation in these heads of the Bill is not acceptable.  It does not meet the requirements under Article 23, even if we were to say that it met the requirements for necessity and proportionality.  Once one accepts that the definition of personal data is as defined in European Union law, which is any data relating to a person, then one can see that any attempt to try to restrict that to only certain data relating to a person, will have to be nullified.</p></speech>

Mr. McGarr has just given us an insight to what that means.  In his professional view, will Mr. McGarr explain how the Bill should be amended to comply with GDPR?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon McGarr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#D01000"><p>If it was to be amended to comply with GDPR it would adopt the phraseology of the GDPR so that we do not have a clash between the texts.  For example, instead of trying to define certain categories of data it would simply define personal data as "personal data as defined in the GDPR at Article 4.1".  By bringing in the definitions and the textual approach, it would ensure at least that one did not get a clash between definitions under the Irish law and definitions under the GDPR.  Unfortunately, primarily the main thing that could be done to bring the Bill into compliance with GDPR would be to excise significant portions of it.  Many of the heads of the Bill set out specifically to do things that are intended to be in conflict with the GDPR.  Hence, head 40 recognises that a restriction would have to be created on the GDPR if any of this is to be enforceable.</p></speech>

Is there confusion there?</p></speech>

Anybody who is a data controller, in the context of information being held and any personal data they are holding, has a duty to provide that data to the individuals if they ask them.  One cannot restrict the identities that are allowed to be asked for data and nor can one restrict who may ask for their own personal data.  Everyone covered by the GDPR have a right to make an access request to anybody, whether private or State.</p></speech>

That has been the case for the past 50 years.  This is not radical or groundbreaking jurisprudence.  It is well known that this primacy is the case.  It is also well known that all public authorities have a duty to disapply any national law that conflicts with EU law.  If the Constitution, a judgment of the Supreme Court or a public authority, including the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla, is in conflict with EU law, they must disapply that law and give effect to EU law.  This includes subject access requests.  No matter what the I. O'T <i>v</i>. B case says, or what the Senator thinks it says, the I. O'T <i>v</i>. B case does not change the GDPR.</p></speech>

Given their expertise and advocacy in this area, the committee would be obliged to include these issues in our report.  I will be pushing strongly for that.  Let us assume, however, that the Minister does not accept the issues we have raised, which is a very real concern of mine, and that the Bill passes with sections contrary to GDPR.  What would happen then?  Would the people concerned be in a worse position in some instances with new restrictions being brought in?  Will individuals be forced to go to court again to access basic information about themselves, as with the case referred to in the response to Senator Ruane?  This question is for both of the witnesses or either.</p></speech>

That is the first step.  If the public authority does not recognise that, then it is liable for two things.  It is liable to being sued by the individual to get access to his or her rights and is liable to being found in breach of the GDPR by the Data Protection Commission and could be fined up to &euro;1 million per instance.  Those are the two administrative responses to a failure by the institutions of the State to follow European Union law.</p> <p>  If the State is in breach of European Union law and refuses to take action, it is also open to citizens to make a complaint to the European Commission about the failure to comply with European Union law.  It is open to the Commission to take a case against Ireland and eventually, as we have seen with our environmental issues, the State could end up with fines accruing unless and until such time as Ireland brings itself back into line with EU law.</p></speech>

It is a public body but it is completely independent of the State.  Its job is to supervise how the State implements the GDPR.  This includes disputes where it is disputed that the legislation is actually valid regarding the GDPR.  Similar to the Workplace Relations Commission, the Data Protection Commission has the power to disapply conflicting national law.  I have already expressed concerns to another committee about the lawfulness and constitutionality of the procedures.  There is no sworn evidence and no hearing.  They tend to get bogged down and in many cases, the Data Protection Commission ends up being a middleman between the opposing sides exchanging points of view and finally deciding to go with one or the other.  It does not have that characteristic we have for dispute resolution involving a hearing or even exchange of legal submissions.  Characteristically, the procedure is very slow.  It takes a very long time.  It is measured in years whereas it is actually quicker to go to court to litigate because one can move things along.  Pre-Covid, one could get a Circuit Court hearing in six months whereas I have cases involving the Data Protection Commission that are over three years old.  One is not getting that effective remedy.  As the Deputy alluded to, part of the solution lies in making this more efficient.  It will make decisions that will be challenged in court.  That is part of the legal process.  It is through those challenges that the law gets clarified or the legislation is struck down but one needs the feed - the pipeline of Data Protection Commission decisions - so that one can get to court to get that clarity.  Everything is stuck at the Data Protection Commission level and is not getting through so that the law can be clarified.  That is a major issue but it is outside the scope of the legislation.</p></speech>

There was a decision that the scheme of the public services cards was not compliant with the Data Protection Acts and the GDPR and it was challenged by the Department of Social Protection.  That challenge has not yet been heard.  We are 18 months on from the decision and are not yet at a hearing stage.  Motion after motion has been sought, primarily with the effect - I will not say with the intention - of providing for further and further delay before the matter can be reached at hearing.  We have a systemic problem if after an extended period of time of investigation, eventually the Data Protection Commission is in a position to make a decision and makes that decision but we are still looking at years.</p> <p>  This problem does not belong to the Data Protection Commission.  This problem belongs to the State.  It is the duty of the State to ensure there is an effective remedy for breaches of data protection legislation.  A failure to provide for an effective remedy is itself a breach of EU law and can be the basis of complaints to the European Commission and so on.  As matters stand, if everyone recognises there is a problem and we are looking for a solution, we should also recognise that the fact that there is acknowledged problem is in itself a breach of people's GDPR rights.</p></speech>

As was said earlier, we as legislators have a responsibility to ensure the legislation recognises those rights.  We need to acknowledge - it would be good to reflect this in our report - the difficulties with the body that is also tasked with protecting these rights.  It is not just about the legislation; it is also about all the other stuff.  Yes, we need to get this right, and it would seem from what has been said so far that we are not quite at that point yet, but we also need to get the other protections for people's rights right.  It is important that we reflect that.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting session.  My questions are for both witnesses as their statements were very similar.  Are there any jurisdictions in the EU where the release of mixed personal data to adopted people is done without a domestic legislative framework and sets out the appropriate balance of GDPR rights?</p><p>Is it the case that under the GDPR, the Article 16 right of a parent to object to data being processed would not have any impact on adopted people accessing their full information because of this legislation or would it possible without the appropriate balancing of rights set out in this legislation for a parent to prevent that information from being released to an adopted person?  That is if there is an objection under Article 16.<br/><br/>Is it also the case that if we get rid of the balancing requirements set out in these heads, each time a request for birth or early life information is made by a data processor, that data processor would have to make its own determination on the balance of rights in accordance with GDPR?  There would be a possibility that some or all information would be withheld from the requester.<br/><br/>Is there an example in Ireland that has come before the courts where the GDPR legislation has been tested for birth information?  Within the argument here, the witnesses have an opinion on the seminal I. O'T <i>v</i>. B case.  The judgment was that neither rights to privacy nor information were absolute and it is weighted to the common good.  That is current case law but has there been any updated case law?  Is it not right that this legislation would be the framework for a GDPR process whereby people's personal data could be accessed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon McGarr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#F00200"><p>I will answer the general question asked at the end of the Senator's contribution, which is whether this provides a framework for accessing information within GDPR.  It does not and instead it restricts it and limits it in ways that are not compatible with EU law.  In doing so, it is itself not compatible with EU law.  That is the kind of general position.</p> <p>  On the question of mixed personal data, there are two kinds of ways of looking at this.  Frequently we see people referring to information about one person or another.  It is referred to as a document with mixed personal data or mixed information relating to two different people.  That is if the information only relates to each of them.  There may be circumstances where the information relates to them both.  The most famous example is that there cannot be information telling me who is my mother without it also being her information.  It is both of our personal data and we both have it.  It is not two different people with different rights on one document.  One would redact the information not related to the person to whom it was being given; in this case it is related to the person to whom it is being given.  It is not the concept of two different people's data on one document and how we can relate to that but rather information that is the personal data of both persons.  It is the combination of the information that is critical because it overlaps.</p> <p>  The question was whether there should be a veto with such cases over the release of information by people if the information relates to them.  The answer is "No" and no party has a veto.  There is no absolute right to refuse information to be released.  Again, this comes down to an administrative response and giving guidance.  This can happen, as Dr. Logue suggested, by way of activity by the Legislature - the Oireachtas - or, as I have suggested, via an administrative response guided by the principles of the GDPR to allow for a common framework for the application of the GDPR.  A decision tree might be presented, for example, and I know the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has engaged experts for this purpose and to give it advice on the GDPR and its application in respect of the mother and baby homes documentation.</p> <p>  These are not problems that are impossible to solve but they would be impossible to solve if we did not correctly recognise and determine what must be done.  Unfortunately, with the proposed heads of Bill, the approach is not only not helpful to that outcome, but it will actively run contrary to what is legal.</p></speech>

O'T <i>v</i>. B case.  The Department's legal advice should be published so we can see what it is.  That is instead of using the I. O'T <i>v</i>. B case as the magic words and that being the end of it.  We should understand that I. O'T <i>v</i>. B is first about constitutional rights and not EU law rights.  The context in which it took place was one in which there was not a framework and the only way to do it was an individual balancing test.  That does not mean it must be an individual balancing test.  I refer again to the paper with Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Dr. David Kenny, who is from Trinity College Dublin.  I am firmly of the view the Legislature can strike the balance in the legislation without it having to be a case-by-case balancing test.<br/><br/>I am not sure about other jurisdictions but most of them had given this right even before data protection rights came along.  They would have pre-existing legislation anyway, particularly in the UK.  That deals with the questions asked but this boils down to us seeing the advice on I. O'T <i>v</i>. B so we can have a look at it.  It is very hard to answer that question without seeing what advice has been given to the Department.  Based on past experience, the advice could be quite conservative or overly conservative.  It would be good to have a debate about that.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that European law trumps the Constitution. If we do not have the framework from this legislation providing for clear detailing of what people can and would get access to, would it be better to scrap the legislation, as mentioned, so we could move to GDPR and let Europe judge all these cases?  If a mother was raped as a child and does not want to be contacted or traumatised by past events, is she able to use that article of GDPR relating to the common good, and say she does not want the information out there?  This legislation would ensure a birth certificate would be provided if it works within GDPR.</p> <p>  If we scrap this legislation and work off GDPR, as it would be adequate, why is there not case law relating to GDPR just yet?  We have spent much time working and challenging ourselves with a really important piece of legislation.  It is a pity this has not been tested in the courts.  If we leave it to GDPR, would Article 12 allow access to information an a case-by-case basis to be challenged?  The legislation indicates it cannot.</p></speech>

That is not a veto on data processing and it only applies in limited circumstances.  In particular, if there is a legal obligation to process the information, there is no right to object.  There is a kind of misconception that a person can object to or prevent data from being processed but that is not correct.</p><p>If the legislation says it can be given out, it can be given out.  For example, as I have said many times now, I could get the Senator's birth certificate tomorrow and there is nothing she could do about it.  That will tell me the name of her mother and possibly her father, their occupations, her date of birth and things like that.  This idea that we have this kind of privacy or that parents can hide their identities from their children is, therefore, quite alien to our system.</p><p> The second thing is that contact is being mixed up with access to information.  I have no idea where that is coming from.  Adopted people want their information.  Nobody is saying that, in all cases, they want this information to trace their parents.  If the issue is contact or tracing, and a risk of this can be identified and demonstrated through objective studies, we can guard against this in a way that does not restrict people's data protection rights.  It can be done in another way.  There are lots of cases where there are issues between parents and children in which the parents may not want the children to be able to contact them.  An example would be an abusive parent outside of an adoption context.  However, in those circumstances, we do not say such children cannot know who their parents are.  There are other laws out there to protect people from unwanted contact from other people.  It does not have to be a secrecy law; it can be something else.  You have to think about what the risk is and what the most proportionate way to protect against it is.</p></speech>

I am just talking about slowing up the process.  We are all on the same page here.  We want to give access to birth information to everybody.  That is why we are pushing this legislation.  It is not about a veto.  I am just afraid that what Mr. Logue is suggesting could actually hold up the process.</p></speech>

I am in my office.  I thank the two witnesses for the brevity and clarity of their responses.  I have a few questions.  I have to admit that, as a layman, I did not realise the enormity of the powers of the GDPR.  It makes me wonder whether the GDPR legislation obviates the need for any legislation by this Parliament at all.  On that question, are the general views the two witnesses have offered the received and accepted views of their peers in law or do they hold these views because they represent people who are seeking data and information and are therefore more aware of these issues?  Are the witnesses' views in line with the general thinking on the issue?</p></speech>

It is generally accepted that European law is superior to all national legal provisions in the areas where European law applies, such as the area of data protection.  It is fair to say that we are presenting the committee with the mainstream opinion.</p></speech>

Do they believe this legislation is totally superfluous?  Is it of any value?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#G01000"><p>I believe there needs to be legislation to give greater effect or more detailed effect to the pre-existing right.  If there have to be restrictions for either the adopted people or the parents, they should be laid out in legislation and done correctly.  At the moment, the GDPR is being misinterpreted in a way that involves reading into it a balancing test that is not really there.  Even if it was there, it can only be there if given effect through legislation.  This is resulting in chaos.  I have sympathy for the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla.  They have inherited a bunch of files from a whole load of religious orders and other institutions that they really do not know anything about.  They do not know anything about the people and are presented with a dilemma as to what to do.  There is no guidance in legislation.  They therefore take the most conservative approach, which is to give out as little as possible.  I can understand that.  Contrary to the impression I may have given, I believe it is essential that there be clarifying legislation.  It should start from the pre-existing right of access and work back from that point rather than assuming there is no right of access and then creating one.  That is the key takeaway from my presentation.</p></speech>

I have a few other brief questions.  I am a bit puzzled.  Heads 38 and 39 deal with restrictions on the right to compensation.  In his document, Dr. Logue says that this is "fundamentally incompatible with GDPR".  I cannot understand why GDPR should apply in respect of restrictions on rights to compensation.  Surely someone has to cap people's rights to compensation.  After all, we have a budget to live with.</p></speech>

Again, GDPR is primary EU legislation and gives people a right to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages.  That relates to the traditional damages for negligence but also damages for distress.  The right to compensation is not limited to damage caused through actions in bad faith.  That is not in the GDPR.  We cannot pass a law that narrows GDPR.  That would actually create a risk that compensation will have to be paid rather than narrowing the risk.  I do a lot of litigation against public bodies and the way to prevent litigation and damages is to make good administrative decisions.  That is the sure-fire way to protect budgets.</p></speech>

There is a general right of access which can only be restricted by legislation that complies with Article 23.  It is up to the legislature to define how that works.  It is not appropriate for individual data controllers to have to do that balancing test.  That is not actually in the GDPR.  The idea of mixed personal data is also not in the GDPR.  The European Court of Justice has clarified that people have the same right of access to non-mixed personal data as to mixed personal data.  By mixed, I mean personal data that is yours and somebody else's at the same time.  There is no real distinction between those in the GDPR.  It has been made up to try to limit the right of access.</p><p>It is just wrong.  I cannot put it more bluntly.</p></speech>

There is confusion here.  Legal right of access already exists yet there are huge barriers to accessing this information.  Will this legislation create further barriers to information?  What specific rights may be restricted?  Having listened to Senator Seery Kearney, I am now more confused.  We all work with the GDPR every day.  If someone comes into our office and we are trying to find something, we must go through the proper channels and get paperwork signed and so on, which is fine.  We must get this right because access and how we get access for the families who want it is going to be important.  From listening to this discussion, I believe changes are needed in order that families who want access can get it and do not face barriers.  There always seems to be some sort of a barrier.  This question may have been asked but do the witnesses believe this legislation would create further restrictions?  What do we need to do to make this right?</p></speech>

Again, the starting point is that people have a right of access to their file.  If there are to be restrictions, they must meet a general interest objective, as set out in Article 23, and they must be necessary and proportionate.  That means there must be an objective link between the restriction and the objective and it cannot be more than is actually necessary to achieve that objective.  Information and studies are needed on what is the actual harm in giving adopted people access to their files.  We cannot have the anecdotalism - people saying they know somebody - that seems to have polluted the discourse for the past ten years.  Somebody needs to find out what the actual problem is.  I say that because we have open access almost everywhere else in Europe and there is not chaos over there.  Adopted people are not turning up and murdering, attacking or harassing their parents.  We need to know why we in Ireland are so special we cannot let adopted people find out the names of their birth mothers or give them their birth certificates.  What is so bad in Ireland that we need to have this swingeing restriction on people's fundamental rights?  That question has never been answered and if it cannot be answered, then adopted people should get all their information - end of.</p></speech>

Families and individuals who have been trying to access their information have come up against barriers.  We must ensure this is right.  We all want to do it right but timing is of the utmost importance here and is a priority for me.  If there are issues with this legislation, they need to be addressed.  Now is the time to ensure we have proper legislation.  People might not want to access their information but people who do want their information should be able to access it without facing barrier after barrier.</p></speech>

The only barrier I ever hear is I. O'T. <i>v</i>. B., which is a legal barrier.  Under the GDPR, the barrier to exercising one's rights must be a practical one, as in something bad will happen to somebody else if a person exercises his or her rights.  People cannot just throw out the argument that I. O'T. <i>v</i>. B. is the reason.  There is not actually a legal barrier.  If nobody can come up with a practical barrier, we should pass legislation that provides that everybody can have access to his or her own file.  It could be on one page and that would be the end of it.</p></speech>

We live in a very slow moving world but there is room for interim activity to ensure those barriers people are meeting right now are addressed without the need for legislation.  As I said, this is an administrative, not a legislative, problem.  There is no legislative gap we currently need to fill to allow people to get access to their information.  Rather there is a problem at the administrative level in giving effect to the legislation that is already in place.  Passing more legislation does not address the problem, which is to get the administration correct.  </p></speech>

It is not the basis of what this legislation is about.  It is about a balancing of rights and trying to look after the mothers this State abused for decades.  It is also about giving effect to legislation to make sure the children this State ignored for decades get access to their records.

People are listening to these sessions of the committee who have lived their lives very vulnerably and very hurt.  To trivialise or in any way be disrespectful and use terminology such that they might show up to murder their parents is unacceptable.  There are people who gave birth who were minors and if they were members of particular communities, it was later important they were virgins when they got married.  I have received a plethora of texts from people who are deeply offended by the terminology that was used.  We can make a legal point.  My personal standing on GDPR is that it overturned the IO'T ruling absolutely and unequivocally.  However, it is not reasonable for any witness who comes before this committee to use trivial terminology or throw-away remarks with regard to something that is people&rsquo;s lived experience and very serious.</p></speech>

Once again I note that the purpose of this meeting is to engage with witnesses on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the birth information and tracing Bill 2021 and on any GDPR concerns with the provisions of the Bill.  I acknowledge that this is the witnesses' second appearance before the committee as during their last appearance before the committee on 13 July, members were advised that the Data Protection Commission had recently received the data protection impact assessment, DPIA, from the Department and it was therefore suggested at the last meeting that the committee engage with the commission once again following detailed consideration of the impact assessment.</p> <p>  Before I call Mr. Sunderland to give his opening statement I need to advise witnesses on the issue of parliamentary privilege.  As all the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If they are therefore directed by me to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Witnesses will be allocated five minutes of speaking time and unfortunately, we need to stick strictly to this limit due to time constraints.  We will then have question-and-answer sessions with each joint committee member.  I invite Mr. Sunderland to deliver his opening statement and thank him again for his attendance today. </p></speech>

I acknowledge the important and sensitive public policy issues at play here and I am happy to contribute to these deliberations.</p> <p>  Since our last appearance before the joint committee in July, we have continued to engage with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the matters raised in our preliminary observations on the general scheme of the Bill, which we presented to the committee in July and discussed at that time.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has noted, we were able to inform members at the July meeting that we had been provided by the Department with a copy of a data protection impact assessment as part of the statutory consultation process under Article 36 of the GDPR.  We have subsequently been in a position to consider the DPIA in full and to provide some observations to the Department.  Our overall general comment and view is that the DPIA represents a considered approach to identifying and mitigating any risks to the personal data of individuals arising from the operation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, both in terms of those making requests under the Bill and receiving data and those other persons and third parties to whom these data might relate. </p> <p>  In broad terms, the DPIA sets out the scope of personal data processing required by the legislation and describes the processing operations and any proposed data sharing.  It also contains an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of data processing in the context of the Bill and identifies risks and evaluates possible solutions and mitigations for those risks.  We are informed by the Department that the DPIA remains under review, which is good practice, as the drafting of the Bill progresses and as ongoing stakeholder engagement takes place regarding the operational aspects of the proposed legislation.</p> <p>  In our previous submissions to the joint committee, we also highlighted the importance of clear guidelines detailing how the legislation is intended to operate in practice for the purpose of providing clarity and certainty to the various bodies such as the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Tusla and various other stipulated organisations that will act as data controllers for the purposes of the legislation.  The DPC understands that the Department has commenced a stakeholder consultation on the development of those guidelines and we in the DPC remain available, through our supervision and consultation functions, to input guidance during that process, if requested to do so.</p> <p>  At our previous attendance before the joint committee, we also discussed a concern regarding the disclosure of medical information of birth relatives on the basis of an assumption that the data had been anonymised.  I can inform the committee that the Department has taken on board our concerns and it is now accepted that this information should not be considered as being anonymous when processed by any of the various data controllers.  It should be treated as special category personal data, that is, data concerning health at all stages of processing up until disclosure to the relevant person.  This is an important clarification, as it will facilitate an approach that will provide medically or genetically relevant information to adopted persons in a manner where suitable safeguards apply and it is in the interests of all parties concerned that the data would be treated as personal data and subject to the full protections of the GDPR.</p> <p>  On a related note, at the July meeting of the joint committee a reference was made to the Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations 1989 in terms of the release of medical information.  We are aware that a process to replace these regulations has been commenced by the Department of Health under section 60(5)(a) of the Data Protection Act 2018 and we have been formally engaged in consultation as part of that process, which is at its early stages at this point.  We welcome this development and recommend that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth should take account of the development of these replacement regulations in any further reworking of the provisions of this Bill regarding the release of medical information.  In other words, those sections of the Bill that refer to the release of medical information should evolve as the Department of Health updates that 1989 statutory instrument to modern-day requirements and to a more suitable set of regulations to meet the context for which they are necessary today, as opposed to perhaps in 1989.</p> <p>  One of the principal areas of concern raised by the DPC in our preliminary observations on the general scheme of the Bill was the broad approach adopted in head 40 to the restriction of data subject rights.  I can inform the joint committee that the Department has accepted the DPC&rsquo;s concerns and has committed to conducting an in-depth analysis of the circumstances in which specific rights may be restricted, including the necessity and proportionality of such restrictions, which will underpin the ongoing development of the legislation.  We welcome this approach, which aligns with our published guidance note, Limiting Data Subject Rights and the Application of Article 23 of the GDPR, which also aligns with the recently published guidelines of the European Data Protection Board.</p> <p>I hope that these comments will be of assistance to the joint committee and I am very happy to answer the questions members may have and I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I hope the committee can hear me, as there is some background noise with bells ringing in Leinster House.</p> <p>  I refer back to the earlier session we had with Dr. Fred Logue and Mr. Simon McGarr to ask whether the witnesses had the opportunity to hear their testimony and the discussion we had.  They put forward a clear and succinct account informing us that the fundamental right to information already exists under the GDPR provisions and that whatever legislative framework we introduce should not restrict those rights in any way that is in conflict with those rights.  I am conscious that I was not a member of this committee when Mr. Sutherland and the Data Protection Commission gave evidence earlier but I was involved in a previous iteration of this legislation and I put it to the previous witnesses that we were always up against an obstacle where we were told that the Attorney General's advice required restrictions being placed on the right of adopted persons to access their birth information.  Many of us contested that interpretation by the Attorney General and indeed Fred Logue, Conor O'Mahony and a number of other lawyers drafted an opinion that was widely publicised two years ago saying exactly what Simon McGarr and Fred Logue have told this committee today, which is that GDPR provides a right of access and that our legislation should recognise adopted persons' right to information and should facilitate access to that birth information.</p><p> What is the DPC's position on that perspective, which is, as I said, a widely shared legal perspective but one which, unfortunately, has never, it seems, been shared by successive Attorneys General and is at odds with what we have been told by successive Ministers on foot of legal advice they received?  They keep referring us to a constitutional right to privacy that they say, in accordance with the I.O'T. case, supersedes or restricts the right of access to information.  I lay that out because it seems to me that Fred Logue's and Simon McGarr's approach, which is widely shared by legal experts I have consulted and accords with my legal view, has never been recognised sufficiently by the drafters on the Government side.  We need to reconcile that and to ensure that our legislation recognises the right of adopted persons to information and that we give effect to GDPR rights.  I am just frustrated that we have never been able to get the same clarity on that as we heard in the earlier session.  I would love to hear the witnesses' views.  I am sorry for the lengthy question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#L00200"><p>There are a number of issues there.  We acknowledge that this issue is complex and long-running and that there are issues above and beyond data protection and the understanding of it.  Having listened to what various speakers said, including even before this meeting, I believe the long-running issue has been these competing rights.  The I.O'T. case was referred to.  We are not constitutional experts either, but our understanding is that each of those rights, including the right to know about your origins <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the right to privacy, might be constrained by the weight of the other as well as by the common good.  This is the complex situation we are in.  It is perhaps somewhat beyond the role of the commission to comment on those constitutional matters in respect of the balancing of rights.<br/><br/>What I can comment on is the question of the right of access, on which the GDPR and the Constitution are <i>ad idem</i>, in our view.  The right of access is the objective.  Then it is a matter of making sure it is not overly prejudicial to the rights and freedoms of others.  I heard some of the previous contributions and there was a discussion about issues of the balancing of rights and its place within the GDPR.<br/><br/>That brings me to Article 15 of the GDPR, which we discussed at the committee's previous meeting, and specifically Article 15.4, which states that the right of access is not absolute and that the right to obtain a copy of personal data &quot;shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others&quot;.  Inherent in Article 15, therefore, specifically Article 15.4, is a balancing test that has to be carried out.  It is quite clear that Article 15, relating to the right of access, provides for a really important and fundamental right.  It is one of the core rights under the GDPR.  The DPC is very active in vindicating that right, but it is not an absolute right.  The GDPR recognises that.  There may be occasions when that right has to cede because of the impact on another person.  The text is specific that the right of access or the right to obtain a copy of personal data &quot;shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others&quot;.<br/><br/>At the last meeting I suggested that our understanding was that the proposed Bill is seeking to acknowledge the right of access and that the view of Minister and the Department was that the right of access was to be given while ensuring that a framework was put in place to allow that to be done in a coherent and clear way whereby there would be a common approach across all the relevant bodies, perhaps as opposed to individual data controllers seeking to attempt this right of balance or to ensure that these rights were given proper effect.  I suggested that certain safeguards in the proposed Bill could be an effective measure to support the balancing that needs to happen under Article 15.4.  It appeared to us that, in the general scheme, issues such as the information session and other such proposed measures were the Department's means by which to ensure that the right of access can be fully respected and can mitigate any adverse impact on the rights of others - for example, the rights of the birth parent, in this case the birth mother.  That is not to say the DPC is saying that the general scheme of the Bill and how it is proposed provides all the appropriate solutions, but the intention is that the provision of a suite of safeguards allows for that assessment under Article 15.  The proposed Bill codifies that in legislation in outlining how that Article 15.4 requirement can be met and respected.  That is the DPC's view.<br/><br/>We believe there are complex issues at play here.  The right of access is paramount but needs to be seen in the context of the GDPR and the requirement to ensure that the right of access does not adversely impact the rights and freedoms of others.  Of course, one of those rights and freedoms is the right of privacy, and there are also all the rights that come into play under the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The Deputy may wish to drill down a little further on aspects of my response, and I can reply further, but I will stop at that for now.</p></speech>

I have just two questions.  In his submission, Mr. Sunderland mentions that developments have been made on the release of medical information.  Will the witnesses speak to that progress?  We heard in earlier submissions about the restrictions surrounding access to medical information and how they gravely contravene the GDPR.  Will Mr. Sunderland comment on the developments in that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#L00500"><p>The primary place of action in that respect is the updating of the 1989 statutory instrument, which required that health data be provided to an individual's medical practitioner.  This has given rise to complications, of course, in the context of access to records held by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We understand - we consulted on this at a very early stage - that good progress is being made on the updating of that statutory instrument and that this would involve a broad range of stakeholder engagement.  I cannot really speak to that any further than that today, given that it is the Department of Health's responsibility and it is for that Department to propose what the updated legislative solution is to be.  Certainly, however, it is acknowledged that there were complications arising from that 1989 statutory instrument, which inhibited the right of access, and that it needed to be updated.  The Data Protection Act foresaw that in that section 60 provided that the 1989 statutory instrument would continue in force until such time as it was updated by the relevant Minister.  We welcome that this work has started.  Our key point, for the purposes of the draft Bill before the committee, is that we see that the Department should take into account any changes being made under that statutory instrument and make any according changes to the provisions of the proposed Bill in order that there be a synergy between the updated law in respect of that statutory instrument and what is ultimately provided for in this Bill.</p></speech>

I am thinking about Aitheantas, which presented its Adoptee Voices report and survey to an earlier committee.  Its report outlined the roles State agencies play in the gatekeeping of access to personal data.  Could the witnesses comment on what type of regulation and oversight there is over State agencies that are responsible for information and tracing, such as the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla?</p></speech>

Of course, each one that holds data in its own right is a data controller and is and will continue to be subject to all the requirements of the GDPR.</p><p>One can see the Bill as a means to provide a core framework for how it is proposed to deal with issues in this space, but they will still retain and have obligations as data controllers.  This Bill in no way diminishes those, unless there is to be restrictions imposed on the rights of data subjects, which will have to be explicitly stated and legislated for in the Bill.  That is one of the issues I have already addressed.  The guidance under the Bill that is to be prepared and published should ensure all of the bodies are identified as data controllers.  It is an opportunity to call out, again, the explicit obligations they have to ensure they carry out their role in accordance with the legislation and they meet their obligations as custodians and data controllers for the personal data of the persons concerned.  I hope that has answered the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I was curious as to what oversight can or does exist to ensure legislation is adhered to, without it being the responsibility of the person trying to request information to shed a light on whether he or she is not getting the adequate information under the law, or whether there would be general oversight on whether people were adhering to the legislation.</p></speech>

There are means by which, for example in a data protection context, a statutory code of conduct can be developed to further define the data protection responsibilities for the handling of personal data.  There are tools in the GDPR that may support that overall effort.  Of course, it is not the role of the individuals the Senator mentioned to oversee the operation of data controllers in respect of their responsibility and adherence, but there is the right of an individual to make a complaint to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, which will be fully dealt with and an outcome reached in respect of that complaint.  That is an option, as is recourse to the courts.</p></speech>

We have heard from previous witnesses, including earlier today, that the Bill in its current form is contrary to GDPR according to some experts; the mandatory information session constitutes a restriction on the right of access and is incompatible with the GDPR.  Can Mr. Sunderland provide his perspective on this key issue?  Head 40 sets out to restrict rights and obligations under the GDPR.  Is Mr. Sunderland confident such a blanket exclusion is compliant with Article 23 of the GDPR?  We have also heard how head 2 of the Bill has a list of excluded information, including care provided by a parent or guardian, or the adoptive parent of a child, and that the only information permitted on relatives is whether one has a relative, the sex of the relative and whether the relative is older or younger.  From a GDPR perspective, what are Mr. Sunderland's views on those points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#M00500"><p>Head 40 is one of the points I tried to cover in my opening statement in that the Department has accepted the concerns raised by the DPC that the proposed head was inadequate on any restrictions that might be imposed.  In the context of Article 23 of the GDPR, we said in July, what was proposed did not meet that standard.  The Department has acknowledged that and is now working to remedy that problem.  It would conduct a deep analysis as to the GDPR rights it proposes to restrict, why that is necessary, how it is proportional and necessary to do so and to do so in a way that meets the requirements of Article 23.  It will revert to us on that.</p> <p>  I also envisage that such restrictions continue to be a feature of the Bill, that it will be a very different head by the time the Bill is formally published.  That is positive and we welcome the Department's hearing our views on that.  The right of access is not an absolute in respect of information sessions and I have referenced Article 15(4) of the GDPR in that the right of access cannot adversely impact the rights and freedoms of others.  That is where we understood the concept of an information session.  The DPC is not casting judgment one way or another whether an information session is the appropriate solution, but it was the mechanism by which we understand the Minister and the Department are trying to ensure the rights of others are not adversely affected in order that the right of access does not need to be restricted.  Ultimately, it was intended to facilitate the full right of access in order that this balancing of rights could happen in an appropriate way under Article 15.  That is our understanding and I am not passing judgment on the policy choices within that, but from the GDPR perspective, that is the intention of providing for that framework.</p> <p>  There is not much more I can say on that matter, unless the Deputy wishes to put a further specific question to me.  The Deputy had a third part to her question, which I have forgotten.  I would be grateful if she could remind me.</p></speech>

I would be interested to know if that is a common practice.  Head 2 of the Bill has a list of excluded information, including care provided by a parent, guardian or an adoptive parent of a child.  The only information permitted regarding relatives is whether one has a relative, the relative's gender and whether that relative is younger or older.  What are Mr. Sunderland's views on that from a GDPR perspective?</p></speech>

I am not passing judgment one way or another.  It is simply from the perspective of trying to ensure the right of access is fully respected, in that the rights of other individuals are not adversely affected and then a controller, or in this case, the Department and the Minister are proposing there should be safeguards in place.  One of the safeguards identified is an information session.  It is not to say some other safeguard would not provide an equally appropriate means by which to ensure Article 15(4) is respected.</p> <p>  With regard to the point under head 2 and the exclusion of certain categories of data, if that is to be seen as a restriction of a data subject's rights, and acknowledging the GDPR provides for the restriction of rights, it has to be justified as such.  I would like to reflect on it again, hearing some of the comments earlier, but in principle, the balancing of what the Department is trying to achieve here is feasible once the requirements of Article 23 are adhered to.  If something is not explicitly restricted in the Act or the proposed Bill, the GDPR still provides and the rights still stand.  If there are elements of data, other rights or other areas of activity by each of those controllers which have not been explicitly restricted in the Bill and there is no other explicit legislative restriction in either primary or secondary legislation, the GDPR still applies in full to those other areas.</p><p>A concern was raised that if there is a restriction in the Bill or if something is captured in the Bill, that would mean controllers are free of other rights.  That is not the case, if it is not explicitly provided for.</p></speech>

Part of the question under head 2 is whether the data is personal data, and that is part of the consideration here.  Some information about family members may not necessarily be what is termed "mixed data" and a relevant body may hold information about family members that is not personal data of the adopted person.  That is a consideration in play in head 2 which gives some rationale for the exclusion of some data.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear the Data Protection Commission has been working with the Department and there has been very positive feedback from the Data Protection Commission, which is welcome.</p> <p>  I do not have many questions.  We heard from previous speakers that this legislation is unnecessary.  Do the witnesses think the legislation is unnecessary or is it a useful framework to ensure individuals get that access to information?  If we did not pass this framework, is there a situation within GDPR legislation that could work to hinder, extend or restrict that access to information?  I have a further question.  We heard in previous contributions that this legislation is contrary to and restricts GDPR and is anti-EU law.  In the opinion of the witnesses, is that the case or is it actually complementary legislation that works within GDPR?</p></speech>

As Mr. Sunderland said, it is not the necessarily the role of the Data Protection Commission to make that decision as to the necessity of legislation on the basis of constitutionality.  What we have been looking at is whether the heads of the Bill, and the Bill as may be enacted, will conflict with or restrict the rights afforded by GDPR.  Essentially, to answer the question, in our view, the role of this legislation is to give full effect to the rights that have been determined to exist for adopted persons.  It is for us to ensure, in our guidance to the Department under the consultation process under Article 36 of the GDPR, that we do not find anything in the provisions that conflicts with those rights or restricts them in an inappropriate, unnecessary or disproportionate manner.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Murphy for jumping in there.  I want to concur with what he said.  What we have seen in practice, as the previous session highlighted, is lots of complexity and uncertainty in regard to how data requests and the right of access were to be dealt with in this challenging and complex area.  Therefore, we see the Bill as providing some of that clarity and certainty, as long as it is done in a way that respects the primacy of EU law and adheres to EU law, in particular in regard to the restriction of any rights.</p> <p>  The Senator asked what may happen absent this legislation.  What will happen is what will continue to be the case, that is, each controller will be responsible for assessing access requests under Article 15 and they will each have to turn to Article 15(4) and ensure the rights of others are not adversely affected.  Therefore, there is in theory and in practice, as we have seen already, some scope for divergence in terms of how requests are being handled.  The Bill clarifies a lot of issues.  It provides in favour of access but with safeguards, and that is the key point that appears to us from our look at the proposed heads.</p></speech>

Access for all is the main concern in regard to this Bill and whether people who want to access information can do so.  Mr. Sunderland referred to restrictive access.  When we talk about access and restrictions, it is important that we know what they will be.  While we are all delighted to see legislation coming, we have to make sure this legislation is proper and that people who want to access the proper information can get it.  The witnesses know that we sometimes pass something but, then, when someone makes an inquiry, there is a barrier, for example, with regard to GDPR.  I am always careful about GDPR when I am looking for information for people or trying to access something in my different roles.  Will there be any restrictions and can the witnesses commit that there will not be?  Do they see any issues arising that may be of concern?</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  I know they have all had incredible engagement with the different Departments, as has been said and I will not repeat that.  However, due to the concerns raised at the other meeting, I feel that to have this legislation done properly and to ensure we get it done 100% right is very important.  As I said at the other meeting, timing is another issue that we need to address as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

First, the intention, as we understand it, is that the full right of access would be respected.  Any of those other matters which we have discussed already, such as the information session, are for the purpose of trying to provide safeguards in ensuring this balancing of rights takes place in a way that allows for the fullest of access to the personal data concerned.  We obviously have yet to see in greater detail what the Department proposes as a further development of head 40 and the restriction of rights.  Our understanding at this stage is that, with regard to those further restrictions of data subject rights, it is not intended to restrict the right of access but rather to maybe restrict the rights of others to ensure that the right of access can proceed and is fully facilitated.  As I said, we need to see further details from the Department in that respect.  As it stands, head 40 is intended to facilitate the right of access to the information encompassed by the Bill rather than to restrict it further.</p></speech>

They are very good to do so.  On a quick &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; question, is this legislation necessary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#N01400"><p>I think that on balance, from where we stand, and obviously we are not really central to this, it is necessary for the reasons I have already outlined, in that there are huge complexities around this balancing of rights.  From our perspective and from a data protection perspective, there is a lot of uncertainty and lack of clarity around what the right of access means in this specific context.</p><p>There is a choice when the Government proposes legislation and the Legislature ultimately enacts it.  There is a choice not to have a Bill, of course, but from our perspective, it does provide further clarity and certainty around how personal data in the scenario which is the subject of the Bill is to be dealt with.  It can be done in a way that is aligned with EU law and that ensures any restrictions meet the requirements of EU law in Article 23.  It can also be done in a way that addresses the bigger context of the long-challenging issues around the constitutional requirements and judgments of the Supreme Court.  The Bill tries to grapple with a very complex matter.  The DPC is not saying that all of the policy choices and safeguards in the Bill are the right ones, but we acknowledge that they are seeking to address a complex issue, namely, the facilitation of the right of access to the fullest extent possible while taking account of the other issues that need to be taken into account<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Article 15.4 in particular, which I have referenced already.</p></speech>

That is everyone's objective but in that there is obviously the person who gave birth and the person who has an entitlement to information.  When we look at the other rights under the GDPR, not the subject access right but the right of restriction, can the birth mother restrict the right of access in the absence of this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#O00300"><p>There is a right to object to processing.  In the absence of legislation, the balancing test under Article 15.4 would still have to be carried out but it would be done absent of any legislative framework or any reference to such a framework.  Each controller would have to do it individually, which may give rise to nuances and inconsistencies in terms of how each controller sees their obligations and their understanding of the rights of the various parties.  It is also the case that any restriction of rights by a data controller needs to be set down in law so any potential restriction of the right to processing on behalf of a data subject that the controller wishes to implement would have to be done through some other legislative means.  It is complex and is not completely clear cut because many aspects of the GDPR come into play, depending on the lawful basis that is being relied on for the processing.  Processing in the public interest is probably the context here.  Setting it out in law sets out the public interest to be achieved by the restriction.  Generally, it is always more advantageous that all of the issues are set out in primary legislation under one Bill rather than having disparate pieces.  Obviously, however, Article 15 stands on its own and will continue to stand.  Any restrictions that the Bill might bring forward will have to be done in that context.  EU law, and its primacy, still stands and the Bill cannot run contrary to it.  Policymakers and the Legislature have to ensure that what is in the Bill respects EU law and from what we have seen so far, that is certainly what they are trying to achieve here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#O00400"><p>My concern when I read Article 15.4 is that if it is left to the discretion of an individual controller and it is not codified, then the balancing of complex issues becomes more difficult.  Article 15.4 will then become a defence to non-disclosure where disclosure is being pursued by an individual entitled to that information.  In that context, we need legislation to take it out of the hands of individual controllers so that there is a basis upon which litigation can occur if disclosure is not made.  We do not want it to become an impediment.  I see Article 15.4 as covering an entitlement to information but also acting as a defence not to disclose.  Quite often the GDPR is used and abused so as not to disclose and we want to avoid that.  By codifying it, we are taking it out of the hands of any individual controller and are creating a basis on which litigation could occur and removing that defence, as such.</p> <p>  In the previous session, I asked if I can restrict the processing of my data if it is relates to giving birth to a child.  I was informed that I cannot restrict anything that is data belonging to another person.  I would not have considered it to be that absolute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#O00500"><p>The way I would come at that in the context of the right of access is via the concept of mixed data.  While it is not referenced in the GDPR, it is a reality that comes into play in scenarios where a birth certificate contains information about more than one person.  The rights of the other person have to be taken into account.  One cannot say that a person cannot have access to one's own data because there is an equality of rights for both data subjects.  This is what Article 15.4 is also trying to get around in order to ensure that there is some mechanism by which the risk of an adverse impact on another person is taken into account.  In the context of the proposed Bill, as we understand it, the constitutional requirements and also commitments given to mothers in the past all have to be taken into account in trying to strike the right balance.  That is what the proposed Bill is trying to achieve.  It is trying to avoid adverse impacts and that section of the Article 15 requires that balancing test to be conducted.  That is the context in which I would view it.  An individual cannot tell a data controller that he or she must never release anything about that individual, even if it is contained in a birth certificate.  The controller has to look at that in the round.  The controller will consider the wishes of the individual, determine whether there are adverse impacts and then decide if the provision under Article 15.4 restricts in any way the right of access.  Some of these issues should be developed further under head 40, where there are other restrictions being imposed including, for example, restrictions related to the rights of third parties.  If there is an intention to restrict their data subject rights, that will have to be fully addressed, explained and worked out in the proposed Bill under head 40.</p></speech>

I have also seen examples where powers are given to the Minister to implement statutory instruments.  In that way, one could put on a statutory footing certain aspects of how the right is to be further restricted.</p><p>The DPC's general point of view is that it is preferable this would be included in the primary legislation.  As was said, it would be possible then to use a code of conduct to set further practical standards for its operation and to ensure all data controllers implementing the restriction do so in the right, common and standardised way.</p></speech>

From listening to the other questions, there still seems to be a difference of views.  We heard clear testimony from our earlier witnesses that some of the provisions in the proposed legislation, such as the proposed age limits in heads 3 and 5 and the mandatory information session, were incompatible with GDPR rights and were too cumbersome a restriction on the right of access to be proportionate in accordance with the provisions of GDPR.  The witnesses may not wish to stray into that level of detail, but do they have views on that aspect?  I ask this question because I think there is a difference of view between what we heard earlier and what we are hearing now in respect of what would be necessary and proportionate as a restriction on the right of access.  Very different views have emerged in this regard from the two sessions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021110200002#P00500"><p>From a general perspective, we see the intent of the proposed Bill and we know further work has to be carried out on it.  This does not fully answer the Deputy's question, but some elements must be worked out further.  Therefore, we are satisfied they do meet the proportionality and necessity requirements under EU law.  An information session is identified as a safeguard under the proposed legislation.  As I referred to already, it is not inherently or necessarily repugnant to the GDPR.  It is just one of the solutions or options the Department has chosen and the Minister is proposing to allow for that balancing of rights under Article 15(4), and that may be quite appropriate.</p> <p>  The age limit for this framework does not stop an access request from a minor in other circumstances.  Unless the legislation explicitly restricts all access requests from a minor, the right of access under GDPR still stands.  Further rights to request access may exist outside of this framework, but the proposed Bill is trying to implement a framework to allow these issues to be addressed and done in a coherent and consistent manner.  I do not have anything further to add on the issues the Deputy has raised other than to say that, from our assessment at this stage, there does not appear to be anything that is overly problematic here, but we are still reviewing the proposed legislation.  We did raise issues with the Department and we will want to see a further iteration of the Bill before we would be happy to say one way or another that there are no concerns from a data protection perspective.</p></speech>

Having listened to the earlier witnesses, it seems hard to justify such requirements or to see how they could be justified under GDPR, which of course takes priority over the Constitution.  That is where I am coming from on this issue.  An approach is still evident in the heads of this Bill that is unduly deferential to an assertive privacy right rather than taking the starting point as the right to have information, whereas GDPR requires the starting point to be the right to information.</p></speech>

I will invite the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to make an opening statement  This will be followed by opening statements from Dr. John O' Connor from Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Mr. Tim Conlon from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and Mr. Andrew Brownlee from SOLAS.  Following the opening statements, each member will have an eight minute slot in which to table questions and get a response from the witnesses.  The committee will publish the opening statements on its website following today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mr. Conlon is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and as such, he may not benefit from the same immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present and he has been advised of same.  Witnesses are reminded the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction from the Chair.</p> <p>  I will now call on the Minister to make his opening statement.  I wish to advise everyone that the Minister must leave the meeting at 12.30 p.m.  </p></speech>

At the outset I want to commend this committee on the work it is undertaking in this area, which is hugely valuable.  The way in which the committee is going about this work, in a very public and transparent way, is really helping with the important discourse that needs to happen now in relation to the lessons emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic in the context of transition pathways and opportunities for our younger people in school and, from my perspective, crucially, when they leave school; the way in which we present those options to them; and how we prepare them to best avail of those options.  There is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused huge disruption, challenge, stress and anxiety but it has also presented opportunities.  When it comes to the area of education, including further and higher education and the entire spectrum of education, there are many opportunities presenting and we will not be forgiven by future generations if we let this moment pass and decide to just go back to the old way of doing things.</p><p>Something much better and much bigger is demanded by our younger people, by the next generation of leaders within our community, society, economy and our political system, arising from their having lived through and endured a global pandemic.  Consequently, I encourage all of us, that is, myself, my Department, our agencies and all Members of the Oireachtas, to take this opportunity and be bold in the policy response we consider.  This committee is very much united across the political spectrum in wanting to explore those opportunities.</p><p> Any reform of the leaving certificate process must be considered in the context of broader senior cycle reform.  Sometimes the conversation can be only about the terminal exam but we must also consider the programme, subjects, skills and objectives in the round.  I will pose some questions.  Does the senior cycle prepare all our students equally well for pursuing their future paths, be they academic or vocational?  I really want to hone in on the latter point.  Where are we at with respect to a student who wishes to pursue a vocational course within our second level system?  Does the leaving certificate capture a person&rsquo;s capabilities in the round or does it choose to focus only on certain capabilities and assess those very well, thoroughly and objectively while ignoring many other capabilities or skills a young person may have?  Do the leaving certificate and the points system hinder a person&rsquo;s potential or help them?  There has never been a better time to have this conversation. </p><p> When we talk about the leaving certificate it is really important we not just talk about half the issue.  We should not have a conversation with one arm tied behind out back.  We should have a fully-rounded conversation.  It cannot just be a conversation about the leaving certificate examination.  When I talk to young people, their parents, teachers, guidance counsellors, principals and colleagues in these Houses, people also want to have a conversation about what happens after the examination.  The process the Department of Education and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Foley, the Government and the Oireachtas ultimately ends up putting in place is important but it needs to be joined up with the pathways that happen after that process of assessment.</p><p> How do we move beyond what I believe has been a very narrow view of options post school?  We have huge success in this country with rates of university and higher education uptake.  We should be proud of that but we must also be big enough to admit we have, perhaps unintentionally, narrowed the conversation about all the options much too early in a young person's life.  We have narrowed, in many ways, the definition of what success is and how it is perceived by society.  We must ask ourselves how we move beyond the points race and all the stress and worry students and their families feel every year and how we create additional and alternative pathways to further and higher education.  The leaving certificate route, whatever that might look like, can be a pathway but it is not the only show in town.  What are the other pathways to get a person where he or she wants to go?  I want the committee to know that is where my energy is going to be.  It will be placed in ensuring school leavers have as many ways as possible to progress to where they want to in terms of careers, as opposed to just one way.  There are far too many conversations around kitchen tables or on couches about what university a person wants to go to and not about what does he or she want to do with his or her life and here are three, four or five different ways of getting him or her there.  That is leading to huge challenges, to huge anxiety and pressure and a warped sense of what success and fulfilment can look like.</p><p> We must also be honest.  The current leaving certificate system does not equip a student in respect of many life skills.  Members may wonder why I should interfere in that space.  I do so because it directly impacts on the ability of a young person when he or she leaves school to make the successful transition to further education, higher education or to the world of work.  It does not always teach students about financial literacy or digital skills.  Bizarrely, it does not teach students properly about sex education and consent.  We in the higher education system then find ourselves having to play catch-up.  We all know the huge difficulties around sexual harassment, sexual violence and consent.  Why do we bury our heads in the sand on these issues when students are at a much younger age?  Furthermore, in the week in which COP26 is taking place, why do we not teach our kids about climate skills?  Mr. Brownlee, who is seated in front of me, is leading a massive programme in SOLAS to train people in green skills.  That is great.  Let us go back and train the people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who never had an opportunity to learn green skills.  However, are we satisfied that kids today, who care more about climate than any generation before them, leave schools with no understanding, in a formal sense, of the green skills or no ability to be assessed in relation to that as well?</p><p>I should acknowledge that we have brilliant schools, teachers and principals.  We have people who are passionate about doing the best by their students.  That is not the point I am making.  The point I am making is that the structured leaving certificate we have now ignores all these areas that I have spoken about but life does not ignore them and citizens in this country do not ignore them.  I believe that these skills being provided in a broader sense within our education system would help our students transition to third level, to employment and, quite frankly, to life.  We need a fair and consistent assessment system, one that can give our students feedback and a clear understanding of their strengths and talents in order that they can make reliable choices. </p><p> I will share with the committee some figures regarding transition rates from DEIS schools to higher education.  In 2018, the overall transition rate was 63%.  Of course, behind headlines there is a lot more detail and behind that overall transition rate there is a rate of 40% in DEIS schools and 69% in non-DEIS schools.  The aspiration of a child from a disadvantaged community is no less and should be no less than the aspiration of a child from another community.  We have to recognise that.  When we boast about how well we are doing as a country in terms of educational attainment, and we have every right to be proud of that, we should not forget that we are still leaving kids behind today and we are failing collectively to put in place enough policy interventions to close that gap between 40% and 69%.  That is not the equal republic that we all want to build post Covid.  Two babies born side by side need to have the same opportunity as they go through the education system at every phase and their dreams should not be dampened or lessened due to the area in which they grow up.</p><p> We also have to acknowledge that we live in a very fast-changing world as regards work, the skills we require and how we work.  We have all seen that accelerated through the pandemic.  Our third level system exists to allow learners to develop and specialise their knowledge, skills and competence.  Ireland&rsquo;s future sustainability depends on the achievements of these learners, on their specialised knowledge, expertise and development, as well as on their collective capacity to widen and deepen social, economic and cultural development.  We must ensure that there are sufficient numbers of students who are equipped to work in areas of specific skills needs.  Science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education, ICT skills and the development of language skills are some of the key areas where we must ensure post-primary students are given a chance to explore their talents.  In other words, let us not begin the conversation about how we address these challenges when a student turns up at the door of a university or college of further education at the age of 18.  Let us embed that in the school system.</p><p> An unintended consequence of the leaving certificate has been that it has decided that some skills matter and, therefore, by implication it has also decided that others do not.  As a result, we are narrowing our view of what success is.  We also have to be honest.  I am also the Minister responsible for skills.  There are skills shortages in this country in relation to housing.  We all want to build more houses and we need 27,500 more people to get to our target for housebuilding.  We all also want to retrofit homes.  I was listening to media commentary about retrofitting this morning.  It is a really important issue for saving our planet, which is on fire and which we all care about.  We have to ask ourselves who is going to do it.  No one here in this room is going to retrofit a home.  No one in this room is going to build a home.  We have to make sure that our younger people in school realise that there are pathways, careers and rewarding jobs in the trades and crafts and that it is not all just about a narrow view of the world.  I would make that point very strongly.</p><p> That is why I am not just talking about it as this Friday, with the co-operation of SOLAS, the CAO and the education and training boards, ETBs, we will launch a new updated CAO website.  Every leaving certificate student will be able to log on to the website and see the button for the traditional CAO options but, for the first time ever, they will also see a button for the further education and training options and a button that they can click to find out lots more information about apprenticeships and the supports and the pathways there as well.  Why hide these issues and not talk to people about apprenticeships at a younger age?  Why not look at allowing people the opportunities to sample and experience apprenticeships in our secondary school system and perhaps even earlier?  In our sector we are going to bring about that cultural change, where the conversation around the kitchen table or on the couch will be broader.  We are going to start that on Friday, with all our partners, with this revamped website.</p><p> Does cultural change not need to begin much earlier in the post-secondary school student's life?  It does.  The way one achieves that is through a broader and more inclusive curriculum.  I look forward to working with my Government colleagues, especially the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and to reviewing the forthcoming report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on priority areas and goals.  I wanted to share with the committee the view that the skills needs our country requires depends on getting this right.  The definition of success and what success is has been unintentionally narrowed by a leaving certificate system that applies a focus to some skills and ignores others.  In addition, the successful transition to other options post school requires a broader ranges of issues being assessed and a broader range of life skills being considered.  Crucially, we will begin this week by showing people all of the options available post school and not just some of them.</p></speech>

QQI oversees quality in post-secondary education and training and is the national awarding body for further education and training.  QQI has a statutory remit to promote the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s national framework of qualifications which includes school, further and higher education and training qualifications.  We promote lifelong learning through the implementation of national policy on access, transfer and progression and advise on the international recognition of qualifications.  My opening statement will focus on those aspects of the topic of leaving certificate reform that are the focus of the discussion today, namely, higher and further education requirements, vocational options and career paths.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate examination is an integral part of what is known in Ireland as senior cycle and internationally as upper secondary level education.  The ongoing senior cycle review led by the NCCA has built on the many strengths of our secondary school system including: systematic use of consultation processes for reform initiatives; well-developed autonomy for schools; a strong supply of highly qualified teachers; and a high level of school completion rates.  Any reform of our leaving certificate should build on what works for all students and be informed by engagement with stakeholders and findings from the best available evidence.</p> <p>  The enduring challenges in upper secondary level education have been well documented internationally.  They include: the need to guarantee real opportunities for young people to continue learning in the upper secondary education model of their choice after completing compulsory education; avoid making upper secondary vocational education programmes an option for lower achievers linked to poor-quality jobs and no access to tertiary education; create and strengthen credible pathways from secondary vocational education to tertiary education and encourage a significant proportion of students to follow that path; and establish systematic student counselling and career guidance services in all schools to prevent a lack of awareness of future options,to facilitate the making of informed choices and to help students to overcome their troubles and prevent dropout.</p> <p>  Senior cycle and the leaving certificate examination are important stages within the national education and training system.  They follow on from junior cycle and lead directly to employment or further and higher education and training opportunities.  System connectedness across general, further and higher education and training will therefore help to ensure cohesion and clarify responsibilities underpinning any reform.</p> <p>  The purpose of senior cycle should be shaped by both social and economic considerations.  Structures, including assessment practice, must support a responsive and flexible upper secondary education system that simultaneously serves employment, social inclusion and lifelong learning.  Ireland's economy and dynamic labour markets need people with sophisticated knowledge, skills and competences that are developed throughout school, further and higher education.  The capacity for lifelong learning is based on primary and secondary education. The secondary school age cohort of young people is larger than ever before and these students will require skills to prepare them for a lifetime of learning.</p> <p>  Vocational education and training is currently underdeveloped within senior cycle.  The role of senior cycle in initial vocational education and training in Ireland could be strengthened and expanded.  Initial vocational education and training programmes combine school and work-based learning.  Developing and strengthening both general and vocational pathways in upper secondary education can make education more inclusive and strengthen the transition from school to work.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA, have a work orientation but are more appropriately classed as pre-vocational or pre-technical, with little work-based learning required.  These programmes attract a minority of students, 25% and 5% of the leaving certificate cohort respectively.  The leaving certificate applied, which does not provide direct access to higher education, disproportionately attracts students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The recent expansion of apprenticeships into new sectors such as hospitality, financial services, information and communication technology present opportunities for pre-apprenticeship and traineeship programmes to be developed alongside traditional leaving certificate programmes.</p><p>Any such developments should be supported by guidance services and should ensure that graduates have opportunities to progress to work and to attain high-quality vocational, academic or professional qualifications.</p><p> Thank you, Chair.  I am happy to provide further information and respond to any questions that might assist the committee with its deliberations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.302" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Conlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#G00300"><p>Thank you, Chair.  My colleagues and I are pleased to assist the committee in its consideration of leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate is the primary assessment element of our national curriculum and facilitates the examination of the potential of students in terms of their knowledge of the national curriculum in their final senior-cycle year and ultimately defines their progression route into either further or higher education, which is our area of interest.  It is critical that any assessment method is based on a robust and practical delivery method in assessing the capability of the learner.  The leaving certificate examination should be fair and equitable, have strong quality assurance arrangements and have stakeholder buy-in, because it is the stakeholders - primarily the learners but also teachers, schools, higher and further education providers and employers - who will benefit directly from any reform agenda.  In the context of both today's discussion and the areas to be examined, any reforms which may be considered should focus on improving the learner experience with a view to providing learners with the best possible opportunity to realise, develop and display their talents.</p> <p>  Currently, the majority of higher education entrants come directly from the leaving certificate in any given year.  Hence, the connection between the second level sector and further and higher education sectors should be strengthened through any reform process and should focus on improving access and retention as learners transition from secondary to tertiary education, with a view to providing an even more seamless transition process.</p> <p>  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has participated in the transitions group which has implemented several policy changes in recent years to address some of the issues associated with transition to higher education including, for example, the revision of the leaving certificate grading system and the streamlining of entry points to higher education programmes to simplify student choices.  Any reform of the leaving certificate assessment model should provide for better connectivity and understanding of future career and associated education pathways for the learner, as the Minister has mentioned.  Outside of leaving certificate assessment, it is also important to create and embed links between higher education providers and post-primary learners at other stages in their junior and senior cycle.  In this regard, for example, the HEA funds ICT and entrepreneurship summer camps which engage post-primary school pupils with higher education institutions in short taster courses in these critical skills areas.</p> <p>  In addition, the HEA funds an access to apprenticeship programme which takes those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have completed the senior cycle or who may not have achieved their desired leaving certificate outcome and offers them a pathway to apprenticeship.  In this way, the recent expansion of apprenticeships into new sectors, such as hospitality, financial services and information and communication technology, presents opportunities for pre-apprenticeship programmes and traineeship programmes to be developed alongside traditional leaving certificate programmes.  Any such developments should be supported by guidance services and ensure that the graduates have opportunities to progress to work and high-quality further and higher vocational and academic qualifications.</p> <p>  Regarding changes relating to information relevant to student choice, and specifically changes to the CAO system, the HEA has been involved in and welcomes the inclusion of apprenticeship and further education programme links and information on the CAO platform, as the Minister has mentioned.</p> <p>  As equity of access to higher education is one of the key priorities for the HEA, it is important that any reform of the leaving certificate takes account of the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged students in accessing higher education.  The higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, schemes, which offer entry to courses on a reduced points basis for socio-economically disadvantaged students and students with a disability, are an important mechanism in that regard.</p> <p>  Overall, the leaving certificate, and any future reform of it, should ensure that all students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or who face barriers in terms of progression to higher education have as a fair chance of accessing higher education and achieving comparable outcomes as those from more affluent backgrounds.  These outcomes cover both access to and progression through higher education, as well as completion and future career development.</p><p> The HEA works closely with the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education to examine and improve teaching and learning interventions in support of student success, aiming to provide a high-quality and supportive higher education environment for all students arriving in our universities, institutes and colleges.</p><p> As with other sections of society and the economy, the recent experience of the higher education system has demonstrated the need for flexibility and responsiveness in challenging circumstances.  Higher education institutions are now examining the outcomes from their recent experience of remote provision in terms of teaching and learning, but also student supports.  Discussions to date suggest that institutions are leveraging new ways of engaging with students, such as through digital learning and outreach from counselling and learning support services, alongside and complementary to more traditional higher education provision.  The national forum is leading a national partnership project, Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together, to consider what we have learned since March 2020 and, crucially, what that means for the future of teaching and learning in Irish higher education.</p><p> Each student is different.  This is a useful opportunity for us to consider how students' educational needs can be met as they transition from the senior cycle into apprenticeship, further education and higher education.  This will require ongoing engagement and dialogue, not just at institutional or system level, but between educators at all levels in the education system as well as with students, their parents and their representatives.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to join this conversation.  I am happy to answer whatever questions it may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#H00200"><p>On behalf of SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, and the ETBs, I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to speak to it on leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>  SOLAS is an agency within the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have responsibility for funding, co-ordinating and monitoring of further education and training, FET, provision across Ireland.  We are also the statutory authority for apprenticeships.  Through the 16 ETBs and other providers, the FET system offers access to a wide range of learning opportunities and supports in every corner of the country, regardless of background or formal education level, and a learning pathway to take people as far as they want to go.  It currently serves a base of approximately 200,000 unique learners every year.  School leavers are a significant part of this provision, including circa 30,000 students on post-leaving certificate courses and many more opportunities through traineeships, specific skills training and apprenticeships.</p> <p>  SOLAS welcomes the Government's commitment to reform of the leaving certificate and senior cycle education and the resulting focus on improving access and pathways into all forms of tertiary education for people.  Currently, more than two thirds of second level students choose to enter higher education directly after their leaving certificate.  However, it is our belief that a proportion of these students would be better suited to a technical or vocational route where they could develop their creativity or technical skills.  Key to achieving this is providing the opportunity to learn about further education and training courses and apprenticeships at the point where decisions are being made on their future learning pathways post secondary school.</p> <p>  In response to this, I am delighted to confirm that, for the first time and as the Minister mentioned, CAO applicants in 2022 will be able to get information and apply for FET courses and view apprenticeship options via a link from the CAO website when it goes live this Friday.  This means that all of a school leaver's options will be available to him or her on one single platform.  This is a significant step towards improving pathways and will bring a focus on all of the opportunities available for students.  However, more work is needed in order to achieve the ambition of having an integrated and inclusive tertiary education system.  Together with the ETBs and other FET stakeholders, we are one year into the implementation of the ambitious FET strategy, Future FET: Transforming Learning 2020&ndash;2024.  This strategy sets out a clear strategic roadmap for the FET system that centres on three core pillars of building skills, fostering inclusion and creating pathways.  In the context of leaving certificate reform, the pillar of creating pathways has specific relevance in terms of school leavers entering the FET system.</p> <p>  The lack of exposure to vocational learning and the lack of vocational options in junior and senior cycles are highlighted as barriers to school leavers developing an interest in FET.  This finding was reinforced through our engagement with the NCCA and was underscored in the SOLAS formal submission to the public consultation on the reform of the senior cycle.</p><p>International approaches suggest a potential role for FET in offering modules and tasters of vocational courses to second-level students where existing teaching resources simply do not have the required technical experience to deliver them.  The potential for apprenticeship taster offerings as part of transition year, TY, is currently being tested in some schools.  The scale of this collaborative practice has the potential to be further expanded.  Indeed, with the ETBs operating many second-level schools, this could facilitate piloting of any new approaches and potentially support earlier interventions to inform future learner pathways to FET.  Furthermore, it provides a basis to consider the introduction of offerings at level 5 and level 6 as an integrated part of the senior cycle.</p><p> All-of-system career guidance is also vital for successful reform.  The FET strategy outlines this, building on the independent report commissioned by the Government on career guidance.  SOLAS and ETBs work closely with both the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and the National Centre for Guidance in Education to ensure their members are equipped with the latest information on FET options and we look forward to continuing to work with them to improve timely access to information.  As a general principle, it is important that FET is promoted as a valid and smart potential destination from the earliest stage within schools.  SOLAS has launched successful national campaigns in recent years to build awareness around FET and apprenticeship options, which are vital to ensure that ETBs can compete on an equal footing in terms of choices for progression by school leavers.</p><p> In conclusion, as the FET strategy and relevant cross-government policy to date demonstrates, there is a real opportunity now for ambitious reform, not only in FET, but in wider second-level and tertiary education provision.  This reform and the other key actions outlined in the FET strategy will together deliver tangible change that better serves both the needs of the learner and the country as a whole, in directly tackling labour and skills shortages and supporting the achievement of national goals and challenges such as Future Jobs Ireland, climate change and Housing for All.  Continuing to build and strengthen pathways from secondary school to FET is a key strategic objective for SOLAS and the wider FET sector.  Vocational options in TY and senior cycle, reform of the CAO and continuing to work with guidance professionals are key to unlocking this growth.</p><p> I hope that this provides a brief overview of SOLAS views on matters related to reform of the leaving certificate.  I thank committee members for their time and look forward to discussion of this matter. </p></speech>

If she directs her questions to particular witnesses, we will get through it more easily.</p></speech>

We agree on much of what has been said.  We certainly agree on the value of further education and apprenticeships, but we need to drop the idea that the main issue with them is perception and snobbery.  That abdicates responsibility for the impediments that need to be addressed within the apprenticeship and further education process.  Perception and snobbery might be the case for some people but it is not for most.</p> <p>  We know the further education system needs multi-year funding to provide the ability to plan strategically, to know where people are and to have greater freedom to provide the courses and education people in their communities want and need.  I welcome the new CAO website.  If it included FET options, including apprenticeships, it would be a step forward.  Critical pathways must be there for those who do not want to progress to higher education.  When we look at this issue, it is quite stark.  Less than 5% of almost 4,000 students who do pre-nursing in further education get access to degree courses afterwards.  That is a real problem we need to address.  It is simply not good enough, especially when we have shortages of nurses.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about enhancing the visibility of apprenticeships, which misses the point to an extent.  Many people are trying, right now, to get an apprenticeship.  I speak to them every day.</p><p>I know of one person who just got an apprenticeship after trying for two years.  In that case, 140 people interviewed for two apprenticeship places.  The retrofitting targets that were mentioned mean we will need 27,000 tradespeople working in this area in the coming years so we know exactly what we need.  Currently, we only have about 18,000 craft apprenticeships in total and we have more on the waiting list unable to access the training they need.  The process has been allowed grind to a halt.  I am aware Covid has been a big factor in that but there were capacity issues before the pandemic and we need to have an honest conversation about this as well.  It is the only way we will be able to tackle what we need.</p><p> The so-called "emergency response" to the waiting lists in 2020 was to allocate &euro;12 million to address the backlog.  This was despite the fact that the backlog was actually saving the State over &euro;16 million in the same year because it did not have to pay many of the allowances.  The response has been completely inadequate and has left the system in crisis.  We also need to ensure apprenticeships are available for people who want them.  We should be leveraging the public procurement system by applying a criterion in respect of apprenticeship employment for companies that want to apply for public contracts.  We need to be very direct about this in ensuring it is part of the conditions.</p><p> There are many other issues around apprenticeships but I am conscious of my time.  I will ask a couple of questions.  What was the estimated saving to the State arising from the waiting list in 2021 and the reduced payments for allowances?</p><p> The next question is for Mr. Conlon.  He referred to the HEA funding ICT and entrepreneurship summer camps.  I welcome that but does it in any way suffice when we have so many second level schools in which computer science is not taught?  Is it an objective of the Minister, the Department and the Government that all students in this day and age have an option to study computer science?  That must be our ambition and there must a timeline for achieving it.  In this changing environment, it is not acceptable that we have schools that do not offer the option of computer science.</p><p> Dr. O'Connor mentioned establishing student counselling and career guidance services.  It is shameful these are not already in place.  We know from research we did last year with college students that one of the biggest impediments they face in making the right choices at further and higher education is the absence of, or lack of sufficient, career guidance.  I want to know how that problem will be fixed.</p><p> I will address my next point to Mr. Brownlee and SOLAS.  We have an ETB training centre in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  The community wants to make it into a vibrant training centre for the town, which has been decimated by banks leaving and other matters.  The community wants to have a cohort of well-trained people.  It is not seeking a huge amount of funding but some funding and support to turn the ETB centre into a place which can be used for apprenticeships for specific job opportunities in the town.  That is a way of making use of buildings that are not being used, reviving our towns and building up the labour capital we need in all of these towns to be able to attract industries to them.  We need much broader thinking and to remove blockages.</p><p> I will make a final point on pathways for nurses.  There is no reason people who do an apprenticeship should not be able to go on to do a degree and go right up to PhD level.  That needs to be made clear to them.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee last week, we discussed cancer research and oncology.  The Minister will know that we have the most brilliant oncology nurses.  Why do they not go on to become consultants?  What are the blockages stopping them from becoming consultants?</p><p>There are lots of matters we need to address and I have little time for answers but maybe some of my questions can be answered.</p></speech>

I want to both agree and disagree with Deputy Conway-Walsh on various matters.  I will not drop the idea, as the Deputy said, that part of the issue around apprenticeships is not a lack of information, a snobbery or a cultural issue because I genuinely believe it is.  That is not abdicating responsibility because I accept it is only a part of the issue.</p> <p>  I met Zoe, the 1,000th female registered apprentice in Ireland, who is an accounting technician in Cork and no one ever told her about apprenticeships.  She did not know anything about them but her brothers in school became aware of them.  She was not aware of them because she went to an all-girls school.  Zoe said that if she had have been made aware of them much earlier her career pathway would have been easier.  I also met Jack in Cavan, who got his first choice in his CAO application and started his degree but he hated it so he dropped out and did a pre-law course in Cavan Institute.  Jack told me that if he had known about that course first it would have been an awful lot more straightforward.  Karen in Sligo College of Further Education was gutted when she did not get the points she wanted in her leaving certificate.  She went to Sligo College of Further Education for a year and is now going on to St. Angela's College to do her degree.  She said she feels better developed as a person as a result.</p> <p>  I genuinely and passionately believe that the pathways, information and knowledge we are giving our students at the age of 16 and 17 are key.  That is not in contradiction with the point Deputy Conway-Walsh validly makes about the need for us to also up our game in what we are doing.  I fully accept that.  We are doing a couple of things although I will not have time to get into all of them.  I will mention increasing the number of available apprenticeships, because availability was a core part of the Deputy's question, as two key actions are taking place next year.  First, from January a core financial payment of around &euro;2,000 per apprentice per year will be made to any employer that takes on a new apprentice.  The hospitality sector and the Restaurants Association of Ireland have been looking for such a financial incentive for an employer to take on an apprentice for years.  Second, there has been hypocrisy about this in the public sector.  We wag our fingers about apprenticeships and give out about them but the entire public sector, which employs around 300,000 people, on average takes on 80 apprentices per year.  That is a darn disgrace.  There is a target in the apprenticeship action plan of 750 apprentices per year by 2025.  By next July the quotas of what council, agency and Department is doing what will be brought to Cabinet.</p> <p>  Mr. Brownlee will comment on the apprenticeship backlogs and the wait times because SOLAS is driving those down.  The Deputy said it is inadequate but I am satisfied with the plan that is in place.  The only constraint in increasing the capacity has been public health concerns and we are now in a good place in that regard.  Any funds that have been or will be required will be forthcoming.  I accept that it is not all down to Covid but this is a chance for something good to come from Covid so we must remove that backlog once and for all.</p> <p>  The Deputy is entirely right about pre-nursing.  When Mr. Brownlee and I talk about this new portal on Friday being the first step towards an integrated third level system, one of the next steps has to be that if one goes on to do pre-nursing or pre anything else and one gets the top marks then there has to be a linkage.  I am committed to delivering on that as part of our integration of the tertiary education system.</p></speech>

There is a major emergency plan and I agree with the Deputy that it is an emergency.  Capacity was an issue before all of this started but it is many times worse now.  The emergency plan involves increasing the instructor base significantly and the Deputy will see that there is an ongoing campaign to recruit 100 additional staff into ETBs in the coming months.  We have moved the entire delivery model for phase 2 of off-the-job training from three intakes per year to two, which increases capacity by 50%.  Some &euro;20 million of capital investment has been made to expand workshop capacity across both further education and higher education.</p> <p>  The key point is that we are back on-site.  For the first nine months of the first 12 months of Covid, the workshops were closed and we could not run the training.</p><p>For the period up to September, they were operating at approximately 50% capacity, but they are ramped up now.  We are turning a corner, in that the waiting list decreased from 11,800 at the end of July to 9,797 at the end of September.  That happened because we have been able to get people back in training.  We believe a corner is turned but there will be no let-up.  We completely accept that we are in an emergency situation. </p></speech>

I thank all of the organisations represented here in terms of the great work that is being done in a very transformational way.  I would like to put a number of direct questions.  </p><p>On the FET strategy, the retrofitting skills programme started with Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board.  I welcome that it continues to be rolled out.  Is Mr. Brownlee confident, in terms of the construction apprenticeship needs we have as a country, that we will be able to meet them?  The Minister mentioned a figure of 27,500.  Is Mr. Brownlee confident we can do that?  One of the problems historically has been barriers of transition between FET and higher education.  Are there existing barriers about which Mr. Brownlee continues to have concerns with regard to those who wish to transition between further and higher education and <i>vice versa</i>?</p><p><i></i>My next question is for Mr. Conlon.  He will be aware of the work done by the Commission on the Points System, the HEA and the NCCA on the transitions issue.  One of the big concerns was around the increasing specialisation of higher education courses, that these were multiplying and we were getting programmes such as engineering with French and computing.  One of the recommendations was that higher education institutions would reduce that diversification.  That has not happened to the extent that we would like to see it happen.  It is welcome that under the CAO, students will get a whole range of options in terms of apprenticeships.  What moves are being made in terms of reducing those overall numbers because it is the backwash from third level that is impacting on the CAO programme, particularly in the area of the high points courses?</p><p>We will be constantly building skills over the next period.  Dr. O'Connor might comment on the work QQI is doing in the area of micro-credentials.  That is important.</p><p>My final question is for the Minister.  Access is improving enormously but for high points courses, the socioeconomic profile, particularly those in medicine and law, is not improving.  There is evidence it is disimproving.  What can be done in that area?  Students who are doing their leaving certificate now will be retiring in the 2070s.  What skills will we need out to that period?  Like others, I have spoken to students about what they would like to hear and see.  They have talked about tax, philosophy, greater knowledge of technology, design, and public speaking.  In my own case, I would have liked a greater knowledge of home economics.  Anybody who has experienced my cooking would probably agree.  In terms of his own experience in life, what skills would the Minister have liked to have undertaken at second level that he believes would stand to him now?  </p></speech>

I ask the Minister to respond first, following which I will call the witnesses.</p></speech>

The Senator raised a valid question.  It is a point that I am trying to make here without being overly prescriptive or without crystal ball-gazing too much.  There are skills that are transversal skills that I do not think our second level system as currently constructed is able to deliver on.  That is not a criticism of the people there; they are doing an exceptional job.  It is not a criticism at all but it goes to our values as a country.  It goes to our view as to what we determine to be success.  Success is different things for different people.  I believe we are putting too much pressure on our students if their success, capabilities and talent is not in the areas that we are assessing.</p><p>There are a whole load of other areas where they could be really good, but we are not shining a light on them.  I was talking to a number of youth organisations at the weekend, and they were hitting me with things like financial skills, digital literacy and climate.  Climate is the big one.  This is one that we could get right.  Why not start it now instead of some other Minister sitting here in 20 years' time and the head of SOLAS saying we have to train all these people in their 40s and 50s in green skills?  They are better clued into this than any generation before.  We have a chance now to not have to go back and, pardon the pun, retrofit the next generation with climate skills but to try to find a way of working it into the school system.</p><p> I know the question on construction needs is for Mr. Brownlee, but I wish to make one comment on it.  Sometimes, when we talk about the 27,500 &ndash; I am sure I am to blame on this too &ndash; people presume they are all in further education and training, FET, and that it is not the case.  While a lot of them are in FET, when we look at the needs, we will also require architects, quantity surveyors and engineers.  I say to Mr. Conlon and the HEA that it does not let the higher education side off the hook, nor would it wish to be.  There will be a need to increase capacity in terms of training people in those areas where a higher education degree or a master's degree is needed, in addition to a lot of the areas that FET can provide as well.</p><p> I am acutely aware of the issue relating to access.  In medicine, there can be too much sameness in terms of the background of people who enter certain professions and that is not good.  To be honest, one of the barriers to entry on the graduate medicine programme is still the cost.  I am working on proposals, which I hope to advance through the next Estimates process &ndash; it gets earlier every year &ndash; on how we can look at both the SUSI system and the level of financial support that is supplied.  In fairness to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, she has raised graduate medicine with me too.  It was indicated that law also has a role to play in this regard.  I hope to engage with the law bodies and colleagues in the Department of Justice on this shortly.  I will hand over to colleagues.</p></speech>

We have large qualifications like the leaving certificate and bachelor's degrees, but the Irish qualifications system also provides for smaller qualifications, what we might call, non-major qualifications.  In some ways, Ireland has been ahead of the pack internationally in having a flexible structure to be able to recognise smaller chunks of learning through the use of what are called micro credentials.  There is a lot of interest in these, in particular in terms of their having a responsive, flexible reaction to labour market skills, for example in response to climate change and digitalisation where micro credentials may well be the solution to upskilling or reskilling where a full or major qualification is not the appropriate labour market response in that particular area.</p> <p>  The universities are leading the way here in a particular project on promoting the national framework for micro credentials.  These can also be used in further education and training.  There is potentially a role here too for micro credentials in school education.  Transition year has a lot of very useful learning.  Sometimes that learning is not formally recognised or certified.  The use of the micro credentials tool to give a formal, portable trusted recognition of learning achieved in transition year could be used for exchange and portability along the path for individuals.</p> <p>  We are well ahead in the game in terms of micro credentials in Ireland, in particular in innovation.  The national quality assurance and qualifications system supports the roll-out of that particular response.</p></speech>

With Housing for All, the imperative is to support the delivery of 33,000 houses per annum.  The emergency measures we talked about in terms of the apprenticeship pipeline once we have dealt with the waiting list problem should give us an increase in capacity of around 50%, which in the medium term will be a platform to deliver on that.  It is not just about apprenticeships, there is a need to ramp up the non-apprenticeship courses.  There is a model to follow with the development of the Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre, which has started to work in partnership with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others to develop levels 4 and 5 construction courses to get people into the labour force.</p> <p>  Retrofitting is a big challenge.  It was mentioned that Waterford-Wexford had the first retrofitting centre of excellence.  There is now one in Laois-Offaly and there are plans for centres in Sligo, Limerick and Cork.</p><p>We have two fully operational and the rest will be on-stream by quarter 1 of next year.<br/><br/>There is still not significant demand from industry for the courses that are being offered in those facilities.  There is a job of work there to stimulate industry interest and demand.  Contracts may still be coming to them a little to easily.  We need to find a way to get the focus on what they will need to meet the skills needs of tomorrow.<br/><br/>On the further education and training to higher education transitions question, I think the Deputy is right that it is <i>ad hoc</i>at present.  It depends on college-to-college links.  One in five of the technological higher education sector intake still comes from further education.  There are, therefore, strong transitions in place.  However, we need to look at a more universal system, probably theme by theme.  Perhaps we should start with nursing and then perhaps information technology or initial teacher education, chunk that off and put in place a system where a student who gets a level 5 pre-nursing qualification will know that he or she will have direct access to an Irish higher educational institution to do the degree.  I think it should go further.  There is real potential for one-plus-two and two-plus-two models where students start their degree in a further education institution.  That is a model for which we can borrow and learn from jurisdictions not too far from here.</p></speech>

The point at which students make a career choice is the most important piece.  The Minister alluded to the need to support students in making a decision that has an impact on the rest of their lives.  Then, if that does not work out, what are the alternates and how can the student step up or step down between different levels in the system?  I could say more about it but time is limited.</p></speech>

The strengths of the leaving certificate also present its weaknesses.  I will ask the Minister a question in respect of that.  The leaving certificate is a good examination for identifying academic excellent.  A boy or girl in secondary school who wants to become a doctor knows that he or she has to excel academically.  Such children know they have to do excellently in the leaving certificate and once they do that, they have a pathway, literally, to the age of 65.  Unfortunately, that same pathway is not available to the child who is not academically excellent or, alternatively, the child who is vocationally gifted.  Do we need to categorise and identify earlier the different gifts that children have when they are in secondary school?  It appears that by the time they get to the junior certificate, they are on the academic route and unless we expose them at that stage to opportunities or avenues aside from that, necessarily they will not achieve their potential.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in response to that general issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#O00600"><p>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's comments on the leaving certificate are very fair.  The leaving certificate has its successes and for certain professions and people who wish to go a certain way in life, it works extremely well.  Even for those for whom it works well - students who do extremely well in it - the sense I get from many of them is that they wished they had been exposed to other skills.  I am conscious that teachers would make the point that schools cannot do everything and are under considerable pressure.</p><p>While I do not wish to stray too much into the Department of Education's space, I also agree with the Deputy's point about when a young adult in secondary school is, to use the Deputy's word, &quot;exposed&quot; or perhaps given an opportunity to sample vocational skills within the second level system.  That does not really happen, with the exception of schools that do it off their own bat or in the transition year programme where it may happen in an <i>ad hoc</i>, non-structured and non-credentialled way.</p><p>Our suggestion is that we need to broaden the options so that the conversation changes at 16 and 17 and a student does not only see the traditional CAO form but also FET courses and asks what certain courses are and whether there is a different way available if he or she does not get the points for law.  For example, should someone sample law by doing a pre-law course, to use the Deputy's profession as an example.  Can students sample in transition year by micro-credentialling elements and allowing them to try something out for a few months?  As the FET strategy says, can we introduce taster programmes in apprenticeships at transition year?  The answer to all of those questions is &quot;Yes&quot;, but we need to do this in a way that is tied in with the NCCA review and the work the Minister, Deputy Foley, will be doing.</p></speech>

At one level, however, transition year seems to be chaotic and at other levels, it is not properly structured.  What would Dr. O'Connor like to see in a transition year that would be beneficial to expose younger people to the types of careers they might be interested in?</p></speech>

It is not necessarily that the student makes the decision but that the rest of the system makes the decision for the student as to whether he or she is on an academic track.  That may be too early to make the decision and there is a question of whether that is an informed decision by the individual.  You hear different experiences anecdotally around transition year based on the school and the individual.  It does seem to be a really useful opportunity.  A lot of useful learning happens in transition year.  I do not think we make the best of it.  Deputy Conway-Walsh struck on something earlier, namely, the idea of a vocational education and training pathway.  In school, in further education and in training and higher education, you could take engineering, nursing, teaching or law and look at what that pathway looks like and at what the role is for secondary education in that pathway.  That goes to the point in guidance too.  It is about when you can see a pathway and there are assurances along that path that if I can strike that path and can get taster elements of it in the school system, it will lead across further education, into higher education and professional qualifications if I desire.  In some ways, we are zooming out away from the leaving certificate and looking at what vocational education and training looks like in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is complicated.  At what stage in one's career does one make a choice about one's future career?  We see a challenge, in terms of access and progression in higher education, in respect of students who do not make the appropriate course choices and drop out.  There should be step-downs and other options.  To engage too soon is a challenge but as others have said, it is most important to have a range of options and information available for people to inform them in the choices that they make.  For this apprenticeship programme, it is about telling people that these are pathways into apprenticeship that can lead on to further and higher education and about giving them that as a career choice.</p></speech>

Is it because society says to them that this is where they should go?</p></speech>

Many people might benefit from an further education-first type of approach before they go into to higher education.  There are schools where 100% of school leavers go directly into higher education and surely, one or two of those individuals would be better suited to a more technical or vocational route.  As we reflected, they do not get exposure to those kinds of technical or vocational options.  Transition year is one part of it and in a way it is quite easy to build in taster and foundation courses but we need to look at real reform of the senior cycle and the leaving certificate and maybe look at, say, the Scottish model where further education colleges actually deliver those level 5 and level 6 modules and students get credit for them as part of the equivalent of the leaving certificate there.</p></speech>

This has been an interesting session because we have focused to a great degree on skills, which is welcome.</p> <p>  One of the recurring themes that we are seeing throughout this process is that we must differentiate between senior cycle and the leaving certificate.  Too often, they are viewed as one and the same.  I wonder whether by overfocusing on the leaving certificate as a summative end point exam, we almost make it a singularity in a student's life, to use science fiction terminology, and we miss out on the senior cycle.  As such, it is welcome that we are beginning to speak about moving beyond the leaving certificate &ndash; sidestepping it is probably the wrong way to talk about it &ndash; and discuss alternative pathways for students.  The leaving certificate captures one type of learning, which has been broadly accepted as we have worked our way through this process.</p> <p>  Skills will be vital.  Housing has been mentioned.  Waterford and Wexford have done great work leading on retrofit programmes.  However, retrofit on its own will not be enough.  As the town centres first policy is delivered, it will entail refurbishing older properties, but we do not have the skills in our trades to bring those old market town properties back into use.  If we are serious about tackling vacancy and dereliction and returning life to the hearts of our towns, this will be an important skill set.</p> <p>  I will offer the Minister praise.  He has shown the merit of having a senior Ministry in this area.  It has driven further education.  We should also consider lifelong learning.  While it is tangential to this discussion, lifelong learning is one of the areas where we do not do well.  However, I am glad that we are focusing more on further education, in particular apprenticeships.</p> <p>  I would like to give Mr. Brownlee the opportunity to drill down a little more into the idea of level 5 and level 6 certification.  It is interesting and I would love to see it happen in respect of languages as well.  I would like to see the common European framework being rolled out into schools.  We have discussed this at length on the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge.  Many people who leave school, often with a good leaving certificate in Irish, will say the next day that they cannot speak Irish at all.  If we put them on the common European framework and told that them that they were at B2, B1 or wherever, it would be helpful.  I would like to give Mr. Brownlee an opportunity to speak a little more about this idea and how to segment it for particular subjects.  I studied engineering to the leaving certificate.  Is there a micro-credential that we could roll out for computer aided design, CAD, computer numerical control, CNC, turning, milling or the like?  I am using these as examples only because I know the subject reasonably well.</p> <p>  I took a look at the figures in preparation for today.  We are not doing badly in terms of STEM subjects.  A press release from Engineers Ireland in September detailed how well we were doing in terms of the number of students taking engineering, construction studies and agricultural sciences to the leaving certificate.  That is welcome, as an important part of the skills piece has to do with land use.  For example, the forestry programme in WIT was oversubscribed.</p><p>It will be incredibly important.  Land use programmes, organic agriculture and horticulture will become extremely valuable skills.  I will give Mr. Brownlee and Dr. O'Connor an opportunity to talk about that because the witnesses were speaking about that in terms of micro-credentials.  How do they see that working and integrating, particularly in transition year?  There is probably a role for it in the senior cycle if we could make the system marry up.</p></speech>

Obviously, my job is to worry about further education and training and apprenticeships, but the idea of integrating modules in languages or engineering as part of the leaving certificate or senior cycle plays to the same point.  There is no reason a technological university or one of our traditional universities could not offer that type of access to a module as part of senior cycle.  How it works and how it works in other places is quite simple.  It is a credit-based system.  Very often, someone will go to the local further education college for a couple of hours.  The college will deliver that module once or twice a week to senior cycle students and students will get credit that will be recognised as their overall leaving certificate award and, potentially, their overall CAO score.  It is really that simple.  It is the delivery we must get right.  We would have to reconcile how we would get a further education instructor to deliver education within a school setting but perhaps the answer to that is to take interested students to the local further education college, give them a taste for the environment, deliver the module there and bus them back to the school afterwards.  I know this is the model that is followed in Scotland.  There is a real idea there around this not being just a further education thing but could be a higher education thing in terms of an offering in the senior cycle.</p></speech>

It is central to it and leaving certificate reform.  Regarding the Deputy's question on delivery and certification, we can be very open-minded.  We have the toolkit available to us in terms of different types of certification.  We have QQI and FET certification.  If we think again about zooming out and upper secondary education, it can be delivered not just in school but outside it.  It can be delivered in workplaces.  We have other certification bodies that can provide input into this.  It involves looking in a more holistic way at what the right mix of certification is, awarding bodies that might be involved and further education and general education being mixed.  That kind of zooming out and thinking about that idea of upper secondary education where we have general education and further education gives us a lot of tools to play with in terms of finding the right mix of certifications and places and location of delivery, which is not always a classroom in a school.  It can be delivered outside a school in a workplace or other education and training settings.  We have the policy instruments available to us to design those more rounded pathways for young people.</p></speech>

I suspect it will be the same at this session.  Do we need to seriously invest in second level in order that guidance counselling is available?  The Chairman put together a significant unit of work on bullying in schools.  The need for guidance counselling and one-on-one relationship service within schools was another thing referenced.  Do we need it in terms of helping students to see a pathway that is not just the leaving certificate to a third-level institution and that academic pathway?  Do we need to make that investment?</p></speech>

We have a responsibility to build it up within our own sector as well.  I am very struck by Dr. O'Connor's comments, which are hugely valid and probably broaden the discussion.  If we talk about everything to do with 16- and 17-year-olds as being what happens within the school, we limit our options quite frankly.</p><p>This is because schools can only do so much within the number of hours each day.  We will build up our own guidance supports as well, with guidance in the community, and guidance that will be made available to students and the population about information about apprenticeships.  The short answer is "Yes".  We need to support guidance.  Guidance counsellors are being asked to do a huge amount.  It is an ever more complex role for a whole variety of reasons, academic and otherwise.  "Yes" is the short answer.</p></speech>

The son decided he wanted to become a plumber.  The professional parents nearly had a conniption, because he was not going to get a professional job and that he was going get hands dirty.  They decided to go to the guidance counsellor to try change his mind and that he would go to a more professional job.  The guidance counsellor told them their son was happy with what he wanted to do and that they should let him do that.  It tells us the two sides of the importance of guidance counsellors.  The parents were trying to talk the son out of what he wanted to, which was a trade.  He would probably make more money than what the parents were making.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh raised this point.  We are fully committed to it.  However, I want to emphasise the point Mr. Brownlee made.  It is a serious point from a policy perspective.  We will not be found wanting as a Department, nor will SOLAS as an agency of our Department, in making sure we do everything we can to expand retrofitting skills.  However, we need to consider what policy instruments are required to create demand.  This demand should be on two fronts.  The first relates to demand by those who wish to access the training and how one incentivises that.  The second relates to demand by people who want to get their home retrofitted and how we incentivise that.  I am fully committed to this.  It has to be done in half a million houses.  We are opening centres of excellence to train people.  We want those centres of excellence to be busy.  I want to flag with this committee that we will need a policy discussion about how we incentivise demand by people who are looking for the training and demand for people who wish to be able to have the works carried out on their home, office, business, or building.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about the climate emergency.  It is important to note that it is not the planet that is in danger, but it is us, as a species, who are in danger.  We have to put the measures in place to ensure that we survive as a species.  It is that serious.  There is a moment for us in education across primary, secondary and tertiary.  That moment is now and we have got to grab it.  We need to be a lot more ambitious about transition year.  The suggestions Dr. O'Connor had are excellent, but they need to be throughout school, and not just in transition year.  In the GCSEs, for instance, students can do Bitesize.  They can be accredited in the UK system.  Why not do the same here and look at doing it every single year?  School, fundamentally, is a transition.  It is not just one year.  Let us look at the whole of the schooling system.  </p> <p>  Additionally, we should not have the kind of conversation where we talk about academic kids versus non-academic kids.  Apprenticeships are not necessarily non-academic.  There are all kinds of apprenticeships.  Apprenticeships just mean that the person is doing a particular job that requires mentorship.</p> <p>  I would like to address the point that leaving certificate lets down academic kids too.  Secondary school lets down gifted children.  We talk about giftedness as a special need, but we do not provide the services for that special need.  In legislation it is a special need and, yet, what are we doing there?  Let us not forget that in the conversation.  That goes for some of the universities as well.  I know this having done guest lecturing with third level students.  The students come into third level feeling bedazzled, even though they are academic children and young people.</p><p>Does the Minister have any thoughts around some of those issues?  I will come back in with a couple more questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#T00200"><p>I endorse and agree with everything Senator Pauline O'Reilly has said.  Earlier, I posed a question about climate skills in trying to help this committee with its deliberations on leaving certificate reform.  While we have a role to do with third level in terms of climate and green skills, why are we retrofitting our citizens with those skills at that age when we could be doing it much earlier?  They are demanding we do it much earlier, as the Senator knows very well.  They are taking to the streets.  They want action at every level and to play their part.  I do not want, in years to come, a committee asking the Minister of the day how many more places he or she is putting in for people in their 40s, 50s and 60s to get the green skills, when we have a chance to start people in within the education system within an earlier stage.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator.  It is dangerous to categorise children, full stop.  What does academic versus vocational even mean?  One can be academic in one area and vocational in another.  It is about providing as many different pathways to access different skills in different and flexible ways as possible.  I am glad the Senator made the point on apprenticeships.  If I walked down Grafton Street now and asked people what an apprenticeship was, I guarantee people would tell me it was all the crafts and would list the craft apprenticeships one by one.  Of course, they are not wrong and we need more people in those and want to promote and do more but one could do a PhD in an apprenticeship or a master's degree in science in an apprenticeship in Ireland.  One can do a level 8 degree as an apprentice.  An apprenticeship is not something over here, it is a different way of obtaining that qualification, as Dr. O'Connor will know in QQI.</p> <p>  Apprenticeships are much broader.  I met the CEO of an insurance company in a DEIS school the other day.  He entered the company through an apprenticeship scheme and is now the CEO.  This is the norm throughout the European Union.  We are outliers in that regard.  We are expanding the number of apprenticeship programmes into areas that have been seen in this country as non-traditional apprenticeship areas.  I welcome the Senator's point.</p></speech>

I have been reading through the submissions.  Reference has been made in a couple of submissions to students with special educational needs.  We have had internal debates about this in my party.  Previously, there have been thresholds in the public sector with a target of 2% of employees being people coming from special educational backgrounds.  Where are we at with that?  I am having significant difficulty back in Cork in trying to get programmes off the ground with both local authorities whereby a certain percentage of people would be employed or taking on trainees as trainees or given placement.  These people are highly skilled in their own way and the private sector in Cork seems to be doing an awful lot more than we as the public sector or State are doing.</p></speech>

I will ask the HEA to provide to the committee any data it has on numbers and percentages and maybe SOLAS also has some information.  I will highlight two actions we are taking.  One is on apprenticeships.  We are setting targets for the public sector for the first time for 750 apprentices to be taken on in a year in the public sector by 2025, compared to an average of approximately 80 now.  It is a big step up.  The quota for who will do what will be worked out between now and next July and then brought to Government.  That is about the public sector having to step up.</p> <p>  Alongside that, in the apprenticeship action plan, should be read the commitment to increase diversity among apprenticeships.  There is specific reference to disabilities.  We will be setting up a group in the apprenticeship action plan to look at how we improve access.  I am happy to keep in touch with the Deputy on that.  We are doing broader work on which I can write to the committee.  We are quite excited about it.  One could argue the cliff edge for a person with disability has moved from being from primary to secondary and is now from secondary to third level.</p><p>That is not to say there are not good examples out there, the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities, TCPID, being one that springs to mind.  I met parents of children with Down's syndrome recently who told me that not only was it heartbreaking for them as parents to not watch their child progress post-school, but they were having to watch their child regress.  A fund of &euro;5 million was provided in the budget this year to provide pathways for people with intellectual disabilities into further and higher education.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, and I have been charged with looking at how we do that transition planning.  When I was Minister for Health we were having a conversation every year about school leavers in the context of residential places and day care.  While I am not suggesting that is not important, I am not sure that the same level of conversation is being had about training places, for example.  In fact, I know it is not, to be quite frank.  We have been asked by the Taoiseach to bring proposals to the Cabinet committee on education.  If this committee wants to hear more on that, we can provide more details but as an initial step, I will send a note on it.</p></speech>

It is good to see that things have progressed in terms of embedding environmentalism and sustainable skills across subjects.  That is an important point.  It is not just that certain students will learn about retrofitting.  Every single apprenticeship and qualification needs to have that embedded within it because we must all deal with the crisis we are now in.  Macra na Feirme has raised with me the fact that it would like to see options for ecologists.  I ask the witnesses to speak to the specific skills and areas that have been identified as requiring more places.  What needs to be done in order to make that happen?  I would also welcome any comments they wish to make on the points I made previously.</p></speech>

Any vocational education and training programme or qualification is going to require strong foundations in general education anyway so the aforementioned idea is a false choice.  General education is also key for long-term progression.  As the Minister said before he left, we have doctoral level apprenticeships.  That is not just a symbolic statement.  We actually have them in practice.  That is quite unusual internationally and shows that we mean it when we talk about higher vocational education and training as distinct from higher education.  That is a point well made.</p> <p>  On the skills piece, the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS identifies skills that are in demand and provides forecasting in that area.  The labour market intelligence function that we have can tell us, whether it is with regard to ecology or other areas, not just what occupations are in demand but also the skills and competencies that we will need for those particular occupations.  It is really important to invest in and maintain that infrastructure so that we have good visibility.  It is tricky these days to determine what we will need three, four or five years down the line.  That labour market intelligence is also relevant for guidance and understanding the skills that are needed.  If we are designing qualifications or educational programmes at this stage, we need to have good visibility, with a good deal of granularity, of the skills and competencies that we will need to build into qualifications.  That could include sustainable education principles, green practices or green knowledge.  We need to have that foresight and visibility from our labour market function which is well developed but not always well used, particularly in the senior cycle and in parts of the education and training system.  </p></speech>

We think of those in terms of three broad categories, one of which is green skills for construction.  This relates to things like retrofitting and we have a reasonably good handle on the scale of the skills needs in that area.</p><p>Interesting research that we have got to date from the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit, SLMRU, suggests that when you go beyond that, it is not so much about specific green jobs in five, ten or 15 years.  Rather, many jobs will require a sustainability or a green skills component.  If agriculture, for example, is going to be sustainable, we will need a wide base of farmers and their employees who have that deep understanding of green skills and energy management, emissions, and minimising carbon footprint.  Manufacturing is another area.  If we are going to meet our targets, the whole industry of meat processing has to change.  Green skills for careers is about embedding green skills into particular industries and occupations, rather than bringing in 50,000 new green jobs.  That is what we seem to be hearing already.  The biggest part of this are agents of change.  We should make sure that every learner who does a further education and training course is given a module in sustainability, on minimising carbon footprint, and on green skills.  There is an ambition in the further education and training, FET, strategy to embed that across every FET offering.  We could do that across the entire tertiary space and, as we have heard, start embedding it at school level as well.  That is how we will start to change the dial on this.  </p></speech>

I am thinking about the education for sustainable development strategy, which is currently in development.  It addresses matters more generally.  There will be a specific skills piece.  We work closely with SOLAS and the SLMRU in identifying skills needs and addressing them.  There is a broader piece about education for sustainable development in curriculum, in further and higher education, as well as in post-primary.  This is because the industrial and technical responses to the climate challenge will be highly technical skills solutions.  Behavioural responses are also needed, where the onus is on all of us to be aware of and to understand the environmental and social impacts of our actions.  That will be important in the formation of citizens across the curriculum in higher education.  As I say, that education for sustainable development strategy is on the way.  Embeddedness in the curriculum across the board will be important for the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs.  Another example is that we are currently operating a North-South research programme, which is going to invest heavily in all-island research.  We are asking people not to just talk about a specific scientific project, but about the impact of that project on environmental sustainability, as well as on the broader UN sustainable development goals.  This maps out to European research, which I know goes a long way from leaving certificate.  However, it is the direction of travel and trajectory we are on.  Those "do no significant harm" principles underpin all kinds of public funding rounds and all kinds of proposals.  There are particular technical skills in retrofit, but the broader agenda of sustainable development is for all citizens to respond to.  For that reason, it should be embedded across curricula at all levels.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#V00400"><p>I thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly for letting me in early.  I would like to begin by asking each of the witnesses who are still here to elaborate on the question I raised earlier with the Minister.  What we can do to encourage greater participation from people with special educational needs or with disabilities into our education system and on to the workforce?</p> <p>  I was listening to the discussion earlier from my office about how useful and practical transition year work experience can be.  To give my own experience, that is where I found that I wanted to be a teacher, having worked with a disability service provider.  I was 15 or 16 years of age.  I worked there once a week over the course of a school year.  After that, I worked in a local national school.  That is where I made the decision that I wanted to be a teacher.  That pathway was obvious to me at that point because I was given that opportunity.  I had a number of friends who did the conventional apprenticeships, such as plumbing, electrics, or fabrication, in some cases.</p><p>They got a similar flavour for that and subsequently, they went on and trained in those fields.  We need to highlight the importance of TY work experience and the impression it can give people for their career paths.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that and on the importance of TY.</p><p> I want to raise apprenticeships, which we always talk about in this committee and I have listened to various witnesses discuss it.  I have gone on a tour of a few universities in recent weeks and many of the providers there spoke of our ambitious targets for apprenticeships.  When one hears the word "ambitious" being flung around, one wonders whether we can meet those targets.  I know we will have difficulties due to the Covid pandemic but certain universities and providers have difficulties with capacity, for example.  Those capacity issues have been exacerbated due to providing for social distancing, air ventilation and whatever the restrictions on capacity might be.  We need to examine how we will combat that in the short term because it will have a knock-on effect for all the schemes we are talking about in these Houses every week, be it retrofitting or whatever.</p></speech>

It is outside of my area of expertise but I note from the senior cycle review that much has been made of this particular innovation in the junior cycle where there are level 1 and level 2 programmes that are designed for students with learning disabilities in particular.  That is an important and significant innovation but what options will those people have in the senior cycle?  When we are looking beyond the junior cycle, what is the progression from level 1 and level 2 programmes?  It is on the radar in the senior cycle review, so the policymakers are looking at where useful and valuable progression routes can be provided for students from level 1 and level 2 programmes in junior cycle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#W00300"><p>I will double-check this statistic when I go back but we have 13,000 learners with disabilities currently engaged in further education and training.  A concern of ours is that there has been a decline during the period of Covid shutdown and restrictions.  People with disabilities need in-person support and when we have been relying purely on online modes of learning delivery that has suffered and it has also suffered for other groups that are most at risk of exclusion.  Specialist training provision is split.  This is the kind of dedicated provision provided by Rehab Group, for example, and then there are people with special educational needs and disabilities involved in mainstream further education and training provision.  There are two things we need to do and to get better at.  We need to make sure that if one is starting off in specialist training provision, there is a pathway to move through further education and training and into higher education.  The second part is that there is consistent learner support.  It should not matter where one presents across the country; one should have access to the same learner support that will allow one to learn and engage with one's peers and teachers and progress along that pathway.  It is not consistent at the moment and that is a big priority in the further education and training strategy.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the targets for apprenticeships are realistic.  In the last apprenticeship action plan we underestimated the lead-in time to develop new apprenticeships and so there was always a lag of about a year.  Before the pandemic we were already at over 6,000 new registrations per year and there is good news from 2021 already.  Despite the fact that we have been operating under restrictions this year, craft apprenticeships are up by 13% on 2019 levels.  As the new apprenticeships are up by about 100% on where they were in 2020, we are already seeing the growth.</p><p>We now know how long it takes to develop these new apprenticeship programmes, so moving from 6,000 to 10,000 over the five-year period is realistic.</p></speech>

I noted it when Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan mentioned it earlier.  We recently provided funding support through a special scheme for recognising performance in higher education for the expansion of the certificate in contemporary living at UCC, which I am sure the Deputy is aware of.  It looks at ways for students with intellectual disabilities to engage with higher education and their contemporary living.  We are currently discussing the outreach programme with UCC.  It will be reflective of the broader ambition of our national strategy to ensure that the student body entering and participating in higher education at all levels reflects the diversity of Ireland's population.  The programme in UCC in particular is of interest to us.  As Mr. Brownlee said, while some provision has proven challenging during the pandemic, institutions are learning from that and looking at new ways to reach out and engage in different ways with students and broader communities.  This goes back to some of the earlier points about lifelong learning.  There are additional ways of reaching out, but that is not necessarily germane to leaving certificate reform.  The important thing for us is that when students arrive in higher education that they have the supports available to them.</p></speech>

Today's agenda includes an important meeting with representatives from D&oacute;chas, Oxfam, Concern Worldwide and World Vision.  The purpose of our engagement is to discuss the potential impact and importance of decisions and pledges made at COP26 on developing countries.  I welcome our witnesses, Ms Louise Finan, head of policy, D&oacute;chas; Mr. Yousaf Jogezai, country director, Concern Worldwide, Malawi; Mr. Maurice Sadlier, programmes and policy director, World Vision Ireland; Ms Nafkote Dabi, climate change policy lead, Oxfam International; Mr. Simon Murtagh, senior policy and research co-ordinator, Oxfam Ireland; and Ms Olive Towey, senior policy advisor, Concern Worldwide.</p> <p>  We are still under some Covid restrictions.  Some members are present in the room, namely, Deputies Brady and Clarke.  Others are joining us remotely.  It is an important meeting.  I have received apologies from Senator Joe O'Reilly, who is in the Seanad chairing at present, as well as Deputy Stanton.</p> <p>  We are at beginning of what is a hugely important UN Conference of the Parties, which is taking place currently in Glasgow, Scotland.  I understand that some of our guests are joining us from COP26 in Glasgow.  I thank them, on behalf of the members of the committee, for taking the time to join us today.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the witnesses' opening statements, followed by a discussion with some questions and answers from members of the committee.  I ask the witnesses to be concise in their opening remarks.  I ask members to be concise in their questions so as to allow for an opportunity to engage and participate.  There may be a second opportunity for members to come back in if they so desire.  </p> <p>  I remind our witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are in any way potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It goes without saying that any such direction should be complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, which I see to be the case, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the precincts of the Houses.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it might apply to evidence that they give.  </p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the Houses, or any official, either by name or in such a way as to make them in any way identifiable.  Members may only participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  With that, I welcome the witnesses.  I invite Ms Finan to introduce our guests and make her opening remarks to the committee.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity, on behalf of D&oacute;chas and our members, to discuss with the committee the enormously important issue around COP26, which is currently taking place in Glasgow.</p> <p>  First, I thank all members of the committee for their engagement and support during D&oacute;chas's last meeting with them in July.  At that point, we were seeking their support for the five key asks in our pre-budget submission, in particular, the need for the Government to increase its spending on official development assistance, ODA, if it is to deliver on its Global Ireland strategy and Irish Aid&rsquo;s international development policy, A Better World.  To that end, we very much welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement of an additional allocation of &euro;140 million to ODA in 2022.  We see this as an important step towards meeting our international commitments and ensuring no one is left behind.  We were also encouraged to hear of the intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to work with his own Department and other Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to put in place systems to grow our ODA in line with the commitment of spending 0.7% by 2030. Determined progress will ensure that we meet our pledge and commit to supporting lives which have been upended by Covid-19, conflict and the ever-devastating impact of climate change.</p> <p>  Today, D&oacute;chas members are here to discuss with the committee members why COP26 is a critical moment for multilateral climate action, and to give them a sense of what meaningful action would mean for some of the world's most impacted communities.</p><p>We ask for the committee's support today to ensure Ireland addresses the climate change challenge by focusing on the actions it needs to take both domestically and internationally to ensure sustainable development is delivered for all future generations. </p><p> To that end, we welcome the Taoiseach's comments during COP26, which will be delivered today, which demonstrate we are serious about making progress towards meeting our fair share of climate finance.  When this financing is provided for the benefit of those on the front line of climate change it can have a transformative effect. </p><p> The members will have read many reports about the effects climate change is having on the poorest people in the world, how it is increasing poverty and inequality, preventable diseases, food insecurity and water stress as well as conflict over scarce natural resources.  My colleagues today from Concern Worldwide in Malawi, World Vision Ireland and Oxfam International, present at COP26, will set the scene for the members of the reality of these effects on the communities they work with and the actions they hope will be taken during COP26 and, indeed, actions the members as Irish parliamentarians can take.  </p><p> I thank the members for their attention and for their ongoing support to D&oacute;chas and its members.</p></speech>

I would like to begin by recognising the commitments made at COP26 yesterday by the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin.  Alongside the very significant financial commitments was an equally significant commitment, namely, that climate justice be at the centre of all our efforts.  The Taoiseach said "Countries and communities struggling to cope already must have our support."</p> <p>  I am speaking to the members today from Malawi and I want to share with them some of the realities here and also some good news but, first, I will deal with the realities.  Climate change, climate variability and climate related extreme events are having huge negative impacts on Malawi&rsquo;s economy and the general livelihood of its population.  The country has in the recent past experienced erratic rainfall, severe floods and droughts.  It is worth noting that Malawi&rsquo;s economy is mainly based on rain-fed agriculture, with the sector providing employment and livelihoods to more than 80% of the population, which is based in rural areas.  Malawi was in March 2019 hit by Cyclone Idai, which left a devastating path of destruction, close to 2 million people were affected and hundreds were killed.  Total effects are estimated at more than $370 million with severe damage to roads, bridges, houses, power lines, irrigation infrastructure and, sadly, to crops which were nearing maturity. </p> <p>  It is sometimes hard to take in hard facts and figures and, therefore, I want to share with the members a story about a lady we have worked with.  Her name is Sifati James.  She and her family of seven children and two parents were devastated when raging winds and rains from Cyclone Idai hit their home.  Her house was completely demolished and she lost all her belongings plus the little food she had remaining.  Before the disaster, Sifati and her family were expecting a good maize harvest but the floodwaters destroyed their half acre of land and garden that day, further plunging the family into a precarious situation. </p> <p>  Climate related events like these are only going to increase in severity in the future.  Malawi is facing a number of challenges that increase its vulnerability to climate change, including high population growth, dependence on rain-fed agriculture and high rates of undernutrition and stunting in young children.  That said, the good news is that people like Sifati are able to improve their situation in the face of a changing climate.  Following the cyclone, Sifati, with support from Concern funded by Irish Aid and other donors, received a package of support, which enabled her to get back on her feet.  A cash donation and farming inputs enabled her to meet both her immediate needs and helped her invest in the farm and grow crops to replace the lost harvest, and thousands like her have received similar assistance.</p> <p>  However, such support to help counter shocks and build back better is not always available.  In May this year one of Concern&rsquo;s climate adaptation programmes suddenly had its funding cut, which meant more than 350,000 people were immediately left without support.  Climate related funding has too often been unpredictable and erratic.  It should not be like this.  At COP15 in Copenhagen 2009, governments around the world made a commitment to allocate $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries address the impacts of climate change.  However, this commitment has never been met.  In response to this unreliable funding situation, Concern has joined with other members of civil society as well as the Malawian Government to call on OECD countries to meet their $100 billion commitment and ensure it reaches the countries most affected. </p> <p>  High income countries announced their plan for meeting the $100 billion commitment this week, but this plan only goes part of the way to addressing the problem.  Adaptation has received significantly less funding than mitigation despite a clear and urgent need to adapt to impacts that we are already seeing.  Climate finance is also not being effectively targeted at the most climate vulnerable countries.</p> <p>  People like Sifati are already experiencing the worst effects of climate change.  They have done the least to cause the problem and yet they are suffering the most.  This is deeply unfair, unjust and disproportionate. </p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s leadership, commitment and, above all, its emphasis on climate justice will be critically important in the coming days, weeks and months.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach called for a narrative of hope with a focus on solutions and on what we can achieve when we work together.  Concern stands ready to help contribute to those solutions by working together in a spirit of hope.</p> <p>  Building on the commitments made today, Ireland can, and I am sure, will be an ever stronger advocate on the issues of greatest importance for those countries and communities most affected, namely, pressing for the delivery of adequate, appropriate, accessible quality funding for adaptation and loss and damage.  I thank the members for their time and for this opportunity.</p></speech>

I also thank the members of the committee for this opportunity to appear before them.   Tomorrow morning, I travel to Glasgow with two young people from Galway to participate in COP26 and while we are there we will advocate for the greater inclusion of children and young people in the decision-making process on climate action at all levels.  We would very much have liked to have two colleagues from Tanzania join us but, unfortunately, due to Covid restrictions and massive logistics around that it was not possible.</p> <p>  As a representative of a child focused NGO, we want to see how children and young people are meaningfully engaged in decision-making processes around climate action and not left standing on the streets shouting in, but I will come back to that later.</p> <p>  The members may have seen in the news recently that Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, has appointed Africa's first chief heat officer, Eugenia Kargbo.  This is in response to the impacts of climate change and the ever rising temperatures in an already very hot city.</p> <p>  World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, is implementing a maternal and child health project on Sherbro Island in Sierra Leone.</p><p>Sherbro Island sits at the bottom of Sierra Leone and is reached by an hour-long boat journey following a seven-hour car drive from Freetown.  On my first trip to Sierra Leone, I got to sit with members of the community on Sherbro Island to talk to them about the challenges they face in their everyday lives.  There are two vehicles on Sherbro, which are two ambulances for the local hospital.  There is no power supply or running water to the island so the carbon footprint of its nearly 30,000 inhabitants is almost negligible.  When I sit with members of that community and ask them about the challenges, they tell me about their fishing grounds being washed away, their crops not growing as they used to, their growing seasons changing and the fact that they are not able to provide food for their children due to the increasing impacts of climate change.</p><p> As I was leaving Sherbro Island the next morning, my departure was delayed for two hours because of torrential downpours.  I turned to my colleague and asked what was happening as it was dry season.  He said the dry season could not be depended on any more because the seasons are changing.  That led to a very interesting discussion about how it was alright for me to be delayed for two hours because I was departing on a very strong boat, but what if a pregnant woman needed essential maternity care from the main hospital on the mainland but could not get off the island that morning.  Her life and the life of her child were being put in danger because of climate change.</p><p> What can COP26 deliver for the people of Sherbro Island and the many other communities we work with around the world?  We need to see greater ambition.  We all know the figures.  We know the world is on track for 2.5&deg;C warming and not the 1.5&deg;C that is needed.  That is disastrous for Sherbro Island, the Pacific islands and many of the places we work.  People are already feeling the impacts of climate change and we need to see much more ambition.  We need COP26 to send a clear signal that countries are moving towards a 1.5&deg;C warming target.  Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, is essential and is contributing to great progress in the sustainable development goals, SDGs, across many countries, but climate change will undermine this more and more.  We need to see greater action on climate change to be able to deliver on the SDGs.  This means greater action domestically and internationally.</p><p> We also need to see COP26 deliver on finance for vulnerable nations.  When I sit with colleagues in Sierra Leone, we have a very different discussion about the need for finance and what actions have to be taken because of climate change.  We have a high standard of living in Ireland off the back of fossil fuel development.  We have been very lucky in that regard.  We now have to change our emissions pathway and reduce our carbon emissions.  The Government of Sierra Leone, and those of many other countries, have to deliver development for their people in the absence of this fossil fuel-heavy development.  They need the funding, capacity building and support to deliver development for their communities in this new green manner.  COP26 must set a pathway forward for this.</p><p> I will go back to the issue of the participation of young people, and people in general, in climate action.  We are hearing very worrying noises from COP26 that negotiations are effectively closed to observer organisations.  The negotiations need to be open and transparent and observers need to be given access to them.  We understand the restrictions that are based on Covid.  However, we encourage Members to speak out against this closing of space for civil society.  </p><p> We had a very interesting discussion recently, moderated by the Irish ambassador to Ethiopia, Nicola Brennan, that brought together young people from Ireland, Ethiopia and Tanzania, on how young people have much to say about, and give to, climate action.  Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the young people outside COP26.  This should not be the case.  Young people need to be at the tables and part of the discussions.  They have to be there and they have to be the decision makers.  Those aged between ten and 24 years currently make up almost one quarter of the world's population.  They should not be excluded from decisions that impact their lives.  They have a right to participate.  </p><p> During the discussion with colleagues from Tanzania and Ethiopia, it was interesting to see that local government representatives in those countries are far more open to discussions with young people than those in Ireland.  It is not as easy to have access to our local councillors.  I ask this committee to consider a youth-only hearing to demonstrate leadership on this issue and show how we can lead the way in including young people in climate action in a meaningful manner. </p></speech>

These are not my words.  They are the words used by the Taoiseach when he addressed the UN Security Council this year.  He also said: &ldquo;In the Horn of Africa ... droughts are undermining coping capacities&rdquo;.  We are seeing that in our work with Oxfam right across the world and we are struggling to help communities adapt to the effects of climate change.  The need to adapt, or for adaptation, is critical to our work.  It is an honour to address the committee from COP26.  I will say a few very practical things.</p> <p>  We look on Ireland as one of the great brokers of international politics and one of the great dealmakers.  Ireland can have a huge influence, not only on the EU but on the United States.  As the committee may have heard, America is one of the main nations blocking a finance goal.  It will be a huge blow if we fail to agree on this $100 billion goal at Glasgow, not only for this year but all the years ahead.  It will mean that vulnerable nations are told, effectively, to fend for themselves in a crisis they did not create.  We also know the Biden Administration is being blocked by Congress in reaching a deal to allow the $100 billion climate finance goal.  We appeal to committee members, as Members of the Irish Parliament, to use all their influence, perhaps even by reaching out to their fellow members of parliament in America among the committees.</p> <p>  Loss and damage is another issue at these COP26 negotiations.  As its name suggests, the idea of loss and damage is an extra layer of security to compensate for the effects of extreme, and slow onset, weather events.  These are predicted to happen more as global temperature rises.  This goes beyond normal mitigation and adaptation.  Often, it falls to women to pick up the pieces of broken lives and families.  We would like to support women through the pillar of loss and damage, but we need Ireland&rsquo;s help to establish loss and damage in the COP framework and to give it a strong funding mechanism.  This is a demand that more than 300 civil society organisations, including Oxfam, have made in a letter to the COP26 president. </p> <p>  The issue of agriculture is vital from a developing country perspective, where so many of us are farmers and many of them are women.  I know Ireland faces some challenges in this area, but I have no doubt that it will support measures for sustainable agriculture at COP26.</p> <p>  Where does that leave us now, as my time runs short?  It would be wrong of me not to mention the overarching goal of this conference, which is to agree to keep the rise in global temperature to 1.5&deg;C by 2030.  Equally, I know Ireland has a plan to get there by 2030 and I have every confidence it has the vision to do that.  I urge caution, however, on the issue of the definition of net zero.  This year, Oxfam issued a major report that questioned the methodology of reaching net zero, especially if it means planting trees and biofuels in Africa that force people off their land.  Net zero must not mean a net zero-sum game for the developing world.</p> <p>  Could Ireland do more?  Of course, it could.  It is significant that the Taoiseach announced a more than doubling of Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance commitment from &euro;93 million to &euro;225 million between 2019 and 2025.  This is something that Oxfam Ireland has advocated for and it is a welcome announcement.  It should be remembered, however, that estimates for Ireland&rsquo;s fair share of climate finance contribution are between &euro;450 million and &euro;500 million so we still have a distance to travel to reach this figure.  We have also strongly advocated that any increase in climate finance does not come at the expense of other pressing ODA commitments.</p><p>Additionality is one of the core principles of climate finance.  As parliamentarians, committee members know the difference between real new money and money which is simply reallocated from one fund to another.  It is important that assurances are made that any new climate finance spending is made alongside other increases to ODA funding.</p><p> Similarly, on the question of special drawing rights from the IMF, we expect that these will be made available by Ireland to the developing world, and not fudged into existing ODA.  We hope that, again, Ireland will be a strong advocate for this among other countries.  The strength of Ireland's overseas aid and climate finance is that it is good quality, grant-based funding.  That is another message Irish negotiators can strongly convey to their counterparts at COP26.</p><p> In concluding, I repeat our main messages: adaptation over mitigation measures; grant-based financing over lending; real aid and real climate finance; support for women as farmers, providers and equal citizens.  I will stop here.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

I now turn to members of the committee, some of whom are in the committee room with us, while others are joining us from their offices.  I invite Deputy Brady to make a brief observation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021110200002#D00500"><p>I thank the witnesses that are before the committee.  I do not disagree with anything that has been said.  One of the references used by a contributor was a quote from the Taoiseach that climate change is the defining challenge of our lifetime.  We must face up to that.  While the eyes of the world are on Glasgow, with up to 30,000 delegates taking part in the deliberations, it is disappointing that some of those who need to be there are not there.  I refer to China and Russia.  We all hope for a very successful outcome.  As has been stated, it is our best and some would say probably one of our last, opportunities to keep to the 1.5&deg;C target and to keep the target alive.  The failure to take radical and ambitious actions coming out of this will have grave consequences.</p> <p>  Some of our contributors this afternoon have alluded to the unfortunate reality on the ground as a direct result of climate change.  We see that with the intensification of fires, which are gripping the entire world at this point, the floods and the change of seasons, which was graphically touched on.  We simply cannot rely on having a wet season any more.  Unfortunately, the consequences of that is famine, which is now gripping the world and spreading at a frightening pace.  This is the stark reality.  We hear of some countries that simply will not exist in 20 years' time if we do not immediately address and live up to the radical and ambitious plans that are needed.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to a couple of points Mr. Sadlier made about young people.  I concur with everything he said on the need for young people's voices to be heard.  Young people have been to the fore of this movement in trying to force people like us to take action.  When I say "us", I mean politicians in this country.  I remember the movements and the protests that took place outside this institution.  That was fired up by activists such as Greta Thunberg, who has inspired so many young people across the world.  It was disappointing to hear some of the commentary from her at COP26.  She said it was "blah, blah, blah" that was going in inside, and that it was people pretending to take the future seriously.  While I do not disagree with that, it is unfortunate that young people are not in there participating and having their voices heard as well.  There is a lot of concern about what is being said.</p> <p>  I listened to Mary Robinson as well, who is watching and listening with worry and hope, as to what may come out of COP26.  We need to be ambitious.  The world is eagerly waiting to see what happens over the course of the deliberations.  Mr. Sadlier suggests having a youth-only hearing.  I am not sure whether he was referring to this committee, but as a committee member I am really up for that.  Prior to Covid, in the previous D&aacute;il term, the Ceann Comhairle had a number of hearings within the Oireachtas that involved young people coming in and making their views known.  I would be open to that, if that is what has been suggested by Mr. Sadlier.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to have the opportunity to engage with them again.  I have a couple of observations and questions to put to the witnesses.  I will start with Mr. Sadlier.  He should please not think that this is anything to do with him personally.  It is just that a couple of statements in his presentation struck me.  One such statement was: "The changing climate is making people's right to food impossible to realise."  If that does not hit home, I am not sure what will.  He also stated: "Poverty makes her vulnerable, but climate change is affecting her right to health".  That is a stark warning from Sierra Leone.  I was following the proceedings from COP26 this morning.  Mr. Sadlier referred to the lack of a carbon footprint in Sierra Leone.  It is not the only country that does not have a carbon footprint, but it is suffering hugely because of the carbon footprint and actions of others and climate change in total.</p> <p>  A contributor mentioned the conflict over scarce resources.  What effect is that having in the countries in which the witnesses work on the political, health and education systems and what is the societal impact of the conflict over scarce resources?  I agree with what Deputy Brady said earlier.  We need actions not words.  That is what I hear when I speak to the younger members of my constituency in Longford-Westmeath.  It is actions not words that they want.  What does that look like from the perspective of the witnesses?  Is there a timescale that the witnesses could put on this, whereby the impact of the failure to act now could be reversed?  I understand the point about the coping capacity that is affected by the drought but that simply is not good enough.  Every country should continue to grow, develop and strengthen itself.  If what we are speaking about is a country's ability to cope, then the bar is set very low for us as politicians and legislators to put solutions in place.  Time is not on our side.  It is getting very close to the tipping point and where the bar that will be set for developing countries is a level of coping as opposed to a level of strengthening and developing.</p></speech>

It was fascinating to listen to the presentations of the witnesses.  I have one question about the expectation of state actors going to COP26.</p><p>Do we get any sense that states are going there to act as global citizens or are we still in the mould of 20th century diplomacy whereby individual countries are representing their own interests?  Is more of a global approach being taken?  I heard the announcement today regarding deforestation and countries that had previously not signed up to preventing deforestation are now doing so.  Is that something we are hopeful about or is lip service being paid?  Is global citizenship happening at COP26 or it is a return to 20th century diplomacy?</p></speech>

We are hoping for everyone to come together but, of course, countries are coming here to represent their issues and interests.  Deputy Clarke have touched upon the issue.  For developing countries, their interests relate to limiting warming to 1.5&deg;C, which will be critical.  However, they are also keen for that to happen based on a fair share and equity because rich countries have historical responsibility and so on.  There are, of course, differences between countries in terms of protecting their interests.  Some of that is understandable, but we must come across these issues.  Everyone is impacted by the crisis.  We used to talk about countries in the global south and drought in the Horn of Africa or in Madagascar, as is the case now, but we also saw flooding in Germany this summer.  Oxfam protested yesterday in an effort to bring the public with us and put pressure on leaders and so on.  We hope to create a global village at COP26 and come up with concrete actions.</p></speech>

This is not a specific response to what has been asked but I will return to what was said by Deputy Brady.  Young people are fed up, annoyed and tired of how slow the response has been.  I recently met an impressive young woman from Kenya who said that young people's voices in climate change must move from the streets to the halls where decisions are made and change happens.  Young people are sick of being left on the outside while lip service is being paid on the inside.  The media coverage of COP26 has been brilliant.  I have never known a COP meeting to get so much media coverage, but I am also asking how much bluster is happening there.  There has really been a lot of big talk but we need action now.  Deputy Clarke asked when we need to see action and we need it now.  In fact, it is already too late for some places.  I have met people from Papua New Guinea who have had to move their entire community from their island because it is going under.  People are already losing their homes.  They have left behind the graveyards where their ancestors are buried.  They have had to move because of climate change.  It is too late for some communities.  They will never recover.  We need to make sure we do not continue to let that happen.</p> <p>  I had the privilege to work for Mary Robinson for three and a half years, at which time I got to meet many people who told desperate stories of how their lives were impacted by climate change.  I have been working in development for 15 years now and it is not getting better for some people.  In fact, it is getting worse.  Climate change is eroding everything.  If you look at recent reports coming out of South Sudan and you look at security, people are being displaced because of floods which are a direct impact of climate change, which is causing conflict.  People are on the move because of climate change.  It is happening here and now.  We can no longer continue to wait, we must take action.  That means providing the finance, capacity building and support for our official development assistance, plus our support for increased climate finance.  It also means taking serious action at home.  What right do I have to sit in Dublin, burning coal and driving my fossil fuel car, when my friends on Sherbro Island are sinking?  That is the challenge we must face.  We really need to cop on now.  We do not have time.</p></speech>

Within the report, we refer to a toxic cocktail of the climate crisis, the Covid-19 and violent conflicts.  Those forces are having a negative impact on the hunger situation in the world.  Violent conflicts are becoming  increasingly severe and protracted, and are destructive to virtually every aspect of the food system.  Climate change is one of the major contributors to insecure food access.  The rise in hunger is among the most pressing challenges of our time and requires decisive and sustained actions.</p> <p>  We can see, even in some of the major conflicts in the world, that the roots are in the move towards climate change.  There have been limited responses from governments that have limited capacity and resources.  There has also been a lack of action from the international community.  We feel there is an urgency that should be dealt with through immediate actions.</p></speech>

Forgive me if I am the only person in the room who is not familiar with the term "chief heat officer" in public administration.  There was a reference to Africa's chief heat officer, who was appointed in Sierra Leone.  Mr. Sadlier might expand a little on the nature of the work of the chief heat officer, the manner of the appointment and the public reaction to the appointment.  Would he anticipate other affected states and countries following suit?  COP26 will obviously deal with a range of issues touching on personal, national and international responsibility.  Even if money were to be made available to the chief heat officer, how would it be spent in a place such as Sierra Leone?  I make the point to highlight the enormity of the task across a range of issues.  Does Mr. Sadlier feel that the office of the chief heat officer is something we will hear much more about in forthcoming times?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021110200002#E00900"><p>I wish I had read more about the job of the chief heat officer.  My understanding is that the person in question is looking at the impact of climate change on the city and how they can plan for a city that is being impacted by climate change, including consideration of what sort of public planning needs to be done, what sort of services are in place, how the population can be protected against increasing heat and what sort of measures can be put in place.  I understand that while it is the first role of its sort in Africa, there is a chief heat officer in Athens as well.  It is symptomatic of the bigger challenge around climate change, that is, loss and damage.  This takes us into the realm of loss and damage.  Countries are having to deal with the severe impacts of climate change.  Even if we stop carbon emissions today, many of the countries with which we work are already feeling the impact of climate change so we will need adaptation funding for many years to come.</p><p>In many places, we are in the realm of loss and damage.  All these roles are symptomatic of it being too late or too far down the track for some countries.  I am not advocating for funding of a chief heat officer for the entire world but that shows innovation.  It shows how Sierra Leone is looking at the challenges it is facing.</p><p> That is what we seeing from many of the countries we work in.  Malawi, Ethiopia and the marginal islands have some of the most ambitious climate action plans in the world.  Their road to net zero or to carbon-free development is far better than those of many of the developing nations that have huge resources behind them.  This is what many of the countries we work with have to do with funding because of the impact of climate change.</p><p> I forgot to respond to Deputy Brady.  We would love this committee to have a child-only meeting.  It should not be me sitting here today but rather one of the young people I am attending COP26 with, if I was really practising what I preach.  We are hoping to have some of the young people who participate in our project from Tanzania early next year.  It would be great to have a discussion with them and colleagues in Galway.  I am sure many other agencies in D&oacute;chas have many young people and children we work with.  It would be a real show of leadership regarding how to listen to young people.</p></speech>

Given that our guests are busy both at the conference and monitoring from afar what is happening in these crucial few days in Scotland, I might ask Ms Finan to bring matters to a conclusion by summing up or providing us with her best and final message.  We too will look forward to the publication later this week of the national statement on Ireland's further engagement.  I acknowledge what she said about the additional budgetary allocation of &euro;140 million for our development assistance.  She mentioned the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy's, plan to map a route towards the 0.7% figure.  I assure our guests this committee will also monitor the plan and will have regular opportunities to engage directly with him to ensure Ireland will fulfil this long-standing commitment, which, unfortunately, is often less than certain.  We were very pleased when the Minister of State expressed to this committee his intention to proceed by way of a definite plan.  We will assist our guests in that regard.</p></speech>

I wanted to come in on some of Deputy O'Callaghan's questions about what is happening at COP26 and what sense of urgency there is among the negotiators.  I might add to my colleague Ms Dabi's comments that there is a healthy sense of competition among nations because they are being pushed by the protestors outside and the activists, whom we see as our supporters in Oxfam and the people we work with throughout the world.  We mentioned loss and damage in our submission.  There is a sense of competition even between Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon, whereby Scotland is trying to move faster than the UK, which has made the most ambitious pledges thus far.  On the issue of loss and damage, Ms Sturgeon came out with the first significant pledge of any country to fund loss and damage, which we see as vital as a policy area.  It is a way of financing people who have been hit by extreme weather events throughout the world and who have no other recourse to protection other than this fund for loss and damage.  That is something we would like the committee to convey to the Irish negotiators.  We need to create a funding mechanism for loss and damage.</p> <p>  The other point we made, in the context of hard policy goals, relates to the pledge of $100 billion in climate finance.  It is, in a way, an emblematic goal but it has existed for 11 or 12 years and we are still not getting there.  It is our understanding that the US is the main stumbling block and in particular the Houses of Congress, as we mentioned.  We reiterate Ireland is the great broker of deals internationally, so if there is anything our members as negotiators or brokers can do to convey that to the appropriate committee on Capitol Hill, or in general to convey that sense of urgency to our American friends, that would be good.</p> <p>  That is how we read it here among Oxfam and the Irish delegation at COP26.</p></speech>

In Malawi, a couple of months ago, in advance of COP 26, there were several engagements between the youth, the Malawian Government and civil society organisations.  The main issue that arose related to the lack of financing for countries such as Malawi to cope with climate change.  It is often said that within Malawi, only 10% of the population has access to electricity and that is hydro-powered.  As a country, therefore, we are not contributing to climate change but we are the worst affected.  Since the economy is so small, it is difficult for countries such as Malawi or others in a similar position to adapt.</p> <p>  Based on suggestions from young people and civil society organisations, we started a Twitter campaign to advocate for a fund of $100 billion for climate change.  It has gone viral within Malawi.  There have been tweets from ministers, various embassies and UN agencies, which has given voice to the civil society organisations and young people there to allow them to contribute.  Some of the same young people are attending COP 26 in Glasgow, where they will interact with young people from Ireland.  That is a good example of how we are able to create links between young people in our country's programmes and in Ireland.</p></speech>

It has been wonderful to get this opportunity.  I do not think I can put anything more passionately or strongly than our speakers did.  They have given the committee good reason to understand the urgency of why we need to act.  We ask it to continue to follow this issue closely.  Post COP 26, it should organise a session to which it invites in the Government and civil society to analyse what happened at the conference, what needs to happen and what the impact will be.  That is our key ask from today.  I thank members for their time, attention and focus on one of the greatest issues facing mankind.</p></speech>

I am Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer in the mental health unit, and I am accompanied by Ms Doyle in person and Mr. Kelly online, both of whom work full time on the Bill.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 was progressive for its time.  Over the past two decades, however, there has been a fundamental shift in how we view mental health as a society and how we provide treatment to people with mental health conditions.  This meant the operation of the Act needed to be reviewed and updated.  The purpose of the general scheme is to move the Act towards empowering people accessing mental health services to make decisions about their own healthcare insofar as possible.</p><p>While it may be necessary to provide for involuntary detention in the future, the general scheme seeks to bring this practice in line with Ireland's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy.</p><p> The initial review began with a comprehensive public consultation and, following this, an expert review group was established.  The group drew on expertise from the fields of psychiatry, law and people with lived experience of mental health services.  The group published its report in 2015 and included 165 recommendations, most of which related to legislative changes.  The Department has been progressing a review of the Act over the past number of years, which has included extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, as well as a public consultation earlier this year during which 100 submissions were received.  The review of the Act also considered Ireland's commitments under the UN CRPD, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as more recent domestic legislation, particularly the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018.  </p><p> There are nearly 130 heads in the general scheme and the proposed amendments touch on every aspect of the Act.  The briefing documents provided to the committee set out an overview of the proposed changes to each section.  I will highlight some of the most significant changes.  The general scheme replaces the existing paternalistic best-interests principle in section 4 with a set of guiding principles for adults and children.  All people will be presumed to have capacity in line with the 2015 capacity Act and, for those who lack capacity, these guiding principles set out how decisions are made about their care and treatment.  For children, best interests will continue to be the primary consideration in line with commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p><p> The process of involuntary detention has been updated.  In line with Sharing the Vision and our commitments under the UN CRPD, involuntary detention should only be used as a last resort.  While under the existing Act detention can take place on the basis of risk or treatment, the Bill will ensure that treatment is part of the basis for all cases of involuntary detention.  Furthermore, the Bill will provide for all applications for involuntary detention to be made by authorised officers.  </p><p> The approach to consent to treatment has been completely revised to take account of a person's capacity in line with the 2015 capacity Act, moving towards a model where each individual is more involved as a co-decision maker in his or her care and treatment.  The limited circumstances where treatment without consent can be given have been clearly defined in the general scheme. </p><p> The Mental Health Commission's regulatory remit will be extended beyond approved centres to encompass all residential mental health facilities and mental health services.  In future, all mental health facilities and services will, therefore, be registered, regulated and inspected by the commission.  </p><p> A new Part has been introduced setting out the process of admission and consent to treatment for children, introducing capacity and consent for young people and mirroring safeguards for adults under the Act for children, such as the right to information.  The Bill will provide for the presumption of capacity for all young people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to mental health treatment.  This will bring parity between mental health and physical health on consent, as the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act provides for people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to medical treatment. </p><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Department are keen to see the Bill introduced to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  We will continue to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, over the coming months to prepare the Bill.  We look forward to continuing to work with this committee as it carries out pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS.  I thank committee members for their time and I am happy to take questions. </p></speech>

I do not usually talk about personal matters but I got my wisdom teeth out and I am very sore at the moment.  I am here on a listening brief more than anything else.  I appreciate the officials coming in.  The reason I am here is that I see the importance of the committee getting this kind of grounding in the Mental Health Act.  It is very important to get those foundations in place.</p> <p>  I have one question.  I welcome the fundamental shift there has been in how we, as a society, see mental health issues now compared with the past.</p><p>There was a dark age in the past when people with mental health issues were not treated as well as they should have been.  People like that involuntarily being taken out of society seemed to be the norm rather than the exception.  We need modern and up-to-date legislation on that.  Our briefing note states that the Mental Health Commission will be asked to inspect all mental health facilities.  What facilities will that include and what facilities were not being inspected previously?</p></speech>

There are around 60 of those and the commission has a programme of inspection to visit all of those annually.  It is proposed that once the Act has been brought in, the Mental Health Commission will have powers to inspect all other kinds of mental health facilities such as day services and other types of residences.  I do not know the numbers offhand but perhaps my colleague, Mr. Kelly, can give us more detail on that.</p></speech>

It can inspect anywhere it chooses to but it can only regulate and register inpatient facilities.  Under the updated Act, it will be able to inspect, enter and register day hospitals, 24-hour residences that are nurse-led, step-down facilities and, eventually, all services, including the likes of Jigsaw and any counselling services that provide mental health services on behalf of the State.  The scope of how far that will go is a discussion we will have with the Mental Health Commission as those powers come into force.</p></speech>

It is a big undertaking to do that so that is something we will have to work on.  I refer to the provision for 16 and 17-year-olds to refuse or consent to their own mental health treatment.  What is the difference between what is provided for in the heads of Bill and what was in place previously?</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I also congratulate and thank them for the work they do on behalf of society.</p> <p>  I return to the point Deputy Ward raised about funding.  It is a regular occurrence that legislation passed by these Houses in good faith and for good reason, namely, to improve people's lives, does not get acted on to the level we would expect.  Has the Department done costings and agreed budgets?</p> <p>  On the timeline for passing this legislation, is there a particular time by which we can expect inspections to take place and the various sections of the Bill to be implemented?  Will some elements be implemented and others not implemented?  Is there a commitment or a timeline set out for the implementation of the legislation and a budgetary framework to ensure that when it is enacted, the Mental Health Commission will exercise these powers and be given real teeth?</p></speech>

To give a short answer, we do not have a specific plan yet because we are at an early stage in the drafting of the legislation.  We have to wait for it to be passed.</p><p>We have a very good relationship with the commission.  It has the resources it needs to conduct the current programme of inspections.  I would not envisage that we would have a situation where we would give the Mental Health Commission a series of responsibilities without taking into account the funding and resources it would need.  I would rather not tempt fate and say this is what we plan to do and when we plan to do it.</p></speech>

The legislation will be framed to give the commission the powers it clearly needs.  I imagine there must be even an aspirational plan.</p></speech>

The commission has a programme of inspections based on a range of criteria.  I presume it knows how long it takes for each inspection, and it has resources assigned to it.  Going forward, I would have thought that as we extend the commission's remit based on the legislation and regulations that there may well be different formats of investigation or inspection depending on the type of facility.  Perhaps I am splitting hairs here, but I do not think it would be fair to say that based on this costing, this is how much we envisage that another thing would cost in the future.</p></speech>

In terms of the knowledge of the legislation, are there any concerns about what is omitted from it?  Does it address all of the concerns and aspirations of the Department?  Is Mr. Hempenstall concerned about any element of the legislation?  The Bill will be debated and, potentially, amended?  Is there anything Mr. Hempenstall wants to share with us that we should be trying to police as best we can as legislators?</p></speech>

I will invite Mr. Kelly to contribute in a moment.  No legislation is ever complete.  We fully expect to have unknowns and knowns arise as we go forward in terms of drafting.  That is the nature of the beast.  As a Department, we are happy.  It has been a long process.  We have covered an awful lot of bases in the Bill and it does represent a significant advance on what we had before.  I cannot say we have covered everything in absolute detail, but I am confident that with the input from the PLS in the committee, the consultation we have done and will be doing, and with the work of the OPC and the Attorney General's office, we have a good piece of legislation to bring before the Oireachtas and then we will have Committee Stage, at which point any amendments can be debated.  I do not mean to sound as if I am trying to be smart but we are looking forward to the process because it is only through those questions and answers that we get to a decent piece of legislation.  Perhaps Mr. Kelly would like to add something.</p></speech>

The original drafting of the general scheme was based on a 2015 Government decision, which was to give effect to those 165 recommendations of the expert group.  Time has moved on since 2015 as well.  In 2018, we ran it by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015 as well.  What we have been trying to do with this piece of legislation it to take all of the recommendations from the expert group on board and also to be aware of the significant developments that have happened in the field since then.  Over the past two to two and a half years, we have also had a lot of consultation with some of the key stakeholders and we have been building relationships with organisations in the NGO sector and with professional groupings, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and the Mental Health Commission.  As Mr. Hempenstall said, we are never going to catch everything in one piece of legislation or at least not with the first stab, but what it does reflect is the broad-based consultation that we have carried on in recent years.  We are happy with the shape the Bill is in right now but I am sure that something will come up during PLS or on Committee Stage that will give us a further opportunity to consider.</p></speech>

I had to leave the meeting for a couple of seconds so I apologise if any of my questions have been already asked.  In regard to the expert group not making a recommendation for an independent route for the making of a complaint, is there a reason for that?  Mental Health Reform is firm in its opinion that there should be an independent route for making complaints to ensure parity between mental and physical health.  Will the opportunity be taken to look at that again?</p></speech>

There are sections within the draft general scheme - at least three of them - relating to the provision of information to people.  They provide for people to receive information on complaints procedures in whatever approved inpatient facility they are in.  Under the draft general scheme, the remit of the Inspector of Mental Health Services has been expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and services.  There is inspection already provided for and the general scheme provides for additional expansion.  The Office of the Ombudsman has a role in investigating complaints in the HSE as well.  That is where we are on that.  Mr. Kelly might like to add something.</p></speech>

Our discussions have been pretty productive to date.  It is an ongoing conversation in developing the final draft of the Bill.</p> <p>  On the issue of parity of esteem, the Ombudsman is open to anyone who accesses services through the HSE.  Any person who wishes to make a complaint or have a complaint against the HSE investigated can do so regardless of whether it is for a disability service, mental health service or physical health service.  At the moment, that is open to anyone who accesses services through the HSE on an equal basis regardless of what service is being accessed.</p> <p>  On mental health, the Inspector of Mental Health Services, which sits within the Mental Health Commission, has a significant role under the Act in terms of its functions and in meeting with anyone in a mental health facility who, during the course of an inspection, asks to meet with it.  It is not exactly an independent complaints mechanism but, taken together, the inspector and the Office of the Ombudsman already perform a function similar to that which an independent complaints mechanism might perform.</p> <p>  As stated by Mr. Hempenstall, the conversation channel remains open.  We met recently with Mental Health Reform and we will continue to meet with it on the development of the draft Bill.  I am sure it will be a discussion that we will continue to have in the future.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly stated that it is in effect the same elsewhere but if we are drafting legislation, why not make it not just in effect the same but actually the same?  I am sure we will come across this issue again as we move along.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing what engagement took place with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in terms of this legislation, in particular how it interacts with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Has the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth had sight of the draft Bill given the crossover with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015?  I am sure there are other areas in respect of which there will also be a crossover.  Has the Department of Health been working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this legislation?</p></speech>

At the moment, most of the revisions related to children are contained within section 25 of the existing Act.  We are expanding that out in Part 8 to give its own stand-alone section, make clear what the protections for children are and set those out in statute.</p><p>We engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs early in the process.  In December 2019, I think, we gave that Department the initial draft of Part 8 and provisions relating to children elsewhere.  We had a good working relationship with the Department over the year and a half that it took for us to get from that point to the point of publication.</p><p> When the responsibilities for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth we worked with the latter Department on the 2015 Act.  We are very keen to make sure that the Mental Health Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act are aligned correctly.  From our discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, I know it is keen to ensure we get this right as well.  This matter has been very much at the forefront of our minds.  We are very lucky to have had a fruitful engagement with that Department on both the children and capacity sides over the past 18 months or so.</p></speech>

Does the inclusion of these sorts of measures in this legislation conflict with Sharing the Vision?  Obviously, restraints are seen as a last resort.  If we strive to have the best and broadest mental health legislation, should there not be zero restraints?  The legislation and the Sharing the Vision policy do not seem to be aligned.  Again, all of these matters will be teased out as we go along.</p></speech>

The policy and the legislation are, therefore, very much entwined with each other.  Sharing the Vision is a ten-year strategy and nine years of it remain.  We have included the parts on restrictive practices and tried to bring in some additional safeguards.  There is an understanding that we want to minimise restraint as much as possible, to the point where we will no longer need it.  It is a stepping down process, however, and additional resources, training and so forth must be put into place in approved centres to ensure that all staff and residents feel safe.  Over the lifetime of Sharing the Vision, we will move towards a "zero restraint, zero seclusion" policy but, for the interim, it is important to include safeguards.  As the Senator said, we have to provide for last-resort scenarios.  While we are heading towards the policy, we are not there yet so we must provide for these at some level.  What we are trying to do is ensure there are safeguards in place while it is still permitted.</p></speech>

Mr. Hempenstall stated the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Department are keen to see the Bill introduced to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  How can the committee undertake pre-legislative scrutiny when we do not have the legislation in front of us?  It is going to be a difficult job for us.  Will the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel liaise with the clerk to the committee?  Will Mr. Hempenstall feed back our concerns?  What is the timeframe for the legislation?  Mr. Hempenstall used the term "as soon as possible".  Given the delay in amending and commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, I am worried that we are being rushed into this pre-legislative scrutiny when we only have the heads of a Bill.</p></speech>

What we have is a fairly comprehensive general scheme in which many of the legislative provisions are already written up.  It is with the Office of the Attorney General at the moment.  I cannot say I have done pre-legislative scrutiny before but we would not engage in this process without trying to take into account what the committee says.</p><p>We have had the consultation and a lot of time has gone by.  There was another round of top-up consultation.  I would expect that, as part of this process, if the subcommittee raised concerns we would try to take them into account in conjunction with the drafting process being undertaken by the Attorney General.  As I said, things will always arise that we did not foresee.  There may well be drafting issues associated with particular provisions too.  It is a kind of living process.  What I tried to get across in my opening statement was that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, want to move the legislation forward as quickly as possible but not in the sense of guillotining any debate.  It is a huge piece of legislation with significant pieces of policy at the top and a lot of technical things at the bottom.  They are all important and they all need to get done.  It is an interesting piece of legislation from that perspective.  There is momentum behind getting it done now, but that is not to shorten any process of consideration.  </p><p> Earlier, the Senator asked about costings and I said I did not have any.  I see from my note that the Mental Health Commission did supply us with its own estimates and figures.  I will send the information that we have from the commission to the Senator.  The Department has not agreed any figures or plans.  That part of my answer is right.</p></speech>

I have an idea in my head and maybe I am wrong.  It seems to me that the subcommittee is bringing in witnesses to talk about heads of Bill but they do not even know what the Bill is.  We are not sure what the Bill is.  That detail is very important if we are going to do pre-legislative scrutiny.  Is there any idea when we will see the full Bill, when it will be done and dusted?</p></speech>

I would not envisage our moving significantly beyond any of the major policy issues or the technical things either.  I do not think it is valid to say that we do not know how it is.  There is a fairly significant briefing document to go along with the heads.  If the subcommittee has queries about particular aspects, that is what this process is for.  I know Mr. Kelly has been liaising with the clerk as well on how long the pre-legislative scrutiny process with take and that will feed into the timetable for doing the Bill.  The timeframe is not entirely within our gift.  There are 15 other Departments with legislation and who knows what 2022 will bring?  I wanted to convey that there is energy and momentum behind this.  We want to move ahead and get it done as quickly as reasonably possible.</p></speech>

Senator Hoey mentioned the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  That passed through the Oireachtas in 2015, six years ago, and it has not been implemented.  What is the knock-on effect of that?  If it was implemented, what effect would it have on this legislation?  This might have been answered but I would like it clarified for myself.</p></speech>

Had the 2015 Act been fully commenced any time before now it would not have a direct impact on the Mental Health Act prior to 2018 because many of the provisions of the 2015 Act do not apply to people receiving treatment under the Mental Health Act.  I believe that was written into that Act at the time because the review of the Mental Health Act had already begun and they wanted the process to continue, so that down the line the two Acts would dovetail and align when the updated Mental Health Act came in.</p><p>We have aligned a lot of our understanding with what the capacity and the decision-making supports are - all of the things contained in the 2015 Act.  We have aligned those in the updated Mental Health Act or that is what we hope to do.  Fully commencing the Act will rely on a fully commenced capacity Act but I expect this to happen next year and I hope that depending on how the legislative process goes, sections of our Act would begin to be commenced in 2023.  Hopefully, the timelines should add up.  That is certainly what we are working towards.  </p></speech>

I like the extension of who is going to police all of this and the extra powers in it.  The witnesses spoke about capacity within the Act but we also need capacity within the system to complement the Act.  I have not gone through all these amendments, although I have gone through an awful lot of them.  The board is being given a lot more power and there are fines so it will push people into a bit of responsibility.  I got down to page 193 this morning but I will read it over and over again.  In respect of protected disclosures and giving people power within the system, that must be addressed.</p> <p>  If this Government falls within 12 or 24 months, does this work fall as well?  That is my biggest fear.  It has taken such a long time to get to this and there are a lot of very strong and positive recommendations in it.  It is grand to have them all down on paper but it is about how we get the urgency to get them enacted.  A Bill can be passed in these Houses but, unfortunately, it can sit on the shelf for a while before anything happens to it.  My only concern is how we move it on and get the recommendations in place.  At the same time, do we need to do something running parallel to this to complement the services that will be needed because this committee is well aware of it?  We talk about improvements in mental health services here yet in my home town, a mental health centre is being closed.  Pardon the pun but this is lunacy when we are in the middle of a pandemic.  A centre that worked perfectly and never had a case of Covid or a suicide must close because having decided not to put money into it in the past number of years, the HSE is now saying the building is at fault and is trying to move patients out of it.  We are here trying to improve mental health services and responsibilities.  The Bill talks about the responsibilities of proprietors.  I welcome anything positive but my two biggest fears concern whether it moves on swiftly enough to get the Bill enacted.  I would be optimistic.  The two Ministers support us.  Normally, one meets a lot of opposition with the Department of Justice.  It is the one that seems to slow down mental health stuff a lot.  I would be very anxious to move this on but if something must run in parallel to complement the services, will it be enough?  The other point concerns electro-convulsive therapy, ECT.  I have not reached it yet but I am worried about it.  Must it exist in this country in 2021?  However, that is a question for another day.  </p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Kelly to address those questions because they are substantive issues relating to the legislation.  All I can say is that I am not thinking about a change of Government.  We are just trying to get on with the job of moving this forward as quickly as we reasonably can taking into account the Chairman's views in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p> In relation to the centre to which the Deputy referred, that is an operational decision made by the HSE.  In my view, the legislation is the framework and the operations are the muscles to get the whole thing going.  The two are related but they are separate.</p><p> It is positive that the remit of the Mental Health Commission will be expanded.  Mental health services are an important part of the health service and they should be regulated just like other health services.  The improvement of our mental health services under Sharing the Vision is proceeding as quickly as possible.  As Mr. Kelly said, we are only in the first year but my colleagues in the unit are working very hard on that with their colleagues in the HSE.  I do not need to rehearse the fact that we had another record budget for mental health services.  The impetus and momentum is there and for my own part, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, I can say that the energy and enthusiasm are genuine and substantive.  I will invite Mr. Kelly to respond now to the points raised.</p></speech>

What we were trying to do with that was to bring the governance of the commission and the related corporate aspects in line with good governance in other public sector bodies.  A lot of improvements have been made over the last 20 years and we tried to mirror those in that Part.  This would include protected disclosures.  I do not know if we have actually included an explicit reference to them but anyone making a protected disclosure relating to a public sector body would be protected.  Staff in the commission would be protected as would staff in the HSE or a Department.  That said, we can look at this further if the committee believes it is something that requires more thought in the context of the final Bill.</p> <p>  Electroconvulsive therapy or ECT has been retained in the Act and we have updated the measures related to it.  My understanding is that ECT in 2021 is not the ECT that we know from popular culture, as in the film "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".  It has developed hugely in the intervening 50 years and is now regarded as quite an effective treatment for certain types of mental health conditions.  We are retaining it because it does have some clinical value.  The committee could invite clinicians or representative bodies for health professionals who would be more qualified to speak on this but it is my understanding that ECT is an effective treatment and that is why we have decided to retain it.</p></speech>

I just want to put on the record that the protected disclosures system is not just weak but is absolutely flat.  Unfortunately, in my experience, those who have made protected disclosures within the mental health system have been penalised.  One issue in particular has never been properly resolved.  The individual ticked all of the boxes and went all the way up through the system.  The protected disclosure eventually reached a Minister but it was dismissed.  I wanted to flag this issue because while there is excellent work going on in the mental health services, there is also wrongdoing and when people come out and tell the truth, they are not being protected and the issues are not being resolved.</p></speech>

I cannot think of any more important work for us this year than the oversight of this legislation.  It is an incredibly important piece of work and I thank our witnesses for taking the time to bring us through the general scheme.  I am in the same position as Deputy Buckley in terms of only starting this conversation.  It will take a lot of granular work to get through all of this because there is a lot of information here.  In that context, I will try to use my time to contextualise some of the issues for myself.</p> <p>  In the documentation provided and in some of the briefings we had previously, there is some discussion on this issue but from the witnesses' perspective, what are the other key pieces of legislation with which this legislation will interact?</p><p>What else should we reference when we debate this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#K00200"><p>I might answer that question.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is probably that which is most influential on our legislation.  Unfortunately, it is very complex and I struggle to get my head around it sometimes.  The provisions in the 2015 Act are probably the most important to the update of the Mental Health Act and to the idea of co-decision making and empowering people accessing mental health services.</p> <p>  Another important Act is the Child Care Act 1991.  In the existing Mental Health Act, section 25, as I mentioned, deals mainly with the treatment of children and references the Child Care Act, which I understand is being reviewed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  One recommendation of the expert group was to move all the cross-references to the Child Care Act into the Mental Health Act in order that if someone is reading the latter Act, he or she will not have to cross-reference it against other Acts and it will be as simple as legislation can be in that regard.  We have included those provisions in the Bill but the Child Care Act is always useful to refer back to.</p> <p>  Finally, there is some reference in the Act to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which came from the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is another Act it would be good to be familiar with.</p></speech>

In respect of the domestic legislation, does the Department envisage that on the conclusion of this work, there will be amendments to the Acts Mr. Kelly mentioned?</p></speech>

There are certain provisions, between the two Acts, that will have to be amended in either our amending Bill or its amending Bill, although that Department hopes to enact and commence its legislation sooner than we do.  There is ongoing conversation between the two Departments as to which is the better vehicle and which is the better timeframe to get those amendments in.

They loomed large in our minds as we drafted the heads.  The European Convention on Human Rights is another document we referred to, and there are a couple of others.  It might be easier for me to revisit the list I have, which I can send on to the committee secretariat for circulation, to ensure I do not miss anything.</p></speech>

To return to the criminal law aspect, I have been reading through the documentation but Mr. Kelly might flag where we are introducing issues that relate more specifically to the justice area and include aspects of criminal law or criminal accountability.  The Department may wish to send further detail to the committee later but Mr. Kelly might just flag a few areas for us now.  Where are we introducing or amending issues that deal with criminality?</p></speech>

Nevertheless, if someone who is detained in the Central Mental Hospital for a fixed custodial term under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act continues to need treatment as he or she is coming to the end of that term, that is, if he or she is not well enough to be let out into the community, there is currently no direct path of access for that person to be admitted to the Central Mental Hospital under the Mental Health Act.</p><p>It is necessary to be transferred to another approved centre and be transferred back.  It can be just a little messy.  We are providing for direct entry for people who continue to need treatment and are coming to the end of their term, so that they will be able to be assessed like anyone else under the Mental Health Act, and they will be able to be directly admitted to the Central Mental Hospital as a person under the Mental Health Act rather than under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  That is one of the big changes.  It is not changing anything fundamental but makes the path into the Central Mental Hospital a bit easier for those people, especially in what might be a time of transition and stress.  We are also looking at setting out specific regulations around designated centres.  The only designated centre in the country at the moment is the Central Mental Hospital.  We are setting out specific standards and regulations for those centres.</p></speech>

Are any of the issues around criminal liability in respect of proprietors?  For example, if somebody engaged with the mental health tribunals who should not have been there and was committing fraud, are there any criminal aspects to do with placing criminal liability on a person in management, administration or oversight?  It is hard to phrase this nicely, but if such a person does not do the right thing, is there any criminal liability introduced there?</p></speech>

We have included additional safeguards so that the registered proprietor or the person in charge of a centre could be liable to be guilty of a crime and be liable to a custodial sentence or a fine if found to be guilty.  Those have already existed in relation to seclusion and restraint but we are expanding it so that a person running an approved centre and it is not registered with the Mental Health Commission that person will be guilty of a crime for that reason.  We have included some additional safeguards to protect against fraudulent-----</p></speech>

One of the areas I read in detail was on involuntary admission which I know will garner more attention that other aspects.  Some issues it raised for me are more general questions.  One of the issues around involuntary admission is how long it lasts, how one is directed to it, and whether it is possible to care for people within community settings.  I am also on the health committee which constantly tries to move towards Sl&aacute;intecare and to ensure that community setting is stitched into everything.  I can see the attempt to stitch that community approach into this legislation.  Is the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and access to suitable community settings of concern in the drafting of this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#L00900"><p>One thing we were very cognisant of was Sharing the Vision which is the national mental health policy.  It is aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare in that it is about providing the right care in the right environment at the right time and moving as much as possible towards community-based care and supporting people with mental health difficulties to live independent lives.</p><p>There is also an understanding that there will always be a need to provide for involuntary detention and inpatient treatment.  Sharing the Vision is a ten-year strategy.  Over the lifetime of that strategy, this updated Bill will become an Act and will be commenced so hopefully they will complement each other as we move towards empowering people's access to services in the community.  That can be seen in section 9, which is about making an application for involuntary detention.  In line with the expert group recommendations we have limited the group of people who can make an application to authorised officers, which are already a prescribed grade within the HSE.  The idea is that the authorised officer would have a more holistic view of the person, such as where he or she lives and what supports are available to that person in the community.  If the officer believes that none of those supports are adequate or that the person needs more acute care, he or she could make the application.  At every stage before the person is brought to the approved centre, consideration will be given to what other supports are available to him or her, and if there is family support, consideration will be given to what is available there and what the capacity is.  Involuntary detention would really only happen as a last resort and we have explicitly said that in section 9.  When a person is resident in an approved centre, he or she should be there for as short a time as possible.  When that person's condition starts to improve to the extent that he or she can be discharged then he or she should be and there should be discharge planning around where the person is going, whether her or she is going back to his or her family and that kind of thing.  It is baked into the general scheme. </p></speech>

Does the changing nature of the structures within the health service pose a challenge when writing this legislation as it relates to governance?  We have the Central Mental Hospital and a whole spectrum of service providers across the country right now.  We are hopefully going through a period of change and we are also trying to develop this legislation but the governance structures might be changing as we go through.  Does that present a challenge for the Department?  It is so important to get that right when appointing people or gathering a body to make decisions around people's lives.  Does that pose a particular challenge and how are the witnesses going to navigate that?</p></speech>

One is the approved centres, which have always been governed by the Mental Health Act, and we are developing that in the updated Act.  Then there are the 24-hour community residences, which include nurse-led step-down facilities, hospitals and things like that, and all mental health services eventually.  We have not included any references to, let us say, community mental health teams, which are a big part of it as well.  There are certain structures that can be captured without needing to be in the legislation itself.  If someone is accessing a mental health service as a day patient, the multidisciplinary team that is responsible for his or her care does not necessarily need to be explicitly named in the Act to know that it is still part of that care team and part of making decisions about that person's treatment.</p> <p>  The main thing we need to get right with the updated Act is involuntary detention.  As it is such a serious thing to do to someone, we have to make sure there are appropriate structures in place and that the person making the decision as to whether someone should or should not be involuntarily detained has the adequate information about the person themselves, about what the services are in the community and that the decision is reviewed.  Admission orders for involuntary detention only last two weeks now rather than three weeks.  It is about shortening those cases of involuntary detention where possible and ensuring that the reviews are more regular than they are now and that any decision to involuntarily detain someone is not taken lightly.</p></speech>

When one is involuntarily detained an admission order is made and the tribunal will review the order after 21 days but it is proposed to reduce the time to 14 days.  A person who is involuntarily detained will be assessed by an independent consultant psychiatrist.  So there will be another examination of the person and a report will be given to the tribunal.  Then the tribunal will meet the person and the person's treating psychiatrist.  After the tribunal reviews all of the documentation and evidence it will either affirm the order, which means affirm that the person needed to be involuntarily detained and suffers from a mental disorder, as it is phrased under the Act, or the order is refused and the person is released.  It is just to ensure that the person's detention is regularly reviewed.</p></speech>

Does this legislation concern itself with best practice for residential mental health facilities?  Are there guidelines for transitioning between services?  We have heard in the last few months when this matter arose that everybody has a unique care plan.  Therefore, there are no guidelines and no references to best practice so that proprietors can do anything.</p></speech>

There is an understanding that care plans are very important to the person accessing mental health services.  Access to a care plan, regular reviews and having an input are very empowering for the persons concerned and important for their path to recovery.  We have included a ruling on care plans in the general scheme.  The ruling is based on 2006 regulations, under the Act.  We may have to update the ruling depending on the outcome of pre-legislative scrutiny and as we continue to receive feedback on the published heads.  We want to make sure that care plans are filled out, reviewed, that the person is involved in making his or her care plan and that a care plan is followed because there is no point in making a care plan but not following it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there should be a template.  I do not know if it is necessary for us to put a template into the Act. </p></speech>

Are proprietors given guidelines?  Is it envisaged that proprietors would receive guidelines or information on best practice for all of the people who reside in a particular placement and what that looks like?</p><p>Otherwise it seems to be devolved, almost nebulous and difficult for proprietors to get a sense of what good practice would look like.  If everything is based on an individual care plan, where is the more directed information for proprietors showing the basics?</p></speech>

The expert group recommended that a post-enactment pre-commencement implementation group be set up among the commission, HSE and Department to work out the kinks with regard to what the proprietors need to transition to this new way of working and treating people.  This will be an opportunity to foster good practice, share it among different types of facilities and have that education piece.  It is probably not for the proposed Bill to be prescriptive on that.  It can come afterwards and it can be baked it into the education and training on what the updated Act means for proprietors, healthcare professionals and patients.</p></speech>

The point was made that the committee has a good chunk of work ahead of us.</p> <p>  An issue that was not raised is the need for 24-7 emergency access to mental health services.  Mental health issues do not only arise between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and they do not take a break at weekends.  There is a lack of 24-7 emergency mental health provision.  When people feel mentally unwell accident and emergency departments are sometimes the only place they can turn to for any sort of help.  We have the testimonies of people who were not listened to or treated well when they accessed an accident and emergency department.  Many left without getting treatment and those who did see somebody often experienced a lack of follow-up.  There is a real gap in 24-7 emergency mental healthcare and, unfortunately, people have died as a result of that gap.</p> <p>  Submissions and recommendations were made to the expert group in relation to treatment prior to admission in an accident and emergency department.  On the word "prior", how far back does that go in relation to a person's treatment?  I know people who presented to an accident and emergency department numerous times and were not admitted.  What was the basis of these submissions?  More important, what recommendations did they make?</p></speech>

The section Deputy Ward is looking for in the heads is section 13B.  That might provide a bit of clarity on our position on that.  What that section tries to do is say is that if someone is in the process of being involuntarily detained, for example, being transferred to an approved centre, and during the course of that transfer the doctor becomes aware that the person might need medical attention for a physical issue, that person would be transferred to an accident and emergency department to receive physical treatment for the ailment.  Then, after the patient recovers sufficiently to be transferred to the approved centre, he or she would be transferred to the approved centre.  It provides that the person's physical health will be looked after in the accident and emergency department and his or her mental health treatment will be looked after in the approved centre, and if he or she needs mental health treatment-----</p></speech>

I am asking whether the heads of Bill address the fact that people are arriving at emergency departments because they are feeling mentally unwell and are not getting the treatment they deserve and need at that point in time?  They are then basically sent home without getting treatment.  I am asking about that rather than cases where people hurt themselves while in a mental health facility.  In other words, I am asking about what happens prior to admission.</p></speech>

Such persons can continue to be transferred from a hospital under the proposed updated Act but we have not included anything on the resourcing of accident and emergency departments or anything like that in the proposed Bill.</p></speech>

An independent complaints mechanism is vital.  Constituents have been contacting me calling for such a mechanism, particularly in the scenario I raised where people seeking mental health services are unable to get them.  Mr. Kelly touched on this matter briefly but what was the rationale behind not recommending an independent complaints mechanism?  Is that decision final?</p></speech>

The issue came up in the public consultation we ran earlier this year.  We considered it at that point but, as I mentioned to Senator Hoey, we concluded that it might be covered already in the existing functions of the inspector and the role of the Office of the Ombudsman in investigating HSE complains.  As I said, the document is a living one and we will consider anything that emerges from the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny.  Nothing is final until the legislation is passed.</p></speech>

My final question is also about gaps in services.  Dual diagnosis arises when people are suffering from a mental health issue and addiction.  Deputy Buckley, who spoke earlier, has made further progress in reading the proposed Bill than I have at this stage but I tried to go through a fair bit of it over the past week.  It is complex.  Is provision made in the proposed Bill in relation to people admitted to mental health services who have an addiction as well as a mental health issue?  Is there anything in it that would help them in the provision of care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#P00500"><p>If, for instance, somebody is being involuntarily detained, the main reason for the detention is that the person fulfils the criteria.  A person could fulfil the criteria and have addiction issues with alcohol or drugs or the person could have an intellectual disability or any number of issues.  No one is precluded from being involuntarily detained by virtue of the fact that he or she has addiction issues.  As long as someone meets the criteria for detention, he or she should be admitted.  That covers the cohort to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  In terms of the specifics on people with addiction issues or dual diagnosis, these would be looked after in the person's individualised care plan and one would hope that the treatment the person would receive would not only be specific to the individual but would treat both aspects of the issue.  We do not go into detail in the proposed Bill.  We do not name any mental health condition either, so there are no references to schizophrenia or depression.  It is more general and all conditions are included without any of them being named.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly mentioned other conditions that can be classed as dual diagnosis.  Where there is an individualised care plan from an addiction centre and another individual care plan from a mental health perspective, there is a lack of a joined-up care plan.  This is another gap in service.  There should be a way of ensuring the person's needs are treated holistically rather than on an individual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hempenstall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#P00800"><p>We dealt with this matter in detail.  On dual diagnosis, we have a programme manager for the national clinical programme.</p><p>We are developing a model of care which has to do with dual diagnosis.  I also agree with the Deputy at a general level.  People with mental health issues often have other issues as well.  I believe they are called comorbidities.  It is important from an individual care planning perspective that those things are taken into account.  Developing a service to provide that wrap-around is more of a policy issue through Sharing the Vision.</p><p> I will go back to something Deputy Buckley raised about the Department of Justice.  We are working very closely with the Department on a high-level task force for prisoners and for diverting people away from prison if they have committed crimes more because of mental health issues than anything else.  The Department is working very hard and pushing us very hard.  That task force is chaired by Kathleen Lynch, the former Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.</p><p> On the out-of-hours service, I had thought that was what the Deputy was asking about.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has prioritised developing out-of-hours services, crisis teams and that kind of thing as part of the new development funding for 2022.  I could not agree with the Deputy more that people can have mental health issues outside of the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p><p> With regard to what Deputy Hourigan said about guidelines and best practice for proprietors and people running mental health services, I mentioned that dual diagnosis model of care, but we are also bringing in a range of models of care to deal with a lot of new mental health issues that are coming to the fore.  Eating disorders come to mind.  Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have operational guidelines in that regard.  There may well be no shortage of best practice for those who are running services to rely on, especially with regard to multidisciplinary teams that bring all of those things together.  I am not sure that is specifically addressed in legislation because the more specific the legislation, the quicker it can go out of date.  The idea behind the legislation is to present the framework and human rights basis.  Those guiding principles can then be used as a base from which to develop operational guidelines and forms and models of care so that people can get high-quality mental health services.</p><p> On protected disclosures, I do not know if the Deputy was raising something specific.  I cannot answer to that.  All I know is my colleagues deal with such disclosures very seriously whenever we receive one.  From my perspective, the HSE also takes them seriously.  I will put that on the record.</p></speech>

I hope that is okay.  Before I ask any questions, I warmly welcome the publication of the heads of this Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001.  The work the Department has done has been phenomenal and I thank the witnesses for that.  The changes in language, for example, using "person" instead of "patient", are really well thought through.  Ireland has an opportunity to deliver person-centred, human rights-compliant, progressive, non-coercive legislation that is compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UNCRPD.  Do the witnesses know what I mean?  We can lead on this.  Ireland can be a world leader on mental health legislation.  I am honoured that this matter has come before the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and that we can be part of this whole process.  I look forward to working with the witnesses.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the Bill.  I hope that is okay.  My first question aims to follow up on Deputy Hourigan's earlier point regarding other key legislation.  Mr. Kelly mentioned that amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 were needed.  He also mentioned ongoing conversations between the two Departments.  Does one of those amendments relate to decision-making provisions for under-18s?  Is it correct to say there is currently a lacuna with regard to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds?  Will Mr. Kelly give me a bit more detail on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#Q00300"><p>Policy responsibility for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act rests with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I was not involved in the drafting of that Act but I understand the age of 18 was chosen for a number of reasons.  Healthcare is only one of the many areas the Act deals with.</p><p>It also covers decisions relating to finances and other aspects of life.  It is for that Department to decide whether the age should be reduced to 16, but I understand there would be a lot of consequences to such a decision.  It is outside of the control of our Department.  As I mentioned earlier, we are bringing consent for mental health treatment for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds in line with consent for physical treatment.  A 16-year-old can decide whether he or she wants to have surgery but cannot, at the moment, decide whether to attend a mental health service.   That decision is made by the parents.  We want to remedy that disparity between physical and mental treatment.  Those aged 16 or 17 who have physical conditions are also not covered by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  There is a gap on all sides in that regard, not just in respect of mental health.  It is coming to light on our side because we are reducing the age of consent for mental health treatment to 16 whereas that is already the case for those aged 16 or 17 accessing physical health treatment.</p><p> Because that Act does not apply to that age cohort at the moment, we have left it up to the Mental Health Commission to make the guidelines as to how to assess capacity for those aged 16 and 17, how such capacity assessments are to be carried out and who should carry them out.  That is our fix for the moment but, if the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were to decide to reduce the age specified in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to 16 from 18, we would, of course, reconsider the provisions we have included.  However, this is our workaround - for lack of a better word - for now because that Act does not apply to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.  We are trying to bring the principles of that Act into our own Act in a sense.  We are trying to make sure the capacity assessments are as similar as possible to those carried out under the 2015 Act.</p></speech>

I am a little bit concerned about the section 4(9) proposed under head 5 which states, "The provision of mental health services is subject to the availability of resources."  I hope the witnesses will forgive me if they have covered this.  I just feel the inclusion of this statement in legislation only serves to undermine its thrust and the culture change that is needed.  Will this provision be removed from the final version of the Bill?  Will the final Bill be strengthened with regard to resources?</p></speech>

It will be removed from the final Bill.  This provision was included because the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel wants to make sure there is an implicit understanding in any legislation that things can only be made available subject to the resources provided.  The office wanted to make that explicit in the general scheme so that, when formal drafting began, that consideration would have been made explicit.  It will not be in the final Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#R00400"><p>With regard to section 9, which is proposed in head 10 and relates to authorised officers, the head refers to &quot;Persons who may apply for involuntary admission&quot;.  That is obviously very welcome.  In consultation with the HSE, family members wanted to retain the option to apply for involuntary admission for relatives.  I stress that an appropriately funded authorised officer service represents best practice.  I have just one concern.  I will read out a piece of the explanatory note in the general scheme.  It says:</p> <blockquote> 	... [The expert group's] Recommendation 36 states that an authorised officer should be the only person to sign applications for involuntary admission to an approved centre.  The EGR clearly recommended that it should always be an authorised officer who makes an application for a person to be involuntarily admitted.  For this to operate effectively and in a timely manner, the HSE will need to guarantee that there are enough trained authorised officers available in all areas on a 24/7 basis.  It would also mean that should the HSE require more time and resources to build up the authorised officer service, [This is all really good] then this new provision could not come into effect until the full service is in place, so this section may need to be commenced at a later date to the rest of the Act. </blockquote><p>This is the concern.  Has the Department sanctioned additional funding for increased numbers of authorised officers?  Has a scoping exercise been carried out in respect of the community health resource areas where there are no authorised officers?  How will the delay be avoided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#S00200"><p>We put that in because we do not want a situation whereby if somebody needs to be involuntarily detained, they cannot be because there is no authorised officer available.  We have had some initial discussions with the HSE as to how much that might cost per year, to fully staff enough authorised officers on a 24-7 basis in all 26 counties across the community health organisations.  The preliminary discussion has already started and it may be the case that we may need to expand.  At the moment, specific grades within the HSE can become authorised officers.  We may need to go back to that to see if we can expand this to include other grades that are similarly qualified.  This would expand the pool of people available.  It would be an industrial relations issue also for the HSE in some respects because the HSE would have people working on call on a 24-7 basis.</p> <p>  There are issues to be worked through but they are not insurmountable.  Limiting the authorised officers as being the only group of people who can make an application for involuntary detention is a very positive move.  It allows that person to act as an impartial third party so that we are not disrupting the ratios between family members such as between mothers and sons, siblings, husbands and wives, and so on.  It is a key piece.  The HSE is aware of this, and it is also in the programme for Government.  We are very committed to getting it right. With regard to the delay, we were thinking that it might be six months, for example.  It would not be a substantial delay.  It would just be to make sure that the structures are in place.  As soon as we have an idea of the final shape of the Bill and when it might be passed, it will be one of the key priorities in the implementation phase before everything has to be commenced.</p></speech>

Their services should provide support to the person who is experiencing mental health difficulties and also to the family and friends, and supporters and carers with permission.  I had a bit of anxiety around the wording of "at a later date to the rest of the Act".  We can keep an eye on that for sure.</p></speech>

It is in recommendations Nos. 126 and 127, under the heading "Advance Healthcare Directives".  The Act is there already, it would just be a matter of reintroducing it.  It would complement the proposed Bill.</p> <p>  I also wish to flag up a huge problem in Ireland regarding mental health and disability.  If a child, a teenager or any person has a form of autism and has mental health issues, we do not have a service for them in the Thirty-two Counties, never mind Twenty-six Counties.  I just want to flag this up today because we are getting a lot of this in our offices.  It is an awful thing to have to say to a parent that they would have to go to England before they get anything for their child.  I just want to share that with the committee.</p></speech>

No one wants a child to be admitted to a facility for adults, but it does happen on occasion.  If a child is in a CHO where there is no appropriate inpatient CAMHS unit, he or she may be admitted to an adult ward for one night to provide for the transfer in order that he or she is in a safe environment.  It is similar to the restrictive practices around seclusion or restraint.  It is something we do not want to see but, with our eyes fully open, it does happen on some occasions, so we have to put something in place to make sure that we are aware of how often it happens, when it happens and the reasons for it happening with a view to reducing it and hopefully not having to use that section in the future.</p></speech>

I attended a meeting in Linn Dara about six or eight weeks ago.  The number of children that has happened to are significantly down.  I cannot remember the exact number.  In the vast majority of those cases, which were in single figures, it was only for a night and the majority of the children affected were 17, so they were almost adults anyway.  As Mr. Kelly said, it is intended to provide for a last resort.  It is not something that anybody really wants to do.  The HSE is definitely improving in terms of addressing that.</p></speech>

This Part of the Bill is a restatement and augmenting of Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 whose provisions have already successfully delivered Ireland's first marine spatial plan.  We can deal further with the detail of each element in the discussions on later amendments.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the grouping of proposed amendments that deals with definitions and MSP requirements.  Unfortunately, they contain many of the same technical issues evident with earlier amendments and, if accepted, would not provide operable procedures.  I apologise to Deputies for having to present such a critique.  I appreciate the spirit in which these amendments have been put forward, but it is important to record why the amendments cannot be accepted.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 73 purports to define maritime spatial planning.  Maritime spatial planning is defined in the EU directive.  Section 13(2) of the initiated text ensures that the term has the same meaning in this Bill as in the directive.  Deviating substantially from that definition, as proposed in this amendment, attracts significant legal risk of incorrect transposition that could imperil any plan made under this legislation.  That is especially the case in this amendment where the syntax and structure of the proposed definition contain a number of technical deficiencies that render it inoperable or would have unintended consequences.</p> <p>  "Seas and oceans" is not a precisely defined term and not necessarily limited to Ireland's maritime area, as defined in the Bill.  The proposal to "develop coordinated, coherent and transparent decision making in relation to the maritime sectors" is not a requirement of the directive and extends far beyond the scope of preparing a maritime spatial plan.  This proposal could be construed as placing an obligation on the competent authority to reform decision-making procedures that are the responsibility of a range of Ministers and bodies under a range of regulatory and legislative regimes.  Maritime spatial planning provides the context in which decisions are made but does not direct the form of decision-making procedures.  Any reform of those procedures will have to be undertaken in the context of their respective legislative codes.</p> <p>  The syntax of the proposed measures in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the amendment are problematic, in that the terms "have due regard" and "may include" do not match the chapeau of "maritime spatial planning means".</p><p>Further and more fundamentally, these are matters that should be taken into account in the development of a plan and cannot form part of the definition.</p><p> The proposed paragraph (d) also limits applicable policies to those approved by the Oireachtas, which would be an unprecedented and inordinate constraint on any regulatory system.  This would severely limit the scope of any plan made under this amendment and potentially conflicts with the requirements of the directive.</p><p> Amendment No. 74 proposes alternative objectives of a maritime spatial plan.  These objectives are silent on key elements of Article 5(2) of the directive, namely, the sustainable development of energy sectors at sea, maritime transport and the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, and the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment, including resilience to climate change impacts.  This legislation and any plan made under this amendment would be vulnerable to legal challenge.  Section 16(4) of the initiated text captures all the required objectives.</p><p> Amendment No. 76 specifies the promotion of sustainable opportunities for the local fishing industry.  As has been a recurring theme in these sessions, a single sector has been specified in amendments to the exclusion of others.  We must retain neutrality in the legislation and the statutory procedures.</p><p> Amendment No. 77 is fundamentally flawed in a number of respects.  The syntax and grammar of the proposed paragraphs (a) and (d) are not sufficiently clear and are not coherent provisions.  The proposed paragraph (b) is based on a misreading of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the directive, which provides that the member states, through the instrument of marine spatial plans, shall contribute to the matters set out in the paragraph.  This amendment would make the competent authority the instrument of such contribution.  Section 16(5) of the initiated text already provides for the matters set out in Article 8(1) of the directive making the proposed paragraph (d) redundant.</p><p> Acceptance of amendment No. 79 would also duplicate elements of section 17, leading to potential confusion and unacceptable risk.</p><p> Amendment No. 81 is expansive on a single pillar of sustainable development to the exclusion of the other two.  The legislation and procedures must be neutral in this regard to allow for the right balance of the pillars to emerge from the development process and not be directed from the top down.  I fully appreciate the importance of these environmental factors and considerations.  Where relevant, they will be taken into account as a matter of course, in particular in the development of DMAPs covering specified locations where specific impacts on identified species and habitats can be identified and provided for.  I draw attention to the proposals in section 21(2) for DMAPs, in particular paragraphs (c) to (f).  These are broad enough to encompass the considerations raised in this amendment but may not be necessary for every single DMAP.  I oppose this amendment</p><p> Amendment No. 75 proposes to replace the word "colocation" with the word "co-existence".  This formulation is more consistent with the directive than the initiated text and I thank the Deputies for proposing it and bringing it to our attention.  I will accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Perhaps he could have expanded on it.  I apologise for being late.  I came straight from making a short contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I want to make a few points on amendments Nos. 73 to 77, inclusive, 79 and 81.  I will also comment on several points the Minister of State has just made.</p> <p>  The idea of these amendments is to provide an alternative definition and objective for the marine spatial plans, with a stronger focus on environmental and social requirements.  These amendments seek to bring the objectives in line with the EU directives.  What is encompassed by maritime spatial planning needs to be clearly set out in the Bill.  It is very important that we do this to ensure the Bill is as robust as possible.  Why is this important?  I noted at the weekend there was coverage from people in the renewable wind energy sector that if they do not get the type of robust planning system they need, the consequent uncertainty could lead to judicial reviews and impact on investment.  I do not favour the model of developing renewable energy being pursued by the Government.  I would much prefer a much more public role in it.  I accept that the model being pursued is reliant on private investment so it is very important, even from the point of view of getting investment into the sector, that we have robust legislation and that there are not grounds for judicial review.  This is very important.  These are complex environmental considerations and they must take into account spatial planning.  This is not a discretionary matter that we can pick and choose.</p> <p>  With regard to the response of the Minister of State, I want to make several points.  With regard to syntax and grammar, from my point of view if syntax and grammar need to be fixed in any amendment I table, there will be no issue with doing so.  I will be happy to accommodate the Minister of State and the Department in that regard.  It should not be an obstacle to any amendment we are tabling.  It can be fixed as part of the process.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 74, the Minister of State said it is silent on Article 5 of the directive and on the uses being specified.  I will read out a section of amendment No. 74.  The new wording proposed in section 16(2)(b) states "by applying an ecosystem-based approach, and which promote the co-existence of relevant activities and uses, as required by Article 1 and Article 5(1) of the MSP Directive".  Article 5 is specifically written in and the uses are specifically referenced.  I do not accept the comments of the Minister of State that it is silent on Article 5.  I ask him to expand on why he takes this view when we specifically have it written into the amendment.</p></speech>

It is one of those days when we are all running around trying to catch up with ourselves.  I am sure if I had more time to catch a breath, I could have found a pithy remark at the start about co-existence between ourselves and the Minister of State but it is good to see he is accepting at least one of the amendments.  It is not a small change of language but a significant change.  Of course, co-existence is the language used in the directive and I thank the Minister for accepting it.</p> <p>  I am of the view, and I agree with the comments of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, that the language of the directives is being weakened in the text of the Bill, more specifically with respect to the marine spatial plans.  I will come to the DMAPs in a similar way shortly.  Defining in legislation exactly what they are to be would be a much more helpful way of doing things and would potentially reduce the possibility of legal challenge in future.  The concern some of us have, and to go back to the point we have been making from the start, is that we want to see a robust planning regime in the maritime area that facilitates multiple uses in this co-existence spirit, including offshore wind.  If the legislative framework is not clear enough at the outset, it will be an open door to judicial review at a later stage, which we all want to avoid.  Amendment No. 73 to section 13 is proposed to try to provide much greater clarity in terms of what a spatial plan is meant to do and contain.  One of my concerns about some aspects of the language in the Bill is that it defines the process more than the detailed content and, crucially, the objectives.</p> <p>  I also want to reintroduce the issue we discussed previously, namely, the hierarchy and interrelationship between all of these layers of plan making, and I will come to it with regard to DMAPs shortly because there is still a lack of clarity.  Amendment No. 74 is similar in the sense it is trying to set out the objectives for the marine spatial plan explicitly using the language of the directive, which I think is much more explicit and helpful.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is absolutely right that we are raising the issue of the inshore fisheries industry.  There is a strong view in the Opposition that of all the sectors that have engaged in the public consultation on this to date, inshore fisheries is the sector that has been most left behind.  None of us will apologise for continually raising the sector's concerns here.  The Minister of State gave us a commitment on this the last time we discussed it.</p><p>We are urging the Minister to fully appreciate and understand the capacity deficit that may exist for small inshore fishermen and their businesses to fully engage in the technical complexities in front of us and, therefore, to find mechanisms to ensure their full participation in it.  </p><p> Amendment No. 77 is about strengthening the language and making it more compliant with the directive.</p><p> As regards amendment No. 79, one of the concerns many members have, which we have expressed previously and will express again, is that these are not just spatial plans; they are temporal plans.  That is why the issue of Article 6 of the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive is so important.  Although it is clear the framework plan as has been presented to date is spatial, that temporal issue is still very much missing.</p><p> The crucial issue in respect of amendment No. 81 is data and the need to ensure, as required under the directives, that we have the best-quality data and address the data gaps that exist.  The amendment tries to specify some of those because it is crucial that once we get to the other side of the Bill, everything that flows from it is based on the most up-to-date, accurate and informed data.  Unfortunately, as members are aware, Ireland is weak on that, particularly in the context of protected environments.</p><p> An issue on which I have not yet tabled an amendment but to which I may return on Report Stage is the definition of a protected site in section 13(1).  I will wait and see whether that is an issue of sufficient concern for me to table an amendment on Report Stage.  The issue relates to the whole interaction in terms of the time lag between protected areas mitigation measures that are put in at this stage and whether the definition of "protected site" in section 13(1) is adequate for those purposes.  I am not necessarily looking to respond on this Stage, but it may be an issue we will return to on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Last weekend, I took the time to read the December 2020 report entitled Building Offshore Wind by the lobbying group on behalf of the wind energy industry.  I did so in advance of a public meeting we held on this issue last night.  It might be of interest to the Minister of State that the meeting was packed with people who are very concerned.  The overwhelming sentiment at the meeting was that we absolutely need to develop offshore wind and address the climate crisis but there is deep concern and anxiety that we do not have a plan-led approach but, rather, a developer-led approach.</p> <p>  The detail of the report by Wind Energy Ireland, WEI, which has been lobbying very hard, is damning in this regard.  In the document, WEI explicitly states on several occasions that we need a developer-led approach and rails against a plan-led approach.  It explicitly states that private developers and the industry should decide site selection.  This is a key issue.  It came across very strongly at the meeting last night that if the industry selects the sites, then we can forget about the maritime area regulatory authority and all this legislation because there actually is a momentum under way which determines the outcome or is very likely to do so.  This industry is explicitly saying it should decide how we do the development offshore and that we should not plan.  However, the directives insist on planning and a plan-led approach.  That approach should start with the selection of sites but that is not what is happening.  It is not what is happening with the designation of projects.  WEI is lobbying for a new category, one that does not appear anywhere in the directives, whereby the industry selects the sites.</p> <p>  Let us be absolutely clear that what is of concern to us and why we are trying to lock in specific protections and a sustainable approach that is contained in the marine spatial planning directives and the various directives such as the habitats directive, the birds directive and so on is that we have a plan-led approach.  That means plans that take into consideration all of the environmental concerns and that the concerns in respect of sustainable and appropriate uses of the marine area should determine where things happen.  Our concern is that is not what is going on.  What is actually going on is that the industry does not want a plan-led approach and it seems that it is being facilitated in that regard, particularly under this notion of relevant projects.  They are getting a special pass.  The industry explicitly opposes a plan-led approach.  We want this locked into the legislation to apply to all parties.  We want it to start with the issue of site selection and go all the way through the process that there is a plan-led approach which is about appropriate development that ensures we protect biodiversity and marine resources and put things where they should be put rather than where developers who are concerned with profit want them.  That is the logic behind this.  It starts with planning, which is in the EU directives.  A proper and appropriate plan-led approach, not a developer-led approach, should be locked in to the whole process from beginning to end.  That is our concern.  Anyone who reads the comments of WEI will see where our concerns come from.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 75 is not the first to be taken on board.  Where we can, we will work with members to make this legislation better, such as through giving commitments in the context of the resolution relating to the MPPS and getting information out in respect of public participation by communities that think this issue is very important.  That has been the structure we have embarked on right through the four years it took to bring about the NMPF.  Public participation is at the core of this mechanism.  I refer to the three rounds of public participation in that process.</p> <p>  Obviously, the Government is very keen to protect fishermen in every way we can through Government policy.  I make no apologies for saying that.  I am trying to put forward a Bill that is neutral in the planning code to try to get the best possible outcomes for everyone who uses it.</p> <p>  As regards the directive, I have received clear advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  A very senior legal drafter has been working on this legislation because of the complexity and magnitude of the Bill and what it will mean for the country in the future.  The clear advice received meant that, in the first instance, we have stayed as close as possible to the MSP directive throughout, referencing articles on many occasions throughout the legislation.  It is not necessary to reproduce every single word or section of the directive in the Bill or to reinterpret it through the Bill.  We are not doing that.  We have clear precedence for this in terms of Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 which gave birth to the NMPF.  Obviously, we are going through this and embarking on this process again with this new legislation which will undoubtedly be ground-breaking.  The advice I have received from the Office of the Attorney General gives me great confidence that we are taking the right approach.</p> <p>  I fully appreciate the concerns raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p><p>I cannot get into individual cases but I will say that everything the Government does in this Thirty-third D&aacute;il is to try to make our maritime area planning process plan-led.  We are trying to ensure the plan recognises and respects all the vulnerable aspects of our maritime area, protects everyone, gets the best possible outcome and the fairest possible system to adjudicate independently on any applications that come forward in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#D00200"><p>Is the Minister of State giving us a cast-iron guarantee that development consents will not be given until we have plans that designate what is and what is not appropriate, which areas of the marine are appropriate for particular types of development?  Consents should not be given until applications have, if you like, gone through the proper process of environmental impact assessment, full compliance with the habitats directive, the birds directive and the marine spatial planning directive.  In other words, we must ensure we have the plan first.  We need to properly and forensically assess these matters to protect biodiversity, fishers, our coastal amenities, areas that need special protection and so on.  Will the Minister of State guarantee that development consents will not be given until mapping of the marine area has taken place?  Decisions must be made on the basis of proper marine spatial planning that complies with all the relevant directives and environmental impact assessments.  Consents should not be given otherwise.  Decisions must not be made by developers.  Is it potentially the case that sites which have been selected by the developers themselves will get development consents prior to all of those assessments?  That is the key question and what we need to know.  I hope the Minister of State will give us assurances and we will not have huge developments that effectively become a <i>fait accompli </i>before we have done the mapping of what needs to be protected, what is sensitive, and all the screening, if you like, for environmental impact assessment that should take place if we are not going to repeat the Wild West approach to development we have sometimes taken on land.  Those are the assurances we need.  The reason for these amendments is precisely because we are trying to lock that in.  In amendment No. 79, for example, we suggest that in accordance with Article 8 of the marine spatial planning directive, we should &quot;identify the spatial and temporal distribution of relevant, existing and future activities and uses in the marine waters of the Marine Spatial Plan the competent authority is preparing&quot;.  We want the thing mapped out.  Where is it appropriate to do certain things and where is it not?  We should ask has there been a proper process in making those decisions before we start lashing out development consents for big industrial development in our marine areas.</p></speech>

I am still not clear as to how public participation is envisaged with respect to the marine spatial plan.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State in his response not only reads his written reply on the deficiencies of our amendments but also puts on record how that public participation process is envisaged under section 18.</p><p>There is an relationship, which the amendments speak to, between the review of the NMPF and the drafting, amending or revoking of an MSP.  I have a concern with the way in which the Bill is drafted in that public participation, in the context of the NMPF, will kick in at a later stage and, therefore, there could be periods in which there would not be adequate public participation, with respect to both the marine spatial plans and amendments to or replacements of marine spatial plans.  If the Minister of State could set that out, it would be helpful.</p><p>It is important to ensure that where public participation is in place, there will be no undue or unnecessary obstacles to that participation.  That includes ensuring information is made as widely available as possible, with no onerous fees that would block it.  That is not something that is necessarily in our current planning regime but it can be seen in, for example, some of the new provisions of the forestry legislation.  I accept that does not relate to the Minister of State's Department but it is still a worry for those of us who are concerned with access to public participation.</p><p>Depending on the Minister of State's outline of how he envisages public participation with respect to these, I might come back in.  The amendments are about trying to ensure the maximum level of public participation at the earliest stage in the process in order that the public can be brought in to the plan-led approach the Minister of State outlined in his response to opposition earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#E01000"><p>Amendment No. 80, which relates to public participation, seeks to insert Article 9.  That Article states member states shall establish means of public participation by informing all interested parties, consulting relevant stakeholders, authorities and the public concerned at an early stage in the development of maritime spatial plans in accordance with relevant provisions establishing legislation. It will also ensure relevant stakeholders, authorities and the public will have access to plans once they have been finalised.  This is very important to ensure there will be proper compliance with the maritime spatial planning directive when a maritime spatial plan is being compiled.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 87, the Bill, as it stands, includes quite a complex system for public participation on maritime spatial plans, but the reason for this complexity is not clear.  The amendment will provide that the consultation period will exclude public holidays and that it will both be online and use traditional methods to ensure inclusion.  That is important to ensure no one will be disenfranchised in the context of the digital divide.  It will provide also that there will be no charge for submissions or for inspecting materials made available online.  They are all useful steps to take in regard to public participation being written into the legislation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 88 will require a statement on public participation to be published after the Bill has been enacted to ensure compliance with the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 seeks to delete the lines, "The competent authority ... shall take all reasonable steps to comply with the public participation statement".  That wording would give the competent authority discretion not to comply with its own public participation statement.  It is unclear what would constitute "reasonable steps" and the wording is arbitrary.  It is not defined in the legislation and there could be difficulties in that regard.  It is not a good wording to have in the Bill and it weakens it.  In fact, an issue I have with much of the Bill relates to parts whose language weakens provisions unnecessarily.  It reflects some of what is in the directives but it chooses wording that would allow for get-out clauses or weaker implementation.</p> <p>  Amendment Nos. 92 and 93 are similar to amendment No. 87.  Amendment No. 95 sets out additional details on what should be classed as relevant documentation for this section.  It includes reviews of and changes to the existing NMPF, MSPs and DMAPs, whereas the Bill includes only the draft MSP.</p><p>That is important in terms of this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#F00200"><p>The public feels developers are always not one but ten steps ahead in terms of knowledge of plans.  It is felt that the public is the last to know about anything and, insofar as consultation takes place, it is a tick-box exercise.  It is minimal and, as we noted earlier, often happens around August or December.  People find out at the last minute that they are to be consulted and there is a feeling that many things are <i>faits accomplis</i>.</p><p>There is a need to tightly define and ensure the most thoroughgoing, rigorous, open, transparent process of public consultation and participation.  I hate the world &quot;consultation&quot;.  There should be public participation in the planning of our regulation and management of our marine area and resources.  People want that and they want to be confident.  What is set out in the directives, the Aarhus Convention and so on is precisely that.  The definition of sustainable planning and development is that the public is part of it.  The public is not incidental to planning and development but a critical part of it and often has the greatest knowledge.</p><p>We will move onto MARA and the personnel who will oversee these things but who are the experts?  One of the key groups of experts is the public, most often, or the stakeholders in a particular area.  They are often not seen as such, but as a pain in the neck to be overcome, certainly by developers as demonstrated in some of their documents.  We are trying to ensure that public involvement is thoroughgoing, that the public know and that there is no question of people not knowing. </p><p>The Minister of State looked favourably on the suggestion that we move from traditional newspaper media to radio advertising and stuff like that and hopefully that will be reflected in Government amendments before we get to Report Stage.  It is so everybody knows something important is happening that affects the marine area where they operate or that is close to them.  That is what we are looking for and no vagueness or get-out clauses, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan pointed to.  That is the logic of these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#F00300"><p>The grouping proposes a number of changes to the public participation procedures and additional steps in the Oireachtas approval procedures.</p> <p>  I will take participation first.  In part, I think these amendments have been proposed because members may not have fully grasped the intention and function of the initiated text as a whole.  This is understandable as what is proposed is innovative in an Irish context and builds upon the experience of the development of our first national marine planning framework.  I caution members not to fall into the trap of assuming that public consultation and participation are synonymous.  Formal public consultation is only one form of participation.  Participation in the first national marine planning framework was extensive throughout the development process and not limited to the final consultation on a draft document.  The draft could not have been prepared without the input of the public, stakeholders, NGOs, industry, Departments and agencies.  </p> <p>  This Bill, through the tool of the public participation statement, seeks to place such participation arrangements on a statutory footing.  I urge members to re-examine section 18 of the initiated text setting out the detail of what is intended to be included in such statements, in particular subsections (4) and (5).  Many of the concerns raised in sessions to date, such as best practice, inclusivity, Aarhus compliance and appropriate use of media, will be specified in regulations that will guide the preparation of such statements.  We are also conscious of the consultation overload issue raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett at the last session and we intend, insofar as is possible given the complexity of such plans, to minimise the administrative burden on stakeholders.  The publication of the public participation statement will be the first step in the development of the next iteration of the marine spatial plan so the public will have early and full sight of when and how it can engage with the development process.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 78, formal public consultation arrangements on the draft plan will be set out in a public participation statement.  The use of the term &ldquo;full&rdquo; is deficient legally and is open to argument that no public consultation, no matter how comprehensive, could be considered &ldquo;full&rdquo; or complete.  The plan will also be subject to consultation requirements under the SEA and birds and habitats directives via section 31.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 80 would duplicate the provision of section 18(1) in respect of Article 9 of the MSP directive.  Amendment No. 87 further details arrangements for public participation that are not necessary in the context of section 18.  Amendment No. 88 repeats much of the previous amendments but is not necessary in the context of section 18.  Amendment No. 89 would remove the requirement for compliance with the statement, subject to taking &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo; in section 18(2).  This section is necessary because factors outside the control of the competent authority may result in an element of the statement not being fully complied with.  It would be incorrect for a plan to be unable to be made and years of work, participation and engagement to be wasted in such circumstances.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 90 is an alternative to No. 89 replacing &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; with &ldquo;legally required actions&rdquo;.  It is presumed that this is intended to ensure compliance with participation obligations; however, the language is not so limited and risks unintended consequences.  In any case, such obligations are expressed elsewhere in the Bill and would apply even if unstated.  Any development procedure that failed to comply with such obligations would not survive judicial review. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 91 seeks to limit the ability of the competent authority to amend the public participation statement to account for emerging and arising issues and is too restrictive.  Such amendments may be practical in nature and expand the scope of participation or introduce a new mechanism.  I believe our practice to date and the provisions of section 18 highlight our commitment to the best possible participation in the development of plans for the future. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 92 further details public consultation arrangements that are not necessary as they will be set out in regulations and the public participation statement.  It also repeats elements of other amendments and the existing text that would lead to confusion, inconsistency and lack of clarity.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 93 relates to regulations in respect of the statement and sets out matters which the competent authority is already obliged to comply with.  It places a lesser obligation to &ldquo;act consistently with&rdquo; rather than to comply with the directives stated in the amendment.  This opens up the risk that these provisions are considered part-transposition of those directives while not giving them full effect.      </p> <p>  Amendment No. 94 proposes that the Minister &ldquo;shall comply with&rdquo; the principles and policies of section 18(5).  "Have regard to" is the standard terminology for preparation of regulations.  On a technical level, the amendment does not work; for example, it would result in a requirement to &ldquo;comply with compliance with Article 9 of the Directive&rdquo;.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 95 purports to replace existing provisions that are already sufficient.  It is overly restrictive.  Minor amendments are concerned which are provided for under chapter 5 and consultation for DMAPs is provided for under section 23.</p> <p>  These amendments are not necessary.  I point out to members that the national planning framework was a best-in-class view of how to deliver such a comprehensive document in terms of public participation at every step of the way.  Page 196 of the NMPF details the number of public participation and consultation events held.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will be happy to note none of them were in August or September.</p><p>There were also various meetings of our stakeholder advisory group.  I had the pleasure of chairing three meetings from May 2020.  The first of the meetings was in the Custom House in March 2018.  The committee can see that this is four years of work through extensive meetings, through an advisory group and going around various areas including coastal towns to try to get the communities involved.  We will take the workings from the Deputy's suggestions on how we do that into the future.  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's concerns on fees, we absolutely do not see that in any way being any part.  It is very clear that if there is an amendment or change, once that is set aside, section 18 will be triggered and all of this consultation, which is the best in class and has been very wide-ranging, will be brought into action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#G00200"><p>It would be very useful if the Minister of State could give some detail on what exactly is a public participation statement and what is its purpose.  It would be very helpful if the Minister of State could come back on that.</p> <p>  Section 18 of the Bill is about public participation and marine spatial plans, and our amendments here are seeking to strengthen this.  Section 18 is very weak on public participation.  It relies on this public participation statement.  From my reading of it, probably the strongest part of it is the list of requirements the Minister may specify with regard to a public participation statement.  There is a huge amount of discretion around that list.  The section states: "The Minister may by regulations specify requirements with which a public participation statement (M) shall comply...", and then there is the list.  There is no obligation and no wording saying that a public participation statement has to comply with these principles.  The fact that it is resting on this public participation statement rather than being set out in the legislation is very problematic.</p> <p>  This comes at the heart of Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that public participation should not be done just to tick the box.  It is often the case that the public and other stakeholders often have the best knowledge of an issue in a marine area and they can know it in a way that nobody else does.  I have seen this countless times where the developers come with highly paid consultants and all the rest and they miss absolutely key knowledge in the local area that is known by the local community, perhaps by the people who have been fishing it for years and have lived there for generations.  If it is done right, public participation can actually get information that is in everybody's benefit in the long run.  I have a lot of concerns about this.</p> <p>  It goes back to the previous points made that what we are trying to do with this legislation is to facilitate renewable energy, but we need to try to protect our marine biodiversity and environment at the same time.  If we are not, then we are negating some of the positives that could come out of renewable energy.  The importance of our marine environment has been well documented, not just in terms of biodiversity but also around its importance for carbon capture, in the context of marine life and cetaceans, including whales and dolphins, and with regard to the seabed.  If renewable energy is not planned properly, if it is not plan-led, or if it is developer-led, it can lead to unnecessary destruction of our marine environment and the release of carbon, which of course is going against what renewable energy is trying to counteract.</p> <p>  It would be very helpful if the Minister of State will answer specifically what is a public participation statement and what are its purposes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.584" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#G00300"><p>I thank Minister of State for his reply.  I do not believe that because what is proposed is innovative we are finding it difficult to understand.  This suggests that somehow innovation is something that the Opposition cannot comprehend.  It is because this is incredibly complex.  The legislation does not lend itself to easy understanding of its outworkings, particularly when large aspects of what we are talking about are not specified in the legislation.  It is specified by way of powers for the Minister.</p> <p>  The concern that motivates us to have amendments around public participation is that upon reading section 18 I am not clear on who a competent authority may be, and I am not clear what the status of a public participation statement will be.  I understand what the Minister of State is describing it as, which is a series of intentions, but my big concern is to be found when we get into section 18(2), which states: "The competent authority (M) shall take all reasonable steps to comply with the public participation statement (M)."  To me, this seems very vague and open.  While a very good Minister with very good officials with a good track record of public participation will use the provision in a very positive way, this does not necessarily require it under law.</p> <p>  The Minister of State said there may be events outside the control of the authority.  I would like to know what kinds of events are considered.  I am not being awkward, but I ask the Minister of State to be more explicit in explaining what those outside events are that may mean a competent authority does not feel it is fully able to comply with the statement.  What would be reasonable steps and what would not be reasonable steps, and who decides?  Where will this be set out?</p> <p>  Likewise, section 18(3) refers to where the competent authority "considers it necessary or expedient" to revise the statement.  This means that the public participation statement does not have to be fully adhered to, depending on what events outside the control of the competent authority happened to intervene.  It can be amended.  Again, I could be interpreting this wrong, but it seems there is lots of scope and room for manoeuvre in good ways but also in bad ways.  This strikes me as problematic.</p> <p>  My final point speaks to our amendments, which are trying to specify what the public participation consultation will be.  I will slightly add to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question for the Minister of State to tell us what a public participation statement will be.  Clearly in the provisions for the regulation set out in section 18(4), the Minister of State or his officials must have some notion of what an appropriate time period for public consultation would be, what the arrangements would be for notifications and so on.  Will the Minister of State give us some comfort as to what kind of public participation process it would be?  What are the checks on the difficult aspects of sections 18(2) and 18(3), which I have outlined, that would prevent them from being properly used - I must choose my words very carefully - by a future Minister or future officials who are not as committed to public participation, as the Minister of State and his team have made the case here today?</p></speech>

We are genuinely interrogating this because we want to understand fully and for the legislation to be as good as it can be.  When a development plan is being put together there are people in the council department, for example, who may have developed a knowledge and experience over many years in the particular parts for which they are responsible for the drafts.  There is a certain experience and knowledge and so on.  Then there is the established process, which we are always trying to improve, of public participation in that.  We are in new territory here.  One of the things I was very struck by in the industry lobbying, or their vision document, is that essentially they were saying "we have the expertise and nobody else has the expertise".  This was their justification for having a developer-led approach: "we know the stuff and nobody else does".  The question is about who the competent authority is and what sort of expert advice they will depend on for the drafting of plans.  This notion that developers are experts - and one can see why they would want this - and that everybody else does not really know what they are talking about is not the way things are going to be.  As we have said, the huge amount of knowledge and expertise we actually need to input into maritime spatial plans is that of the real stakeholders: the people who know the area, the people who live in the area and people like the fishers and others who know a particular maritime environment.</p><p> I echo the questions about the public participation statement and seek some elaboration on that.  It is stated the Minister may, by regulation, specify those requirements so the Minister of State might explain why this is just "may".  The logic of our amendments is to try to tie down the requirements in terms of public participation in the development of marine spatial plans.</p></speech>

Sections 17(2)(a) and 17(3)(a) indicate "The Minister shall, not later than six years after" when referring to the existing national marine planning framework or a marine spatial plan.  What does that mean in terms of timing for this public participation statement?  Does it mean that, potentially, there would be no public participation statement for a period of six years?  Is that what the proposed legislation implies?  If it is, this section is completely reliant on the public participation statement and there is a potential delay of six years.  Will the Minister of State explain the timing on this or is there a different way of reading the section so it does not potentially allow for a six-year delay before there is a public participation statement?  The entire section of the Bill rests on that public participation statement.  Are we talking about a potential six-year delay in this?</p></speech>

There was a question on meaningful participation and consultation with various groups.  I have been very clear about what we have embarked on with the birth of the national marine planning framework and it being absolutely best-in-class practice.  It is genuinely disappointing to hear suggestions this is tokenistic.</p> <p>  One can look at appendix B.  I noted references to developers and major initiators of offshore renewable energy projects but I can look through the list of people working on the advisory group.  There are six or seven different bodies related to fisheries or seaweed harvesting.  These are all people from the smallest boathouse to the largest renewable energy project and they were facilitated through our advisory group and participation.  I am genuinely a little taken aback by the suggestion that what we were doing was not best in class because it is and has been.</p> <p>  There was mention of "all reasonable measures" but we have been in a pandemic.  We can see that halfway through the consultation it had to go online.  That was in May 2020 for the advisory group in the first instance and, in the second instance, for the consultation event.  It was reasonable to have an event online to bring as many people as possible together.  It was a reasonable measure to try to keep people safe and ensure we met obligations for consultation and to those who are participating.  I had the privilege to chair a number of sessions of the advisory group, where I heard from and saw a screen full of people from every sector around the country.  It was absolutely incredible.  I can say to members that I have experienced this and because of that I know the process was robust.  It was the best I have seen in terms of consultation and participation.</p> <p>  There was a reference to the competent authority and it is clear in section 15 that the Minister shall be the competent authority.  That is in black and white.</p> <p>  The public participation statement is the birth of the process.  It will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and it will be for committees like this one to get involved and try to feed its own ideas into the process, as it has done in the past.  I respectfully say that this would lead to valuable contributions to the process, which is what we want.  Pages 29 and 30 of the Bill outline compliance and what is included in the public participation statement.</p></speech>

I can go back over them.  I thank the Minister of State for indicating the competent authority and I thank him for that clarity.</p> <p>  I am not interrogating the public participation process for the national marine planning framework.  I am looking at this legislation, which may outlive the Minister of State, his officials and all of us.  It is therefore really important we get best practice locked into this as much as possible.  I have heard the Minister of State talking about reasonable steps if there is another pandemic.  Where is there guidance in the legislation to determine what a reasonable step would be to permit non-compliance with the public participation statement?</p> <p>  Likewise, there is mention of a Minister considering it "necessary" or "expedient" and where is that outlined or delineated?  I also asked if the Minister of State could at least give us some flavour of what he expected to be in regulations.  I share the concern of Deputy O'Callaghan, which he articulated much better than I did, with respect to the timeline and lead-in.</p> <p>  I have a further question.  To what does the public participation statement apply?  Will it apply just to spatial plans or will it apply to supplementary amendments or additions to the MSPs?  Will it apply to the review of the national marine planning framework, etc.?  The more information the Minister of State can share with us, the better for everybody.</p></speech>

We appreciate a huge amount of work has gone into the area and we can see the Minister of State is very passionate about the work that has been done.  We are taking a cold look at this legislation to see how it will operate with any Minister or group of officials.  It is our job to do that, and it is not based on current or recent practice.  It is not about making any statement on that.</p> <p>  My specific question concerned section 18(1).  My reading of how it relates to sections 17(2) and 17(3) is that it could allow for a delay of approximately six years until a public participation statement is drawn up.  It refers to being as soon as practicable after those sections are complied with and the sections allow for six years after the existing national marine planning framework's publication.  It could be six years from now.  Am I misreading that?  Is it correct that we could be looking at a six-year delay for this public participation statement being drawn up?  If that is the case, what is the reason, especially given that this is all about the public participation statement?</p></speech>

The Minister of State is lauding the public participation process he went through and I take him at his word at some level.  I was not particularly aware of how it all went.  I am not commenting on the process.  The people I am speaking to, however, who have a concern in this matter do not understand how the relevant projects got slipped in on that basis to the national marine planning framework.  There is much concern and anger about that.  Following from that, is it the case the extended public participation in the development of marine spatial plans is done and dusted for six years?</p><p>There is serious concern about the inclusion of these relevant projects in the national marine planning framework in advance of the sort of detailed marine spatial planning we need to have in advance of major developments in the marine.  That is the concern.  If it were six years, a lot can happen and a lot of damage can be done in six years.  Another matter of considerable concern is the potential for Ministers to walk away from public participation statements that is created by the use in the Bill of language such as "may" and changes as "considered necessary or expedient" in respect of revising statements and so on.</p></speech>

It is not necessary to wait six years.  A review of the plan triggers the public participation statement.</p> <p>  On the competent authority and checks and safeguards, the Minister is the competent authority.  It is up to the committees and Oireachtas structure to hold the Minister to account for his or her actions in drafting the statement.  I am leaving out someone.

Article 9, as the Minister of State noted, is about public participation.  Given the importance of section 17 in terms of how it interacts with section 18 on public participation, surely it would make sense to list Article 9 here.  Can that be addressed?  I do not see why that would not work or how it would take from anything or cause any issues.  Can we look at listing Article 9 in section 17(1)(a)?</p></speech>

Nobody is arguing the Minister should provide a list of everything that is reasonable and unreasonable.  That is not how legislation works.  Even we in the Opposition, with our limited ability to understand innovation, get that, but, either in legislation regulations, there should be some way to determine whether something is reasonable; otherwise it is just left to the discretion of the Minister.  One of my main concerns about section 18 is that subsection 18(5)(c) refers to the Minister only having regard to Article 9.  The wording of section 18 is such that the Minister does not have to comply; he has only to have regard to the article and take reasonable steps to comply regarding the public participation statement, if he or she believes it is expedient or necessary to make changes to it.  We do not know the point at which the public participation statement kicks in with respect to MSPs, DMAPs or anything else.  The Minister of State can surely understand the concern we are articulating.</p></speech>

It goes on to state "Member States shall also ensure that the relevant stakeholders and authorities, and the public concerned, have access to the plans once they are finalised."  That is pretty strong.  Section 17(1)(a) specifies that the competent authority has to comply, or ensure compliance, with the requirements of MSP directive, but, for some odd reason, the strong statement in Article 9, which insists on a certain amount of public information, is omitted.  There are other articles but Article 9, the one that is strong in the directive and which is on public participation, is omitted.  While section 17 outlines that the competent authority must comply, or ensure compliance with the requirements of the directive, the section on giving effect, section 18, is a bit wishy-washy, in our opinion.  That is the concern.  The Minister of State has not really explained why Article 9 is not explicitly referred to so as to let us know what the competent authority must ensure compliance with in respect of the directive.</p></speech>

On amendments to MSPs and designated marine area plans, DMAPs, the detail is in section 28 of the Bill.  I said the article is about giving effect.  That is my clear advice regarding public participation and the associated robust participation.  I have also been very clear that the Oireachtas, as a body, can get involved in the process in respect of how it interprets or gives advice.  The document has to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  If there are further points that I need to clarify, I will have no issue with doing so.</p></speech>

The reason is that significant changes such as this need to be reviewed early so that any teething issues can be addressed.  Six years is a long period to review this.  We must ensure that the national marine planning framework is robust and that this review is a fundamental input to ensuring that it is as robust as possible and informs the framework of this Bill.  That is what amendment No. 83 is about.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State thought, for example, two years was better than one year and wanted to make the case, I am sure we would be open to being reasonable about that, subject to whether it fits the Minister of State's definition of reasonable or not.</p> <p>  Given that we have already passed the national marine planning framework, NMPF, some time ago, six years on top of the time that has elapsed is of concern.  In responding to why the Minister of State will not support this amendment, if he is not to support it, there is something I would like him to explain.  Obviously, we will have the marine protected areas legislation.  There will then be a parallel process of either identifying areas that might have mitigation measures or the designation of areas.  We were told, when we asked a question at an earlier stage, how designation of marine protected areas would be added into the NMPF.  If that is not being reviewed for up to six years, how do we fully incorporate, for example, changes within that period such as designations?</p></speech>

This timeframe is simply too short to accommodate the envisaged participation under this Chapter.  I fully appreciate it was not the intention of Deputes to exclude or diminish the public's role in the development of the next maritime spatial plan, MSP, but that would be the effect of this amendment.  As stated in earlier sessions, the first NMPF will be reviewed within six years.</p> <p>  I reflected on that through the debate and earlier committees.  I stated we potentially will do it earlier, in a few years.  Given it is a new policy and it is a significant policy, it needs a period of time to bed down first because it has to be looked at in the round with the other policies that, as mentioned through this Bill, will give effect to and work with a shared vision through it.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will come in to discuss his role in terms of marine protected areas and how they link in through this Bill.</p></speech>

I can picture the Minister of State's overworked and underpaid officials late last night writing the briefing notes and having a little smile as they added that particular line.  We appreciate the humour, and I mean that genuinely.</p> <p>  I accept one year is too short but I also accept six years is too long.  Would the Minister of State consider, by way of an amendment on Report Stage, slightly shortening the time?  That would still give the Minister of State the flexibility to have it sooner rather than later.  All I am asking the Minister of State is to go away and think.  Six years sounds impossibly long.</p> <p>  With respect to the question regarding the marine protected areas, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will not be able to answer the question that I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, because it is not related to the marine protected areas legislation.  It is specifically related to the national marine planning framework.  I could be wrong, but changes to the national marine planning framework will only be possible consequent to the review, which could be sooner than six years but could be within that timeframe.  If marine protected areas, MPAs, are introduced before there is the review, what is the mechanism in this legislation to incorporate those MPAs into the national marine planning framework so that when, for example, a marine spatial plan is being developed and there is a consequent public participation statement governing public participation they would be required to take into account that MPA designation, which does not currently exist?  It is a reasonable question.</p></speech>

The Bill does not require the Minister to consult as part of that process.  This amendment seeks to create a situation whereby we will not have the Department checking its own work in this regard, and that is why we must have a list of bodies specified that should be consulted, including other Ministers and Departments.  It would oblige the Minister to consider things like any gaps in the plan, such as migratory and foraging routes for marine and bird species, which are important.  The amendment would also oblige the Minister to consider things like the requirement to deliver maritime spatial planning while also achieving good environmental status and the contribution of sea grasses, whales and other sea life to carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  That is an important point.  As I said before, there is little point in us developing renewable wind energy on one hand and then, on the other hand, undermining the contribution that is going to make in respect of climate change mitigation and reducing our carbon emissions if we are causing damage via other carbon emissions in the process.  Therefore, we must be mindful that we are not simply trying to achieve the generation of renewable energy just for the sake of it.  There is a reason we must do that and, in that context, it does not make sense to do anything that undermines our wider goal in the context of reducing carbon emissions.  Amendment No. 85 specifically sets out that the Minister would be obliged to consider those aspects.</p></speech>

All the relevant organisations, bodies and stakeholders should be consulted in any review of a marine spatial plan or the national marine planning framework.  We mention in this regard examples such heritage, which is incredibly important.  One of the things pointed out at a public meeting last night was that there are many wrecks on the Kish Bank, where the construction of the Dublin Array offshore wind farm project is planned, including the HMS Leinster.  In the area of heritage as well, Dublin Bay is also a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, designated biosphere, and, again, this is the area that will be impacted by this proposed development.  Therefore, we must examine all the possible impacts from every conceivable stakeholder perspective.  We have listed in the amendment all the relevant Departments to ensure that there is compliance with the various directives relating to habitats and birds, environmental impact assessments, etc.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State or his officials could answer one question that I was asked in this regard.  I did not know the answer when the query was put to me.  Will the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have a role in assessing reviews of plans - in the context of the plans themselves - regarding proposals for development and the impact of any such development?  I am curious because this question was asked and it seems like a good one.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 84 is a technical amendment to enable amendment No. 85, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said.  Amendment No. 85 sets out new provisions for review requirements of the first NMPF.  They contain many of the same issues as earlier amendments, including limitations on ministerial consultations, while also providing for particular pillars of sustainable development and sectors to the exclusion of others and thereby upsetting the neutrality of the legislation.</p> <p>  Reference is also made to matters relating to marine protected areas that this Bill simply cannot legislate for as they do not yet have a legal existence pending the introduction of the marine protected areas legislation.  While I cannot dwell further on this matter because the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, intends updating the committee in due course, I assure members that any review of the NMPF will be undertaken in the context of the pertaining regulatory environment and the best available information.</p> <p>  The EPA is a prescribed body in the context of strategic environmental assessment and therefore it will come into play in this regard.  Equally, if we look at the national marine planning framework document, all the coastal built heritage sites are mapped out on page 90.  All the UNESCO coastal sites are also mapped out in detail there.  All the shipwrecks in Irish waters are shown on pages 92 and 93.  Therefore, all that information is there in the document on those pages.</p></speech>

They were originally one amendment and were separated by the Bills Office, but the Minister of State and his advisers know that.</p> <p>  Again, one thing that might help to clarify some of the confusion some of us are experiencing would be if the Minister of State in his response, and in as plain a form of English as is possible, were to give a sense of the relationship between maritime spatial plans and the national marine planning framework.  I ask that because I think that when many of us thought about a review of the national marine planning framework, we thought it would be a big-bang review in which the entire framework would be reviewed.  That was partly the reason for the earlier amendments.</p> <p>  The more I hear, though, the more I seem to be hearing that it could be a big-bang review or it could be a series of incremental reviews as maritime spatial plans or other things are developed.  If the Minister of State could explain some of the context a little more, that might allay some of the fears we have.  To give an example, these amendments relate to a new maritime spatial plan, but if the national marine planning framework is itself a collection of maritime spatial plans, albeit being produced in one initial process, could the review of the NMPF then be a process where marine spatial plans amend and update the national marine planning framework and thereby constitute multiple reviews over time?  Is that a correct way of understanding what this means?  Is that one option that exists?</p> <p>  This aspect goes back then to the question I asked previously about the public participation statement.</p><p>If it is potentially a series of micro reviews of sub-geographical areas, then when the first marine spatial plan is produced that, in itself, would constitute the beginning of the review of the national marine planning framework, which would trigger the public participation statement.  If that is the case, it would be helpful if the Minister of State could confirm that or explain it a little more clearly than I have tried to do.</p></speech>

It also sets out a series of detailed requirements for plan makers and project proposers alike in respect of the various headings set out in the Bill, for example, heritage and environmental protection.

That means, for example, that when a review of the national marine planning framework is triggered, that could be the development of one or more marine spatial plans which as they are developed, with their public participation statements informing the public participation, then amend the national marine planning framework.  Likewise, within those MSPs there are DMAPs and they are amended, so it is a constant evolving process.  The reason I am saying this is that if that is the case, that answers the question for which we were seeking an answer earlier.  The moment either an individual MSP is to be developed or a there is a macro review, the public participation statement kicks in and there is public participation.</p></speech>

It states, &quot;This section shall not apply to a MSP to which <i>Chapter 4</i>applies.&quot;  Chapter 4 relates to &quot;Laying of certain DMAPs before CPAs&quot;, not marine spatial plans, MSPs.  Maybe I read it wrongly.  It seems to me that it is an error in the Bill.  If not, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>On amendment No. 97, I will not repeat the long discussion that we had about the allegedly excessive nature of the Oireachtas oversight, scrutiny and decision-making but I want to make a point.  I am not looking to fight the battle we had previously again.  The Minister of State has said on a number of occasions and is right that the Oireachtas has an important role to play.  The difficulty is that the Oireachtas and its committees are not always of the one mind.  Many of us wanted to have a small amount of additional scrutiny of the national marine planning framework.  We did not get it.  We felt that was a limitation.  That is at the discretion of the Government since the Government, unless it is a minority Government, controls a majority of votes when deciding to give time.  While I am not in any way questioning the depth of the public consultation on the national marine planning framework, there are organisations that are on public record as having felt that, while they engaged, they were not necessarily listened to.  That may or may not be the case.  Not everybody can be listened to, heard and have their views incorporated all the time but it is much better if some form of Oireachtas engagement, oversight, scrutiny and decision-making is included for such important plans.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this.  He does not have to read out the same briefing note he had last time but I urge him to consider some greater level of formalised Oireachtas committee involvement in these developments because it would enhance the process.</p><p>When the national planning framework was being developed, the level of Oireachtas involvement was far greater, especially committee involvement.  That was probably a reflection of the fact that it was a minority Government and therefore the negotiations with Government partners were different.  My feeling as a committee member was that the committee did not have as much engagement with the national marine planning framework as we did with the national planning framework.  Setting some of those things out in the context of MSPs and DMAPs in legislation would be a welcome thing for the Minister of State to consider.</p></speech>

Those decisions have been taken.  I am not looking to reopen them.  I am saying that where the level of Oireachtas committee engagement is set out in legislation or by way of regulation, that would ensure that it happens.  Where it is not set out, it is at the discretion of a committee, the Government or the composition of forces in the Oireachtas.  Irrespective of where one stood on the amicable disagreement that we had previously, some of this should be specified more.  That is clearly not an attempt to convince the Minister of State to support this terribly excessive amendment, as he called it, but we should have something better than we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It states that section 19 is not to apply to plans to which Chapter 4 applies, relating to the requirement to lay the intended development plan before the Oireachtas.</p><p>I would like to understand the rationale for that.  I am guessing the Minister of State will say it is because it is the ones that are dealing with local authorities and where they intend to make plans.  I would like to hear his explanation.  I cannot see any reason to accept the requirement for the intention to make a marine spatial plan before the Oireachtas.</p><p> Regarding amendment No. 97, the Bill requires that an intention to make a marine spatial plan would be laid before the Oireachtas and will have regard for recommendations of any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it does not go as far as ours does in requiring that all committees be notified.  That is quite important in that the impact of marine spatial plans can cross many areas.  I suspect that many committees that might have an interest in the stuff we are discussing here are not even aware of how it may potentially impact them or for that matter how the national marine planning framework may impact things that are of concern to them.  The requirement to alert all Oireachtas committees to any intention to make marine special plans is important so that they have the opportunity to give input into those and those inputs need to be taken seriously.  There is a wider requirement for the public to be notified of any intention to make marine special plans.  We should be thorough in ensuring that the public is made aware of that and has the opportunity to give input to such plans.</p></speech>

That subsection disapplies the Oireachtas approval procedure in respect of a specific subset of DMAPS set out in Chapter 4.  I believe that the Members may misunderstand the intention and function of this provision and may wish to withdraw the amendment following further explanation.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 is applicable to DMAPs where a local authority is the designated competent authority and the DMAP is within its proposed nearshore area.  It could also apply to DMAPs where more than one local authority and nearshore is involved.  Instead of Oireachtas approval, oversight and democratic legitimacy is provided by a vote in the local authority concerned.  It is envisaged to be used in circumstances where a local authority may wish to develop a DMAP in parallel with county or local area development plans.  There may be 31 county-based DMAPs and countless local plans.  I do not believe that it is the Members' intention that each single one be subject to Oireachtas approval.  If accepted this amendment might mean the national Legislature does little else during its sessions.  </p> <p>  We also need to be conscious of the message the Oireachtas would be sending to the local authorities by requiring both local and national democratic approval.  In essence these Houses would be saying that a local authority cannot be trusted in terms of its jurisdiction.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 97 proposes revised procedures for Oireachtas approval.  I believe that the measures set out in the Bill - early notification of the Oireachtas through the public participation statement - will enable Oireachtas engagement at a far earlier stage where any proposals made can influence and shape the development of plans.  This will be far more effective and efficient than seeking to retrofit a plan towards the end of its development.  The Oireachtas approval procedure set out in section 19 of the Bill is deemed sufficient.</p></speech>

This was the original intention but the text as initiated was inoperable in this regard.  These amendments make the necessary disapplications and adjustments to procedures.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 98 is a technical amendment to enable amendment No. 104.  Amendment No. 104 inserts a new section 20(7) to enable the delegation of responsibility for a DMAP to another competent authority "D" following its preparation and publication.  This provision would enable another body to undertake a review of the DMAP in question.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 109 corrects a typographical error in section 24.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 111 sets out a new section 29 containing the technical revisions to the DMAP procedure necessary to enable preparation by the competent authority "M".  These relate primarily to where the competent authority "M" had a procedural role regarding the preparation of a DMAP by the competent authority "D".  It does not change the fundamental considerations or obligations in respect of making a DMAP.  Proposal, publication, participation statement and Oireachtas approval all still apply.</p> <p>  Section 29(4) disapplies the designation procedure under section 20; modifies section 21 to allow the competent authority "M" to act as it if were the competent authority "D" and with the same obligations save that it does not have to approve its own proposal; modifies section 22(1) to allow for the publication of the DMAP proposal to serve in place of a designation under section 20; disapplies section 22(4) where a competent authority "D" could make a new proposal where the original was not approved; disapplies section 24 providing for oversight of the competent authority "D"; disapplies section 25(2) relating to section 24; disapplies section 26(2) relating to ministerial directives; disapplies section 28(4) relating to non-material amendments; and modifies 28(5) to provide for these changes.</p> <p>  I now turn to the remaining amendments in this grouping.  Amendments Nos. 99 to 103, inclusive, collectively seek to limit who can be designated as a competent authority to Ministers of Government.  Section 20 of the initiated text provides that any body that meets the definition of public body may be designated as a competent authority "D" to prepare a DMAP.  This would be a severe restriction and would mean that a local authority would not be allowed to prepare a DMAP to align with its county development plan or local area plan.  It would prevent bodies such as the Marine Institute, the EPA or even MARA to be designated.  </p> <p>  We all want high-quality DMAPs that do all the wonderful things we have set out in sections 21 and 22.  We all want those DMAPs to be developed in a comprehensive fashion.  We all want that development process to have best practice participation.  It is acknowledged that not every public body has the necessary capacity, competency or skill sets to prepare a DMAP and it is intended to be very mindful of these matters when designating.  It should be noted that such designations would only be undertaken following an engagement process with the body concerned and, where relevant, its parent Department.</p><p>On review, we have inadvertently used too broad a definition of public body in respect of such a designation.  As defined in the Bill it includes Ministers, local authorities and bodies established under enactment.  It also includes companies.  While appropriate in other contexts, it would not be appropriate for such a company to prepare a DMAP.  I intend to propose a Report Stage amendment to so modify the definition of "public body" for the purposes of this section.  The amendments proposed by the Deputies cannot be accepted.  They may wish to withdraw these amendments in light of this further explanation.</p></speech>

That is not in any way criticising the Minister of State for reading the technical import of the amendments into the record because that has to be done.  However, people sitting at home who have just listened to our series of conversations about the NMPF and the MSPs will be legitimately asking what a DMAP is and how it relates to the MSPs.  I ask the Minister of State to provide us with some clarity on what a DMAP is likely to look like or involve, in terms of its geographical size, its sectoral import and whether it could be activity-related rather than geographical, etc.</p> <p>  Second, I would like the Minister of State to give us more clarity on the kinds of agencies we are likely to see designated by "M" as "D".  I know that sounds like a James Bond movie but that is essentially what we are talking about here.  I have no difficulty with a competent authority such as MARA being given a role but it is reasonable for the committee to get some clarity from the Minister of State because there is an intention here.  I am speculating on this as much in the hope that the Minister of State will say I am wrong as that I am right.  With respect to offshore wind, for example, could the competent authority be another Department that is responsible for regulation of energy?  Would it therefore come under the Minister?  Under what circumstances would MARA or a local authority deal with that?  With local authorities it is a little bit clearer because they are more limited in their scope.  Who is likely to be designated "D" by "M", or "M" by "D", and for what purpose?  A little more information on that would help us to clarify and determine whether we press our amendments.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to explain how the two interact.  If the DMAPs are providing for further granularity and specification for an MSP, they will need to be developed consistently with the methodology requirements of the marine spatial planning directive and be properly approved by the Oireachtas.  Will this happen?</p> <p>  Amendment No. 110 relates to mitigation measures, which are important.  This amendment seeks to protect them and ensure that measures are included to avoid impacts on the integrity of European or Natura 2000 sites.  The Bill allows for quite a lot of discretion and that could alter and affect mitigation and have an effect on the Natura sites so it is important to have this amendment.  I previously referenced the importance of doing something like they have done in Scotland in terms of mitigation and renewable energy, where every licence contributes to the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund.  That is a good model of mitigation.  There are other site-specific mitigation measures as well.  That is what amendment No. 110 is about.</p></speech>

That is a snapshot of what type of body it may be.</p><p>I see the DMAP as a sub-national plan.  It is like the terrestrial planning system for a county.  There is the county development plan and underneath that, breathing life into the shared vision of the county development plan, is the local area plan.  That may be around a town, an area or a community that tries to chart the development with key public participation of that community into the future that the members would vote on, where particular micro-pointed development would happen.  That is on a more micro level and it is the same with the DMAPs.  They breathe life again into the national planning framework.  A DMAP is a more micro document that would be brought forward by an authority, as referenced, to try to give a more specific plan for that designated area.  I refer to page 197 of the NMPF.  I keep referring back to that document because it is so good.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	A DMAP will be a management plan for a specific area of our marine waters and can be used to develop multi-activity area plans; to promote use of specific activities; and/or for the purposes of the sustainable use and protection of particular marine environments. </blockquote></speech>

For example, if a local authority decided that it wanted a particular marine area, would that be limited to the nearshore area?  If that area went beyond the nearshore, since it still had an interest could it request to be designated to develop this more localised form of plan?  What happens if multiple public bodies have an interest in a particular area?  How does that work?  The Minister of State mentioned the energy regulator, heritage bodies and local authorities.  They might all have interest in the same area and all wish to develop a DMAP for the same area or for areas that overlap.  How will all that work?  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate a bit on that.  Can a body seeking to develop a DMAP for a particular area start to request designation to develop a DMAP as soon as this legislation is passed?</p></speech>

They can have accountability to Ministers and so forth but different State agencies, Ministers and Departments will come at this with different perspectives.  Some could be particularly tied or may not be so neutral in how they look at this.  Some could be very much geared towards one particular area, such as renewable energy or something like that.  They could be looking at it just from that sphere and under this legislation they would have the ability to do the DMAP.</p><p>Does it not create potential concerns that they might not be neutral or that they might not look at the wider issues sufficiently although, obviously, they will do some of that?  Does it also not create a bit of difficulty around competence and expertise in that it could be spread between too many different bodies and, thus, create a bit of inefficiency?  Whereas some of these State agencies might have the competence and expertise in terms of marine biodiversity, others might not.  Does that not create certain issues and, potentially, create a process where there could be some deficiencies?  The Minister of State might address those points.</p></speech>

With regard to different plans coming forward, we want to challenge agencies in the spirit of coexistence in our maritime area.  It will be up to the relevant Minister to adjudicate on whether to permit the DMAP to go forward.  Outside of the local authority system, a DMAP has to be approved by the Oireachtas.

I will read the information I have on it.  The Bill is to establish an updated marine spatial planning toolkit that will now include DMAP procedures.  Step one is the enactment.  As is the case elsewhere in the EU, national plans come first, followed by sub-national planning which may take many forms.  Under the legislation, it is envisaged that over time there will be an ever-increasing body of DMAPs and they will all become part of the national marine planning framework.  No decision has been taken on the form, location or extent of the first DMAPs.  The focus is on enacting the necessary procedural toolkit set out in the Bill.  Once the Bill is enacted, we will move on to the next phase and plan of the development.</p></speech>

That Department would, therefore, have a set of expertise in that area, with responsibility to lead a DMAP for the geographical, or sub-regional, area that currently incorporates the legacy projects.

Following on from that, as soon as this legislation is enacted there could conceivably be a massive race between various bodies to grab areas for DMAPs, depending on what their particular interests are.  In fact, I am tempted to participate in that race in respect of certain areas.  Is it a case of whatever body gets in first gets the area?  If a particular Department, and the one mentioned is the very obvious one, states that it wants to get these projects through and it applies to be the competent authority for the development of that DMAP, which it might well do for that area, is it a case of "on your marks, get set, go" to grab particular areas?  The local authority might state that it is concerned about the thing just out here, and that it is in a race against the Department that is primarily about advancing, for example, offshore wind.  Is that the sort of scenario we could, potentially, face?</p></speech>

We see it as bodies that have to coexist in our maritime area and trying to achieve the best for it.  All those bodies have to go through the rigorous and robust thresholds contained in the NMPF regarding all those areas.  The Minister will have to make a determination on that, as will the Oireachtas, subsequently.  There are significant safety catches in any decision that will be made.</p></speech>

That is good on one level, but people might say that particular bits of the NMPF, such as the visual, tourism and heritage aspects, are in line with the DMAP they want for a particular area and they want to vindicate the objectives of the NMPF, but it might be, rather, precisely to prevent certain other types of usage taking place in particular areas.  By the way, that might not be a bad thing, in certain cases.  On coexistence, co-location and all of that, is it a requirement that every objective of the NMPF is in every DMAP for every localised area?  Surely, it is not, because then there would be a requirement, for example, in every DMAP-designated area, to have a bit of this, that and the other thing, when it might not be suitable in certain areas to do certain things as against other things.  I ask for a little clarification on that.</p></speech>

It is not that we will have one sector in the maritime area, at the cost of all other users or all other conditions.  The Minister will have to make a determination based on the shared vision for the NMPF, policy, that the proposal meets the threshold on the requirements and that it is good policy for our maritime area.  The Oireachtas will make a determination subsequent to that.</p></speech>

I just have questions.  I ask the Minister of State to return to my first question on the relationship between an MSP and a DMAP.  I am not clear about that because it is not explained on page 197 of the NMPF.</p> <p>  With respect to section 23, the instigation of a DMAP, or the appointment of a public body for the purposes of drafting it, would constitute, essentially, the beginning of a review of the NMPF, if it came before a MSP, for the purpose of the public participation statement.  Is it likely, however, that a DMAP would come first or is it more likely that a marine spatial plan will?  It is just a technical question.</p> <p>  On section 25, the Minister of State is correct in stating that a report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  Is it the intention, or hope, of the Minister of State with this legislation that the Oireachtas Business Committee will refer it to the relevant committee for consideration as we do, for example, with other planning matters?  On foot of that, there would be a motion for approval, with or without debate.  Does the Minister of State envisage a role for the relevant committee, depending on what agency is developing the DMAP? </p></speech>

Again, in the first instance, the DMAP is on a more micro level.  The NMPF sits at the top of the tree, with the policy statement on top of that.  We then get to a more micro area that has been designated for activity or activities as outlined in the relevant NMPF section or, for whatever other reason, the Minister may make an assessment on an application that comes before him or her.  The Oireachtas will have to determine thereafter.  It is on a more micro level and it then becomes part of the MSP.</p></speech>

The witnesses to be heard today are Dr. Alan Barrett, director of the Economic and Social and Research Institute, and Dr. Martina Lawless, associate research professor at the Economic and Social Research Institute.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means a witness has a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the direction of the Chair.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside of the proceedings of the committee of any matters arising from these set proceedings.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, all members must confirm they are on the grounds of Leinster House.  Members participating in the committee meeting from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature and if their participation is covered by absolute privilege.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  On Covid guidance, members in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risks of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene.  Members will note every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge members not to move their chair from its current position.  Members must also always maintain the appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical nature should be worn at all times at the meeting except when speaking.  I ask those present for the full co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  Before we invite the witnesses to make the their opening statements, the Chairman, Deputy Lisa Chambers, will take the Chair now.</p></speech>

The trade and co-operation agreement signed in December 2020 meant tariff and quota-free trade was retained between the UK and EU.  It therefore avoided the most negative potential economic scenario of high tariffs impeding Irish trade with the UK.  However, the agreement did not retain the <i>status quo</i>of free market access, and a range of non-tariff barriers in the form of new regulatory and customs procedures were put in place from the start of January 2021.<br/><br/>We have been examining the impact of the increased costs associated with these changes to trade requirements over the previous months.  An important issue to take account of when examining recent trade figures is how to isolate the impact of Brexit from other factors, most specifically the changes in trade flows across the past year and a half as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We have been doing this by comparing trade flows between the UK and all EU member states with trade in the same products across all global trade partners to separate the UK-specific Brexit effect from the impact of Covid-19, which applies to international trade more widely.</p><p>For overall trade between the UK and EU, the direct impact of Brexit has led to a 36% decline in aggregate EU imports from the UK and a fall in exports to the UK of 24%.  The time path of the Brexit impact shows that the reductions in both directions of trade were particularly sharp in January and February followed by some recovery in March.  The subsequent effects from April to July have been relatively stable.  </p><p> The direct impact of Brexit estimated by our statistical model accounts for approximately two thirds of the observed year-on-year change in trade with the remainder due to other factors such as Covid-19 disruptions to trade.  For Ireland, we have estimated that the direct impact of Brexit has been to reduce imports coming from the UK to Ireland by 45%.  For exports from Ireland to the UK, in contrast, we estimate that little of the reduction observed over the past year can be attributed solely to Brexit.  However, although the impact of Brexit on total exports has so far been limited, some individual sectors have faced substantial reductions in their exports to Great Britain.  In particular, the food and beverages sectors have experienced large falls in exports to Great Britain that can be linked directly to a Brexit impact with reductions of approximately 25% for food exports and more than 40% reduction in beverages exports in the first half of 2021.</p><p> The effects of Brexit in the first half of 2021 have, therefore, been quite asymmetric, with a much larger change in imports than in exports.  The share of Ireland&rsquo;s imports from the UK was 33% in 2015 before the Brexit referendum and is now just 12%.  The share of the UK in Irish exports has fallen from 14% to 8% in the same period.  The uneven impact on imports rather than exports can be explained by the immediate introduction of customs requirements from the EU side but a more gradual phased-in approach on the UK side.  This means that the risks posed by Brexit in terms of increased costs to Irish exporters have not yet fully materialised with further changes to customs requirements scheduled to be introduced by the UK in January and July 2022.</p><p> When we look at how Brexit has impacted trade, we find clearly that all of the decline in Irish-UK trade since January 2021 is driven by Great Britain.  In contrast, trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland trade has increased considerably.  This increase has been primarily on the side of imports from Northern Ireland, which have grown by close to 90% as a result of Brexit.  In 2015, Northern Ireland accounted for approximately 1.5 per cent of both total Irish imports and exports.  This year, the share of Northern Ireland has gone up to 5% of total Irish imports.  The food and beverages sectors have shown particularly large increases in the shares of imports originating in Northern Ireland.</p><p> While the increase in Irish imports from Northern Ireland is significant, it does not offset the decline in trade with Great Britain.  Trade has also been diverted to other members of the EU and to the rest of the world as shown by the changes in transport routes with the increase in direct shipping to Europe suggesting both a change in Irish supply chains and also avoidance of the UK landbridge.  Data released by the CSO on volumes handled by Irish ports show that the tonnages going from Irish to UK ports in the second quarter of 2021 were down 18% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and a similar reduction in percentage terms for tonnages arriving.  I am comparing those figures to 2019 to avoid the complicating factor of Covid-19 in the 2020 figures.</p><p> One risk, which we drew attention to in previous appearances before this committee, was how increased costs of trade might feed into consumer prices.  Although inflation overall has picked up substantially in recent months, we note that food prices have been relatively stable.  This was the area where concern was most focused regarding the impact of Brexit given the large share of grocery imports from the UK.  This suggests that supply chain adjustment by firms have mitigated much of the potential risk in this particular area.</p><p> A number of potential long-run impacts of Brexit are still unknown, particularly in regard to regulatory divergence, which may further increase the cost of trade between the UK and the EU.  </p><p> Limited international travel during the Covid-19 pandemic means that we have yet to see what, if any, changes Brexit might bring to migration patterns with restrictions on migration into the UK potentially leading to greater flows into Ireland.  Likewise, with the UK outside of the EU Single Market, the attractiveness of Ireland to foreign direct investment, FDI, that may have located in the UK may increase further.</p><p> The growth in trade with Northern Ireland and its unique status in respect of access to both the EU and UK markets could feed into broader economic linkages across the island, with enhanced co-operation in economic and other areas being supported by the shared island initiatives of the Government.  While this will be seen in positive terms by some, it should be acknowledged that others will see the increased trade as resulting from an obstacle imposed on Great Britain and Northern Ireland trade by the Northern Ireland protocol.  It remains to be seen how the ongoing dispute with regard to the protocol will be resolved and whether any resulting changes to the protocol will see a partial reversal of the increased trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  More generally on the protocol, continued uncertainty with regard to its operation is likely to be limiting the extent to which Northern Ireland can benefit from its unique status.  A successful resolution could see increased investment in Northern Ireland and, in the long run, a strengthened Northern Ireland economy which would be positive for all on the island of Ireland.</p><p> We will be happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

If the distortion in trade coming from the UK in the research has shown an increase of 90% coming from the Six Counties, has this research revealed where the rest of that trade has come from to fill the gap created by the fall-off in activity from the UK?</p> <p>  She mentioned that there have been relatively similar volumes of trade between here and the UK but she nonetheless identified a significant drop in food and beverages.  Have some services increased to maintain that equilibrium or has she observed anything in that particular area?</p></speech>

In terms of where the trade has diverted, there have been large increases in imports from Northern Ireland.  There has been a relatively even spread between increases in imports from the rest of the EU and changes in imports from the rest of the world.  We looked to see if trade had diverted from any one individual member state, such as France or Belgium, where links would be strong, but we were not able to identify it as being driven by an individual country.  It seems the increase and the change in supply chains were relatively evenly spread.</p> <p>  As to where the trade has fallen particularly sharply in food and beverages, it is more the case that those particular sectors were notably impacted, whereas in other sectors we were not able to attribute fully any falls in trade to a definitively Brexit impact rather than other issues such Covid-19, which was reducing trade flows overall.  We did not identify any particular areas where trade had increased.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned services.  I should highlight that this analysis is focused entirely on goods trade.  The reason for this is that the data on goods trade is released monthly whereas we will not have any official data on services trade until early next year because it is only released on an annual basis.</p></speech>

Has the ESRI looked at or has it any data on the capacity of companies within that region to continue to grow to meet our demand?  It makes sense if goods can be sourced on the island of Ireland.  It would be cheaper to get them here.  I assume it is a matter of the capacity of these companies to grow to meet that demand.  Has Professor Lawless seen any projected data on that area?</p></speech>

Sectors that have fallen in respect of sourcing imports from Great Britain are precisely the same food and beverage sectors where a large volume of trade has been reorientated to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

This does not change from the perspective of her statistics but I am just trying to understand the mechanics of what has happened on the ground.</p></speech>

The certainty over the protocol is perhaps almost limiting the ability of companies to fully take advantage of that.</p><p>Many of these investments may need certainty over the longer term.  We can already see the big increase in trade coming from Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Lawless.  It is useful work.</p></speech>

Senator Dooley pitched it quite sensibly in the sense this can only be positive from an economic point of view.  Some could argue what was happening previously was the most efficient and good way of running things.  Then one has this artificial barrier placed in trade in order that one could have a distortion.  Some would argue it is sub-optimal in some shape or form, because, it is only arising from these.  We need to see over time precisely how it works out.</p></speech>

I found the information and the statistics presented to us quite startling.  From a business perspective, I am just trying to get into the shoes of the Northern Ireland company that found, through Brexit, it was difficult to trade on the mainland, a term some would like to use.  Trade has been increased with the Republic on the same island.  From a profit perspective, one would imagine it would be more profitable for those same Northern Ireland companies to be trading on the same island, from the cost of getting goods across the Irish Sea.  Was that business always there?  Is it only now they are realising that business was always there?  One would imagine, from a business and cost-analysis perspective, the closer to home one's market is, the more desirable and profitable that would be.  What are the witnesses' opinion on that aspect?  </p> <p>  When one looks at Northern Ireland post-Brexit, one would imagine the best of both worlds, as Dr. Lawless already stated, in that it can have unencumbered trade with the UK and any trade deals the UK may sign up to going forward and trade within the EU.  I do not know if that penny has dropped yet with some people in Northern Ireland.  It would appear to have serious potential.</p> <p>  The only downside to that is this ongoing dispute on the protocol.  Some would say it is in the UK Government's political advantage to keep this on the boil over a period of time.  I fear this thing will never go away and politically, it seems to be a very advantageous drum to be beaten, from politics at home in the UK.  How will that scenario play out eventually?  One would imagine if it is good for Northern Ireland, it will be good for the entire island and that the whole island could benefit from this new arrangement.  The only thing holding this back is the protocol.  I do not know what the witnesses' thoughts are on that.</p></speech>

It is important to realise it has become more expensive and difficult for Ireland to import from Great Britain.  Much of the increase the Deputy has seen in trade with Northern Ireland has not been so much that Northern Ireland businesses were not always taking advantage of opportunities in Ireland, but more that businesses in Ireland have now discovered it is cheaper, easier and more convenient to deal with companies in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain.  We have particularly noticed that much of the shift or the sectors that have fallen most in terms of what we are bringing in from Great Britain, food and beverages, are the ones in which we have seen the biggest increase from Northern Ireland.  Much of the diversion to Northern Ireland has been as a result of it being more difficult to source goods from Great Britain, rather than that Northern Ireland firms were not already taking advantage there.</p> <p>  As we should have pointed out in the opening statement, Northern Ireland is a relatively small part of the UK as a whole.  The large increase in trade from Northern Ireland of 90% is a 90% increase of the 10% of trade.  It does not in any way offset the trade falls from the much larger economic partner.  However, it shows Northern Ireland is uniquely placed in that the terms of the protocol allow it to continue selling and increase its sales not just into Ireland, but all of the EU, where firms previously may have been sourcing things from Great Britain, while also maintaining its market access to the latter.  If the protocol works, as everybody would hope it does, that should put Northern Ireland businesses in a really strong position to attract extra investment and sell into both markets.</p> <p>  The one gap we have in our data analysis is, because, trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is internal and not international, it is not reflected in these numbers.  We cannot say that some of this trade that has increased from Northern Ireland to Ireland is because trade has fallen between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  We do not know that is the case at all nor to what extent trade from Britain to Northern Ireland has changed.  As the data are collected in a different way for these internal flows, it will be into the early part of next year, when the annual surveys of Northern Ireland businesses are completed.  We can get some small sense from transport statistics available on a more up-to-date basis, but they do not tell us precisely what values are being imported into Northern Ireland.  We have the trade movements.  One needs to add up where the trade is going.  We have three or four of the angles, but we do not have the connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to fully see whether overall trade has changed or just been reallocated across the different routes.</p></speech>

I agree regarding the gap in information.  I am sure the gap in respect of trade from the North of Ireland into Britain and <i>vice versa</i>is frustrating from an economic perspective.  It is also politically frustrating for us as Oireachtas Members.  It is to be hoped that we can get to the point where it is no longer a case of cursing in the dark but, rather, lighting a candle in terms of some of those statistics informing all of our work going forward.<br/><br/>My colleagues have covered many of the issues I wished to raise.  This may seem like an obvious question but I want to put it to the witnesses anyway.  In the context of the figure in respect of the increase in trade North to South, would that have happened without the protocol?  I appreciate that probably seems obvious, but it is important that we remind ourselves of the dynamics of the situation we are in and the insulation and protections that the protocol offers to businesses here.  Reference was made to the 90% increase and where that sits in the context of trade falling or increasing elsewhere.  How much room is there to grow that trade through a dedicated piece of work that promotes the protocol and informs businesses about it?  Is it something that could be grown exponentially if dedicated supports, plans and processes are put in place?</p></speech>

We have seen from the fall in trade between Ireland and Great Britain that the new obstacles put in place, such as the new costs of data, customs procedures and so on, have been an impediment to trade.  Those are a result of Brexit.  Essentially, the protocol protects businesses in Northern Ireland from the negative impact of Brexit.  That is very much an increase in trade that would not have occurred if the protocol were not in place; in fact, it would have been quite the opposite.  Northern Ireland trade would have fallen significantly if the protocol was not in place to maintain the access of Northern Ireland to both the EU and UK markets.</p> <p>  As regards the potential for Northern Ireland to grow further, I have not done any specific work on that.  It is an issue at which we hope to look.  I do not wish to speculate by giving precise numbers but there is a very strong case that Northern Ireland is in a good position to benefit from this unique situation of having easy access to two large markets.  If the uncertainty relating to the operation and permanency of the protocol can be put to one side, the economic benefits of Northern Ireland having access to both these markets would be significant.  We are clear in terms of making it an attractive place to invest-----</p></speech>

I know the committee has engaged with businesses north and south of the Border and everything like that.  Of course, we in the ESRI hear the very same thing, which is that all that businesses want to know is exactly what are the arrangements with which they must deal on a long-term basis, subject to these being reasonably sensible.  It is about certainty and knowing what has to be done.  Their view is that they will then engage and trade and do all the positive things they need to do.  It is interesting to consider that the protocol is assisting with trade, as Dr. Lawless mentioned, and, in a sense, insulating Northern Ireland from the worst impacts of Brexit in terms of trade disruption.  The investment should be the next wave of this.  Northern Ireland should be a very attractive place to invest for people within Northern Ireland or from the Republic of Ireland or internationally.  The fact that it is a place from which someone can trade into two markets should be very positive as well.  However, the great misfortune in the current situation is the uncertainty in respect of the operation of the protocol.  There are obvious uncertainties in respect of how this plays out immediately.  There is the issue of the vote in 2024.  These are unfortunate circumstances.  If politicians North and South or wherever can collectively achieve greater certainty in respect of the protocol, the economic benefit of that could be considerable.</p></speech>

I have always admired the work of the ESRI and, therefore, it is a pleasure and an honour to have Dr. Barrett and Dr. Lawless in the room with us.  When I hear Brexit, I also think about climate and carbon footprint.  Is work being done to consider not just the economic benefits but also the environmental benefits of this cross-Border support for businesses?  There is a significant opportunity associated with the much lower carbon footprint of selling products to the North or bringing goods from the North down here compared with that of importing goods from other countries, such as England, mainland Europe, China and all the other places we import mad things from.  There is a significant opportunity there as COP26 takes place and the climate emergency becomes clear.  Is anybody thinking about the fact that this can be a positive if the protocol is used to promote businesses and give householders and businesses an opportunity to be part of the solution and stop buying stuff from everywhere else because they can get it from businesses in Northern Ireland or in southern Ireland.  That should be part of this discussion.  Brexit has happened and we now need to look at positive ways of working with what we have.  We are missing a trick in respect of the carbon footprint and the benefits of an all-island promotion of business.  I am not sure if all the businesses in the North are aware of all the stuff they can access from the South and<i>vice versa</i>and I do not know if anything is being done about that.</p></speech>

The Senator asked the question specifically in the context of the protocol and trade and it is clear there are implications there, but what has come about in the past year or two is an increased discussion in respect of the shared island, if I can use that phrase, or on an all-island basis.  As everyone in the room will be aware, discussing environmental and climate issues even at a national level does not make a lot of sense as these are global issues.  However, it is certainly the case that the craziness of discussing issues such as climate and biodiversity on a 26-county basis and a six-county basis has been emerging more strongly.  That was presented most starkly to the ESRI in the context of an environmental model we started developing - obviously, we have been doing economic modelling for the Twenty-six Counties for many years - that linked macroeconomics in the Twenty-six Counties or the State of Ireland to greenhouse gas emissions.  It was pointed out what a limited way of looking at this issue that is, that we should be looking at it, at least, on a 32-county basis.  We really should be thinking about issues such as biodiversity, water quality and a host of other environmental issues on a 32-county basis.  I do not know if it is an effect of Brexit or the shared island unit or another matter, but we in the ESRI are certainly being prompted much more to think about those sort of issues on that basis.  Of course, whatever about the political sensitivities, North and South, everybody can agree that it is much more sensible to consider matters such as water quality and biodiversity on a 32-county basis.  We are trying to do our bit in terms of the analysis and the modelling on that sort of a basis.  Our job then is to feed those results into the policy sphere.  For us, that normally involves feeding them into the policy sphere in Dublin, be that through the Oireachtas or Departments or whatever, but we are certainly trying to up our game in informing Northern Ireland policymakers as well to bring greater rationality to it.  That is not a direct answer to the Senator's question but I hope she will appreciate that it is prompting interesting thoughts more generally.</p></speech>

Of course, water quality and biodiversity is a whole other huge question.  That is not what I was probing.  For example, through Brexit, we have a lot of statistics on imports and exports with England.  I do not know if anyone is using those figures to see how we can be more resilient and sustainable as a country.  At one of this committee's first meetings, I mentioned that we were importing 110,000 tonnes of potatoes, between seed potatoes from Scotland and edible potatoes from England.  I would love to see us using the statistics we have gathered from Brexit to see how the whole island, the Republic and the North, could become more resilient.  We have to help each other out.  It is one island, irrespective of borders and with the climate emergency, we will have to support each other.</p> <p>  My first question asked if we were doing anything to promote businesses North and South, looking at carbon reduction rather than importing everything.  It is a whole other thing, that is right, and it is different from water quality and biodiversity.  We could have a whole other meeting about that.</p></speech>

While we have talked about the positive growth of trade on the island of Ireland, there is also a diversion of trade away from the United Kingdom.  Some of the benefit that might be gained through more condensed trade might be lost because we are not trading as cohesively in terms of the two islands together.</p></speech>

Northern Ireland as a relatively small economic unit is not able to replace all the trade that we were getting in from Great Britain and some of that has been diverted further afield.  When we look at trade flows, we are always very conscious of distance.  Generally, trading over shorter distances is much more efficient and cheaper.  We have considered distance not so much from the perspective of carbon footprint, but more as an actual cost of getting the goods to market etc., although the two are obviously very closely correlated and it is an area that could be gone into in greater depth.</p></speech>

Is it a commitment?  The climate is affecting every Department.  If the ESRI is saying it has not considered that before, I would love to hear that it is something not that it could do but that it will do.  From talking to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and doing loads of research, there is a huge issue with small businesses knowing their carbon footprints.  There is a whole body of work that needs to be done around that.  We did all this work on Brexit and collected all the statistics, and we must have paid loads of consultants loads of money to figure out what we have been importing and exporting with our neighbours across the water, so it would be great to see that being used to help us to deal with the climate emergency.  There is an economic cost but as Larry Fink said, "climate risk is investment risk".  These days, nothing is economically viable unless it is climate resilient.  It would be really good to see that commitment.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Barrett and Dr. Lawless and thank them for being here.  It is a fascinating development, particularly for a person from the Border region, to see this great increase in North-South trade.  I take the point about there being a similar diminution in east-west trade, because as Dr. Lawless said, Northern Ireland cannot deal with every requirement and there is also a focus outside to Europe.  It is a fascinating development.  It is amazing how events change things.  Who would have anticipated this some time ago?  I take the point that the ESRI is not in the business of discussing the politics but there are obvious political implications.</p> <p>  There was tangential reference earlier to the regulatory changes around veterinary standards and harmonisation.  It suggests the Commissioner, Mr. &Scaron;efovi, has removed 80% of the east-west problems and difficulties with the protocol and the flow of trade.  This may have been discussed, and I have the disadvantage of not having heard all of the earlier discussion, but I would be fascinated to know how Mr. &Scaron;efovi's interventions could affect the new North-South dynamic.  Could it refocus some of the trade?  If so, how much?  I know it is all very speculative.</p> <p>  If the doomsday nuclear option of Article 16 is pressed, what are some of the implications?  It might be too amorphous or unclear but I am interested.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses speculate on what the implications will be for the Border region?  Historically, because of the conflict and all that went with it, the Border region did not develop as well as the rest of the country and there is a differential in income, prosperity and opportunity.  Does the new dynamic or, say, dispensation have great potential for the Border region?</p> <p>   It is great that the witnesses are here.  I read their paper just now and it is fascinating.  We were aware of it in broad-stroke terms but the sheer volume and extent of the shift is phenomenal and raises questions on east-west trade.  When we had informal meetings with UK colleagues, both sides would stress the importance of our trade with the UK, but this is a whole new dynamic.  I am interested in how it will impact the area I come from and the island in general in socioeconomic terms.  I do not expect the witnesses to comment on the political play-out.  The paper did refer to the Taoiseach's special fund, the shared island fund, and how there may be linkages between that and some industrial development or stimulation of opportunity in the context of improved trade.  How might that play out?</p></speech>

There has been a very substantial and quite quick change to a lot of trade patterns.</p><p>This has happened with astonishingly little disruption, and certainly not visible disruption to consumers, by way of interruptions to supplies.  That speaks very strongly also to the resilience and flexibility of the businesses dealing with it and to much of the preparations that had been put in place by transport authorities and the Revenue Commissioners preparing for this eventuality before they even fully understood what was going to happen.  The deal was signed very late in the day, in December of 2020, so people were preparing for something they did not quite know the shape of, but this just shows a great deal of preparation and work had been put in place.  The level of disruption was surprisingly minimal given the extent of the shifts.</p><p> We saw in our numbers where we mentioned that the falls in trade were particularly stark in January and February where people were, perhaps, learning a bit about the processes and trying to avoid or delay some transactions while they got to grips with the new procedures, but by March or April trade had gone back up a little bit and has since stabilised.  Perhaps that is the extent of the Brexit impact but there was a little bit of an extra effect in January and February.  This largely speaks to a very big change in economic relationships which is going very smoothly.</p><p> On the Great Britain to Northern Ireland checks, which have obviously been the big focus of political attention, while there have been many moves to lighten those checks, there were many grace periods already in place.  Many of the decisions talked about now are not so much about removing checks but about the continuation in perpetuity of the grace periods that had been in place.  As I said, we do not have as much information, or it is very limited, on the trade flows between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  There is therefore something of a gap in our knowledge of all of the different directions of trade there.</p><p> In that context it is interesting that what we have seen of trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland is a very large increase in imports from Northern Ireland coming into Ireland.  This seems to be very much the attractiveness of sourcing products in Northern Ireland rather than in Great Britain because of the increased checks that have been put in place there.  We have seen some increase in trade going from Ireland to Northern Ireland but it has increased by a much smaller amount.  This suggests that goods going into Northern Ireland are still being sourced in perhaps more or less the same direction.  This suggests - this is somewhat speculative as I do not have data on what is going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland - that most of that trade is still flowing reasonably smoothly because we have not seen any great shift in supply in terms of Northern Ireland massively increasing what it buys from Ireland and the EU to replace goods from Great Britain.  All of the change in trade from Northern Ireland has been in respect of it selling more into Ireland and the EU markets rather than it having to buy more from these markets.  This suggests Northern Ireland is trading smoothly in both directions, which is very much what we are talking about in regard to Northern Ireland having the best of both worlds and having access to both economic areas at the same time.</p><p> On the Border region, any increased investment in Northern Ireland, taking advantage of its special access to both markets, would have quite clear positive spillover benefits to all of the surrounding Border region in terms of the supply linkages that exist between neighbouring counties and the kind of free labour market that also exists in that area.  Any increased investment and growth in the Northern Ireland economy is very much to the entire benefit of the island, and especially of benefit perhaps to the Border counties where there would be some kind of positive spillover and where it would impact more directly.</p></speech>

Largely, there have been grace periods in checks for grocery and other particular products and the current negotiations are to keep those in place permanently, whereas they had been due to expire.</p></speech>

To draw out some of the things we have been discussing in the diversion of trade and this new openness, if we can put it like that, in the possibilities of trade on the island, it is certainly possible that would have a generalised effect across the Border and at least in the Border region.  Much of the Border region is rural in nature and has other disadvantages that are always going to be difficult, in a sense, to offset.</p> <p>  For many years - I am sure everybody in the room is probably familiar with projects such as these - there were projects such as the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor, where, as long as I have been discussing economics in Ireland, there was always a view that there was great potential to develop the corridor between Belfast and Dublin, being somewhat focused on Dundalk.  Nevertheless, if you have seen the presentations and have looked at the actual population volume in the area, with proper transport links and everything like that, you can imagine that what we are discussing and describing today would very much give impetus to something like that.  Between Letterkenny and Derry, for example, where there are substantial towns and urban areas, there is the idea, in a cross-Border sense, of a critical mass of activity in these areas.  You can almost imagine them becoming growth nodes, if I can use that kind of phrase.</p> <p>  The hope would be that there would be positive economic benefits spread throughout the region, but it would be a bit unrealistic to think this would be completely the case, in the same way that growth does not happen uniformly across regions in any shape or form.  I will give those two examples, however, as being areas where real possibilities would exist.</p></speech>

I neglected at the outset to say we have received apologies from Senators Byrne and Wall who could not be here with us today and were anxious their apologies would be conveyed by me.  All of my colleagues have asked questions at this point.  I do not believe I have much further to add as all of the areas have been covered very well.</p><p>We were keen to have the witnesses back.  The evidence provided to the committee by the ESRI, prior to us publishing our interim report in July, was crucial to our report, in particular, Dr. Barrett's strong message that the protocol would have great potential if given certainty.  Both witnesses have reiterated that point today.  We have engaged with parliamentary colleagues in Northern Ireland on that issue.  An important message coming from the Oireachtas is that this is not just about serving the interests of those in Ireland, but also serving the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  There are significant benefits in that regard.</p><p> I agree with Dr. Lawless; it is remarkable that we have had so little disruption.  Given the doomsday planning and worst-case scenario planning we were doing, it is a credit to the Government and the businesses on the ground that those warnings were taken seriously.  Witnesses said in their opening remarks that the ESRI was considering the food and beverage sector and the price inflation of food.  Now that the ESRI has had time to establish what is happening, are there other areas of interests where there may be potential vulnerability for Ireland?  That is my final question before we wrap up the meeting.</p></speech>

As I said, the implementation of Brexit has been somewhat uneven.  Checks that were supposed to be introduced by the UK Government in July and October have not yet happened.  On the exporter side, there are still some risks to Irish firms that are reliant on the British market.  Those checks could further increase the cost of trade on them.  Therefore, we may not have seen the full impact on the export side.</p></speech>
