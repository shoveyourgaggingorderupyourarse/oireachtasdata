    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#C00200"><p>Today we will continue our discussion on leaving certificate reform with reference to higher and further education requirements, vocational options and career paths.  I will invite the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to make an opening statement  This will be followed by opening statements from Dr. John O' Connor from Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Mr. Tim Conlon from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and Mr. Andrew Brownlee from SOLAS.  Following the opening statements, each member will have an eight minute slot in which to table questions and get a response from the witnesses.  The committee will publish the opening statements on its website following today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mr. Conlon is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and as such, he may not benefit from the same immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present and he has been advised of same.  Witnesses are reminded the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction from the Chair.</p> <p>  I will now call on the Minister to make his opening statement.  I wish to advise everyone that the Minister must leave the meeting at 12.30 p.m.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me, my Department and agencies of my Department to attend today.  At the outset I want to commend this committee on the work it is undertaking in this area, which is hugely valuable.  The way in which the committee is going about this work, in a very public and transparent way, is really helping with the important discourse that needs to happen now in relation to the lessons emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic in the context of transition pathways and opportunities for our younger people in school and, from my perspective, crucially, when they leave school; the way in which we present those options to them; and how we prepare them to best avail of those options.  There is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused huge disruption, challenge, stress and anxiety but it has also presented opportunities.  When it comes to the area of education, including further and higher education and the entire spectrum of education, there are many opportunities presenting and we will not be forgiven by future generations if we let this moment pass and decide to just go back to the old way of doing things.</p><p>Something much better and much bigger is demanded by our younger people, by the next generation of leaders within our community, society, economy and our political system, arising from their having lived through and endured a global pandemic.  Consequently, I encourage all of us, that is, myself, my Department, our agencies and all Members of the Oireachtas, to take this opportunity and be bold in the policy response we consider.  This committee is very much united across the political spectrum in wanting to explore those opportunities.</p><p> Any reform of the leaving certificate process must be considered in the context of broader senior cycle reform.  Sometimes the conversation can be only about the terminal exam but we must also consider the programme, subjects, skills and objectives in the round.  I will pose some questions.  Does the senior cycle prepare all our students equally well for pursuing their future paths, be they academic or vocational?  I really want to hone in on the latter point.  Where are we at with respect to a student who wishes to pursue a vocational course within our second level system?  Does the leaving certificate capture a person&rsquo;s capabilities in the round or does it choose to focus only on certain capabilities and assess those very well, thoroughly and objectively while ignoring many other capabilities or skills a young person may have?  Do the leaving certificate and the points system hinder a person&rsquo;s potential or help them?  There has never been a better time to have this conversation. </p><p> When we talk about the leaving certificate it is really important we not just talk about half the issue.  We should not have a conversation with one arm tied behind out back.  We should have a fully-rounded conversation.  It cannot just be a conversation about the leaving certificate examination.  When I talk to young people, their parents, teachers, guidance counsellors, principals and colleagues in these Houses, people also want to have a conversation about what happens after the examination.  The process the Department of Education and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Foley, the Government and the Oireachtas ultimately ends up putting in place is important but it needs to be joined up with the pathways that happen after that process of assessment.</p><p> How do we move beyond what I believe has been a very narrow view of options post school?  We have huge success in this country with rates of university and higher education uptake.  We should be proud of that but we must also be big enough to admit we have, perhaps unintentionally, narrowed the conversation about all the options much too early in a young person's life.  We have narrowed, in many ways, the definition of what success is and how it is perceived by society.  We must ask ourselves how we move beyond the points race and all the stress and worry students and their families feel every year and how we create additional and alternative pathways to further and higher education.  The leaving certificate route, whatever that might look like, can be a pathway but it is not the only show in town.  What are the other pathways to get a person where he or she wants to go?  I want the committee to know that is where my energy is going to be.  It will be placed in ensuring school leavers have as many ways as possible to progress to where they want to in terms of careers, as opposed to just one way.  There are far too many conversations around kitchen tables or on couches about what university a person wants to go to and not about what does he or she want to do with his or her life and here are three, four or five different ways of getting him or her there.  That is leading to huge challenges, to huge anxiety and pressure and a warped sense of what success and fulfilment can look like.</p><p> We must also be honest.  The current leaving certificate system does not equip a student in respect of many life skills.  Members may wonder why I should interfere in that space.  I do so because it directly impacts on the ability of a young person when he or she leaves school to make the successful transition to further education, higher education or to the world of work.  It does not always teach students about financial literacy or digital skills.  Bizarrely, it does not teach students properly about sex education and consent.  We in the higher education system then find ourselves having to play catch-up.  We all know the huge difficulties around sexual harassment, sexual violence and consent.  Why do we bury our heads in the sand on these issues when students are at a much younger age?  Furthermore, in the week in which COP26 is taking place, why do we not teach our kids about climate skills?  Mr. Brownlee, who is seated in front of me, is leading a massive programme in SOLAS to train people in green skills.  That is great.  Let us go back and train the people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who never had an opportunity to learn green skills.  However, are we satisfied that kids today, who care more about climate than any generation before them, leave schools with no understanding, in a formal sense, of the green skills or no ability to be assessed in relation to that as well?</p><p>I should acknowledge that we have brilliant schools, teachers and principals.  We have people who are passionate about doing the best by their students.  That is not the point I am making.  The point I am making is that the structured leaving certificate we have now ignores all these areas that I have spoken about but life does not ignore them and citizens in this country do not ignore them.  I believe that these skills being provided in a broader sense within our education system would help our students transition to third level, to employment and, quite frankly, to life.  We need a fair and consistent assessment system, one that can give our students feedback and a clear understanding of their strengths and talents in order that they can make reliable choices. </p><p> I will share with the committee some figures regarding transition rates from DEIS schools to higher education.  In 2018, the overall transition rate was 63%.  Of course, behind headlines there is a lot more detail and behind that overall transition rate there is a rate of 40% in DEIS schools and 69% in non-DEIS schools.  The aspiration of a child from a disadvantaged community is no less and should be no less than the aspiration of a child from another community.  We have to recognise that.  When we boast about how well we are doing as a country in terms of educational attainment, and we have every right to be proud of that, we should not forget that we are still leaving kids behind today and we are failing collectively to put in place enough policy interventions to close that gap between 40% and 69%.  That is not the equal republic that we all want to build post Covid.  Two babies born side by side need to have the same opportunity as they go through the education system at every phase and their dreams should not be dampened or lessened due to the area in which they grow up.</p><p> We also have to acknowledge that we live in a very fast-changing world as regards work, the skills we require and how we work.  We have all seen that accelerated through the pandemic.  Our third level system exists to allow learners to develop and specialise their knowledge, skills and competence.  Ireland&rsquo;s future sustainability depends on the achievements of these learners, on their specialised knowledge, expertise and development, as well as on their collective capacity to widen and deepen social, economic and cultural development.  We must ensure that there are sufficient numbers of students who are equipped to work in areas of specific skills needs.  Science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education, ICT skills and the development of language skills are some of the key areas where we must ensure post-primary students are given a chance to explore their talents.  In other words, let us not begin the conversation about how we address these challenges when a student turns up at the door of a university or college of further education at the age of 18.  Let us embed that in the school system.</p><p> An unintended consequence of the leaving certificate has been that it has decided that some skills matter and, therefore, by implication it has also decided that others do not.  As a result, we are narrowing our view of what success is.  We also have to be honest.  I am also the Minister responsible for skills.  There are skills shortages in this country in relation to housing.  We all want to build more houses and we need 27,500 more people to get to our target for housebuilding.  We all also want to retrofit homes.  I was listening to media commentary about retrofitting this morning.  It is a really important issue for saving our planet, which is on fire and which we all care about.  We have to ask ourselves who is going to do it.  No one here in this room is going to retrofit a home.  No one in this room is going to build a home.  We have to make sure that our younger people in school realise that there are pathways, careers and rewarding jobs in the trades and crafts and that it is not all just about a narrow view of the world.  I would make that point very strongly.</p><p> That is why I am not just talking about it as this Friday, with the co-operation of SOLAS, the CAO and the education and training boards, ETBs, we will launch a new updated CAO website.  Every leaving certificate student will be able to log on to the website and see the button for the traditional CAO options but, for the first time ever, they will also see a button for the further education and training options and a button that they can click to find out lots more information about apprenticeships and the supports and the pathways there as well.  Why hide these issues and not talk to people about apprenticeships at a younger age?  Why not look at allowing people the opportunities to sample and experience apprenticeships in our secondary school system and perhaps even earlier?  In our sector we are going to bring about that cultural change, where the conversation around the kitchen table or on the couch will be broader.  We are going to start that on Friday, with all our partners, with this revamped website.</p><p> Does cultural change not need to begin much earlier in the post-secondary school student's life?  It does.  The way one achieves that is through a broader and more inclusive curriculum.  I look forward to working with my Government colleagues, especially the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and to reviewing the forthcoming report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on priority areas and goals.  I wanted to share with the committee the view that the skills needs our country requires depends on getting this right.  The definition of success and what success is has been unintentionally narrowed by a leaving certificate system that applies a focus to some skills and ignores others.  In addition, the successful transition to other options post school requires a broader ranges of issues being assessed and a broader range of life skills being considered.  Crucially, we will begin this week by showing people all of the options available post school and not just some of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#F00200"><p>On behalf of QQI, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion.  QQI oversees quality in post-secondary education and training and is the national awarding body for further education and training.  QQI has a statutory remit to promote the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s national framework of qualifications which includes school, further and higher education and training qualifications.  We promote lifelong learning through the implementation of national policy on access, transfer and progression and advise on the international recognition of qualifications.  My opening statement will focus on those aspects of the topic of leaving certificate reform that are the focus of the discussion today, namely, higher and further education requirements, vocational options and career paths.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate examination is an integral part of what is known in Ireland as senior cycle and internationally as upper secondary level education.  The ongoing senior cycle review led by the NCCA has built on the many strengths of our secondary school system including: systematic use of consultation processes for reform initiatives; well-developed autonomy for schools; a strong supply of highly qualified teachers; and a high level of school completion rates.  Any reform of our leaving certificate should build on what works for all students and be informed by engagement with stakeholders and findings from the best available evidence.</p> <p>  The enduring challenges in upper secondary level education have been well documented internationally.  They include: the need to guarantee real opportunities for young people to continue learning in the upper secondary education model of their choice after completing compulsory education; avoid making upper secondary vocational education programmes an option for lower achievers linked to poor-quality jobs and no access to tertiary education; create and strengthen credible pathways from secondary vocational education to tertiary education and encourage a significant proportion of students to follow that path; and establish systematic student counselling and career guidance services in all schools to prevent a lack of awareness of future options,to facilitate the making of informed choices and to help students to overcome their troubles and prevent dropout.</p> <p>  Senior cycle and the leaving certificate examination are important stages within the national education and training system.  They follow on from junior cycle and lead directly to employment or further and higher education and training opportunities.  System connectedness across general, further and higher education and training will therefore help to ensure cohesion and clarify responsibilities underpinning any reform.</p> <p>  The purpose of senior cycle should be shaped by both social and economic considerations.  Structures, including assessment practice, must support a responsive and flexible upper secondary education system that simultaneously serves employment, social inclusion and lifelong learning.  Ireland's economy and dynamic labour markets need people with sophisticated knowledge, skills and competences that are developed throughout school, further and higher education.  The capacity for lifelong learning is based on primary and secondary education. The secondary school age cohort of young people is larger than ever before and these students will require skills to prepare them for a lifetime of learning.</p> <p>  Vocational education and training is currently underdeveloped within senior cycle.  The role of senior cycle in initial vocational education and training in Ireland could be strengthened and expanded.  Initial vocational education and training programmes combine school and work-based learning.  Developing and strengthening both general and vocational pathways in upper secondary education can make education more inclusive and strengthen the transition from school to work.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA, have a work orientation but are more appropriately classed as pre-vocational or pre-technical, with little work-based learning required.  These programmes attract a minority of students, 25% and 5% of the leaving certificate cohort respectively.  The leaving certificate applied, which does not provide direct access to higher education, disproportionately attracts students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The recent expansion of apprenticeships into new sectors such as hospitality, financial services, information and communication technology present opportunities for pre-apprenticeship and traineeship programmes to be developed alongside traditional leaving certificate programmes.</p><p>Any such developments should be supported by guidance services and should ensure that graduates have opportunities to progress to work and to attain high-quality vocational, academic or professional qualifications.</p><p> Thank you, Chair.  I am happy to provide further information and respond to any questions that might assist the committee with its deliberations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Conlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#G00300"><p>Thank you, Chair.  My colleagues and I are pleased to assist the committee in its consideration of leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>  The leaving certificate is the primary assessment element of our national curriculum and facilitates the examination of the potential of students in terms of their knowledge of the national curriculum in their final senior-cycle year and ultimately defines their progression route into either further or higher education, which is our area of interest.  It is critical that any assessment method is based on a robust and practical delivery method in assessing the capability of the learner.  The leaving certificate examination should be fair and equitable, have strong quality assurance arrangements and have stakeholder buy-in, because it is the stakeholders - primarily the learners but also teachers, schools, higher and further education providers and employers - who will benefit directly from any reform agenda.  In the context of both today's discussion and the areas to be examined, any reforms which may be considered should focus on improving the learner experience with a view to providing learners with the best possible opportunity to realise, develop and display their talents.</p> <p>  Currently, the majority of higher education entrants come directly from the leaving certificate in any given year.  Hence, the connection between the second level sector and further and higher education sectors should be strengthened through any reform process and should focus on improving access and retention as learners transition from secondary to tertiary education, with a view to providing an even more seamless transition process.</p> <p>  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has participated in the transitions group which has implemented several policy changes in recent years to address some of the issues associated with transition to higher education including, for example, the revision of the leaving certificate grading system and the streamlining of entry points to higher education programmes to simplify student choices.  Any reform of the leaving certificate assessment model should provide for better connectivity and understanding of future career and associated education pathways for the learner, as the Minister has mentioned.  Outside of leaving certificate assessment, it is also important to create and embed links between higher education providers and post-primary learners at other stages in their junior and senior cycle.  In this regard, for example, the HEA funds ICT and entrepreneurship summer camps which engage post-primary school pupils with higher education institutions in short taster courses in these critical skills areas.</p> <p>  In addition, the HEA funds an access to apprenticeship programme which takes those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have completed the senior cycle or who may not have achieved their desired leaving certificate outcome and offers them a pathway to apprenticeship.  In this way, the recent expansion of apprenticeships into new sectors, such as hospitality, financial services and information and communication technology, presents opportunities for pre-apprenticeship programmes and traineeship programmes to be developed alongside traditional leaving certificate programmes.  Any such developments should be supported by guidance services and ensure that the graduates have opportunities to progress to work and high-quality further and higher vocational and academic qualifications.</p> <p>  Regarding changes relating to information relevant to student choice, and specifically changes to the CAO system, the HEA has been involved in and welcomes the inclusion of apprenticeship and further education programme links and information on the CAO platform, as the Minister has mentioned.</p> <p>  As equity of access to higher education is one of the key priorities for the HEA, it is important that any reform of the leaving certificate takes account of the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged students in accessing higher education.  The higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, schemes, which offer entry to courses on a reduced points basis for socio-economically disadvantaged students and students with a disability, are an important mechanism in that regard.</p> <p>  Overall, the leaving certificate, and any future reform of it, should ensure that all students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or who face barriers in terms of progression to higher education have as a fair chance of accessing higher education and achieving comparable outcomes as those from more affluent backgrounds.  These outcomes cover both access to and progression through higher education, as well as completion and future career development.</p><p> The HEA works closely with the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education to examine and improve teaching and learning interventions in support of student success, aiming to provide a high-quality and supportive higher education environment for all students arriving in our universities, institutes and colleges.</p><p> As with other sections of society and the economy, the recent experience of the higher education system has demonstrated the need for flexibility and responsiveness in challenging circumstances.  Higher education institutions are now examining the outcomes from their recent experience of remote provision in terms of teaching and learning, but also student supports.  Discussions to date suggest that institutions are leveraging new ways of engaging with students, such as through digital learning and outreach from counselling and learning support services, alongside and complementary to more traditional higher education provision.  The national forum is leading a national partnership project, Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together, to consider what we have learned since March 2020 and, crucially, what that means for the future of teaching and learning in Irish higher education.</p><p> Each student is different.  This is a useful opportunity for us to consider how students' educational needs can be met as they transition from the senior cycle into apprenticeship, further education and higher education.  This will require ongoing engagement and dialogue, not just at institutional or system level, but between educators at all levels in the education system as well as with students, their parents and their representatives.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to join this conversation.  I am happy to answer whatever questions it may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#H00200"><p>On behalf of SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, and the ETBs, I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to speak to it on leaving certificate reform.</p> <p>  SOLAS is an agency within the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have responsibility for funding, co-ordinating and monitoring of further education and training, FET, provision across Ireland.  We are also the statutory authority for apprenticeships.  Through the 16 ETBs and other providers, the FET system offers access to a wide range of learning opportunities and supports in every corner of the country, regardless of background or formal education level, and a learning pathway to take people as far as they want to go.  It currently serves a base of approximately 200,000 unique learners every year.  School leavers are a significant part of this provision, including circa 30,000 students on post-leaving certificate courses and many more opportunities through traineeships, specific skills training and apprenticeships.</p> <p>  SOLAS welcomes the Government's commitment to reform of the leaving certificate and senior cycle education and the resulting focus on improving access and pathways into all forms of tertiary education for people.  Currently, more than two thirds of second level students choose to enter higher education directly after their leaving certificate.  However, it is our belief that a proportion of these students would be better suited to a technical or vocational route where they could develop their creativity or technical skills.  Key to achieving this is providing the opportunity to learn about further education and training courses and apprenticeships at the point where decisions are being made on their future learning pathways post secondary school.</p> <p>  In response to this, I am delighted to confirm that, for the first time and as the Minister mentioned, CAO applicants in 2022 will be able to get information and apply for FET courses and view apprenticeship options via a link from the CAO website when it goes live this Friday.  This means that all of a school leaver's options will be available to him or her on one single platform.  This is a significant step towards improving pathways and will bring a focus on all of the opportunities available for students.  However, more work is needed in order to achieve the ambition of having an integrated and inclusive tertiary education system.  Together with the ETBs and other FET stakeholders, we are one year into the implementation of the ambitious FET strategy, Future FET: Transforming Learning 2020&ndash;2024.  This strategy sets out a clear strategic roadmap for the FET system that centres on three core pillars of building skills, fostering inclusion and creating pathways.  In the context of leaving certificate reform, the pillar of creating pathways has specific relevance in terms of school leavers entering the FET system.</p> <p>  The lack of exposure to vocational learning and the lack of vocational options in junior and senior cycles are highlighted as barriers to school leavers developing an interest in FET.  This finding was reinforced through our engagement with the NCCA and was underscored in the SOLAS formal submission to the public consultation on the reform of the senior cycle.</p><p>International approaches suggest a potential role for FET in offering modules and tasters of vocational courses to second-level students where existing teaching resources simply do not have the required technical experience to deliver them.  The potential for apprenticeship taster offerings as part of transition year, TY, is currently being tested in some schools.  The scale of this collaborative practice has the potential to be further expanded.  Indeed, with the ETBs operating many second-level schools, this could facilitate piloting of any new approaches and potentially support earlier interventions to inform future learner pathways to FET.  Furthermore, it provides a basis to consider the introduction of offerings at level 5 and level 6 as an integrated part of the senior cycle.</p><p> All-of-system career guidance is also vital for successful reform.  The FET strategy outlines this, building on the independent report commissioned by the Government on career guidance.  SOLAS and ETBs work closely with both the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and the National Centre for Guidance in Education to ensure their members are equipped with the latest information on FET options and we look forward to continuing to work with them to improve timely access to information.  As a general principle, it is important that FET is promoted as a valid and smart potential destination from the earliest stage within schools.  SOLAS has launched successful national campaigns in recent years to build awareness around FET and apprenticeship options, which are vital to ensure that ETBs can compete on an equal footing in terms of choices for progression by school leavers.</p><p> In conclusion, as the FET strategy and relevant cross-government policy to date demonstrates, there is a real opportunity now for ambitious reform, not only in FET, but in wider second-level and tertiary education provision.  This reform and the other key actions outlined in the FET strategy will together deliver tangible change that better serves both the needs of the learner and the country as a whole, in directly tackling labour and skills shortages and supporting the achievement of national goals and challenges such as Future Jobs Ireland, climate change and Housing for All.  Continuing to build and strengthen pathways from secondary school to FET is a key strategic objective for SOLAS and the wider FET sector.  Vocational options in TY and senior cycle, reform of the CAO and continuing to work with guidance professionals are key to unlocking this growth.</p><p> I hope that this provides a brief overview of SOLAS views on matters related to reform of the leaving certificate.  I thank committee members for their time and look forward to discussion of this matter. </p></speech>

We agree on much of what has been said.  We certainly agree on the value of further education and apprenticeships, but we need to drop the idea that the main issue with them is perception and snobbery.  That abdicates responsibility for the impediments that need to be addressed within the apprenticeship and further education process.  Perception and snobbery might be the case for some people but it is not for most.</p> <p>  We know the further education system needs multi-year funding to provide the ability to plan strategically, to know where people are and to have greater freedom to provide the courses and education people in their communities want and need.  I welcome the new CAO website.  If it included FET options, including apprenticeships, it would be a step forward.  Critical pathways must be there for those who do not want to progress to higher education.  When we look at this issue, it is quite stark.  Less than 5% of almost 4,000 students who do pre-nursing in further education get access to degree courses afterwards.  That is a real problem we need to address.  It is simply not good enough, especially when we have shortages of nurses.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about enhancing the visibility of apprenticeships, which misses the point to an extent.  Many people are trying, right now, to get an apprenticeship.  I speak to them every day.</p><p>I know of one person who just got an apprenticeship after trying for two years.  In that case, 140 people interviewed for two apprenticeship places.  The retrofitting targets that were mentioned mean we will need 27,000 tradespeople working in this area in the coming years so we know exactly what we need.  Currently, we only have about 18,000 craft apprenticeships in total and we have more on the waiting list unable to access the training they need.  The process has been allowed grind to a halt.  I am aware Covid has been a big factor in that but there were capacity issues before the pandemic and we need to have an honest conversation about this as well.  It is the only way we will be able to tackle what we need.</p><p> The so-called "emergency response" to the waiting lists in 2020 was to allocate &euro;12 million to address the backlog.  This was despite the fact that the backlog was actually saving the State over &euro;16 million in the same year because it did not have to pay many of the allowances.  The response has been completely inadequate and has left the system in crisis.  We also need to ensure apprenticeships are available for people who want them.  We should be leveraging the public procurement system by applying a criterion in respect of apprenticeship employment for companies that want to apply for public contracts.  We need to be very direct about this in ensuring it is part of the conditions.</p><p> There are many other issues around apprenticeships but I am conscious of my time.  I will ask a couple of questions.  What was the estimated saving to the State arising from the waiting list in 2021 and the reduced payments for allowances?</p><p> The next question is for Mr. Conlon.  He referred to the HEA funding ICT and entrepreneurship summer camps.  I welcome that but does it in any way suffice when we have so many second level schools in which computer science is not taught?  Is it an objective of the Minister, the Department and the Government that all students in this day and age have an option to study computer science?  That must be our ambition and there must a timeline for achieving it.  In this changing environment, it is not acceptable that we have schools that do not offer the option of computer science.</p><p> Dr. O'Connor mentioned establishing student counselling and career guidance services.  It is shameful these are not already in place.  We know from research we did last year with college students that one of the biggest impediments they face in making the right choices at further and higher education is the absence of, or lack of sufficient, career guidance.  I want to know how that problem will be fixed.</p><p> I will address my next point to Mr. Brownlee and SOLAS.  We have an ETB training centre in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  The community wants to make it into a vibrant training centre for the town, which has been decimated by banks leaving and other matters.  The community wants to have a cohort of well-trained people.  It is not seeking a huge amount of funding but some funding and support to turn the ETB centre into a place which can be used for apprenticeships for specific job opportunities in the town.  That is a way of making use of buildings that are not being used, reviving our towns and building up the labour capital we need in all of these towns to be able to attract industries to them.  We need much broader thinking and to remove blockages.</p><p> I will make a final point on pathways for nurses.  There is no reason people who do an apprenticeship should not be able to go on to do a degree and go right up to PhD level.  That needs to be made clear to them.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee last week, we discussed cancer research and oncology.  The Minister will know that we have the most brilliant oncology nurses.  Why do they not go on to become consultants?  What are the blockages stopping them from becoming consultants?</p><p>There are lots of matters we need to address and I have little time for answers but maybe some of my questions can be answered.</p></speech>

I want to both agree and disagree with Deputy Conway-Walsh on various matters.  I will not drop the idea, as the Deputy said, that part of the issue around apprenticeships is not a lack of information, a snobbery or a cultural issue because I genuinely believe it is.  That is not abdicating responsibility because I accept it is only a part of the issue.</p> <p>  I met Zoe, the 1,000th female registered apprentice in Ireland, who is an accounting technician in Cork and no one ever told her about apprenticeships.  She did not know anything about them but her brothers in school became aware of them.  She was not aware of them because she went to an all-girls school.  Zoe said that if she had have been made aware of them much earlier her career pathway would have been easier.  I also met Jack in Cavan, who got his first choice in his CAO application and started his degree but he hated it so he dropped out and did a pre-law course in Cavan Institute.  Jack told me that if he had known about that course first it would have been an awful lot more straightforward.  Karen in Sligo College of Further Education was gutted when she did not get the points she wanted in her leaving certificate.  She went to Sligo College of Further Education for a year and is now going on to St. Angela's College to do her degree.  She said she feels better developed as a person as a result.</p> <p>  I genuinely and passionately believe that the pathways, information and knowledge we are giving our students at the age of 16 and 17 are key.  That is not in contradiction with the point Deputy Conway-Walsh validly makes about the need for us to also up our game in what we are doing.  I fully accept that.  We are doing a couple of things although I will not have time to get into all of them.  I will mention increasing the number of available apprenticeships, because availability was a core part of the Deputy's question, as two key actions are taking place next year.  First, from January a core financial payment of around &euro;2,000 per apprentice per year will be made to any employer that takes on a new apprentice.  The hospitality sector and the Restaurants Association of Ireland have been looking for such a financial incentive for an employer to take on an apprentice for years.  Second, there has been hypocrisy about this in the public sector.  We wag our fingers about apprenticeships and give out about them but the entire public sector, which employs around 300,000 people, on average takes on 80 apprentices per year.  That is a darn disgrace.  There is a target in the apprenticeship action plan of 750 apprentices per year by 2025.  By next July the quotas of what council, agency and Department is doing what will be brought to Cabinet.</p> <p>  Mr. Brownlee will comment on the apprenticeship backlogs and the wait times because SOLAS is driving those down.  The Deputy said it is inadequate but I am satisfied with the plan that is in place.  The only constraint in increasing the capacity has been public health concerns and we are now in a good place in that regard.  Any funds that have been or will be required will be forthcoming.  I accept that it is not all down to Covid but this is a chance for something good to come from Covid so we must remove that backlog once and for all.</p> <p>  The Deputy is entirely right about pre-nursing.  When Mr. Brownlee and I talk about this new portal on Friday being the first step towards an integrated third level system, one of the next steps has to be that if one goes on to do pre-nursing or pre anything else and one gets the top marks then there has to be a linkage.  I am committed to delivering on that as part of our integration of the tertiary education system.</p></speech>

There is a major emergency plan and I agree with the Deputy that it is an emergency.  Capacity was an issue before all of this started but it is many times worse now.  The emergency plan involves increasing the instructor base significantly and the Deputy will see that there is an ongoing campaign to recruit 100 additional staff into ETBs in the coming months.  We have moved the entire delivery model for phase 2 of off-the-job training from three intakes per year to two, which increases capacity by 50%.  Some &euro;20 million of capital investment has been made to expand workshop capacity across both further education and higher education.</p> <p>  The key point is that we are back on-site.  For the first nine months of the first 12 months of Covid, the workshops were closed and we could not run the training.</p><p>For the period up to September, they were operating at approximately 50% capacity, but they are ramped up now.  We are turning a corner, in that the waiting list decreased from 11,800 at the end of July to 9,797 at the end of September.  That happened because we have been able to get people back in training.  We believe a corner is turned but there will be no let-up.  We completely accept that we are in an emergency situation. </p></speech>

I thank all of the organisations represented here in terms of the great work that is being done in a very transformational way.  I would like to put a number of direct questions.  </p><p>On the FET strategy, the retrofitting skills programme started with Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board.  I welcome that it continues to be rolled out.  Is Mr. Brownlee confident, in terms of the construction apprenticeship needs we have as a country, that we will be able to meet them?  The Minister mentioned a figure of 27,500.  Is Mr. Brownlee confident we can do that?  One of the problems historically has been barriers of transition between FET and higher education.  Are there existing barriers about which Mr. Brownlee continues to have concerns with regard to those who wish to transition between further and higher education and <i>vice versa</i>?</p><p><i></i>My next question is for Mr. Conlon.  He will be aware of the work done by the Commission on the Points System, the HEA and the NCCA on the transitions issue.  One of the big concerns was around the increasing specialisation of higher education courses, that these were multiplying and we were getting programmes such as engineering with French and computing.  One of the recommendations was that higher education institutions would reduce that diversification.  That has not happened to the extent that we would like to see it happen.  It is welcome that under the CAO, students will get a whole range of options in terms of apprenticeships.  What moves are being made in terms of reducing those overall numbers because it is the backwash from third level that is impacting on the CAO programme, particularly in the area of the high points courses?</p><p>We will be constantly building skills over the next period.  Dr. O'Connor might comment on the work QQI is doing in the area of micro-credentials.  That is important.</p><p>My final question is for the Minister.  Access is improving enormously but for high points courses, the socioeconomic profile, particularly those in medicine and law, is not improving.  There is evidence it is disimproving.  What can be done in that area?  Students who are doing their leaving certificate now will be retiring in the 2070s.  What skills will we need out to that period?  Like others, I have spoken to students about what they would like to hear and see.  They have talked about tax, philosophy, greater knowledge of technology, design, and public speaking.  In my own case, I would have liked a greater knowledge of home economics.  Anybody who has experienced my cooking would probably agree.  In terms of his own experience in life, what skills would the Minister have liked to have undertaken at second level that he believes would stand to him now?  </p></speech>

The Senator raised a valid question.  It is a point that I am trying to make here without being overly prescriptive or without crystal ball-gazing too much.  There are skills that are transversal skills that I do not think our second level system as currently constructed is able to deliver on.  That is not a criticism of the people there; they are doing an exceptional job.  It is not a criticism at all but it goes to our values as a country.  It goes to our view as to what we determine to be success.  Success is different things for different people.  I believe we are putting too much pressure on our students if their success, capabilities and talent is not in the areas that we are assessing.</p><p>There are a whole load of other areas where they could be really good, but we are not shining a light on them.  I was talking to a number of youth organisations at the weekend, and they were hitting me with things like financial skills, digital literacy and climate.  Climate is the big one.  This is one that we could get right.  Why not start it now instead of some other Minister sitting here in 20 years' time and the head of SOLAS saying we have to train all these people in their 40s and 50s in green skills?  They are better clued into this than any generation before.  We have a chance now to not have to go back and, pardon the pun, retrofit the next generation with climate skills but to try to find a way of working it into the school system.</p><p> I know the question on construction needs is for Mr. Brownlee, but I wish to make one comment on it.  Sometimes, when we talk about the 27,500 &ndash; I am sure I am to blame on this too &ndash; people presume they are all in further education and training, FET, and that it is not the case.  While a lot of them are in FET, when we look at the needs, we will also require architects, quantity surveyors and engineers.  I say to Mr. Conlon and the HEA that it does not let the higher education side off the hook, nor would it wish to be.  There will be a need to increase capacity in terms of training people in those areas where a higher education degree or a master's degree is needed, in addition to a lot of the areas that FET can provide as well.</p><p> I am acutely aware of the issue relating to access.  In medicine, there can be too much sameness in terms of the background of people who enter certain professions and that is not good.  To be honest, one of the barriers to entry on the graduate medicine programme is still the cost.  I am working on proposals, which I hope to advance through the next Estimates process &ndash; it gets earlier every year &ndash; on how we can look at both the SUSI system and the level of financial support that is supplied.  In fairness to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, she has raised graduate medicine with me too.  It was indicated that law also has a role to play in this regard.  I hope to engage with the law bodies and colleagues in the Department of Justice on this shortly.  I will hand over to colleagues.</p></speech>

We have large qualifications like the leaving certificate and bachelor's degrees, but the Irish qualifications system also provides for smaller qualifications, what we might call, non-major qualifications.  In some ways, Ireland has been ahead of the pack internationally in having a flexible structure to be able to recognise smaller chunks of learning through the use of what are called micro credentials.  There is a lot of interest in these, in particular in terms of their having a responsive, flexible reaction to labour market skills, for example in response to climate change and digitalisation where micro credentials may well be the solution to upskilling or reskilling where a full or major qualification is not the appropriate labour market response in that particular area.</p> <p>  The universities are leading the way here in a particular project on promoting the national framework for micro credentials.  These can also be used in further education and training.  There is potentially a role here too for micro credentials in school education.  Transition year has a lot of very useful learning.  Sometimes that learning is not formally recognised or certified.  The use of the micro credentials tool to give a formal, portable trusted recognition of learning achieved in transition year could be used for exchange and portability along the path for individuals.</p> <p>  We are well ahead in the game in terms of micro credentials in Ireland, in particular in innovation.  The national quality assurance and qualifications system supports the roll-out of that particular response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#N00300"><p>There were two questions.  With Housing for All, the imperative is to support the delivery of 33,000 houses per annum.  The emergency measures we talked about in terms of the apprenticeship pipeline once we have dealt with the waiting list problem should give us an increase in capacity of around 50%, which in the medium term will be a platform to deliver on that.  It is not just about apprenticeships, there is a need to ramp up the non-apprenticeship courses.  There is a model to follow with the development of the Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre, which has started to work in partnership with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others to develop levels 4 and 5 construction courses to get people into the labour force.</p> <p>  Retrofitting is a big challenge.  It was mentioned that Waterford-Wexford had the first retrofitting centre of excellence.  There is now one in Laois-Offaly and there are plans for centres in Sligo, Limerick and Cork.</p><p>We have two fully operational and the rest will be on-stream by quarter 1 of next year.<br/><br/>There is still not significant demand from industry for the courses that are being offered in those facilities.  There is a job of work there to stimulate industry interest and demand.  Contracts may still be coming to them a little to easily.  We need to find a way to get the focus on what they will need to meet the skills needs of tomorrow.<br/><br/>On the further education and training to higher education transitions question, I think the Deputy is right that it is <i>ad hoc</i>at present.  It depends on college-to-college links.  One in five of the technological higher education sector intake still comes from further education.  There are, therefore, strong transitions in place.  However, we need to look at a more universal system, probably theme by theme.  Perhaps we should start with nursing and then perhaps information technology or initial teacher education, chunk that off and put in place a system where a student who gets a level 5 pre-nursing qualification will know that he or she will have direct access to an Irish higher educational institution to do the degree.  I think it should go further.  There is real potential for one-plus-two and two-plus-two models where students start their degree in a further education institution.  That is a model for which we can borrow and learn from jurisdictions not too far from here.</p></speech>

The point at which students make a career choice is the most important piece.  The Minister alluded to the need to support students in making a decision that has an impact on the rest of their lives.  Then, if that does not work out, what are the alternates and how can the student step up or step down between different levels in the system?  I could say more about it but time is limited.</p></speech>

The strengths of the leaving certificate also present its weaknesses.  I will ask the Minister a question in respect of that.  The leaving certificate is a good examination for identifying academic excellent.  A boy or girl in secondary school who wants to become a doctor knows that he or she has to excel academically.  Such children know they have to do excellently in the leaving certificate and once they do that, they have a pathway, literally, to the age of 65.  Unfortunately, that same pathway is not available to the child who is not academically excellent or, alternatively, the child who is vocationally gifted.  Do we need to categorise and identify earlier the different gifts that children have when they are in secondary school?  It appears that by the time they get to the junior certificate, they are on the academic route and unless we expose them at that stage to opportunities or avenues aside from that, necessarily they will not achieve their potential.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in response to that general issue.</p></speech>

The leaving certificate has its successes and for certain professions and people who wish to go a certain way in life, it works extremely well.  Even for those for whom it works well - students who do extremely well in it - the sense I get from many of them is that they wished they had been exposed to other skills.  I am conscious that teachers would make the point that schools cannot do everything and are under considerable pressure.</p><p>While I do not wish to stray too much into the Department of Education's space, I also agree with the Deputy's point about when a young adult in secondary school is, to use the Deputy's word, &quot;exposed&quot; or perhaps given an opportunity to sample vocational skills within the second level system.  That does not really happen, with the exception of schools that do it off their own bat or in the transition year programme where it may happen in an <i>ad hoc</i>, non-structured and non-credentialled way.</p><p>Our suggestion is that we need to broaden the options so that the conversation changes at 16 and 17 and a student does not only see the traditional CAO form but also FET courses and asks what certain courses are and whether there is a different way available if he or she does not get the points for law.  For example, should someone sample law by doing a pre-law course, to use the Deputy's profession as an example.  Can students sample in transition year by micro-credentialling elements and allowing them to try something out for a few months?  As the FET strategy says, can we introduce taster programmes in apprenticeships at transition year?  The answer to all of those questions is &quot;Yes&quot;, but we need to do this in a way that is tied in with the NCCA review and the work the Minister, Deputy Foley, will be doing.</p></speech>

At one level, however, transition year seems to be chaotic and at other levels, it is not properly structured.  What would Dr. O'Connor like to see in a transition year that would be beneficial to expose younger people to the types of careers they might be interested in?</p></speech>

It is not necessarily that the student makes the decision but that the rest of the system makes the decision for the student as to whether he or she is on an academic track.  That may be too early to make the decision and there is a question of whether that is an informed decision by the individual.  You hear different experiences anecdotally around transition year based on the school and the individual.  It does seem to be a really useful opportunity.  A lot of useful learning happens in transition year.  I do not think we make the best of it.  Deputy Conway-Walsh struck on something earlier, namely, the idea of a vocational education and training pathway.  In school, in further education and in training and higher education, you could take engineering, nursing, teaching or law and look at what that pathway looks like and at what the role is for secondary education in that pathway.  That goes to the point in guidance too.  It is about when you can see a pathway and there are assurances along that path that if I can strike that path and can get taster elements of it in the school system, it will lead across further education, into higher education and professional qualifications if I desire.  In some ways, we are zooming out away from the leaving certificate and looking at what vocational education and training looks like in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is complicated.  At what stage in one's career does one make a choice about one's future career?  We see a challenge, in terms of access and progression in higher education, in respect of students who do not make the appropriate course choices and drop out.  There should be step-downs and other options.  To engage too soon is a challenge but as others have said, it is most important to have a range of options and information available for people to inform them in the choices that they make.  For this apprenticeship programme, it is about telling people that these are pathways into apprenticeship that can lead on to further and higher education and about giving them that as a career choice.</p></speech>

Is he saying there are too many unprepared people or people who should not necessarily be going on to higher education?  Why is that happening?  Is it because society says to them that this is where they should go?</p></speech>

Many people might benefit from an further education-first type of approach before they go into to higher education.  There are schools where 100% of school leavers go directly into higher education and surely, one or two of those individuals would be better suited to a more technical or vocational route.  As we reflected, they do not get exposure to those kinds of technical or vocational options.  Transition year is one part of it and in a way it is quite easy to build in taster and foundation courses but we need to look at real reform of the senior cycle and the leaving certificate and maybe look at, say, the Scottish model where further education colleges actually deliver those level 5 and level 6 modules and students get credit for them as part of the equivalent of the leaving certificate there.</p></speech>

This has been an interesting session because we have focused to a great degree on skills, which is welcome.</p> <p>  One of the recurring themes that we are seeing throughout this process is that we must differentiate between senior cycle and the leaving certificate.  Too often, they are viewed as one and the same.  I wonder whether by overfocusing on the leaving certificate as a summative end point exam, we almost make it a singularity in a student's life, to use science fiction terminology, and we miss out on the senior cycle.  As such, it is welcome that we are beginning to speak about moving beyond the leaving certificate &ndash; sidestepping it is probably the wrong way to talk about it &ndash; and discuss alternative pathways for students.  The leaving certificate captures one type of learning, which has been broadly accepted as we have worked our way through this process.</p> <p>  Skills will be vital.  Housing has been mentioned.  Waterford and Wexford have done great work leading on retrofit programmes.  However, retrofit on its own will not be enough.  As the town centres first policy is delivered, it will entail refurbishing older properties, but we do not have the skills in our trades to bring those old market town properties back into use.  If we are serious about tackling vacancy and dereliction and returning life to the hearts of our towns, this will be an important skill set.</p> <p>  I will offer the Minister praise.  He has shown the merit of having a senior Ministry in this area.  It has driven further education.  We should also consider lifelong learning.  While it is tangential to this discussion, lifelong learning is one of the areas where we do not do well.  However, I am glad that we are focusing more on further education, in particular apprenticeships.</p> <p>  I would like to give Mr. Brownlee the opportunity to drill down a little more into the idea of level 5 and level 6 certification.  It is interesting and I would love to see it happen in respect of languages as well.  I would like to see the common European framework being rolled out into schools.  We have discussed this at length on the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge.  Many people who leave school, often with a good leaving certificate in Irish, will say the next day that they cannot speak Irish at all.  If we put them on the common European framework and told that them that they were at B2, B1 or wherever, it would be helpful.  I would like to give Mr. Brownlee an opportunity to speak a little more about this idea and how to segment it for particular subjects.  I studied engineering to the leaving certificate.  Is there a micro-credential that we could roll out for computer aided design, CAD, computer numerical control, CNC, turning, milling or the like?  I am using these as examples only because I know the subject reasonably well.</p> <p>  I took a look at the figures in preparation for today.  We are not doing badly in terms of STEM subjects.  A press release from Engineers Ireland in September detailed how well we were doing in terms of the number of students taking engineering, construction studies and agricultural sciences to the leaving certificate.  That is welcome, as an important part of the skills piece has to do with land use.  For example, the forestry programme in WIT was oversubscribed.</p><p>It will be incredibly important.  Land use programmes, organic agriculture and horticulture will become extremely valuable skills.  I will give Mr. Brownlee and Dr. O'Connor an opportunity to talk about that because the witnesses were speaking about that in terms of micro-credentials.  How do they see that working and integrating, particularly in transition year?  There is probably a role for it in the senior cycle if we could make the system marry up.</p></speech>

Obviously, my job is to worry about further education and training and apprenticeships, but the idea of integrating modules in languages or engineering as part of the leaving certificate or senior cycle plays to the same point.  There is no reason a technological university or one of our traditional universities could not offer that type of access to a module as part of senior cycle.  How it works and how it works in other places is quite simple.  It is a credit-based system.  Very often, someone will go to the local further education college for a couple of hours.  The college will deliver that module once or twice a week to senior cycle students and students will get credit that will be recognised as their overall leaving certificate award and, potentially, their overall CAO score.  It is really that simple.  It is the delivery we must get right.  We would have to reconcile how we would get a further education instructor to deliver education within a school setting but perhaps the answer to that is to take interested students to the local further education college, give them a taste for the environment, deliver the module there and bus them back to the school afterwards.  I know this is the model that is followed in Scotland.  There is a real idea there around this not being just a further education thing but could be a higher education thing in terms of an offering in the senior cycle.</p></speech>

It is central to it and leaving certificate reform.  Regarding the Deputy's question on delivery and certification, we can be very open-minded.  We have the toolkit available to us in terms of different types of certification.  We have QQI and FET certification.  If we think again about zooming out and upper secondary education, it can be delivered not just in school but outside it.  It can be delivered in workplaces.  We have other certification bodies that can provide input into this.  It involves looking in a more holistic way at what the right mix of certification is, awarding bodies that might be involved and further education and general education being mixed.  That kind of zooming out and thinking about that idea of upper secondary education where we have general education and further education gives us a lot of tools to play with in terms of finding the right mix of certifications and places and location of delivery, which is not always a classroom in a school.  It can be delivered outside a school in a workplace or other education and training settings.  We have the policy instruments available to us to design those more rounded pathways for young people.</p></speech>

I suspect it will be the same at this session.  Do we need to seriously invest in second level in order that guidance counselling is available?  The Chairman put together a significant unit of work on bullying in schools.  The need for guidance counselling and one-on-one relationship service within schools was another thing referenced.  Do we need it in terms of helping students to see a pathway that is not just the leaving certificate to a third-level institution and that academic pathway?  Do we need to make that investment?</p></speech>

We have a responsibility to build it up within our own sector as well.  I am very struck by Dr. O'Connor's comments, which are hugely valid and probably broaden the discussion.  If we talk about everything to do with 16- and 17-year-olds as being what happens within the school, we limit our options quite frankly.</p><p>This is because schools can only do so much within the number of hours each day.  We will build up our own guidance supports as well, with guidance in the community, and guidance that will be made available to students and the population about information about apprenticeships.  The short answer is "Yes".  We need to support guidance.  Guidance counsellors are being asked to do a huge amount.  It is an ever more complex role for a whole variety of reasons, academic and otherwise.  "Yes" is the short answer.</p></speech>

The son decided he wanted to become a plumber.  The professional parents nearly had a conniption, because he was not going to get a professional job and that he was going get hands dirty.  They decided to go to the guidance counsellor to try change his mind and that he would go to a more professional job.  The guidance counsellor told them their son was happy with what he wanted to do and that they should let him do that.  It tells us the two sides of the importance of guidance counsellors.  The parents were trying to talk the son out of what he wanted to, which was a trade.  He would probably make more money than what the parents were making.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh raised this point.  We are fully committed to it.  However, I want to emphasise the point Mr. Brownlee made.  It is a serious point from a policy perspective.  We will not be found wanting as a Department, nor will SOLAS as an agency of our Department, in making sure we do everything we can to expand retrofitting skills.  However, we need to consider what policy instruments are required to create demand.  This demand should be on two fronts.  The first relates to demand by those who wish to access the training and how one incentivises that.  The second relates to demand by people who want to get their home retrofitted and how we incentivise that.  I am fully committed to this.  It has to be done in half a million houses.  We are opening centres of excellence to train people.  We want those centres of excellence to be busy.  I want to flag with this committee that we will need a policy discussion about how we incentivise demand by people who are looking for the training and demand for people who wish to be able to have the works carried out on their home, office, business, or building.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about the climate emergency.  It is important to note that it is not the planet that is in danger, but it is us, as a species, who are in danger.  We have to put the measures in place to ensure that we survive as a species.  It is that serious.  There is a moment for us in education across primary, secondary and tertiary.  That moment is now and we have got to grab it.  We need to be a lot more ambitious about transition year.  The suggestions Dr. O'Connor had are excellent, but they need to be throughout school, and not just in transition year.  In the GCSEs, for instance, students can do Bitesize.  They can be accredited in the UK system.  Why not do the same here and look at doing it every single year?  School, fundamentally, is a transition.  It is not just one year.  Let us look at the whole of the schooling system.  </p> <p>  Additionally, we should not have the kind of conversation where we talk about academic kids versus non-academic kids.  Apprenticeships are not necessarily non-academic.  There are all kinds of apprenticeships.  Apprenticeships just mean that the person is doing a particular job that requires mentorship.</p> <p>  I would like to address the point that leaving certificate lets down academic kids too.  Secondary school lets down gifted children.  We talk about giftedness as a special need, but we do not provide the services for that special need.  In legislation it is a special need and, yet, what are we doing there?  Let us not forget that in the conversation.  That goes for some of the universities as well.  I know this having done guest lecturing with third level students.  The students come into third level feeling bedazzled, even though they are academic children and young people.</p><p>Does the Minister have any thoughts around some of those issues?  I will come back in with a couple more questions.</p></speech>

Earlier, I posed a question about climate skills in trying to help this committee with its deliberations on leaving certificate reform.  While we have a role to do with third level in terms of climate and green skills, why are we retrofitting our citizens with those skills at that age when we could be doing it much earlier?  They are demanding we do it much earlier, as the Senator knows very well.  They are taking to the streets.  They want action at every level and to play their part.  I do not want, in years to come, a committee asking the Minister of the day how many more places he or she is putting in for people in their 40s, 50s and 60s to get the green skills, when we have a chance to start people in within the education system within an earlier stage.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator.  It is dangerous to categorise children, full stop.  What does academic versus vocational even mean?  One can be academic in one area and vocational in another.  It is about providing as many different pathways to access different skills in different and flexible ways as possible.  I am glad the Senator made the point on apprenticeships.  If I walked down Grafton Street now and asked people what an apprenticeship was, I guarantee people would tell me it was all the crafts and would list the craft apprenticeships one by one.  Of course, they are not wrong and we need more people in those and want to promote and do more but one could do a PhD in an apprenticeship or a master's degree in science in an apprenticeship in Ireland.  One can do a level 8 degree as an apprentice.  An apprenticeship is not something over here, it is a different way of obtaining that qualification, as Dr. O'Connor will know in QQI.</p> <p>  Apprenticeships are much broader.  I met the CEO of an insurance company in a DEIS school the other day.  He entered the company through an apprenticeship scheme and is now the CEO.  This is the norm throughout the European Union.  We are outliers in that regard.  We are expanding the number of apprenticeship programmes into areas that have been seen in this country as non-traditional apprenticeship areas.  I welcome the Senator's point.</p></speech>

I have been reading through the submissions.  Reference has been made in a couple of submissions to students with special educational needs.  We have had internal debates about this in my party.  Previously, there have been thresholds in the public sector with a target of 2% of employees being people coming from special educational backgrounds.  Where are we at with that?  I am having significant difficulty back in Cork in trying to get programmes off the ground with both local authorities whereby a certain percentage of people would be employed or taking on trainees as trainees or given placement.  These people are highly skilled in their own way and the private sector in Cork seems to be doing an awful lot more than we as the public sector or State are doing.</p></speech>

I will ask the HEA to provide to the committee any data it has on numbers and percentages and maybe SOLAS also has some information.  I will highlight two actions we are taking.  One is on apprenticeships.  We are setting targets for the public sector for the first time for 750 apprentices to be taken on in a year in the public sector by 2025, compared to an average of approximately 80 now.  It is a big step up.  The quota for who will do what will be worked out between now and next July and then brought to Government.  That is about the public sector having to step up.</p> <p>  Alongside that, in the apprenticeship action plan, should be read the commitment to increase diversity among apprenticeships.  There is specific reference to disabilities.  We will be setting up a group in the apprenticeship action plan to look at how we improve access.  I am happy to keep in touch with the Deputy on that.  We are doing broader work on which I can write to the committee.  We are quite excited about it.  One could argue the cliff edge for a person with disability has moved from being from primary to secondary and is now from secondary to third level.</p><p>That is not to say there are not good examples out there, the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities, TCPID, being one that springs to mind.  I met parents of children with Down's syndrome recently who told me that not only was it heartbreaking for them as parents to not watch their child progress post-school, but they were having to watch their child regress.  A fund of &euro;5 million was provided in the budget this year to provide pathways for people with intellectual disabilities into further and higher education.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, and I have been charged with looking at how we do that transition planning.  When I was Minister for Health we were having a conversation every year about school leavers in the context of residential places and day care.  While I am not suggesting that is not important, I am not sure that the same level of conversation is being had about training places, for example.  In fact, I know it is not, to be quite frank.  We have been asked by the Taoiseach to bring proposals to the Cabinet committee on education.  If this committee wants to hear more on that, we can provide more details but as an initial step, I will send a note on it.</p></speech>

It is good to see that things have progressed in terms of embedding environmentalism and sustainable skills across subjects.  That is an important point.  It is not just that certain students will learn about retrofitting.  Every single apprenticeship and qualification needs to have that embedded within it because we must all deal with the crisis we are now in.  Macra na Feirme has raised with me the fact that it would like to see options for ecologists.  I ask the witnesses to speak to the specific skills and areas that have been identified as requiring more places.  What needs to be done in order to make that happen?  I would also welcome any comments they wish to make on the points I made previously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#U00400"><p>I thank the Senator and agree with the idea that this split between academic and vocational education and training is not particularly helpful.  Any vocational education and training programme or qualification is going to require strong foundations in general education anyway so the aforementioned idea is a false choice.  General education is also key for long-term progression.  As the Minister said before he left, we have doctoral level apprenticeships.  That is not just a symbolic statement.  We actually have them in practice.  That is quite unusual internationally and shows that we mean it when we talk about higher vocational education and training as distinct from higher education.  That is a point well made.</p> <p>  On the skills piece, the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS identifies skills that are in demand and provides forecasting in that area.  The labour market intelligence function that we have can tell us, whether it is with regard to ecology or other areas, not just what occupations are in demand but also the skills and competencies that we will need for those particular occupations.  It is really important to invest in and maintain that infrastructure so that we have good visibility.  It is tricky these days to determine what we will need three, four or five years down the line.  That labour market intelligence is also relevant for guidance and understanding the skills that are needed.  If we are designing qualifications or educational programmes at this stage, we need to have good visibility, with a good deal of granularity, of the skills and competencies that we will need to build into qualifications.  That could include sustainable education principles, green practices or green knowledge.  We need to have that foresight and visibility from our labour market function which is well developed but not always well used, particularly in the senior cycle and in parts of the education and training system.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#U00500"><p>As Dr. O' Connor mentioned, we have a skills and labour market research unit which is actively working on an analysis of future skills needs in the green space.  We think of those in terms of three broad categories, one of which is green skills for construction.  This relates to things like retrofitting and we have a reasonably good handle on the scale of the skills needs in that area.</p><p>Interesting research that we have got to date from the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit, SLMRU, suggests that when you go beyond that, it is not so much about specific green jobs in five, ten or 15 years.  Rather, many jobs will require a sustainability or a green skills component.  If agriculture, for example, is going to be sustainable, we will need a wide base of farmers and their employees who have that deep understanding of green skills and energy management, emissions, and minimising carbon footprint.  Manufacturing is another area.  If we are going to meet our targets, the whole industry of meat processing has to change.  Green skills for careers is about embedding green skills into particular industries and occupations, rather than bringing in 50,000 new green jobs.  That is what we seem to be hearing already.  The biggest part of this are agents of change.  We should make sure that every learner who does a further education and training course is given a module in sustainability, on minimising carbon footprint, and on green skills.  There is an ambition in the further education and training, FET, strategy to embed that across every FET offering.  We could do that across the entire tertiary space and, as we have heard, start embedding it at school level as well.  That is how we will start to change the dial on this.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Conlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#V00200"><p>I thank the Senator for an interesting question.  I am thinking about the education for sustainable development strategy, which is currently in development.  It addresses matters more generally.  There will be a specific skills piece.  We work closely with SOLAS and the SLMRU in identifying skills needs and addressing them.  There is a broader piece about education for sustainable development in curriculum, in further and higher education, as well as in post-primary.  This is because the industrial and technical responses to the climate challenge will be highly technical skills solutions.  Behavioural responses are also needed, where the onus is on all of us to be aware of and to understand the environmental and social impacts of our actions.  That will be important in the formation of citizens across the curriculum in higher education.  As I say, that education for sustainable development strategy is on the way.  Embeddedness in the curriculum across the board will be important for the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs.  Another example is that we are currently operating a North-South research programme, which is going to invest heavily in all-island research.  We are asking people not to just talk about a specific scientific project, but about the impact of that project on environmental sustainability, as well as on the broader UN sustainable development goals.  This maps out to European research, which I know goes a long way from leaving certificate.  However, it is the direction of travel and trajectory we are on.  Those "do no significant harm" principles underpin all kinds of public funding rounds and all kinds of proposals.  There are particular technical skills in retrofit, but the broader agenda of sustainable development is for all citizens to respond to.  For that reason, it should be embedded across curricula at all levels.</p></speech>

I would like to begin by asking each of the witnesses who are still here to elaborate on the question I raised earlier with the Minister.  What we can do to encourage greater participation from people with special educational needs or with disabilities into our education system and on to the workforce?</p> <p>  I was listening to the discussion earlier from my office about how useful and practical transition year work experience can be.  To give my own experience, that is where I found that I wanted to be a teacher, having worked with a disability service provider.  I was 15 or 16 years of age.  I worked there once a week over the course of a school year.  After that, I worked in a local national school.  That is where I made the decision that I wanted to be a teacher.  That pathway was obvious to me at that point because I was given that opportunity.  I had a number of friends who did the conventional apprenticeships, such as plumbing, electrics, or fabrication, in some cases.</p><p>They got a similar flavour for that and subsequently, they went on and trained in those fields.  We need to highlight the importance of TY work experience and the impression it can give people for their career paths.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that and on the importance of TY.</p><p> I want to raise apprenticeships, which we always talk about in this committee and I have listened to various witnesses discuss it.  I have gone on a tour of a few universities in recent weeks and many of the providers there spoke of our ambitious targets for apprenticeships.  When one hears the word "ambitious" being flung around, one wonders whether we can meet those targets.  I know we will have difficulties due to the Covid pandemic but certain universities and providers have difficulties with capacity, for example.  Those capacity issues have been exacerbated due to providing for social distancing, air ventilation and whatever the restrictions on capacity might be.  We need to examine how we will combat that in the short term because it will have a knock-on effect for all the schemes we are talking about in these Houses every week, be it retrofitting or whatever.</p></speech>

It is outside of my area of expertise but I note from the senior cycle review that much has been made of this particular innovation in the junior cycle where there are level 1 and level 2 programmes that are designed for students with learning disabilities in particular.  That is an important and significant innovation but what options will those people have in the senior cycle?  When we are looking beyond the junior cycle, what is the progression from level 1 and level 2 programmes?  It is on the radar in the senior cycle review, so the policymakers are looking at where useful and valuable progression routes can be provided for students from level 1 and level 2 programmes in junior cycle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021110200002#W00300"><p>I will double-check this statistic when I go back but we have 13,000 learners with disabilities currently engaged in further education and training.  A concern of ours is that there has been a decline during the period of Covid shutdown and restrictions.  People with disabilities need in-person support and when we have been relying purely on online modes of learning delivery that has suffered and it has also suffered for other groups that are most at risk of exclusion.  Specialist training provision is split.  This is the kind of dedicated provision provided by Rehab Group, for example, and then there are people with special educational needs and disabilities involved in mainstream further education and training provision.  There are two things we need to do and to get better at.  We need to make sure that if one is starting off in specialist training provision, there is a pathway to move through further education and training and into higher education.  The second part is that there is consistent learner support.  It should not matter where one presents across the country; one should have access to the same learner support that will allow one to learn and engage with one's peers and teachers and progress along that pathway.  It is not consistent at the moment and that is a big priority in the further education and training strategy.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the targets for apprenticeships are realistic.  In the last apprenticeship action plan we underestimated the lead-in time to develop new apprenticeships and so there was always a lag of about a year.  Before the pandemic we were already at over 6,000 new registrations per year and there is good news from 2021 already.  Despite the fact that we have been operating under restrictions this year, craft apprenticeships are up by 13% on 2019 levels.  As the new apprenticeships are up by about 100% on where they were in 2020, we are already seeing the growth.</p><p>We now know how long it takes to develop these new apprenticeship programmes, so moving from 6,000 to 10,000 over the five-year period is realistic.</p></speech>

I noted it when Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan mentioned it earlier.  We recently provided funding support through a special scheme for recognising performance in higher education for the expansion of the certificate in contemporary living at UCC, which I am sure the Deputy is aware of.  It looks at ways for students with intellectual disabilities to engage with higher education and their contemporary living.  We are currently discussing the outreach programme with UCC.  It will be reflective of the broader ambition of our national strategy to ensure that the student body entering and participating in higher education at all levels reflects the diversity of Ireland's population.  The programme in UCC in particular is of interest to us.  As Mr. Brownlee said, while some provision has proven challenging during the pandemic, institutions are learning from that and looking at new ways to reach out and engage in different ways with students and broader communities.  This goes back to some of the earlier points about lifelong learning.  There are additional ways of reaching out, but that is not necessarily germane to leaving certificate reform.  The important thing for us is that when students arrive in higher education that they have the supports available to them.</p></speech>

I am Seamus Hempenstall, principal officer in the mental health unit, and I am accompanied by Ms Doyle in person and Mr. Kelly online, both of whom work full time on the Bill.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 was progressive for its time.  Over the past two decades, however, there has been a fundamental shift in how we view mental health as a society and how we provide treatment to people with mental health conditions.  This meant the operation of the Act needed to be reviewed and updated.  The purpose of the general scheme is to move the Act towards empowering people accessing mental health services to make decisions about their own healthcare insofar as possible.</p><p>While it may be necessary to provide for involuntary detention in the future, the general scheme seeks to bring this practice in line with Ireland's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy.</p><p> The initial review began with a comprehensive public consultation and, following this, an expert review group was established.  The group drew on expertise from the fields of psychiatry, law and people with lived experience of mental health services.  The group published its report in 2015 and included 165 recommendations, most of which related to legislative changes.  The Department has been progressing a review of the Act over the past number of years, which has included extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, as well as a public consultation earlier this year during which 100 submissions were received.  The review of the Act also considered Ireland's commitments under the UN CRPD, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as more recent domestic legislation, particularly the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018.  </p><p> There are nearly 130 heads in the general scheme and the proposed amendments touch on every aspect of the Act.  The briefing documents provided to the committee set out an overview of the proposed changes to each section.  I will highlight some of the most significant changes.  The general scheme replaces the existing paternalistic best-interests principle in section 4 with a set of guiding principles for adults and children.  All people will be presumed to have capacity in line with the 2015 capacity Act and, for those who lack capacity, these guiding principles set out how decisions are made about their care and treatment.  For children, best interests will continue to be the primary consideration in line with commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p><p> The process of involuntary detention has been updated.  In line with Sharing the Vision and our commitments under the UN CRPD, involuntary detention should only be used as a last resort.  While under the existing Act detention can take place on the basis of risk or treatment, the Bill will ensure that treatment is part of the basis for all cases of involuntary detention.  Furthermore, the Bill will provide for all applications for involuntary detention to be made by authorised officers.  </p><p> The approach to consent to treatment has been completely revised to take account of a person's capacity in line with the 2015 capacity Act, moving towards a model where each individual is more involved as a co-decision maker in his or her care and treatment.  The limited circumstances where treatment without consent can be given have been clearly defined in the general scheme. </p><p> The Mental Health Commission's regulatory remit will be extended beyond approved centres to encompass all residential mental health facilities and mental health services.  In future, all mental health facilities and services will, therefore, be registered, regulated and inspected by the commission.  </p><p> A new Part has been introduced setting out the process of admission and consent to treatment for children, introducing capacity and consent for young people and mirroring safeguards for adults under the Act for children, such as the right to information.  The Bill will provide for the presumption of capacity for all young people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to mental health treatment.  This will bring parity between mental health and physical health on consent, as the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act provides for people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to medical treatment. </p><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Department are keen to see the Bill introduced to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  We will continue to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, over the coming months to prepare the Bill.  We look forward to continuing to work with this committee as it carries out pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS.  I thank committee members for their time and I am happy to take questions. </p></speech>

I do not usually talk about personal matters but I got my wisdom teeth out and I am very sore at the moment.  I am here on a listening brief more than anything else.  I appreciate the officials coming in.  The reason I am here is that I see the importance of the committee getting this kind of grounding in the Mental Health Act.  It is very important to get those foundations in place.</p> <p>  I have one question.  I welcome the fundamental shift there has been in how we, as a society, see mental health issues now compared with the past.</p><p>There was a dark age in the past when people with mental health issues were not treated as well as they should have been.  People like that involuntarily being taken out of society seemed to be the norm rather than the exception.  We need modern and up-to-date legislation on that.  Our briefing note states that the Mental Health Commission will be asked to inspect all mental health facilities.  What facilities will that include and what facilities were not being inspected previously?</p></speech>

There are around 60 of those and the commission has a programme of inspection to visit all of those annually.  It is proposed that once the Act has been brought in, the Mental Health Commission will have powers to inspect all other kinds of mental health facilities such as day services and other types of residences.  I do not know the numbers offhand but perhaps my colleague, Mr. Kelly, can give us more detail on that.</p></speech>

It can inspect anywhere it chooses to but it can only regulate and register inpatient facilities.  Under the updated Act, it will be able to inspect, enter and register day hospitals, 24-hour residences that are nurse-led, step-down facilities and, eventually, all services, including the likes of Jigsaw and any counselling services that provide mental health services on behalf of the State.  The scope of how far that will go is a discussion we will have with the Mental Health Commission as those powers come into force.</p></speech>

It is a big undertaking to do that so that is something we will have to work on.  I refer to the provision for 16 and 17-year-olds to refuse or consent to their own mental health treatment.  What is the difference between what is provided for in the heads of Bill and what was in place previously?</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I also congratulate and thank them for the work they do on behalf of society.</p> <p>  I return to the point Deputy Ward raised about funding.  It is a regular occurrence that legislation passed by these Houses in good faith and for good reason, namely, to improve people's lives, does not get acted on to the level we would expect.  Has the Department done costings and agreed budgets?</p> <p>  On the timeline for passing this legislation, is there a particular time by which we can expect inspections to take place and the various sections of the Bill to be implemented?  Will some elements be implemented and others not implemented?  Is there a commitment or a timeline set out for the implementation of the legislation and a budgetary framework to ensure that when it is enacted, the Mental Health Commission will exercise these powers and be given real teeth?</p></speech>

To give a short answer, we do not have a specific plan yet because we are at an early stage in the drafting of the legislation.  We have to wait for it to be passed.</p><p>We have a very good relationship with the commission.  It has the resources it needs to conduct the current programme of inspections.  I would not envisage that we would have a situation where we would give the Mental Health Commission a series of responsibilities without taking into account the funding and resources it would need.  I would rather not tempt fate and say this is what we plan to do and when we plan to do it.</p></speech>

The legislation will be framed to give the commission the powers it clearly needs.  I imagine there must be even an aspirational plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hempenstall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#D00300"><p>What I could do for the Senator is to get figures on the budget the commission has at the moment and the number of inspections it does in order to see if we can work something out there.  The commission has a programme of inspections based on a range of criteria.  I presume it knows how long it takes for each inspection, and it has resources assigned to it.  Going forward, I would have thought that as we extend the commission's remit based on the legislation and regulations that there may well be different formats of investigation or inspection depending on the type of facility.  Perhaps I am splitting hairs here, but I do not think it would be fair to say that based on this costing, this is how much we envisage that another thing would cost in the future.</p></speech>

In terms of the knowledge of the legislation, are there any concerns about what is omitted from it?  Does it address all of the concerns and aspirations of the Department?  Is Mr. Hempenstall concerned about any element of the legislation?  The Bill will be debated and, potentially, amended?  Is there anything Mr. Hempenstall wants to share with us that we should be trying to police as best we can as legislators?</p></speech>

I will invite Mr. Kelly to contribute in a moment.  No legislation is ever complete.  We fully expect to have unknowns and knowns arise as we go forward in terms of drafting.  That is the nature of the beast.  As a Department, we are happy.  It has been a long process.  We have covered an awful lot of bases in the Bill and it does represent a significant advance on what we had before.  I cannot say we have covered everything in absolute detail, but I am confident that with the input from the PLS in the committee, the consultation we have done and will be doing, and with the work of the OPC and the Attorney General's office, we have a good piece of legislation to bring before the Oireachtas and then we will have Committee Stage, at which point any amendments can be debated.  I do not mean to sound as if I am trying to be smart but we are looking forward to the process because it is only through those questions and answers that we get to a decent piece of legislation.  Perhaps Mr. Kelly would like to add something.</p></speech>

The original drafting of the general scheme was based on a 2015 Government decision, which was to give effect to those 165 recommendations of the expert group.  Time has moved on since 2015 as well.  In 2018, we ran it by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015 as well.  What we have been trying to do with this piece of legislation it to take all of the recommendations from the expert group on board and also to be aware of the significant developments that have happened in the field since then.  Over the past two to two and a half years, we have also had a lot of consultation with some of the key stakeholders and we have been building relationships with organisations in the NGO sector and with professional groupings, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and the Mental Health Commission.  As Mr. Hempenstall said, we are never going to catch everything in one piece of legislation or at least not with the first stab, but what it does reflect is the broad-based consultation that we have carried on in recent years.  We are happy with the shape the Bill is in right now but I am sure that something will come up during PLS or on Committee Stage that will give us a further opportunity to consider.</p></speech>

I had to leave the meeting for a couple of seconds so I apologise if any of my questions have been already asked.  In regard to the expert group not making a recommendation for an independent route for the making of a complaint, is there a reason for that?  Mental Health Reform is firm in its opinion that there should be an independent route for making complaints to ensure parity between mental and physical health.  Will the opportunity be taken to look at that again?</p></speech>

There are sections within the draft general scheme - at least three of them - relating to the provision of information to people.  They provide for people to receive information on complaints procedures in whatever approved inpatient facility they are in.  Under the draft general scheme, the remit of the Inspector of Mental Health Services has been expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and services.  There is inspection already provided for and the general scheme provides for additional expansion.  The Office of the Ombudsman has a role in investigating complaints in the HSE as well.  That is where we are on that.  Mr. Kelly might like to add something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#E00400"><p>We have had a back and forth engagement on this with our colleagues in Mental Health Reform.  Our discussions have been pretty productive to date.  It is an ongoing conversation in developing the final draft of the Bill.</p> <p>  On the issue of parity of esteem, the Ombudsman is open to anyone who accesses services through the HSE.  Any person who wishes to make a complaint or have a complaint against the HSE investigated can do so regardless of whether it is for a disability service, mental health service or physical health service.  At the moment, that is open to anyone who accesses services through the HSE on an equal basis regardless of what service is being accessed.</p> <p>  On mental health, the Inspector of Mental Health Services, which sits within the Mental Health Commission, has a significant role under the Act in terms of its functions and in meeting with anyone in a mental health facility who, during the course of an inspection, asks to meet with it.  It is not exactly an independent complaints mechanism but, taken together, the inspector and the Office of the Ombudsman already perform a function similar to that which an independent complaints mechanism might perform.</p> <p>  As stated by Mr. Hempenstall, the conversation channel remains open.  We met recently with Mental Health Reform and we will continue to meet with it on the development of the draft Bill.  I am sure it will be a discussion that we will continue to have in the future.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly stated that it is in effect the same elsewhere but if we are drafting legislation, why not make it not just in effect the same but actually the same?  I am sure we will come across this issue again as we move along.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing what engagement took place with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in terms of this legislation, in particular how it interacts with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Has the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth had sight of the draft Bill given the crossover with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015?  I am sure there are other areas in respect of which there will also be a crossover.  Has the Department of Health been working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this legislation?</p></speech>

At the moment, most of the revisions related to children are contained within section 25 of the existing Act.  We are expanding that out in Part 8 to give its own stand-alone section, make clear what the protections for children are and set those out in statute.</p><p>We engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs early in the process.  In December 2019, I think, we gave that Department the initial draft of Part 8 and provisions relating to children elsewhere.  We had a good working relationship with the Department over the year and a half that it took for us to get from that point to the point of publication.</p><p> When the responsibilities for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth we worked with the latter Department on the 2015 Act.  We are very keen to make sure that the Mental Health Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act are aligned correctly.  From our discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, I know it is keen to ensure we get this right as well.  This matter has been very much at the forefront of our minds.  We are very lucky to have had a fruitful engagement with that Department on both the children and capacity sides over the past 18 months or so.</p></speech>

Does the inclusion of these sorts of measures in this legislation conflict with Sharing the Vision?  Obviously, restraints are seen as a last resort.  If we strive to have the best and broadest mental health legislation, should there not be zero restraints?  The legislation and the Sharing the Vision policy do not seem to be aligned.  Again, all of these matters will be teased out as we go along.</p></speech>

The policy and the legislation are, therefore, very much entwined with each other.  Sharing the Vision is a ten-year strategy and nine years of it remain.  We have included the parts on restrictive practices and tried to bring in some additional safeguards.  There is an understanding that we want to minimise restraint as much as possible, to the point where we will no longer need it.  It is a stepping down process, however, and additional resources, training and so forth must be put into place in approved centres to ensure that all staff and residents feel safe.  Over the lifetime of Sharing the Vision, we will move towards a "zero restraint, zero seclusion" policy but, for the interim, it is important to include safeguards.  As the Senator said, we have to provide for last-resort scenarios.  While we are heading towards the policy, we are not there yet so we must provide for these at some level.  What we are trying to do is ensure there are safeguards in place while it is still permitted.</p></speech>

Mr. Hempenstall stated the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Department are keen to see the Bill introduced to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  How can the committee undertake pre-legislative scrutiny when we do not have the legislation in front of us?  It is going to be a difficult job for us.  Will the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel liaise with the clerk to the committee?  Will Mr. Hempenstall feed back our concerns?  What is the timeframe for the legislation?  Mr. Hempenstall used the term "as soon as possible".  Given the delay in amending and commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, I am worried that we are being rushed into this pre-legislative scrutiny when we only have the heads of a Bill.</p></speech>

What we have is a fairly comprehensive general scheme in which many of the legislative provisions are already written up.  It is with the Office of the Attorney General at the moment.  I cannot say I have done pre-legislative scrutiny before but we would not engage in this process without trying to take into account what the committee says.</p><p>We have had the consultation and a lot of time has gone by.  There was another round of top-up consultation.  I would expect that, as part of this process, if the subcommittee raised concerns we would try to take them into account in conjunction with the drafting process being undertaken by the Attorney General.  As I said, things will always arise that we did not foresee.  There may well be drafting issues associated with particular provisions too.  It is a kind of living process.  What I tried to get across in my opening statement was that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, want to move the legislation forward as quickly as possible but not in the sense of guillotining any debate.  It is a huge piece of legislation with significant pieces of policy at the top and a lot of technical things at the bottom.  They are all important and they all need to get done.  It is an interesting piece of legislation from that perspective.  There is momentum behind getting it done now, but that is not to shorten any process of consideration.  </p><p> Earlier, the Senator asked about costings and I said I did not have any.  I see from my note that the Mental Health Commission did supply us with its own estimates and figures.  I will send the information that we have from the commission to the Senator.  The Department has not agreed any figures or plans.  That part of my answer is right.</p></speech>

I have an idea in my head and maybe I am wrong.  It seems to me that the subcommittee is bringing in witnesses to talk about heads of Bill but they do not even know what the Bill is.  We are not sure what the Bill is.  That detail is very important if we are going to do pre-legislative scrutiny.  Is there any idea when we will see the full Bill, when it will be done and dusted?</p></speech>

I would not envisage our moving significantly beyond any of the major policy issues or the technical things either.  I do not think it is valid to say that we do not know how it is.  There is a fairly significant briefing document to go along with the heads.  If the subcommittee has queries about particular aspects, that is what this process is for.  I know Mr. Kelly has been liaising with the clerk as well on how long the pre-legislative scrutiny process with take and that will feed into the timetable for doing the Bill.  The timeframe is not entirely within our gift.  There are 15 other Departments with legislation and who knows what 2022 will bring?  I wanted to convey that there is energy and momentum behind this.  We want to move ahead and get it done as quickly as reasonably possible.</p></speech>

Senator Hoey mentioned the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  That passed through the Oireachtas in 2015, six years ago, and it has not been implemented.  What is the knock-on effect of that?  If it was implemented, what effect would it have on this legislation?  This might have been answered but I would like it clarified for myself.</p></speech>

Had the 2015 Act been fully commenced any time before now it would not have a direct impact on the Mental Health Act prior to 2018 because many of the provisions of the 2015 Act do not apply to people receiving treatment under the Mental Health Act.  I believe that was written into that Act at the time because the review of the Mental Health Act had already begun and they wanted the process to continue, so that down the line the two Acts would dovetail and align when the updated Mental Health Act came in.</p><p>We have aligned a lot of our understanding with what the capacity and the decision-making supports are - all of the things contained in the 2015 Act.  We have aligned those in the updated Mental Health Act or that is what we hope to do.  Fully commencing the Act will rely on a fully commenced capacity Act but I expect this to happen next year and I hope that depending on how the legislative process goes, sections of our Act would begin to be commenced in 2023.  Hopefully, the timelines should add up.  That is certainly what we are working towards.  </p></speech>

I like the extension of who is going to police all of this and the extra powers in it.  The witnesses spoke about capacity within the Act but we also need capacity within the system to complement the Act.  I have not gone through all these amendments, although I have gone through an awful lot of them.  The board is being given a lot more power and there are fines so it will push people into a bit of responsibility.  I got down to page 193 this morning but I will read it over and over again.  In respect of protected disclosures and giving people power within the system, that must be addressed.</p> <p>  If this Government falls within 12 or 24 months, does this work fall as well?  That is my biggest fear.  It has taken such a long time to get to this and there are a lot of very strong and positive recommendations in it.  It is grand to have them all down on paper but it is about how we get the urgency to get them enacted.  A Bill can be passed in these Houses but, unfortunately, it can sit on the shelf for a while before anything happens to it.  My only concern is how we move it on and get the recommendations in place.  At the same time, do we need to do something running parallel to this to complement the services that will be needed because this committee is well aware of it?  We talk about improvements in mental health services here yet in my home town, a mental health centre is being closed.  Pardon the pun but this is lunacy when we are in the middle of a pandemic.  A centre that worked perfectly and never had a case of Covid or a suicide must close because having decided not to put money into it in the past number of years, the HSE is now saying the building is at fault and is trying to move patients out of it.  We are here trying to improve mental health services and responsibilities.  The Bill talks about the responsibilities of proprietors.  I welcome anything positive but my two biggest fears concern whether it moves on swiftly enough to get the Bill enacted.  I would be optimistic.  The two Ministers support us.  Normally, one meets a lot of opposition with the Department of Justice.  It is the one that seems to slow down mental health stuff a lot.  I would be very anxious to move this on but if something must run in parallel to complement the services, will it be enough?  The other point concerns electro-convulsive therapy, ECT.  I have not reached it yet but I am worried about it.  Must it exist in this country in 2021?  However, that is a question for another day.  </p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Kelly to address those questions because they are substantive issues relating to the legislation.  All I can say is that I am not thinking about a change of Government.  We are just trying to get on with the job of moving this forward as quickly as we reasonably can taking into account the Chairman's views in terms of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p> In relation to the centre to which the Deputy referred, that is an operational decision made by the HSE.  In my view, the legislation is the framework and the operations are the muscles to get the whole thing going.  The two are related but they are separate.</p><p> It is positive that the remit of the Mental Health Commission will be expanded.  Mental health services are an important part of the health service and they should be regulated just like other health services.  The improvement of our mental health services under Sharing the Vision is proceeding as quickly as possible.  As Mr. Kelly said, we are only in the first year but my colleagues in the unit are working very hard on that with their colleagues in the HSE.  I do not need to rehearse the fact that we had another record budget for mental health services.  The impetus and momentum is there and for my own part, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, I can say that the energy and enthusiasm are genuine and substantive.  I will invite Mr. Kelly to respond now to the points raised.</p></speech>

What we were trying to do with that was to bring the governance of the commission and the related corporate aspects in line with good governance in other public sector bodies.  A lot of improvements have been made over the last 20 years and we tried to mirror those in that Part.  This would include protected disclosures.  I do not know if we have actually included an explicit reference to them but anyone making a protected disclosure relating to a public sector body would be protected.  Staff in the commission would be protected as would staff in the HSE or a Department.  That said, we can look at this further if the committee believes it is something that requires more thought in the context of the final Bill.</p> <p>  Electroconvulsive therapy or ECT has been retained in the Act and we have updated the measures related to it.  My understanding is that ECT in 2021 is not the ECT that we know from popular culture, as in the film "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".  It has developed hugely in the intervening 50 years and is now regarded as quite an effective treatment for certain types of mental health conditions.  We are retaining it because it does have some clinical value.  The committee could invite clinicians or representative bodies for health professionals who would be more qualified to speak on this but it is my understanding that ECT is an effective treatment and that is why we have decided to retain it.</p></speech>

I just want to put on the record that the protected disclosures system is not just weak but is absolutely flat.  Unfortunately, in my experience, those who have made protected disclosures within the mental health system have been penalised.  One issue in particular has never been properly resolved.  The individual ticked all of the boxes and went all the way up through the system.  The protected disclosure eventually reached a Minister but it was dismissed.  I wanted to flag this issue because while there is excellent work going on in the mental health services, there is also wrongdoing and when people come out and tell the truth, they are not being protected and the issues are not being resolved.</p></speech>

I cannot think of any more important work for us this year than the oversight of this legislation.  It is an incredibly important piece of work and I thank our witnesses for taking the time to bring us through the general scheme.  I am in the same position as Deputy Buckley in terms of only starting this conversation.  It will take a lot of granular work to get through all of this because there is a lot of information here.  In that context, I will try to use my time to contextualise some of the issues for myself.</p> <p>  In the documentation provided and in some of the briefings we had previously, there is some discussion on this issue but from the witnesses' perspective, what are the other key pieces of legislation with which this legislation will interact?</p><p>What else should we reference when we debate this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#K00200"><p>I might answer that question.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is probably that which is most influential on our legislation.  Unfortunately, it is very complex and I struggle to get my head around it sometimes.  The provisions in the 2015 Act are probably the most important to the update of the Mental Health Act and to the idea of co-decision making and empowering people accessing mental health services.</p> <p>  Another important Act is the Child Care Act 1991.  In the existing Mental Health Act, section 25, as I mentioned, deals mainly with the treatment of children and references the Child Care Act, which I understand is being reviewed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  One recommendation of the expert group was to move all the cross-references to the Child Care Act into the Mental Health Act in order that if someone is reading the latter Act, he or she will not have to cross-reference it against other Acts and it will be as simple as legislation can be in that regard.  We have included those provisions in the Bill but the Child Care Act is always useful to refer back to.</p> <p>  Finally, there is some reference in the Act to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which came from the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is another Act it would be good to be familiar with.</p></speech>

In respect of the domestic legislation, does the Department envisage that on the conclusion of this work, there will be amendments to the Acts Mr. Kelly mentioned?</p></speech>

There are certain provisions, between the two Acts, that will have to be amended in either our amending Bill or its amending Bill, although that Department hopes to enact and commence its legislation sooner than we do.  There is ongoing conversation between the two Departments as to which is the better vehicle and which is the better timeframe to get those amendments in.  There will be a number of amendments to the capacity Act that will have to come from either that Department&rsquo;s side or our side.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are many references to human rights and international human rights law.  What are the key international or supranational agreements we should consider?</p></speech>

They loomed large in our minds as we drafted the heads.  The European Convention on Human Rights is another document we referred to, and there are a couple of others.  It might be easier for me to revisit the list I have, which I can send on to the committee secretariat for circulation, to ensure I do not miss anything.</p></speech>

To return to the criminal law aspect, I have been reading through the documentation but Mr. Kelly might flag where we are introducing issues that relate more specifically to the justice area and include aspects of criminal law or criminal accountability.  The Department may wish to send further detail to the committee later but Mr. Kelly might just flag a few areas for us now.  Where are we introducing or amending issues that deal with criminality?</p></speech>

Nevertheless, if someone who is detained in the Central Mental Hospital for a fixed custodial term under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act continues to need treatment as he or she is coming to the end of that term, that is, if he or she is not well enough to be let out into the community, there is currently no direct path of access for that person to be admitted to the Central Mental Hospital under the Mental Health Act.</p><p>It is necessary to be transferred to another approved centre and be transferred back.  It can be just a little messy.  We are providing for direct entry for people who continue to need treatment and are coming to the end of their term, so that they will be able to be assessed like anyone else under the Mental Health Act, and they will be able to be directly admitted to the Central Mental Hospital as a person under the Mental Health Act rather than under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  That is one of the big changes.  It is not changing anything fundamental but makes the path into the Central Mental Hospital a bit easier for those people, especially in what might be a time of transition and stress.  We are also looking at setting out specific regulations around designated centres.  The only designated centre in the country at the moment is the Central Mental Hospital.  We are setting out specific standards and regulations for those centres.</p></speech>

Are any of the issues around criminal liability in respect of proprietors?  For example, if somebody engaged with the mental health tribunals who should not have been there and was committing fraud, are there any criminal aspects to do with placing criminal liability on a person in management, administration or oversight?  It is hard to phrase this nicely, but if such a person does not do the right thing, is there any criminal liability introduced there?</p></speech>

We have included additional safeguards so that the registered proprietor or the person in charge of a centre could be liable to be guilty of a crime and be liable to a custodial sentence or a fine if found to be guilty.  Those have already existed in relation to seclusion and restraint but we are expanding it so that a person running an approved centre and it is not registered with the Mental Health Commission that person will be guilty of a crime for that reason.  We have included some additional safeguards to protect against fraudulent-----</p></speech>

One of the areas I read in detail was on involuntary admission which I know will garner more attention that other aspects.  Some issues it raised for me are more general questions.  One of the issues around involuntary admission is how long it lasts, how one is directed to it, and whether it is possible to care for people within community settings.  I am also on the health committee which constantly tries to move towards Sl&aacute;intecare and to ensure that community setting is stitched into everything.  I can see the attempt to stitch that community approach into this legislation.  Is the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and access to suitable community settings of concern in the drafting of this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#L00900"><p>One thing we were very cognisant of was Sharing the Vision which is the national mental health policy.  It is aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare in that it is about providing the right care in the right environment at the right time and moving as much as possible towards community-based care and supporting people with mental health difficulties to live independent lives.</p><p>There is also an understanding that there will always be a need to provide for involuntary detention and inpatient treatment.  Sharing the Vision is a ten-year strategy.  Over the lifetime of that strategy, this updated Bill will become an Act and will be commenced so hopefully they will complement each other as we move towards empowering people's access to services in the community.  That can be seen in section 9, which is about making an application for involuntary detention.  In line with the expert group recommendations we have limited the group of people who can make an application to authorised officers, which are already a prescribed grade within the HSE.  The idea is that the authorised officer would have a more holistic view of the person, such as where he or she lives and what supports are available to that person in the community.  If the officer believes that none of those supports are adequate or that the person needs more acute care, he or she could make the application.  At every stage before the person is brought to the approved centre, consideration will be given to what other supports are available to him or her, and if there is family support, consideration will be given to what is available there and what the capacity is.  Involuntary detention would really only happen as a last resort and we have explicitly said that in section 9.  When a person is resident in an approved centre, he or she should be there for as short a time as possible.  When that person's condition starts to improve to the extent that he or she can be discharged then he or she should be and there should be discharge planning around where the person is going, whether her or she is going back to his or her family and that kind of thing.  It is baked into the general scheme. </p></speech>

Does the changing nature of the structures within the health service pose a challenge when writing this legislation as it relates to governance?  We have the Central Mental Hospital and a whole spectrum of service providers across the country right now.  We are hopefully going through a period of change and we are also trying to develop this legislation but the governance structures might be changing as we go through.  Does that present a challenge for the Department?  It is so important to get that right when appointing people or gathering a body to make decisions around people's lives.  Does that pose a particular challenge and how are the witnesses going to navigate that?</p></speech>

One is the approved centres, which have always been governed by the Mental Health Act, and we are developing that in the updated Act.  Then there are the 24-hour community residences, which include nurse-led step-down facilities, hospitals and things like that, and all mental health services eventually.  We have not included any references to, let us say, community mental health teams, which are a big part of it as well.  There are certain structures that can be captured without needing to be in the legislation itself.  If someone is accessing a mental health service as a day patient, the multidisciplinary team that is responsible for his or her care does not necessarily need to be explicitly named in the Act to know that it is still part of that care team and part of making decisions about that person's treatment.</p> <p>  The main thing we need to get right with the updated Act is involuntary detention.  As it is such a serious thing to do to someone, we have to make sure there are appropriate structures in place and that the person making the decision as to whether someone should or should not be involuntarily detained has the adequate information about the person themselves, about what the services are in the community and that the decision is reviewed.  Admission orders for involuntary detention only last two weeks now rather than three weeks.  It is about shortening those cases of involuntary detention where possible and ensuring that the reviews are more regular than they are now and that any decision to involuntarily detain someone is not taken lightly.</p></speech>

When one is involuntarily detained an admission order is made and the tribunal will review the order after 21 days but it is proposed to reduce the time to 14 days.  A person who is involuntarily detained will be assessed by an independent consultant psychiatrist.  So there will be another examination of the person and a report will be given to the tribunal.  Then the tribunal will meet the person and the person's treating psychiatrist.  After the tribunal reviews all of the documentation and evidence it will either affirm the order, which means affirm that the person needed to be involuntarily detained and suffers from a mental disorder, as it is phrased under the Act, or the order is refused and the person is released.  It is just to ensure that the person's detention is regularly reviewed.</p></speech>

Does this legislation concern itself with best practice for residential mental health facilities?  Are there guidelines for transitioning between services?  We have heard in the last few months when this matter arose that everybody has a unique care plan.  Therefore, there are no guidelines and no references to best practice so that proprietors can do anything.</p></speech>

There is an understanding that care plans are very important to the person accessing mental health services.  Access to a care plan, regular reviews and having an input are very empowering for the persons concerned and important for their path to recovery.  We have included a ruling on care plans in the general scheme.  The ruling is based on 2006 regulations, under the Act.  We may have to update the ruling depending on the outcome of pre-legislative scrutiny and as we continue to receive feedback on the published heads.  We want to make sure that care plans are filled out, reviewed, that the person is involved in making his or her care plan and that a care plan is followed because there is no point in making a care plan but not following it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there should be a template.  I do not know if it is necessary for us to put a template into the Act. </p></speech>

Are proprietors given guidelines?  Is it envisaged that proprietors would receive guidelines or information on best practice for all of the people who reside in a particular placement and what that looks like?</p><p>Otherwise it seems to be devolved, almost nebulous and difficult for proprietors to get a sense of what good practice would look like.  If everything is based on an individual care plan, where is the more directed information for proprietors showing the basics?</p></speech>

The expert group recommended that a post-enactment pre-commencement implementation group be set up among the commission, HSE and Department to work out the kinks with regard to what the proprietors need to transition to this new way of working and treating people.  This will be an opportunity to foster good practice, share it among different types of facilities and have that education piece.  It is probably not for the proposed Bill to be prescriptive on that.  It can come afterwards and it can be baked it into the education and training on what the updated Act means for proprietors, healthcare professionals and patients.</p></speech>

The point was made that the committee has a good chunk of work ahead of us.</p> <p>  An issue that was not raised is the need for 24-7 emergency access to mental health services.  Mental health issues do not only arise between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and they do not take a break at weekends.  There is a lack of 24-7 emergency mental health provision.  When people feel mentally unwell accident and emergency departments are sometimes the only place they can turn to for any sort of help.  We have the testimonies of people who were not listened to or treated well when they accessed an accident and emergency department.  Many left without getting treatment and those who did see somebody often experienced a lack of follow-up.  There is a real gap in 24-7 emergency mental healthcare and, unfortunately, people have died as a result of that gap.</p> <p>  Submissions and recommendations were made to the expert group in relation to treatment prior to admission in an accident and emergency department.  On the word "prior", how far back does that go in relation to a person's treatment?  I know people who presented to an accident and emergency department numerous times and were not admitted.  What was the basis of these submissions?  More important, what recommendations did they make?</p></speech>

The section Deputy Ward is looking for in the heads is section 13B.  That might provide a bit of clarity on our position on that.  What that section tries to do is say is that if someone is in the process of being involuntarily detained, for example, being transferred to an approved centre, and during the course of that transfer the doctor becomes aware that the person might need medical attention for a physical issue, that person would be transferred to an accident and emergency department to receive physical treatment for the ailment.  Then, after the patient recovers sufficiently to be transferred to the approved centre, he or she would be transferred to the approved centre.  It provides that the person's physical health will be looked after in the accident and emergency department and his or her mental health treatment will be looked after in the approved centre, and if he or she needs mental health treatment-----</p></speech>

I am asking whether the heads of Bill address the fact that people are arriving at emergency departments because they are feeling mentally unwell and are not getting the treatment they deserve and need at that point in time?  They are then basically sent home without getting treatment.  I am asking about that rather than cases where people hurt themselves while in a mental health facility.  In other words, I am asking about what happens prior to admission.</p></speech>

Such persons can continue to be transferred from a hospital under the proposed updated Act but we have not included anything on the resourcing of accident and emergency departments or anything like that in the proposed Bill.</p></speech>

An independent complaints mechanism is vital.  Constituents have been contacting me calling for such a mechanism, particularly in the scenario I raised where people seeking mental health services are unable to get them.  Mr. Kelly touched on this matter briefly but what was the rationale behind not recommending an independent complaints mechanism?  Is that decision final?</p></speech>

The issue came up in the public consultation we ran earlier this year.  We considered it at that point but, as I mentioned to Senator Hoey, we concluded that it might be covered already in the existing functions of the inspector and the role of the Office of the Ombudsman in investigating HSE complains.  As I said, the document is a living one and we will consider anything that emerges from the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny.  Nothing is final until the legislation is passed.</p></speech>

My final question is also about gaps in services.  Dual diagnosis arises when people are suffering from a mental health issue and addiction.  Deputy Buckley, who spoke earlier, has made further progress in reading the proposed Bill than I have at this stage but I tried to go through a fair bit of it over the past week.  It is complex.  Is provision made in the proposed Bill in relation to people admitted to mental health services who have an addiction as well as a mental health issue?  Is there anything in it that would help them in the provision of care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#P00500"><p>If, for instance, somebody is being involuntarily detained, the main reason for the detention is that the person fulfils the criteria.  A person could fulfil the criteria and have addiction issues with alcohol or drugs or the person could have an intellectual disability or any number of issues.  No one is precluded from being involuntarily detained by virtue of the fact that he or she has addiction issues.  As long as someone meets the criteria for detention, he or she should be admitted.  That covers the cohort to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  In terms of the specifics on people with addiction issues or dual diagnosis, these would be looked after in the person's individualised care plan and one would hope that the treatment the person would receive would not only be specific to the individual but would treat both aspects of the issue.  We do not go into detail in the proposed Bill.  We do not name any mental health condition either, so there are no references to schizophrenia or depression.  It is more general and all conditions are included without any of them being named.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly mentioned other conditions that can be classed as dual diagnosis.  Where there is an individualised care plan from an addiction centre and another individual care plan from a mental health perspective, there is a lack of a joined-up care plan.  This is another gap in service.  There should be a way of ensuring the person's needs are treated holistically rather than on an individual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Hempenstall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#P00800"><p>We dealt with this matter in detail.  On dual diagnosis, we have a programme manager for the national clinical programme.</p><p>We are developing a model of care which has to do with dual diagnosis.  I also agree with the Deputy at a general level.  People with mental health issues often have other issues as well.  I believe they are called comorbidities.  It is important from an individual care planning perspective that those things are taken into account.  Developing a service to provide that wrap-around is more of a policy issue through Sharing the Vision.</p><p> I will go back to something Deputy Buckley raised about the Department of Justice.  We are working very closely with the Department on a high-level task force for prisoners and for diverting people away from prison if they have committed crimes more because of mental health issues than anything else.  The Department is working very hard and pushing us very hard.  That task force is chaired by Kathleen Lynch, the former Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.</p><p> On the out-of-hours service, I had thought that was what the Deputy was asking about.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has prioritised developing out-of-hours services, crisis teams and that kind of thing as part of the new development funding for 2022.  I could not agree with the Deputy more that people can have mental health issues outside of the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p><p> With regard to what Deputy Hourigan said about guidelines and best practice for proprietors and people running mental health services, I mentioned that dual diagnosis model of care, but we are also bringing in a range of models of care to deal with a lot of new mental health issues that are coming to the fore.  Eating disorders come to mind.  Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have operational guidelines in that regard.  There may well be no shortage of best practice for those who are running services to rely on, especially with regard to multidisciplinary teams that bring all of those things together.  I am not sure that is specifically addressed in legislation because the more specific the legislation, the quicker it can go out of date.  The idea behind the legislation is to present the framework and human rights basis.  Those guiding principles can then be used as a base from which to develop operational guidelines and forms and models of care so that people can get high-quality mental health services.</p><p> On protected disclosures, I do not know if the Deputy was raising something specific.  I cannot answer to that.  All I know is my colleagues deal with such disclosures very seriously whenever we receive one.  From my perspective, the HSE also takes them seriously.  I will put that on the record.</p></speech>

I hope that is okay.  Before I ask any questions, I warmly welcome the publication of the heads of this Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001.  The work the Department has done has been phenomenal and I thank the witnesses for that.  The changes in language, for example, using "person" instead of "patient", are really well thought through.  Ireland has an opportunity to deliver person-centred, human rights-compliant, progressive, non-coercive legislation that is compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UNCRPD.  Do the witnesses know what I mean?  We can lead on this.  Ireland can be a world leader on mental health legislation.  I am honoured that this matter has come before the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and that we can be part of this whole process.  I look forward to working with the witnesses.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the Bill.  I hope that is okay.  My first question aims to follow up on Deputy Hourigan's earlier point regarding other key legislation.  Mr. Kelly mentioned that amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 were needed.  He also mentioned ongoing conversations between the two Departments.  Does one of those amendments relate to decision-making provisions for under-18s?  Is it correct to say there is currently a lacuna with regard to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds?  Will Mr. Kelly give me a bit more detail on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021110200002#Q00300"><p>Policy responsibility for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act rests with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I was not involved in the drafting of that Act but I understand the age of 18 was chosen for a number of reasons.  Healthcare is only one of the many areas the Act deals with.</p><p>It also covers decisions relating to finances and other aspects of life.  It is for that Department to decide whether the age should be reduced to 16, but I understand there would be a lot of consequences to such a decision.  It is outside of the control of our Department.  As I mentioned earlier, we are bringing consent for mental health treatment for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds in line with consent for physical treatment.  A 16-year-old can decide whether he or she wants to have surgery but cannot, at the moment, decide whether to attend a mental health service.   That decision is made by the parents.  We want to remedy that disparity between physical and mental treatment.  Those aged 16 or 17 who have physical conditions are also not covered by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  There is a gap on all sides in that regard, not just in respect of mental health.  It is coming to light on our side because we are reducing the age of consent for mental health treatment to 16 whereas that is already the case for those aged 16 or 17 accessing physical health treatment.</p><p> Because that Act does not apply to that age cohort at the moment, we have left it up to the Mental Health Commission to make the guidelines as to how to assess capacity for those aged 16 and 17, how such capacity assessments are to be carried out and who should carry them out.  That is our fix for the moment but, if the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were to decide to reduce the age specified in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to 16 from 18, we would, of course, reconsider the provisions we have included.  However, this is our workaround - for lack of a better word - for now because that Act does not apply to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.  We are trying to bring the principles of that Act into our own Act in a sense.  We are trying to make sure the capacity assessments are as similar as possible to those carried out under the 2015 Act.</p></speech>

I am a little bit concerned about the section 4(9) proposed under head 5 which states, "The provision of mental health services is subject to the availability of resources."  I hope the witnesses will forgive me if they have covered this.  I just feel the inclusion of this statement in legislation only serves to undermine its thrust and the culture change that is needed.  Will this provision be removed from the final version of the Bill?  Will the final Bill be strengthened with regard to resources?</p></speech>

It will be removed from the final Bill.  This provision was included because the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel wants to make sure there is an implicit understanding in any legislation that things can only be made available subject to the resources provided.  The office wanted to make that explicit in the general scheme so that, when formal drafting began, that consideration would have been made explicit.  It will not be in the final Bill.</p></speech>

That is obviously very welcome.  In consultation with the HSE, family members wanted to retain the option to apply for involuntary admission for relatives.  I stress that an appropriately funded authorised officer service represents best practice.  I have just one concern.  I will read out a piece of the explanatory note in the general scheme.  It says:</p> <blockquote> 	... [The expert group's] Recommendation 36 states that an authorised officer should be the only person to sign applications for involuntary admission to an approved centre.  The EGR clearly recommended that it should always be an authorised officer who makes an application for a person to be involuntarily admitted.  For this to operate effectively and in a timely manner, the HSE will need to guarantee that there are enough trained authorised officers available in all areas on a 24/7 basis.  It would also mean that should the HSE require more time and resources to build up the authorised officer service, [This is all really good] then this new provision could not come into effect until the full service is in place, so this section may need to be commenced at a later date to the rest of the Act. </blockquote><p>This is the concern.  Has the Department sanctioned additional funding for increased numbers of authorised officers?  Has a scoping exercise been carried out in respect of the community health resource areas where there are no authorised officers?  How will the delay be avoided?</p></speech>

We have had some initial discussions with the HSE as to how much that might cost per year, to fully staff enough authorised officers on a 24-7 basis in all 26 counties across the community health organisations.  The preliminary discussion has already started and it may be the case that we may need to expand.  At the moment, specific grades within the HSE can become authorised officers.  We may need to go back to that to see if we can expand this to include other grades that are similarly qualified.  This would expand the pool of people available.  It would be an industrial relations issue also for the HSE in some respects because the HSE would have people working on call on a 24-7 basis.</p> <p>  There are issues to be worked through but they are not insurmountable.  Limiting the authorised officers as being the only group of people who can make an application for involuntary detention is a very positive move.  It allows that person to act as an impartial third party so that we are not disrupting the ratios between family members such as between mothers and sons, siblings, husbands and wives, and so on.  It is a key piece.  The HSE is aware of this, and it is also in the programme for Government.  We are very committed to getting it right. With regard to the delay, we were thinking that it might be six months, for example.  It would not be a substantial delay.  It would just be to make sure that the structures are in place.  As soon as we have an idea of the final shape of the Bill and when it might be passed, it will be one of the key priorities in the implementation phase before everything has to be commenced.</p></speech>

Their services should provide support to the person who is experiencing mental health difficulties and also to the family and friends, and supporters and carers with permission.

If a child, a teenager or any person has a form of autism and has mental health issues, we do not have a service for them in the Thirty-two Counties, never mind Twenty-six Counties.  I just want to flag this up today because we are getting a lot of this in our offices.  It is an awful thing to have to say to a parent that they would have to go to England before they get anything for their child.  I just want to share that with the committee.</p></speech>

No one wants a child to be admitted to a facility for adults, but it does happen on occasion.  If a child is in a CHO where there is no appropriate inpatient CAMHS unit, he or she may be admitted to an adult ward for one night to provide for the transfer in order that he or she is in a safe environment.  It is similar to the restrictive practices around seclusion or restraint.  It is something we do not want to see but, with our eyes fully open, it does happen on some occasions, so we have to put something in place to make sure that we are aware of how often it happens, when it happens and the reasons for it happening with a view to reducing it and hopefully not having to use that section in the future.</p></speech>

I attended a meeting in Linn Dara about six or eight weeks ago.  The number of children that has happened to are significantly down.  I cannot remember the exact number.  In the vast majority of those cases, which were in single figures, it was only for a night and the majority of the children affected were 17, so they were almost adults anyway.  As Mr. Kelly said, it is intended to provide for a last resort.  It is not something that anybody really wants to do.  The HSE is definitely improving in terms of addressing that.</p></speech>

This Part of the Bill is a restatement and augmenting of Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 whose provisions have already successfully delivered Ireland's first marine spatial plan.  We can deal further with the detail of each element in the discussions on later amendments.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the grouping of proposed amendments that deals with definitions and MSP requirements.  Unfortunately, they contain many of the same technical issues evident with earlier amendments and, if accepted, would not provide operable procedures.  I apologise to Deputies for having to present such a critique.  I appreciate the spirit in which these amendments have been put forward, but it is important to record why the amendments cannot be accepted.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 73 purports to define maritime spatial planning.  Maritime spatial planning is defined in the EU directive.  Section 13(2) of the initiated text ensures that the term has the same meaning in this Bill as in the directive.  Deviating substantially from that definition, as proposed in this amendment, attracts significant legal risk of incorrect transposition that could imperil any plan made under this legislation.  That is especially the case in this amendment where the syntax and structure of the proposed definition contain a number of technical deficiencies that render it inoperable or would have unintended consequences.</p> <p>  "Seas and oceans" is not a precisely defined term and not necessarily limited to Ireland's maritime area, as defined in the Bill.  The proposal to "develop coordinated, coherent and transparent decision making in relation to the maritime sectors" is not a requirement of the directive and extends far beyond the scope of preparing a maritime spatial plan.  This proposal could be construed as placing an obligation on the competent authority to reform decision-making procedures that are the responsibility of a range of Ministers and bodies under a range of regulatory and legislative regimes.  Maritime spatial planning provides the context in which decisions are made but does not direct the form of decision-making procedures.  Any reform of those procedures will have to be undertaken in the context of their respective legislative codes.</p> <p>  The syntax of the proposed measures in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the amendment are problematic, in that the terms "have due regard" and "may include" do not match the chapeau of "maritime spatial planning means".</p><p>Further and more fundamentally, these are matters that should be taken into account in the development of a plan and cannot form part of the definition.</p><p> The proposed paragraph (d) also limits applicable policies to those approved by the Oireachtas, which would be an unprecedented and inordinate constraint on any regulatory system.  This would severely limit the scope of any plan made under this amendment and potentially conflicts with the requirements of the directive.</p><p> Amendment No. 74 proposes alternative objectives of a maritime spatial plan.  These objectives are silent on key elements of Article 5(2) of the directive, namely, the sustainable development of energy sectors at sea, maritime transport and the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, and the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment, including resilience to climate change impacts.  This legislation and any plan made under this amendment would be vulnerable to legal challenge.  Section 16(4) of the initiated text captures all the required objectives.</p><p> Amendment No. 76 specifies the promotion of sustainable opportunities for the local fishing industry.  As has been a recurring theme in these sessions, a single sector has been specified in amendments to the exclusion of others.  We must retain neutrality in the legislation and the statutory procedures.</p><p> Amendment No. 77 is fundamentally flawed in a number of respects.  The syntax and grammar of the proposed paragraphs (a) and (d) are not sufficiently clear and are not coherent provisions.  The proposed paragraph (b) is based on a misreading of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the directive, which provides that the member states, through the instrument of marine spatial plans, shall contribute to the matters set out in the paragraph.  This amendment would make the competent authority the instrument of such contribution.  Section 16(5) of the initiated text already provides for the matters set out in Article 8(1) of the directive making the proposed paragraph (d) redundant.</p><p> Acceptance of amendment No. 79 would also duplicate elements of section 17, leading to potential confusion and unacceptable risk.</p><p> Amendment No. 81 is expansive on a single pillar of sustainable development to the exclusion of the other two.  The legislation and procedures must be neutral in this regard to allow for the right balance of the pillars to emerge from the development process and not be directed from the top down.  I fully appreciate the importance of these environmental factors and considerations.  Where relevant, they will be taken into account as a matter of course, in particular in the development of DMAPs covering specified locations where specific impacts on identified species and habitats can be identified and provided for.  I draw attention to the proposals in section 21(2) for DMAPs, in particular paragraphs (c) to (f).  These are broad enough to encompass the considerations raised in this amendment but may not be necessary for every single DMAP.  I oppose this amendment</p><p> Amendment No. 75 proposes to replace the word "colocation" with the word "co-existence".  This formulation is more consistent with the directive than the initiated text and I thank the Deputies for proposing it and bringing it to our attention.  I will accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Perhaps he could have expanded on it.  I apologise for being late.  I came straight from making a short contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I want to make a few points on amendments Nos. 73 to 77, inclusive, 79 and 81.  I will also comment on several points the Minister of State has just made.</p> <p>  The idea of these amendments is to provide an alternative definition and objective for the marine spatial plans, with a stronger focus on environmental and social requirements.  These amendments seek to bring the objectives in line with the EU directives.  What is encompassed by maritime spatial planning needs to be clearly set out in the Bill.  It is very important that we do this to ensure the Bill is as robust as possible.  Why is this important?  I noted at the weekend there was coverage from people in the renewable wind energy sector that if they do not get the type of robust planning system they need, the consequent uncertainty could lead to judicial reviews and impact on investment.  I do not favour the model of developing renewable energy being pursued by the Government.  I would much prefer a much more public role in it.  I accept that the model being pursued is reliant on private investment so it is very important, even from the point of view of getting investment into the sector, that we have robust legislation and that there are not grounds for judicial review.  This is very important.  These are complex environmental considerations and they must take into account spatial planning.  This is not a discretionary matter that we can pick and choose.</p> <p>  With regard to the response of the Minister of State, I want to make several points.  With regard to syntax and grammar, from my point of view if syntax and grammar need to be fixed in any amendment I table, there will be no issue with doing so.  I will be happy to accommodate the Minister of State and the Department in that regard.  It should not be an obstacle to any amendment we are tabling.  It can be fixed as part of the process.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 74, the Minister of State said it is silent on Article 5 of the directive and on the uses being specified.  I will read out a section of amendment No. 74.  The new wording proposed in section 16(2)(b) states "by applying an ecosystem-based approach, and which promote the co-existence of relevant activities and uses, as required by Article 1 and Article 5(1) of the MSP Directive".  Article 5 is specifically written in and the uses are specifically referenced.  I do not accept the comments of the Minister of State that it is silent on Article 5.  I ask him to expand on why he takes this view when we specifically have it written into the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#B00300"><p>I also apologise for being late.  It is one of those days when we are all running around trying to catch up with ourselves.  I am sure if I had more time to catch a breath, I could have found a pithy remark at the start about co-existence between ourselves and the Minister of State but it is good to see he is accepting at least one of the amendments.  It is not a small change of language but a significant change.  Of course, co-existence is the language used in the directive and I thank the Minister for accepting it.</p> <p>  I am of the view, and I agree with the comments of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, that the language of the directives is being weakened in the text of the Bill, more specifically with respect to the marine spatial plans.  I will come to the DMAPs in a similar way shortly.  Defining in legislation exactly what they are to be would be a much more helpful way of doing things and would potentially reduce the possibility of legal challenge in future.  The concern some of us have, and to go back to the point we have been making from the start, is that we want to see a robust planning regime in the maritime area that facilitates multiple uses in this co-existence spirit, including offshore wind.  If the legislative framework is not clear enough at the outset, it will be an open door to judicial review at a later stage, which we all want to avoid.  Amendment No. 73 to section 13 is proposed to try to provide much greater clarity in terms of what a spatial plan is meant to do and contain.  One of my concerns about some aspects of the language in the Bill is that it defines the process more than the detailed content and, crucially, the objectives.</p> <p>  I also want to reintroduce the issue we discussed previously, namely, the hierarchy and interrelationship between all of these layers of plan making, and I will come to it with regard to DMAPs shortly because there is still a lack of clarity.  Amendment No. 74 is similar in the sense it is trying to set out the objectives for the marine spatial plan explicitly using the language of the directive, which I think is much more explicit and helpful.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is absolutely right that we are raising the issue of the inshore fisheries industry.  There is a strong view in the Opposition that of all the sectors that have engaged in the public consultation on this to date, inshore fisheries is the sector that has been most left behind.  None of us will apologise for continually raising the sector's concerns here.  The Minister of State gave us a commitment on this the last time we discussed it.</p><p>We are urging the Minister to fully appreciate and understand the capacity deficit that may exist for small inshore fishermen and their businesses to fully engage in the technical complexities in front of us and, therefore, to find mechanisms to ensure their full participation in it.  </p><p> Amendment No. 77 is about strengthening the language and making it more compliant with the directive.</p><p> As regards amendment No. 79, one of the concerns many members have, which we have expressed previously and will express again, is that these are not just spatial plans; they are temporal plans.  That is why the issue of Article 6 of the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive is so important.  Although it is clear the framework plan as has been presented to date is spatial, that temporal issue is still very much missing.</p><p> The crucial issue in respect of amendment No. 81 is data and the need to ensure, as required under the directives, that we have the best-quality data and address the data gaps that exist.  The amendment tries to specify some of those because it is crucial that once we get to the other side of the Bill, everything that flows from it is based on the most up-to-date, accurate and informed data.  Unfortunately, as members are aware, Ireland is weak on that, particularly in the context of protected environments.</p><p> An issue on which I have not yet tabled an amendment but to which I may return on Report Stage is the definition of a protected site in section 13(1).  I will wait and see whether that is an issue of sufficient concern for me to table an amendment on Report Stage.  The issue relates to the whole interaction in terms of the time lag between protected areas mitigation measures that are put in at this stage and whether the definition of "protected site" in section 13(1) is adequate for those purposes.  I am not necessarily looking to respond on this Stage, but it may be an issue we will return to on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Last weekend, I took the time to read the December 2020 report entitled Building Offshore Wind by the lobbying group on behalf of the wind energy industry.  I did so in advance of a public meeting we held on this issue last night.  It might be of interest to the Minister of State that the meeting was packed with people who are very concerned.  The overwhelming sentiment at the meeting was that we absolutely need to develop offshore wind and address the climate crisis but there is deep concern and anxiety that we do not have a plan-led approach but, rather, a developer-led approach.</p> <p>  The detail of the report by Wind Energy Ireland, WEI, which has been lobbying very hard, is damning in this regard.  In the document, WEI explicitly states on several occasions that we need a developer-led approach and rails against a plan-led approach.  It explicitly states that private developers and the industry should decide site selection.  This is a key issue.  It came across very strongly at the meeting last night that if the industry selects the sites, then we can forget about the maritime area regulatory authority and all this legislation because there actually is a momentum under way which determines the outcome or is very likely to do so.  This industry is explicitly saying it should decide how we do the development offshore and that we should not plan.  However, the directives insist on planning and a plan-led approach.  That approach should start with the selection of sites but that is not what is happening.  It is not what is happening with the designation of projects.  WEI is lobbying for a new category, one that does not appear anywhere in the directives, whereby the industry selects the sites.</p> <p>  Let us be absolutely clear that what is of concern to us and why we are trying to lock in specific protections and a sustainable approach that is contained in the marine spatial planning directives and the various directives such as the habitats directive, the birds directive and so on is that we have a plan-led approach.  That means plans that take into consideration all of the environmental concerns and that the concerns in respect of sustainable and appropriate uses of the marine area should determine where things happen.  Our concern is that is not what is going on.  What is actually going on is that the industry does not want a plan-led approach and it seems that it is being facilitated in that regard, particularly under this notion of relevant projects.  They are getting a special pass.  The industry explicitly opposes a plan-led approach.  We want this locked into the legislation to apply to all parties.  We want it to start with the issue of site selection and go all the way through the process that there is a plan-led approach which is about appropriate development that ensures we protect biodiversity and marine resources and put things where they should be put rather than where developers who are concerned with profit want them.  That is the logic behind this.  It starts with planning, which is in the EU directives.  A proper and appropriate plan-led approach, not a developer-led approach, should be locked in to the whole process from beginning to end.  That is our concern.  Anyone who reads the comments of WEI will see where our concerns come from.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 75 is not the first to be taken on board.  Where we can, we will work with members to make this legislation better, such as through giving commitments in the context of the resolution relating to the MPPS and getting information out in respect of public participation by communities that think this issue is very important.  That has been the structure we have embarked on right through the four years it took to bring about the NMPF.  Public participation is at the core of this mechanism.  I refer to the three rounds of public participation in that process.</p> <p>  Obviously, the Government is very keen to protect fishermen in every way we can through Government policy.  I make no apologies for saying that.  I am trying to put forward a Bill that is neutral in the planning code to try to get the best possible outcomes for everyone who uses it.</p> <p>  As regards the directive, I have received clear advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  A very senior legal drafter has been working on this legislation because of the complexity and magnitude of the Bill and what it will mean for the country in the future.  The clear advice received meant that, in the first instance, we have stayed as close as possible to the MSP directive throughout, referencing articles on many occasions throughout the legislation.  It is not necessary to reproduce every single word or section of the directive in the Bill or to reinterpret it through the Bill.  We are not doing that.  We have clear precedence for this in terms of Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 which gave birth to the NMPF.  Obviously, we are going through this and embarking on this process again with this new legislation which will undoubtedly be ground-breaking.  The advice I have received from the Office of the Attorney General gives me great confidence that we are taking the right approach.</p> <p>  I fully appreciate the concerns raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p><p>I cannot get into individual cases but I will say that everything the Government does in this Thirty-third D&aacute;il is to try to make our maritime area planning process plan-led.  We are trying to ensure the plan recognises and respects all the vulnerable aspects of our maritime area, protects everyone, gets the best possible outcome and the fairest possible system to adjudicate independently on any applications that come forward in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#D00200"><p>Is the Minister of State giving us a cast-iron guarantee that development consents will not be given until we have plans that designate what is and what is not appropriate, which areas of the marine are appropriate for particular types of development?  Consents should not be given until applications have, if you like, gone through the proper process of environmental impact assessment, full compliance with the habitats directive, the birds directive and the marine spatial planning directive.  In other words, we must ensure we have the plan first.  We need to properly and forensically assess these matters to protect biodiversity, fishers, our coastal amenities, areas that need special protection and so on.  Will the Minister of State guarantee that development consents will not be given until mapping of the marine area has taken place?  Decisions must be made on the basis of proper marine spatial planning that complies with all the relevant directives and environmental impact assessments.  Consents should not be given otherwise.  Decisions must not be made by developers.  Is it potentially the case that sites which have been selected by the developers themselves will get development consents prior to all of those assessments?  That is the key question and what we need to know.  I hope the Minister of State will give us assurances and we will not have huge developments that effectively become a <i>fait accompli </i>before we have done the mapping of what needs to be protected, what is sensitive, and all the screening, if you like, for environmental impact assessment that should take place if we are not going to repeat the Wild West approach to development we have sometimes taken on land.  Those are the assurances we need.  The reason for these amendments is precisely because we are trying to lock that in.  In amendment No. 79, for example, we suggest that in accordance with Article 8 of the marine spatial planning directive, we should &quot;identify the spatial and temporal distribution of relevant, existing and future activities and uses in the marine waters of the Marine Spatial Plan the competent authority is preparing&quot;.  We want the thing mapped out.  Where is it appropriate to do certain things and where is it not?  We should ask has there been a proper process in making those decisions before we start lashing out development consents for big industrial development in our marine areas.</p></speech>

I am still not clear as to how public participation is envisaged with respect to the marine spatial plan.  It might be helpful if the Minister of State in his response not only reads his written reply on the deficiencies of our amendments but also puts on record how that public participation process is envisaged under section 18.</p><p>There is an relationship, which the amendments speak to, between the review of the NMPF and the drafting, amending or revoking of an MSP.  I have a concern with the way in which the Bill is drafted in that public participation, in the context of the NMPF, will kick in at a later stage and, therefore, there could be periods in which there would not be adequate public participation, with respect to both the marine spatial plans and amendments to or replacements of marine spatial plans.  If the Minister of State could set that out, it would be helpful.</p><p>It is important to ensure that where public participation is in place, there will be no undue or unnecessary obstacles to that participation.  That includes ensuring information is made as widely available as possible, with no onerous fees that would block it.  That is not something that is necessarily in our current planning regime but it can be seen in, for example, some of the new provisions of the forestry legislation.  I accept that does not relate to the Minister of State's Department but it is still a worry for those of us who are concerned with access to public participation.</p><p>Depending on the Minister of State's outline of how he envisages public participation with respect to these, I might come back in.  The amendments are about trying to ensure the maximum level of public participation at the earliest stage in the process in order that the public can be brought in to the plan-led approach the Minister of State outlined in his response to opposition earlier.</p></speech>

That Article states member states shall establish means of public participation by informing all interested parties, consulting relevant stakeholders, authorities and the public concerned at an early stage in the development of maritime spatial plans in accordance with relevant provisions establishing legislation. It will also ensure relevant stakeholders, authorities and the public will have access to plans once they have been finalised.  This is very important to ensure there will be proper compliance with the maritime spatial planning directive when a maritime spatial plan is being compiled.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 87, the Bill, as it stands, includes quite a complex system for public participation on maritime spatial plans, but the reason for this complexity is not clear.  The amendment will provide that the consultation period will exclude public holidays and that it will both be online and use traditional methods to ensure inclusion.  That is important to ensure no one will be disenfranchised in the context of the digital divide.  It will provide also that there will be no charge for submissions or for inspecting materials made available online.  They are all useful steps to take in regard to public participation being written into the legislation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 88 will require a statement on public participation to be published after the Bill has been enacted to ensure compliance with the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 seeks to delete the lines, "The competent authority ... shall take all reasonable steps to comply with the public participation statement".  That wording would give the competent authority discretion not to comply with its own public participation statement.  It is unclear what would constitute "reasonable steps" and the wording is arbitrary.  It is not defined in the legislation and there could be difficulties in that regard.  It is not a good wording to have in the Bill and it weakens it.  In fact, an issue I have with much of the Bill relates to parts whose language weakens provisions unnecessarily.  It reflects some of what is in the directives but it chooses wording that would allow for get-out clauses or weaker implementation.</p> <p>  Amendment Nos. 92 and 93 are similar to amendment No. 87.  Amendment No. 95 sets out additional details on what should be classed as relevant documentation for this section.  It includes reviews of and changes to the existing NMPF, MSPs and DMAPs, whereas the Bill includes only the draft MSP.</p><p>That is important in terms of this legislation.</p></speech>

It is felt that the public is the last to know about anything and, insofar as consultation takes place, it is a tick-box exercise.  It is minimal and, as we noted earlier, often happens around August or December.  People find out at the last minute that they are to be consulted and there is a feeling that many things are <i>faits accomplis</i>.</p><p>There is a need to tightly define and ensure the most thoroughgoing, rigorous, open, transparent process of public consultation and participation.  I hate the world &quot;consultation&quot;.  There should be public participation in the planning of our regulation and management of our marine area and resources.  People want that and they want to be confident.  What is set out in the directives, the Aarhus Convention and so on is precisely that.  The definition of sustainable planning and development is that the public is part of it.  The public is not incidental to planning and development but a critical part of it and often has the greatest knowledge.</p><p>We will move onto MARA and the personnel who will oversee these things but who are the experts?  One of the key groups of experts is the public, most often, or the stakeholders in a particular area.  They are often not seen as such, but as a pain in the neck to be overcome, certainly by developers as demonstrated in some of their documents.  We are trying to ensure that public involvement is thoroughgoing, that the public know and that there is no question of people not knowing. </p><p>The Minister of State looked favourably on the suggestion that we move from traditional newspaper media to radio advertising and stuff like that and hopefully that will be reflected in Government amendments before we get to Report Stage.  It is so everybody knows something important is happening that affects the marine area where they operate or that is close to them.  That is what we are looking for and no vagueness or get-out clauses, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan pointed to.  That is the logic of these amendments.</p></speech>

In part, I think these amendments have been proposed because members may not have fully grasped the intention and function of the initiated text as a whole.  This is understandable as what is proposed is innovative in an Irish context and builds upon the experience of the development of our first national marine planning framework.  I caution members not to fall into the trap of assuming that public consultation and participation are synonymous.  Formal public consultation is only one form of participation.  Participation in the first national marine planning framework was extensive throughout the development process and not limited to the final consultation on a draft document.  The draft could not have been prepared without the input of the public, stakeholders, NGOs, industry, Departments and agencies.  </p> <p>  This Bill, through the tool of the public participation statement, seeks to place such participation arrangements on a statutory footing.  I urge members to re-examine section 18 of the initiated text setting out the detail of what is intended to be included in such statements, in particular subsections (4) and (5).  Many of the concerns raised in sessions to date, such as best practice, inclusivity, Aarhus compliance and appropriate use of media, will be specified in regulations that will guide the preparation of such statements.  We are also conscious of the consultation overload issue raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett at the last session and we intend, insofar as is possible given the complexity of such plans, to minimise the administrative burden on stakeholders.  The publication of the public participation statement will be the first step in the development of the next iteration of the marine spatial plan so the public will have early and full sight of when and how it can engage with the development process.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 78, formal public consultation arrangements on the draft plan will be set out in a public participation statement.  The use of the term &ldquo;full&rdquo; is deficient legally and is open to argument that no public consultation, no matter how comprehensive, could be considered &ldquo;full&rdquo; or complete.  The plan will also be subject to consultation requirements under the SEA and birds and habitats directives via section 31.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 80 would duplicate the provision of section 18(1) in respect of Article 9 of the MSP directive.  Amendment No. 87 further details arrangements for public participation that are not necessary in the context of section 18.  Amendment No. 88 repeats much of the previous amendments but is not necessary in the context of section 18.  Amendment No. 89 would remove the requirement for compliance with the statement, subject to taking &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo; in section 18(2).  This section is necessary because factors outside the control of the competent authority may result in an element of the statement not being fully complied with.  It would be incorrect for a plan to be unable to be made and years of work, participation and engagement to be wasted in such circumstances.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 90 is an alternative to No. 89 replacing &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo; with &ldquo;legally required actions&rdquo;.  It is presumed that this is intended to ensure compliance with participation obligations; however, the language is not so limited and risks unintended consequences.  In any case, such obligations are expressed elsewhere in the Bill and would apply even if unstated.  Any development procedure that failed to comply with such obligations would not survive judicial review. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 91 seeks to limit the ability of the competent authority to amend the public participation statement to account for emerging and arising issues and is too restrictive.  Such amendments may be practical in nature and expand the scope of participation or introduce a new mechanism.  I believe our practice to date and the provisions of section 18 highlight our commitment to the best possible participation in the development of plans for the future. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 92 further details public consultation arrangements that are not necessary as they will be set out in regulations and the public participation statement.  It also repeats elements of other amendments and the existing text that would lead to confusion, inconsistency and lack of clarity.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 93 relates to regulations in respect of the statement and sets out matters which the competent authority is already obliged to comply with.  It places a lesser obligation to &ldquo;act consistently with&rdquo; rather than to comply with the directives stated in the amendment.  This opens up the risk that these provisions are considered part-transposition of those directives while not giving them full effect.      </p> <p>  Amendment No. 94 proposes that the Minister &ldquo;shall comply with&rdquo; the principles and policies of section 18(5).  "Have regard to" is the standard terminology for preparation of regulations.  On a technical level, the amendment does not work; for example, it would result in a requirement to &ldquo;comply with compliance with Article 9 of the Directive&rdquo;.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 95 purports to replace existing provisions that are already sufficient.  It is overly restrictive.  Minor amendments are concerned which are provided for under chapter 5 and consultation for DMAPs is provided for under section 23.</p> <p>  These amendments are not necessary.  I point out to members that the national planning framework was a best-in-class view of how to deliver such a comprehensive document in terms of public participation at every step of the way.  Page 196 of the NMPF details the number of public participation and consultation events held.  Deputy Boyd Barrett will be happy to note none of them were in August or September.</p><p>There were also various meetings of our stakeholder advisory group.  I had the pleasure of chairing three meetings from May 2020.  The first of the meetings was in the Custom House in March 2018.  The committee can see that this is four years of work through extensive meetings, through an advisory group and going around various areas including coastal towns to try to get the communities involved.  We will take the workings from the Deputy's suggestions on how we do that into the future.  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's concerns on fees, we absolutely do not see that in any way being any part.  It is very clear that if there is an amendment or change, once that is set aside, section 18 will be triggered and all of this consultation, which is the best in class and has been very wide-ranging, will be brought into action.</p></speech>

It would be very helpful if the Minister of State could come back on that.</p> <p>  Section 18 of the Bill is about public participation and marine spatial plans, and our amendments here are seeking to strengthen this.  Section 18 is very weak on public participation.  It relies on this public participation statement.  From my reading of it, probably the strongest part of it is the list of requirements the Minister may specify with regard to a public participation statement.  There is a huge amount of discretion around that list.  The section states: "The Minister may by regulations specify requirements with which a public participation statement (M) shall comply...", and then there is the list.  There is no obligation and no wording saying that a public participation statement has to comply with these principles.  The fact that it is resting on this public participation statement rather than being set out in the legislation is very problematic.</p> <p>  This comes at the heart of Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that public participation should not be done just to tick the box.  It is often the case that the public and other stakeholders often have the best knowledge of an issue in a marine area and they can know it in a way that nobody else does.  I have seen this countless times where the developers come with highly paid consultants and all the rest and they miss absolutely key knowledge in the local area that is known by the local community, perhaps by the people who have been fishing it for years and have lived there for generations.  If it is done right, public participation can actually get information that is in everybody's benefit in the long run.  I have a lot of concerns about this.</p> <p>  It goes back to the previous points made that what we are trying to do with this legislation is to facilitate renewable energy, but we need to try to protect our marine biodiversity and environment at the same time.  If we are not, then we are negating some of the positives that could come out of renewable energy.  The importance of our marine environment has been well documented, not just in terms of biodiversity but also around its importance for carbon capture, in the context of marine life and cetaceans, including whales and dolphins, and with regard to the seabed.  If renewable energy is not planned properly, if it is not plan-led, or if it is developer-led, it can lead to unnecessary destruction of our marine environment and the release of carbon, which of course is going against what renewable energy is trying to counteract.</p> <p>  It would be very helpful if the Minister of State will answer specifically what is a public participation statement and what are its purposes.</p></speech>

I do not believe that because what is proposed is innovative we are finding it difficult to understand.  This suggests that somehow innovation is something that the Opposition cannot comprehend.  It is because this is incredibly complex.  The legislation does not lend itself to easy understanding of its outworkings, particularly when large aspects of what we are talking about are not specified in the legislation.  It is specified by way of powers for the Minister.</p> <p>  The concern that motivates us to have amendments around public participation is that upon reading section 18 I am not clear on who a competent authority may be, and I am not clear what the status of a public participation statement will be.  I understand what the Minister of State is describing it as, which is a series of intentions, but my big concern is to be found when we get into section 18(2), which states: "The competent authority (M) shall take all reasonable steps to comply with the public participation statement (M)."  To me, this seems very vague and open.  While a very good Minister with very good officials with a good track record of public participation will use the provision in a very positive way, this does not necessarily require it under law.</p> <p>  The Minister of State said there may be events outside the control of the authority.  I would like to know what kinds of events are considered.  I am not being awkward, but I ask the Minister of State to be more explicit in explaining what those outside events are that may mean a competent authority does not feel it is fully able to comply with the statement.  What would be reasonable steps and what would not be reasonable steps, and who decides?  Where will this be set out?</p> <p>  Likewise, section 18(3) refers to where the competent authority "considers it necessary or expedient" to revise the statement.  This means that the public participation statement does not have to be fully adhered to, depending on what events outside the control of the competent authority happened to intervene.  It can be amended.  Again, I could be interpreting this wrong, but it seems there is lots of scope and room for manoeuvre in good ways but also in bad ways.  This strikes me as problematic.</p> <p>  My final point speaks to our amendments, which are trying to specify what the public participation consultation will be.  I will slightly add to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question for the Minister of State to tell us what a public participation statement will be.  Clearly in the provisions for the regulation set out in section 18(4), the Minister of State or his officials must have some notion of what an appropriate time period for public consultation would be, what the arrangements would be for notifications and so on.  Will the Minister of State give us some comfort as to what kind of public participation process it would be?  What are the checks on the difficult aspects of sections 18(2) and 18(3), which I have outlined, that would prevent them from being properly used - I must choose my words very carefully - by a future Minister or future officials who are not as committed to public participation, as the Minister of State and his team have made the case here today?</p></speech>

We are genuinely interrogating this because we want to understand fully and for the legislation to be as good as it can be.  When a development plan is being put together there are people in the council department, for example, who may have developed a knowledge and experience over many years in the particular parts for which they are responsible for the drafts.  There is a certain experience and knowledge and so on.  Then there is the established process, which we are always trying to improve, of public participation in that.  We are in new territory here.  One of the things I was very struck by in the industry lobbying, or their vision document, is that essentially they were saying "we have the expertise and nobody else has the expertise".  This was their justification for having a developer-led approach: "we know the stuff and nobody else does".  The question is about who the competent authority is and what sort of expert advice they will depend on for the drafting of plans.  This notion that developers are experts - and one can see why they would want this - and that everybody else does not really know what they are talking about is not the way things are going to be.  As we have said, the huge amount of knowledge and expertise we actually need to input into maritime spatial plans is that of the real stakeholders: the people who know the area, the people who live in the area and people like the fishers and others who know a particular maritime environment.</p><p> I echo the questions about the public participation statement and seek some elaboration on that.  It is stated the Minister may, by regulation, specify those requirements so the Minister of State might explain why this is just "may".  The logic of our amendments is to try to tie down the requirements in terms of public participation in the development of marine spatial plans.</p></speech>

Sections 17(2)(a) and 17(3)(a) indicate "The Minister shall, not later than six years after" when referring to the existing national marine planning framework or a marine spatial plan.  What does that mean in terms of timing for this public participation statement?  Does it mean that, potentially, there would be no public participation statement for a period of six years?  Is that what the proposed legislation implies?  If it is, this section is completely reliant on the public participation statement and there is a potential delay of six years.  Will the Minister of State explain the timing on this or is there a different way of reading the section so it does not potentially allow for a six-year delay before there is a public participation statement?  The entire section of the Bill rests on that public participation statement.  Are we talking about a potential six-year delay in this?</p></speech>

There was a question on meaningful participation and consultation with various groups.  I have been very clear about what we have embarked on with the birth of the national marine planning framework and it being absolutely best-in-class practice.  It is genuinely disappointing to hear suggestions this is tokenistic.</p> <p>  One can look at appendix B.  I noted references to developers and major initiators of offshore renewable energy projects but I can look through the list of people working on the advisory group.  There are six or seven different bodies related to fisheries or seaweed harvesting.  These are all people from the smallest boathouse to the largest renewable energy project and they were facilitated through our advisory group and participation.  I am genuinely a little taken aback by the suggestion that what we were doing was not best in class because it is and has been.</p> <p>  There was mention of "all reasonable measures" but we have been in a pandemic.  We can see that halfway through the consultation it had to go online.  That was in May 2020 for the advisory group in the first instance and, in the second instance, for the consultation event.  It was reasonable to have an event online to bring as many people as possible together.  It was a reasonable measure to try to keep people safe and ensure we met obligations for consultation and to those who are participating.  I had the privilege to chair a number of sessions of the advisory group, where I heard from and saw a screen full of people from every sector around the country.  It was absolutely incredible.  I can say to members that I have experienced this and because of that I know the process was robust.  It was the best I have seen in terms of consultation and participation.</p> <p>  There was a reference to the competent authority and it is clear in section 15 that the Minister shall be the competent authority.  That is in black and white.</p> <p>  The public participation statement is the birth of the process.  It will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and it will be for committees like this one to get involved and try to feed its own ideas into the process, as it has done in the past.  I respectfully say that this would lead to valuable contributions to the process, which is what we want.  Pages 29 and 30 of the Bill outline compliance and what is included in the public participation statement.</p></speech>

I can go back over them.  I thank the Minister of State for indicating the competent authority and I thank him for that clarity.</p> <p>  I am not interrogating the public participation process for the national marine planning framework.  I am looking at this legislation, which may outlive the Minister of State, his officials and all of us.  It is therefore really important we get best practice locked into this as much as possible.  I have heard the Minister of State talking about reasonable steps if there is another pandemic.  Where is there guidance in the legislation to determine what a reasonable step would be to permit non-compliance with the public participation statement?</p> <p>  Likewise, there is mention of a Minister considering it "necessary" or "expedient" and where is that outlined or delineated?  I also asked if the Minister of State could at least give us some flavour of what he expected to be in regulations.  I share the concern of Deputy O'Callaghan, which he articulated much better than I did, with respect to the timeline and lead-in.</p> <p>  I have a further question.  To what does the public participation statement apply?  Will it apply just to spatial plans or will it apply to supplementary amendments or additions to the MSPs?  Will it apply to the review of the national marine planning framework, etc.?  The more information the Minister of State can share with us, the better for everybody.</p></speech>

We appreciate a huge amount of work has gone into the area and we can see the Minister of State is very passionate about the work that has been done.  We are taking a cold look at this legislation to see how it will operate with any Minister or group of officials.  It is our job to do that, and it is not based on current or recent practice.  It is not about making any statement on that.</p> <p>  My specific question concerned section 18(1).  My reading of how it relates to sections 17(2) and 17(3) is that it could allow for a delay of approximately six years until a public participation statement is drawn up.  It refers to being as soon as practicable after those sections are complied with and the sections allow for six years after the existing national marine planning framework's publication.  It could be six years from now.  Am I misreading that?  Is it correct that we could be looking at a six-year delay for this public participation statement being drawn up?  If that is the case, what is the reason, especially given that this is all about the public participation statement?</p></speech>

The Minister of State is lauding the public participation process he went through and I take him at his word at some level.  I was not particularly aware of how it all went.  I am not commenting on the process.  The people I am speaking to, however, who have a concern in this matter do not understand how the relevant projects got slipped in on that basis to the national marine planning framework.  There is much concern and anger about that.  Following from that, is it the case the extended public participation in the development of marine spatial plans is done and dusted for six years?</p><p>There is serious concern about the inclusion of these relevant projects in the national marine planning framework in advance of the sort of detailed marine spatial planning we need to have in advance of major developments in the marine.  That is the concern.  If it were six years, a lot can happen and a lot of damage can be done in six years.  Another matter of considerable concern is the potential for Ministers to walk away from public participation statements that is created by the use in the Bill of language such as "may" and changes as "considered necessary or expedient" in respect of revising statements and so on.</p></speech>

It is not necessary to wait six years.  A review of the plan triggers the public participation statement.</p> <p>  On the competent authority and checks and safeguards, the Minister is the competent authority.

We are trying to ascertain whether the MSPs, DMAPs or anything else can be developed before the review of the national marine framework is triggered and, therefore, in the absence of a public participation statement.  If so, how is the public participation element of those crucial plans developed?</p></speech>

Article 9, as the Minister of State noted, is about public participation.  Given the importance of section 17 in terms of how it interacts with section 18 on public participation, surely it would make sense to list Article 9 here.  Can that be addressed?  I do not see why that would not work or how it would take from anything or cause any issues.  Can we look at listing Article 9 in section 17(1)(a)?</p></speech>

There is a list of things the Minister may specify as regards requirements.  That is as far as section 18 goes, whereas Article 9 is very specific.

It does exactly what Article 9 is suggesting.</p><p>I appreciate that we all need to be good-humoured about this.  Nobody is arguing the Minister should provide a list of everything that is reasonable and unreasonable.  That is not how legislation works.  Even we in the Opposition, with our limited ability to understand innovation, get that, but, either in legislation regulations, there should be some way to determine whether something is reasonable; otherwise it is just left to the discretion of the Minister.  One of my main concerns about section 18 is that subsection 18(5)(c) refers to the Minister only having regard to Article 9.  The wording of section 18 is such that the Minister does not have to comply; he has only to have regard to the article and take reasonable steps to comply regarding the public participation statement, if he or she believes it is expedient or necessary to make changes to it.  We do not know the point at which the public participation statement kicks in with respect to MSPs, DMAPs or anything else.  The Minister of State can surely understand the concern we are articulating.</p></speech>

It goes on to state "Member States shall also ensure that the relevant stakeholders and authorities, and the public concerned, have access to the plans once they are finalised."  That is pretty strong.  Section 17(1)(a) specifies that the competent authority has to comply, or ensure compliance, with the requirements of MSP directive, but, for some odd reason, the strong statement in Article 9, which insists on a certain amount of public information, is omitted.  There are other articles but Article 9, the one that is strong in the directive and which is on public participation, is omitted.  While section 17 outlines that the competent authority must comply, or ensure compliance with the requirements of the directive, the section on giving effect, section 18, is a bit wishy-washy, in our opinion.  That is the concern.  The Minister of State has not really explained why Article 9 is not explicitly referred to so as to let us know what the competent authority must ensure compliance with in respect of the directive.</p></speech>

On amendments to MSPs and designated marine area plans, DMAPs, the detail is in section 28 of the Bill.  I said the article is about giving effect.  That is my clear advice regarding public participation and the associated robust participation.  I have also been very clear that the Oireachtas, as a body, can get involved in the process in respect of how it interprets or gives advice.  The document has to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  If there are further points that I need to clarify, I will have no issue with doing so.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the national marine planning framework is robust and that this review is a fundamental input to ensuring that it is as robust as possible and informs the framework of this Bill.  That is what amendment No. 83 is about.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State thought, for example, two years was better than one year and wanted to make the case, I am sure we would be open to being reasonable about that, subject to whether it fits the Minister of State's definition of reasonable or not.</p> <p>  Given that we have already passed the national marine planning framework, NMPF, some time ago, six years on top of the time that has elapsed is of concern.  In responding to why the Minister of State will not support this amendment, if he is not to support it, there is something I would like him to explain.  Obviously, we will have the marine protected areas legislation.  There will then be a parallel process of either identifying areas that might have mitigation measures or the designation of areas.  We were told, when we asked a question at an earlier stage, how designation of marine protected areas would be added into the NMPF.  If that is not being reviewed for up to six years, how do we fully incorporate, for example, changes within that period such as designations?</p></speech>

This timeframe is simply too short to accommodate the envisaged participation under this Chapter.  I fully appreciate it was not the intention of Deputes to exclude or diminish the public's role in the development of the next maritime spatial plan, MSP, but that would be the effect of this amendment.  As stated in earlier sessions, the first NMPF will be reviewed within six years.</p> <p>  I reflected on that through the debate and earlier committees.  I stated we potentially will do it earlier, in a few years.  Given it is a new policy and it is a significant policy, it needs a period of time to bed down first because it has to be looked at in the round with the other policies that, as mentioned through this Bill, will give effect to and work with a shared vision through it.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will come in to discuss his role in terms of marine protected areas and how they link in through this Bill.</p></speech>

I can picture the Minister of State's overworked and underpaid officials late last night writing the briefing notes and having a little smile as they added that particular line.  We appreciate the humour, and I mean that genuinely.</p> <p>  I accept one year is too short but I also accept six years is too long.  Would the Minister of State consider, by way of an amendment on Report Stage, slightly shortening the time?  That would still give the Minister of State the flexibility to have it sooner rather than later.  All I am asking the Minister of State is to go away and think.  Six years sounds impossibly long.</p> <p>  With respect to the question regarding the marine protected areas, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will not be able to answer the question that I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, because it is not related to the marine protected areas legislation.  It is specifically related to the national marine planning framework.  I could be wrong, but changes to the national marine planning framework will only be possible consequent to the review, which could be sooner than six years but could be within that timeframe.  If marine protected areas, MPAs, are introduced before there is the review, what is the mechanism in this legislation to incorporate those MPAs into the national marine planning framework so that when, for example, a marine spatial plan is being developed and there is a consequent public participation statement governing public participation they would be required to take into account that MPA designation, which does not currently exist?  It is a reasonable question.</p></speech>

I prefer hard copies.</p> <p>  A framework is not a plan.  My concern is that six years is a long time before we have a proper plan with all the public participation, the environmental assessment and, as has been mentioned, the marine protected areas.  Why six years?  Can the Minister of State explain why we have this figure of six years, particularly because the concern is that a framework is a little vague whereas a plan is not so vague?</p></speech>

I was very clear on that.</p> <p>  In terms of the policy pieces that have to come together through this Bill and others that have been referenced, a year is way too short a term to judge it from its inception because this is a big new instrument governing all of our maritime area.  It is a huge instrument and it needs a reasonable amount of time to have proper assessments that the public will be core to of how it has delivered for and protected the area.</p></speech>

The Bill does not require the Minister to consult as part of that process.  This amendment seeks to create a situation whereby we will not have the Department checking its own work in this regard, and that is why we must have a list of bodies specified that should be consulted, including other Ministers and Departments.  It would oblige the Minister to consider things like any gaps in the plan, such as migratory and foraging routes for marine and bird species, which are important.  The amendment would also oblige the Minister to consider things like the requirement to deliver maritime spatial planning while also achieving good environmental status and the contribution of sea grasses, whales and other sea life to carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  That is an important point.  As I said before, there is little point in us developing renewable wind energy on one hand and then, on the other hand, undermining the contribution that is going to make in respect of climate change mitigation and reducing our carbon emissions if we are causing damage via other carbon emissions in the process.  Therefore, we must be mindful that we are not simply trying to achieve the generation of renewable energy just for the sake of it.  There is a reason we must do that and, in that context, it does not make sense to do anything that undermines our wider goal in the context of reducing carbon emissions.  Amendment No. 85 specifically sets out that the Minister would be obliged to consider those aspects.</p></speech>

All the relevant organisations, bodies and stakeholders should be consulted in any review of a marine spatial plan or the national marine planning framework.  We mention in this regard examples such heritage, which is incredibly important.  One of the things pointed out at a public meeting last night was that there are many wrecks on the Kish Bank, where the construction of the Dublin Array offshore wind farm project is planned, including the HMS Leinster.  In the area of heritage as well, Dublin Bay is also a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, designated biosphere, and, again, this is the area that will be impacted by this proposed development.  Therefore, we must examine all the possible impacts from every conceivable stakeholder perspective.  We have listed in the amendment all the relevant Departments to ensure that there is compliance with the various directives relating to habitats and birds, environmental impact assessments, etc.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State or his officials could answer one question that I was asked in this regard.  I did not know the answer when the query was put to me.  Will the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have a role in assessing reviews of plans - in the context of the plans themselves - regarding proposals for development and the impact of any such development?  I am curious because this question was asked and it seems like a good one.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 84 is a technical amendment to enable amendment No. 85, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said.  Amendment No. 85 sets out new provisions for review requirements of the first NMPF.  They contain many of the same issues as earlier amendments, including limitations on ministerial consultations, while also providing for particular pillars of sustainable development and sectors to the exclusion of others and thereby upsetting the neutrality of the legislation.</p> <p>  Reference is also made to matters relating to marine protected areas that this Bill simply cannot legislate for as they do not yet have a legal existence pending the introduction of the marine protected areas legislation.  While I cannot dwell further on this matter because the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, intends updating the committee in due course, I assure members that any review of the NMPF will be undertaken in the context of the pertaining regulatory environment and the best available information.</p> <p>  The EPA is a prescribed body in the context of strategic environmental assessment and therefore it will come into play in this regard.  Equally, if we look at the national marine planning framework document, all the coastal built heritage sites are mapped out on page 90.  All the UNESCO coastal sites are also mapped out in detail there.  All the shipwrecks in Irish waters are shown on pages 92 and 93.  Therefore, all that information is there in the document on those pages.</p></speech>

They were originally one amendment and were separated by the Bills Office, but the Minister of State and his advisers know that.</p> <p>  Again, one thing that might help to clarify some of the confusion some of us are experiencing would be if the Minister of State in his response, and in as plain a form of English as is possible, were to give a sense of the relationship between maritime spatial plans and the national marine planning framework.  I ask that because I think that when many of us thought about a review of the national marine planning framework, we thought it would be a big-bang review in which the entire framework would be reviewed.  That was partly the reason for the earlier amendments.</p> <p>  The more I hear, though, the more I seem to be hearing that it could be a big-bang review or it could be a series of incremental reviews as maritime spatial plans or other things are developed.  If the Minister of State could explain some of the context a little more, that might allay some of the fears we have.  To give an example, these amendments relate to a new maritime spatial plan, but if the national marine planning framework is itself a collection of maritime spatial plans, albeit being produced in one initial process, could the review of the NMPF then be a process where marine spatial plans amend and update the national marine planning framework and thereby constitute multiple reviews over time?  Is that a correct way of understanding what this means?  Is that one option that exists?</p> <p>  This aspect goes back then to the question I asked previously about the public participation statement.</p><p>If it is potentially a series of micro reviews of sub-geographical areas, then when the first marine spatial plan is produced that, in itself, would constitute the beginning of the review of the national marine planning framework, which would trigger the public participation statement.  If that is the case, it would be helpful if the Minister of State could confirm that or explain it a little more clearly than I have tried to do.</p></speech>

The plan sets out in detail the high-level spatial planning policies that will help support sustainable development of Ireland's maritime resource.  It also sets out a series of detailed requirements for plan makers and project proposers alike in respect of the various headings set out in the Bill, for example, heritage and environmental protection.  This plan will be superseded by the MSP under this current legislation.</p></speech>

That means, for example, that when a review of the national marine planning framework is triggered, that could be the development of one or more marine spatial plans which as they are developed, with their public participation statements informing the public participation, then amend the national marine planning framework.  Likewise, within those MSPs there are DMAPs and they are amended, so it is a constant evolving process.  The reason I am saying this is that if that is the case, that answers the question for which we were seeking an answer earlier.  The moment either an individual MSP is to be developed or a there is a macro review, the public participation statement kicks in and there is public participation.</p></speech>

It states, &quot;This section shall not apply to a MSP to which <i>Chapter 4</i>applies.&quot;  Chapter 4 relates to &quot;Laying of certain DMAPs before CPAs&quot;, not marine spatial plans, MSPs.  Maybe I read it wrongly.  It seems to me that it is an error in the Bill.  If not, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>On amendment No. 97, I will not repeat the long discussion that we had about the allegedly excessive nature of the Oireachtas oversight, scrutiny and decision-making but I want to make a point.  I am not looking to fight the battle we had previously again.  The Minister of State has said on a number of occasions and is right that the Oireachtas has an important role to play.  The difficulty is that the Oireachtas and its committees are not always of the one mind.  Many of us wanted to have a small amount of additional scrutiny of the national marine planning framework.  We did not get it.  We felt that was a limitation.  That is at the discretion of the Government since the Government, unless it is a minority Government, controls a majority of votes when deciding to give time.  While I am not in any way questioning the depth of the public consultation on the national marine planning framework, there are organisations that are on public record as having felt that, while they engaged, they were not necessarily listened to.  That may or may not be the case.  Not everybody can be listened to, heard and have their views incorporated all the time but it is much better if some form of Oireachtas engagement, oversight, scrutiny and decision-making is included for such important plans.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this.  He does not have to read out the same briefing note he had last time but I urge him to consider some greater level of formalised Oireachtas committee involvement in these developments because it would enhance the process.</p><p>When the national planning framework was being developed, the level of Oireachtas involvement was far greater, especially committee involvement.  That was probably a reflection of the fact that it was a minority Government and therefore the negotiations with Government partners were different.  My feeling as a committee member was that the committee did not have as much engagement with the national marine planning framework as we did with the national planning framework.  Setting some of those things out in the context of MSPs and DMAPs in legislation would be a welcome thing for the Minister of State to consider.</p></speech>

Those decisions have been taken.  I am not looking to reopen them.  I am saying that where the level of Oireachtas committee engagement is set out in legislation or by way of regulation, that would ensure that it happens.  Where it is not set out, it is at the discretion of a committee, the Government or the composition of forces in the Oireachtas.  Irrespective of where one stood on the amicable disagreement that we had previously, some of this should be specified more.  That is clearly not an attempt to convince the Minister of State to support this terribly excessive amendment, as he called it, but we should have something better than we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It states that section 19 is not to apply to plans to which Chapter 4 applies, relating to the requirement to lay the intended development plan before the Oireachtas.</p><p>I would like to understand the rationale for that.  I am guessing the Minister of State will say it is because it is the ones that are dealing with local authorities and where they intend to make plans.  I would like to hear his explanation.  I cannot see any reason to accept the requirement for the intention to make a marine spatial plan before the Oireachtas.</p><p> Regarding amendment No. 97, the Bill requires that an intention to make a marine spatial plan would be laid before the Oireachtas and will have regard for recommendations of any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it does not go as far as ours does in requiring that all committees be notified.  That is quite important in that the impact of marine spatial plans can cross many areas.  I suspect that many committees that might have an interest in the stuff we are discussing here are not even aware of how it may potentially impact them or for that matter how the national marine planning framework may impact things that are of concern to them.  The requirement to alert all Oireachtas committees to any intention to make marine special plans is important so that they have the opportunity to give input into those and those inputs need to be taken seriously.  There is a wider requirement for the public to be notified of any intention to make marine special plans.  We should be thorough in ensuring that the public is made aware of that and has the opportunity to give input to such plans.</p></speech>

That subsection disapplies the Oireachtas approval procedure in respect of a specific subset of DMAPS set out in Chapter 4.  I believe that the Members may misunderstand the intention and function of this provision and may wish to withdraw the amendment following further explanation.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 is applicable to DMAPs where a local authority is the designated competent authority and the DMAP is within its proposed nearshore area.  It could also apply to DMAPs where more than one local authority and nearshore is involved.  Instead of Oireachtas approval, oversight and democratic legitimacy is provided by a vote in the local authority concerned.  It is envisaged to be used in circumstances where a local authority may wish to develop a DMAP in parallel with county or local area development plans.  There may be 31 county-based DMAPs and countless local plans.  I do not believe that it is the Members' intention that each single one be subject to Oireachtas approval.  If accepted this amendment might mean the national Legislature does little else during its sessions.  </p> <p>  We also need to be conscious of the message the Oireachtas would be sending to the local authorities by requiring both local and national democratic approval.  In essence these Houses would be saying that a local authority cannot be trusted in terms of its jurisdiction.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 97 proposes revised procedures for Oireachtas approval.  I believe that the measures set out in the Bill - early notification of the Oireachtas through the public participation statement - will enable Oireachtas engagement at a far earlier stage where any proposals made can influence and shape the development of plans.  This will be far more effective and efficient than seeking to retrofit a plan towards the end of its development.  The Oireachtas approval procedure set out in section 19 of the Bill is deemed sufficient.</p></speech>

This was the original intention but the text as initiated was inoperable in this regard.  These amendments make the necessary disapplications and adjustments to procedures.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 98 is a technical amendment to enable amendment No. 104.  Amendment No. 104 inserts a new section 20(7) to enable the delegation of responsibility for a DMAP to another competent authority "D" following its preparation and publication.  This provision would enable another body to undertake a review of the DMAP in question.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 109 corrects a typographical error in section 24.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 111 sets out a new section 29 containing the technical revisions to the DMAP procedure necessary to enable preparation by the competent authority "M".  These relate primarily to where the competent authority "M" had a procedural role regarding the preparation of a DMAP by the competent authority "D".  It does not change the fundamental considerations or obligations in respect of making a DMAP.  Proposal, publication, participation statement and Oireachtas approval all still apply.</p> <p>  Section 29(4) disapplies the designation procedure under section 20; modifies section 21 to allow the competent authority "M" to act as it if were the competent authority "D" and with the same obligations save that it does not have to approve its own proposal; modifies section 22(1) to allow for the publication of the DMAP proposal to serve in place of a designation under section 20; disapplies section 22(4) where a competent authority "D" could make a new proposal where the original was not approved; disapplies section 24 providing for oversight of the competent authority "D"; disapplies section 25(2) relating to section 24; disapplies section 26(2) relating to ministerial directives; disapplies section 28(4) relating to non-material amendments; and modifies 28(5) to provide for these changes.</p> <p>  I now turn to the remaining amendments in this grouping.  Amendments Nos. 99 to 103, inclusive, collectively seek to limit who can be designated as a competent authority to Ministers of Government.  Section 20 of the initiated text provides that any body that meets the definition of public body may be designated as a competent authority "D" to prepare a DMAP.  This would be a severe restriction and would mean that a local authority would not be allowed to prepare a DMAP to align with its county development plan or local area plan.  It would prevent bodies such as the Marine Institute, the EPA or even MARA to be designated.  </p> <p>  We all want high-quality DMAPs that do all the wonderful things we have set out in sections 21 and 22.  We all want those DMAPs to be developed in a comprehensive fashion.  We all want that development process to have best practice participation.  It is acknowledged that not every public body has the necessary capacity, competency or skill sets to prepare a DMAP and it is intended to be very mindful of these matters when designating.  It should be noted that such designations would only be undertaken following an engagement process with the body concerned and, where relevant, its parent Department.</p><p>On review, we have inadvertently used too broad a definition of public body in respect of such a designation.  As defined in the Bill it includes Ministers, local authorities and bodies established under enactment.  It also includes companies.  While appropriate in other contexts, it would not be appropriate for such a company to prepare a DMAP.  I intend to propose a Report Stage amendment to so modify the definition of "public body" for the purposes of this section.  The amendments proposed by the Deputies cannot be accepted.  They may wish to withdraw these amendments in light of this further explanation.</p></speech>

That is not in any way criticising the Minister of State for reading the technical import of the amendments into the record because that has to be done.  However, people sitting at home who have just listened to our series of conversations about the NMPF and the MSPs will be legitimately asking what a DMAP is and how it relates to the MSPs.  I ask the Minister of State to provide us with some clarity on what a DMAP is likely to look like or involve, in terms of its geographical size, its sectoral import and whether it could be activity-related rather than geographical, etc.</p> <p>  Second, I would like the Minister of State to give us more clarity on the kinds of agencies we are likely to see designated by "M" as "D".  I know that sounds like a James Bond movie but that is essentially what we are talking about here.  I have no difficulty with a competent authority such as MARA being given a role but it is reasonable for the committee to get some clarity from the Minister of State because there is an intention here.  I am speculating on this as much in the hope that the Minister of State will say I am wrong as that I am right.  With respect to offshore wind, for example, could the competent authority be another Department that is responsible for regulation of energy?  Would it therefore come under the Minister?  Under what circumstances would MARA or a local authority deal with that?  With local authorities it is a little bit clearer because they are more limited in their scope.  Who is likely to be designated "D" by "M", or "M" by "D", and for what purpose?  A little more information on that would help us to clarify and determine whether we press our amendments.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to explain how the two interact.  If the DMAPs are providing for further granularity and specification for an MSP, they will need to be developed consistently with the methodology requirements of the marine spatial planning directive and be properly approved by the Oireachtas.  Will this happen?</p> <p>  Amendment No. 110 relates to mitigation measures, which are important.  This amendment seeks to protect them and ensure that measures are included to avoid impacts on the integrity of European or Natura 2000 sites.  The Bill allows for quite a lot of discretion and that could alter and affect mitigation and have an effect on the Natura sites so it is important to have this amendment.  I previously referenced the importance of doing something like they have done in Scotland in terms of mitigation and renewable energy, where every licence contributes to the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund.  That is a good model of mitigation.  There are other site-specific mitigation measures as well.  That is what amendment No. 110 is about.</p></speech>

That is a snapshot of what type of body it may be.</p><p>I see the DMAP as a sub-national plan.  It is like the terrestrial planning system for a county.  There is the county development plan and underneath that, breathing life into the shared vision of the county development plan, is the local area plan.  That may be around a town, an area or a community that tries to chart the development with key public participation of that community into the future that the members would vote on, where particular micro-pointed development would happen.  That is on a more micro level and it is the same with the DMAPs.  They breathe life again into the national planning framework.  A DMAP is a more micro document that would be brought forward by an authority, as referenced, to try to give a more specific plan for that designated area.  I refer to page 197 of the NMPF.  I keep referring back to that document because it is so good.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	A DMAP will be a management plan for a specific area of our marine waters and can be used to develop multi-activity area plans; to promote use of specific activities; and/or for the purposes of the sustainable use and protection of particular marine environments. </blockquote></speech>

For example, if a local authority decided that it wanted a particular marine area, would that be limited to the nearshore area?  If that area went beyond the nearshore, since it still had an interest could it request to be designated to develop this more localised form of plan?  What happens if multiple public bodies have an interest in a particular area?  How does that work?  The Minister of State mentioned the energy regulator, heritage bodies and local authorities.  They might all have interest in the same area and all wish to develop a DMAP for the same area or for areas that overlap.  How will all that work?  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate a bit on that.  Can a body seeking to develop a DMAP for a particular area start to request designation to develop a DMAP as soon as this legislation is passed?</p></speech>

They can have accountability to Ministers and so forth but different State agencies, Ministers and Departments will come at this with different perspectives.  Some could be particularly tied or may not be so neutral in how they look at this.  Some could be very much geared towards one particular area, such as renewable energy or something like that.  They could be looking at it just from that sphere and under this legislation they would have the ability to do the DMAP.</p><p>Does it not create potential concerns that they might not be neutral or that they might not look at the wider issues sufficiently although, obviously, they will do some of that?  Does it also not create a bit of difficulty around competence and expertise in that it could be spread between too many different bodies and, thus, create a bit of inefficiency?  Whereas some of these State agencies might have the competence and expertise in terms of marine biodiversity, others might not.  Does that not create certain issues and, potentially, create a process where there could be some deficiencies?  The Minister of State might address those points.</p></speech>

With regard to different plans coming forward, we want to challenge agencies in the spirit of coexistence in our maritime area.  It will be up to the relevant Minister to adjudicate on whether to permit the DMAP to go forward.  Outside of the local authority system, a DMAP has to be approved by the Oireachtas.  It is important to make that point.</p></speech>

My understanding of the text the Minister of State referred us to is that DMAPs are presented as regional or sub-regional action-type plans whether for single use or varied use.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong that we could have multiple marine spatial plans sitting underneath the national marine planning framework.  Could we then have DMAPs which could crossover different MSPs?  Is that possible?</p></speech>

I presume the plan is to, over time, fill out all of the detail that is not yet there in the national marine planning framework with multiple MSPs.  The boundary of a DMAP is not necessarily contiguous with any of that.  It could be just a subsection.</p> <p>  Could you have a DMAP specifically related to the legacy projects for offshore wind prior to the establishment of MARA and MARA's process of consent to the planning authority or am I jumping too far ahead in terms of the function of DMAPs?  I may have another question on that depending on the Minister of State's answer.</p></speech>

I will read the information I have on it.  The Bill is to establish an updated marine spatial planning toolkit that will now include DMAP procedures.  Step one is the enactment.  As is the case elsewhere in the EU, national plans come first, followed by sub-national planning which may take many forms.  Under the legislation, it is envisaged that over time there will be an ever-increasing body of DMAPs and they will all become part of the national marine planning framework.  No decision has been taken on the form, location or extent of the first DMAPs.  The focus is on enacting the necessary procedural toolkit set out in the Bill.  Once the Bill is enacted, we will move on to the next phase and plan of the development.</p></speech>

That Department would, therefore, have a set of expertise in that area, with responsibility to lead a DMAP for the geographical, or sub-regional, area that currently incorporates the legacy projects.  Is that possible and is it the Government's intention to do that? </p></speech>

Following on from that, as soon as this legislation is enacted there could conceivably be a massive race between various bodies to grab areas for DMAPs, depending on what their particular interests are.  In fact, I am tempted to participate in that race in respect of certain areas.  Is it a case of whatever body gets in first gets the area?  If a particular Department, and the one mentioned is the very obvious one, states that it wants to get these projects through and it applies to be the competent authority for the development of that DMAP, which it might well do for that area, is it a case of "on your marks, get set, go" to grab particular areas?  The local authority might state that it is concerned about the thing just out here, and that it is in a race against the Department that is primarily about advancing, for example, offshore wind.  Is that the sort of scenario we could, potentially, face?</p></speech>

We see it as bodies that have to coexist in our maritime area and trying to achieve the best for it.  All those bodies have to go through the rigorous and robust thresholds contained in the NMPF regarding all those areas.  The Minister will have to make a determination on that, as will the Oireachtas, subsequently.  There are significant safety catches in any decision that will be made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-02a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021110200002#S00600"><p>Everything is in the NMPF.  That is good on one level, but people might say that particular bits of the NMPF, such as the visual, tourism and heritage aspects, are in line with the DMAP they want for a particular area and they want to vindicate the objectives of the NMPF, but it might be, rather, precisely to prevent certain other types of usage taking place in particular areas.  By the way, that might not be a bad thing, in certain cases.  On coexistence, co-location and all of that, is it a requirement that every objective of the NMPF is in every DMAP for every localised area?  Surely, it is not, because then there would be a requirement, for example, in every DMAP-designated area, to have a bit of this, that and the other thing, when it might not be suitable in certain areas to do certain things as against other things.  I ask for a little clarification on that.</p></speech>

It is not that we will have one sector in the maritime area, at the cost of all other users or all other conditions.  The Minister will have to make a determination based on the shared vision for the NMPF, policy, that the proposal meets the threshold on the requirements and that it is good policy for our maritime area.  The Oireachtas will make a determination subsequent to that.</p></speech>

I just have questions.  I ask the Minister of State to return to my first question on the relationship between an MSP and a DMAP.  I am not clear about that because it is not explained on page 197 of the NMPF.</p> <p>  With respect to section 23, the instigation of a DMAP, or the appointment of a public body for the purposes of drafting it, would constitute, essentially, the beginning of a review of the NMPF, if it came before a MSP, for the purpose of the public participation statement.  Is it likely, however, that a DMAP would come first or is it more likely that a marine spatial plan will?  It is just a technical question.</p> <p>  On section 25, the Minister of State is correct in stating that a report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  Is it the intention, or hope, of the Minister of State with this legislation that the Oireachtas Business Committee will refer it to the relevant committee for consideration as we do, for example, with other planning matters?  On foot of that, there would be a motion for approval, with or without debate.  Does the Minister of State envisage a role for the relevant committee, depending on what agency is developing the DMAP? </p></speech>

Again, in the first instance, the DMAP is on a more micro level.  The NMPF sits at the top of the tree, with the policy statement on top of that.  We then get to a more micro area that has been designated for activity or activities as outlined in the relevant NMPF section or, for whatever other reason, the Minister may make an assessment on an application that comes before him or her.  The Oireachtas will have to determine thereafter.  It is on a more micro level and it then becomes part of the MSP.</p></speech>

If, for example, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is looking to do a DMAP and another Department is looking to be the lead body, or there are a few bodies and the Minister has to make that adjudication, does the Minister just make that decision or does he or she have to consult with the Oireachtas at some level?</p></speech>
