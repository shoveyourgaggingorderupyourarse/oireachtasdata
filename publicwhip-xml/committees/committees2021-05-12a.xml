    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#A00200"><p>I thank members and witnesses for their attendance at this meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances and measures required due to Covid-19.  I remind members who are participating remotely that they should do so from within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Today we will be discussing issues relating to the employment of content moderators.  A content moderator is an employee of an online platform responsible for user-generated content submitted to the platform.  The content moderator's job includes making sure the material posted to the platform is placed in the right category, is free from scams and does not include any illegal matter.</p> <p>  At the outset I wish to explain the purpose of today's discussion, which is to enable the committee to inform itself about matters of policy and possible legislative changes it could raise with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and officials of his Department, who will be before us next week.  As is normal, we cannot involve ourselves in general industrial relations issues.  To assist the committee in its consideration of some of the issues that arise relating to the employment of persons as content moderators, I am pleased to welcome Ms Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in from the Communications Workers Union, CWU, and Ms Cori Crider from Foxglove, a London-based group that advocates on behalf of the users of digital technology.  Ms Crider is accompanied by Ms Isabella Plunkett, a content moderator.</p> <p>  Before we begin I wish to explain some of the limitations on parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses in the context of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Opening statements and other relevant documentation have already been circulated to members.  I invite Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#A00300"><p>I am the head of organising with the Communications Workers Union, CWU in Ireland.  The CWU represents workers in the postal, telecoms and call centre digital sectors.  The increasing footprint of global digital companies in Ireland has brought changes to the existing landscape and new challenges for workers in these areas.  We are pleased to appear before the committee today along with Foxglove and, in particular, with Isabella Plunkett, who has shown great courage by speaking out.  I thank committee members for giving us the opportunity to speak to them today and for giving voice to a group of workers who have been protecting us and our families, quietly and in the background, but without the same protections their directly employed colleagues and other workers enjoy.</p> <p>  Despite the critical service content moderators provide, they are led to believe they cannot voice concerns regarding that work and its impact on them, their colleagues and their families.  It is our information that content moderators are required to sign non-disclosure agreements at the start of their employment.  They are not given a copy of these agreements to retain for reference.  This has a chilling effect from the start and creates an atmosphere in which workers fear retaliation if they try to vindicate their right to raise legitimate issues and concerns in their workplace.  We have been advised that workers are frequently reminded of the existence of these agreements and they are prohibited from discussing any and all aspects of their work, whether that be with a trade union representative or even with their own families.</p> <p>  Social media platforms and their outsourcing partners exploit moderators' lack of legal training to make demands for secrecy that are possibly unlawful.  Two moderators received messages seeking to reassert this secrecy from one of the two outsourcing firms in advance of this hearing.  This climate of fear has chilled workers' participation in legitimate democratic processes and is unacceptable.  Trade unions have long experience of workers having a fear of speaking out or of talking to a trade union, let alone joining one.  Coupled with the atmosphere created by non-disclosure agreements, this fear is clearly amplified.  The right to join a union is enshrined in our Constitution and yet workers are led to believe this right cannot apply to them.  Furthermore, the European Parliament is currently in discussions on a proposal for a directive on an adequate minimum wage in the EU.  This debate has expanded to include collective bargaining rights and access to workplaces for the purposes of organising, thus recognising the need for these protections.  How can such rights be achieved when workers feel silenced by their own employer?</p> <p>  It is worth noting that a large proportion of content moderators working in Ireland are non-nationals, working on various streams and in multiple languages.  Employers rely not only on their language abilities but also on their unique understanding of their respective cultures to make judgments on what is and is not appropriate material.  This valuable cultural and linguistic insight is also part of these workers' vulnerability due to their possible lack of knowledge of their rights and entitlements here in Ireland.  It cannot be said strongly enough that the content these workers are exposed to can be grotesque and traumatising and includes violence, extremism, child exploitation and more.  During the past year, society has come to recognise the vital role played by front-line workers.  In terms of this critical service to society, surely we owe it to these workers to value their work as it should be valued.</p> <p>  Artificial intelligence and other technologies are nowhere near being able to review and make the judgment calls taken by thousands of moderators here in Ireland, across Europe and the rest of the world.  Social media companies are fully aware of this dynamic but continue to outsource this work, meaning moderators do not enjoy the same level of support, benefits and protections as direct employees.  Without the moderators' expertise, these platforms would simply cease to function.  When attempting to engage with employers, the outsourcing company can point to the requirements of the client company and the client company can point to the fact these workers are not, in fact, their employees.  Where does the buck stop?  By directly employing content moderators, these global giants would be recognising the immense importance of their work to society while also recognising the impact of this work on their mental health, their families and their relationships.</p> <p>  In order for moderators to exercise their rights without fear of reprisal, we ask the committee to engage with these employers, prohibit all acts which undermine workers' rights or discourage their active participation in a union, and ensure proper access for all workers to the necessary information on their rights.  Our society is made better by work of content moderators.  They are suffering so that we do not have to, and the least they deserve is to be rewarded and protected accordingly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#A00500"><p>Thank you very much for being the first Parliament in the world to address the vital issue of social media content moderators on Facebook and beyond.  I am Cori Crider, the co-founder of Foxglove, a non-profit organisation working to ensure justice in technology.  For two years now we have assisted moderators to seek a fairer workplace.  As Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in said, social media content moderation is one of the most vital and under-regulated jobs in the modern economy.  A third of the planet uses Facebook now, including millions in Ireland.  These days, it is our public square.  As Facebook's oversight board said in a recent decision about the ban on former President Donald Trump, Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, especially in election periods.</p><p>Content moderation, a new form of work, is here to stay, so it is crucial that this committee understands what it really takes to keep Facebook running and what it costs people like Ms Plunkett who do it.</p><p> The work Ms Plunkett and thousands of her colleagues do is for us.  It guards our public square.  When a terrorist tries to livestream a beheading, a content moderator steps in.  When an anti-vax group spreads misinformation about the Covid vaccine, a moderator deals with it.  When a depressed teen tries to hurt herself and broadcast it to the world, a moderator is there.  I can put it no better than an engineer at Facebook did: "Content moderators are the people literally holding this platform.  They are the ones keeping the platform safe."</p><p> Facebook depends on these moderators to keep the company attractive to users and therefore profitable, but Ms Plunkett and other critical workers like her feel treated like second-class citizens.  Light-touch regulation of social media has failed.  Thus, Foxglove has three recommendations.  First, end the culture of fear and excessive secrecy at Facebook and its companies.  No NDA should stop moderators raising legitimate concerns about working conditions.  The firms should really be made to clarify this and the extent of moderators' rights, in public.  Second, regulate content moderation, just as other hazardous businesses in Ireland are regulated.  One could draw, for instance, on examples in the police and, indeed, from recommendations which Facebook itself has endorsed and which we have submitted as evidence to the committee.  A regulation moderation floor should allow opt-outs for toxic content for people who are not able to sustain it, it should allow independent experts to set safe limits on exposure to toxic content and it should offer real psychiatric support - medical, clinical support, not mere wellness coaching.  Third, it should be required that social media firms of a certain size bring content moderation in-house.  It should be brought in-house through a legal requirement on platforms of a certain size, because it is core to their business - it is not adjunct to their business.</p><p> We were pleased to meet with the T&aacute;naiste in January to discuss these issues.  However, we only received a response to the issues raised in that meeting at 7 p.m. last night, which I am afraid, raises more questions than it answers.  Also, because it came in at 7 p.m., we could not submit it in evidence, but I am happy to discuss the response that we received.</p><p> I will now hand over to Ms Plunkett for the remainder of the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#B00200"><p>Good morning.  I thank the committee for inviting me today.  I have worked with Facebook as a content moderator, through one of its outsourcing firms, Covalen, for almost two years.  Today I speak on behalf of hundreds of colleagues who would have come to the meeting but have been intimidated by a pervasive climate of fear at work.  I speak out today to make a difference.</p> <p>  I was excited to work for Facebook.  You would think that it is a smart career move and that you would be part of the new economy, until you realise what the costs will be to you personally.  I will talk about three problems that we face.</p> <p>  The first is the climate of fear.  It has been very hard to come here to day.  My lawyers insist that it is my right and I believe that, but in my opinion, Facebook and Covalen have confused us and undermined our belief in the right to speak out.  Facebook presents itself as a progressive company.  There are slogans in our office that read: "Be bold and be brave".  How can we be brave when our right to speak out is consistently undermined?</p> <p>  The second point I wish to raise is the mental health aspect.  The content that is moderated is awful.  It would affect anyone.  It has finally started to get to me.  I have horrible lucid dreams about all the things I have seen, and for months I have been taking antidepressants because of this content.  My job is to train the algorithm.  Facebook's fantasy is that one day human content moderators will no longer be required.  That means I get all kinds of content - hate speech, bullying, graphic violence, suicides, abuse, child exploitation, and the list goes on.  Some of my colleagues have it even worse.  They are working on child abuse and self-harm queues all day.  A manager tells them that they should limit their exposure to a maximum of two hours per day, but this is not happening.  To help, they offer us wellness coaches.  These people mean really well, but they are not doctors.  They suggest karaoke and painting, but frankly, one does not always feel like singing, after having seen someone be battered to bits.  I was referred to the company doctor once and I was supposed to hear about a follow-up appointment, but I have not heard anything since.</p> <p>  Finally, we are tired of the second-class citizenship.  We know that it would be different if we were Facebook staff, because we have seen how Facebook staff are treated.  The Facebook staff who review identical content to me can work from home and stay safe during the Covid period.  My mother has survived cancer twice and I support her.  When I asked to work from home to keep her safe, I was told that it was not possible.  I was told that I had to come into the office and I should stay away from her.  The pay of Facebook staff is more than double mine.  They get sick pay.  I get seven days' unpaid sick leave per year.  If our work is so important, why are we not Facebook staff?</p> <p>  Moderators want to see action taken in respect of the following.  First, content moderation is Facebook's core business and it must be valued.  We should not be treated as disposable; we are not disposable.  If we are "core" enough to risk our lives and those of our loved ones to come into the office, we are "core" enough to be staff.  I hope the committee will investigate the practice of outsourcing.  Second, the mental health care is nowhere close to good enough.  Unfortunately, we cannot opt out of toxic content and we are not given real psychiatric care.  It is a workplace health and safety issue and must be dealt with.  Finally, the climate of fear has to end.  I should not have to stand here alone------</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#B00300"><p>Before, Ms Plunkett finishes, I would like to remind her not to mention another entity.  She can make her comments, but I ask her not mention the name of the secondary company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#B00400"><p>Yes, absolutely.</p> <p>  Finally, the climate of fear has to end.  I should not have to stand here alone.  Hundreds of my colleagues have the same experiences.  We ask that Facebook and the outsourcing companies are made to openly clarify our rights around legitimate grievances.  Fear stops us speaking out and makes us afraid to raise safety issues, as it stands in the way of our working with the union.</p> <p>  I thank the members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#B00500"><p>I invite the members to discuss the issues with the witnesses.  I remind them to use the hand-raising function on Teams, and more importantly, to lower their hand, as it were, when they have finished speaking.  As members know, a rota is in place.  The first member indicating is Deputy Louise O'Reilly, who has 14 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#B00600"><p>Time is tight.  I would like to let the members and witnesses know that I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber, so I will be stepping in and out of the meeting, but I will be following the proceedings.</p> <p>  I wish to address Ms Plunkett directly for a moment.  I want to thank her and commend her on her bravery.  I know that it is not easy.  It is never easy to do something like this, particularly in the circumstances as have been outlined and given the nature of the work and the manner in which her employer uses NDAs and other mechanisms within the workplace.  I do not think that anyone will disagree with me when I say that Ms Plunkett is a brave young woman and she is doing her colleagues, and indeed her union, a great service today.  As Ms Crider has pointed out, it is the first time that any parliament has had the opportunity to discuss this issue.  It is absolutely necessary.  I think every person participating in this meeting uses social media.  I would be surprised if they do not.  We all use social media and know the benefits of using it.  However, we can all use these platforms safely because of people like Ms Plunkett.  There are people like Ms Plunkett who stand between us and the kind of disgusting, vile content that has been alluded to and not even described.  I do not think that we would even be able to listen to the descriptions of it, much less to have to experience it.  The reason that we can use these platforms is because of people like Ms Plunkett.  Therefore, the work that they do is absolutely essential and is core to the business of the platforms.  The fact that it is outsourced is deeply worrying.</p> <p>  It is deeply worrying on a number of levels.  It is deeply worrying from the point of view of workers' rights.  It is also worrying that from a user perspective, the platforms feel that it is okay to have this essential front-line work conducted at a remove from the main companies.  That is very wrong.  We are talking about issues of health and safety, and the personal safety of those who are moderating the content.  That is core to the business.</p> <p>  I do not have enough words with which I can salute Ms Plunkett.  She has been very brave today.  As we all know, and as I say at many of our meetings, the strongest message that any worker can send to their employer and, indeed, to Government and politicians is to join a union and be active in that trade union.  That gives the worker a voice and that is why Ms Plunkett is here today.</p> <p>  I ask whichever of the witnesses has the information to hand the following questions.  What supports are available currently?  I know that sometimes we are told that supports are available.  I am referring specifically to supports available to content moderators who are not directly employed.  What sort of supports should be available?  There is no disputing that the work is dangerous.  The health, safety and welfare at work legislation provides for checks, balances, safety equipment, education and other measures as part of dealing with a hazardous work environment, which is the kind of work environment the content moderators are dealing with.</p> <p>  It is deeply worrying on a number of levels.  From the point of view of workers' rights, it is deeply worrying</p><p>One of the witnesses could describe what kind of supports could be put in place and what should be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#C00200"><p>I will outline the general situation and Ms Plunkett, if there is sufficient time, could give her experience of engaging with the mental health services.</p> <p>  Ms Plunkett and other content moderators working for Facebook are allotted a short period of time each week with a so-called wellness coach.  You might wonder what the purpose of such a slightly strange word is but it is specifically intended to convey that this is not a clinical role.  If you look at the rules governing the wellness coaches, these are not psychiatrists.  They are forbidden by the rules from engaging in diagnosis and treatment.  What they are intended to do is to provide a sort of soft counselling service but it is not medical care.  To compare it, for example, with what a police officer in Ireland investigating a child abuse case would be offered, that is proper clinical psychiatric support.  It recognises it is a medical issue.  The committee heard Ms Plunkett talking about karaoke, which seems, frankly, a quite odd way of handling exposure to graphic and obscene content.  Essentially, it is not medical care.  Many people have said to us, in several countries and not only Ireland, since this is a systemic issue across Facebook's countries that do this work, that it just is not enough because it is not medical care.</p> <p>  Does Ms Plunkett have anything she would want to add about her experience with the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy again for the kind words.  To outline it briefly, we can go and see a wellness coach and we can do these sessions for an hour a week.  We are only entitled to an hour and a half a week of wellness, for example, if we see some very harsh content and we need to walk away to get a cup of tea or go for a cigarette.  An hour and a half is not enough.  The services provided to us, although they involve amazing people who try their best, do not have the capability and the necessary scope for what we are dealing with.  I would love to see it change into the future because mental health is so important.  It is talked about so much these days.  It should be a priority.  That is all I have to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#C00400"><p>I thank Ms Plunkett.  If I could address a few questions to Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in, greenfield organising is tough and I commend the Communications Workers Union on the work it is doing on this.  This is important work to be done.</p> <p>  In terms of organising these workers, bringing them together and giving them a collective voice, what impact does the outsourcing have?  It seems there is a bit of an "Upstairs, Downstairs" situation going on.  There are directly employed and outsourced workers.  There is clearly a comparator.  I would say the comparator exists with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Even if it did not, there is clearly a comparator with directly employed personnel.  Will Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in outline for us briefly the challenges she has faced as an organiser and how tough it is, particularly to organise this group of workers because this is new work?  This work did not exist when I was growing up.  This is new work and I would say it requires new regulation.</p></speech>

There are several challenges with organising content moderators in their current employment status, the primary one being, as the Deputy identified correctly, the outsourcing model used by these employers.  As I mentioned briefly in my statement, when you are looking to raise or address an issue with an employer, you have to identify who that employer is - who is calling the shots, so to speak.  When an individual worker raises an issue with his or her direct employer, the outsourced company, he or she is referred to the business requirements of the client, and if the person attempts to raise any issues with the client company, he or she is correctly advised that he or she is not employed by the client company.</p> <p>  The other main issue we have that is unique to content moderators and which I have not encountered in my 15 years' experience of organising until this point is this climate of fear Ms Plunkett outlined so clearly.  They are required to sign these non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, they are given on day one.  These are taken away.  They do not have time to read them.  They certainly do not have time to refer to them.  Regularly and frequently they are reminded they exist.  As difficult as it is to organise a new workplace and give those workers the assurance they have the right and entitlement to be a member of a trade union and raise legitimate issues, to convince a worker he or she has that right when he or she is being bombarded on all sides by this climate of fear and secrecy Ms Plunkett described so well is an extra layer of challenge for those workers.  Until the position is clarified that these workers have the right to raise issues in the same way as any other workers, it will remain a significant challenge for them.</p></speech>

In my experience, these types of non-disclosure agreements do not exist to a huge extent in the State.  I would be worried, the same as with all trends that batter workers, that it might catch on.  Is this an international phenomenon right across the board or is this unique to us here?</p></speech>

It is not simply one NDA.  It is a series of documents people are made to sign and which they are not then generally given a copy of.</p> <p>  We engaged with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about this question of NDAs when we had the meeting in January.  I now can see from the letter I received at 7.04 p.m. yesterday that the T&aacute;naiste did then ask.  Facebook wrote back in February stating that all the content moderators needed to do if they wanted to get a copy of their NDAs was simply ask, but that is not consonant with our experience.  What happened was, in advance of the meeting of content moderators with the T&aacute;naiste in January, we wrote to Facebook and to one of the outsourcing firms stating these people were about to speak about their workplace conditions, they needed some reassurance from them, that we had said it was lawful but asked the companies if they could confirm it, and if they could disclose all of the documentation they said applied to these people's right to speak.  The outsourcing firm never replied in advance of that meeting.  Facebook wrote back stating the content moderators know what their obligations were and it would not give them anything.  After the meeting, the companies told the content moderators they needed to put in a subject access request under the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR.  We put in a subject access request under the GDPR, there was an endless back and forth, and we have received some documentation.  However, I have good reason to believe it is not all of the relevant documentation on confidentiality.</p> <p>  It may well be, by the way, that if the companies were required to publish this information, disclose it, give it over in the course of events and give it to an independent legal examiner, it would be something like a paper tiger, that a lawyer who read it would say it does not prevent a person from raising legitimate workplace grievances and that there has been an effort to talk workers out of raising legitimate issues that is much farther than what the law would allow.  Content moderators are not lawyers, however; they should not have to be lawyers.  They should be able to get the documents without having someone like me shepherd through a subject access request to do it.  That has been the problem - identifying what it is that these companies even claim restricts these people.</p></speech>

I refer to the idea that you sign it, it gets taken off you, you cannot refer to it then but you are constantly being told there is something on a piece of paper that you have signed that means that you cannot do what you want to do.  In terms of organising and giving the workers a voice, what is the impact of that NDA?</p></speech>

They have been, as I said, bombarded with this idea that they cannot speak.  They are told they cannot speak to their own families and to their own friends.  They cannot speak to their colleagues.  In that climate, how would a person say that he or she will reach out and expose all this - what he or she believes to be confidential information - and have no comfort whatsoever as to what the impact might be on his or her employment and what kind of retaliation he or she might face as a worker by raising these?  Imagine in that climate even attempting to raise an internal grievance with your employer.</p></speech>

They are not supposed to discuss the content they have seen or the impact it has on them.  That is extraordinary given that, as Ms Plunkett has said, they do not have the psychiatric or mental health support we feel would be necessary given this is a workplace health and safety issue.  Not even to be able to go home and have the comfort and support of your own family members as a release for that trauma is an extraordinary burden to place on workers given the nature of the content they are viewing.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Plunkett will outline for us the mental health impacts.  In her evidence she described some of the impacts.  Will she now share that with the committee?  I will not get a chance to speak again but I must thank and salute Ms Plunkett.  She is doing a very good job here on behalf of her union and on behalf of her colleagues.</p></speech>

I appreciate the kind words.  The mental health side of things is a big part of it.  Not being able to speak to family and friends about it will, of course, affect a person.  As I said earlier, in these days and times we should be looking after mental health.  Issues are on the rise.  As Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in has said, if we are not given that support in work, what are we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to sit there by ourselves and think about these horrible things?  Are we supposed to suffer in silence?  I do not think it is right and I do not believe it is fair.  As I outlined in my statement, I am now on antidepressants for more than seven months.  I have horrible dreams about the content and I can find myself, while in a day-to-day situation, thinking of yesterday's work.  I may think of something I saw that was really horrible and I cannot forget it although I would like to.  Everybody should be able to separate work and life balance.  They should be able to go home and have that separation, but I feel that with this job it is not necessarily possible because your subconscious mind is always thinking about it.  It is very difficult.</p></speech>

I had read and researched about the role of content moderator.  It seems to be most challenging and difficult.  As we have heard from the contributions, it is very upsetting.  This is unacceptable.</p> <p>  Will our guests speak about what they feel is the biggest factor in Facebook not making content moderators employees?  Is it solely related to cost and financial issues or are there other factors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#D00400"><p>I cannot overly speculate as to Facebook's motives, but I would respectfully suggest to the committee that, just as it is speaking to the T&aacute;naiste shortly about these issues, it would be appropriate to invite the companies who are taking on this work and who host the public square to come and give the committee their perspective.  We would absolutely welcome that.  There seem to us to be two factors at play.  One is, as Ms Plunkett has said, that she makes an absolute fraction of what a Facebook employee makes, including a relatively entry-level Facebook employee who is doing quality assurance on the same content.  This employee is just a couple of rungs up the proverbial totem pole and would make an absolute multiple of what an outsourced content moderator earns, so there is that fact.  There is also the fact there is greater ability to shift the workforce relatively rapidly, in that the companies can open up something and then lay off people <i>en masse</i>with what they consider to be a greater degree of flexibility.  The final concern is to do with potential liability for people who contract very serious clinical PTSD as a result of exposure.<br/><br/>One of the documents we submitted in evidence to the committee is an acknowledgment used by one of the outsourcing firms that says in its terms that the moderator will understand that exposure to this content &quot;could even lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&quot;, and that the moderator will engage in the mandatory wellness coaching session.  The moderator is to understand that those [coaches] are not clinicians and this may not be sufficient to prevent him or her contracting PTSD.  We can see there, in black and white in the document we have submitted to this committee, that the companies are essentially asking the workers themselves to shoulder the burden and the responsibility for their own mental health.  This seems to us to be the functional equivalent of an industrial factory saying to a worker building a car, for example, that &quot;we have not put a guard on but make sure you keep your arm out of the machine&quot;.  The fact this is mental health and therefore harder to see and that we are socially behind in our conversation about this does not mean it is not a real medical workplace health and safety issue; it is.</p></speech>

It is hard for me to understand a couple of those points.  No more than Deputy O'Reilly's points, will the witnesses give a broader sense of the supports that are available?

"Surely there has to be more" is the human response to Ms Plunkett's story.  Surely there has to be more, but the reality is there is not or she would not be with us here today.  You would have an expectation of what should be a proper standard of dignity, respect and protection in the workplace for this kind of material, but sadly that is all there is, which is the reality.</p></speech>

I thank them for what they have said and for the work they are doing.  I wonder what these social media platforms would be like if this work was not going on.  None of us can even imagine the kind of content the moderators have to look at.  Reference was made to post-traumatic stress disorder.  During the First World War this was not recognised and people were shot because they had it and were determined as cowards.  From what I can see and from what I know about this, post-traumatic stress disorder in cases of content moderators is very real.  It must be dealt with and treated properly.</p> <p>  I will not go over what Deputy O'Reilly, Senator Crowe and others have already asked.  Will the witnesses clarify if the pandemic has made things worse?  We have heard that violence, domestic violence, and other forms of aggression have increased during the pandemic because people have been at home.  Has this actually increased the awfulness, for want of a better word, of the content that moderators are looking at?  Has anything been done to help with that?</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoken about the issue of non-disclosure.  Will they tell us about working from home?  Are moderators allowed to work from home or is this work deemed an essential service?  If that is the case, does it make a difference if they are working from home?</p> <p>  I agree we should certainly invite the companies in as soon as possible.  This is to be fair and to learn more about this.  The issue is relatively new.  When many of us here were children, social media did not exist and I would argue many people do not know about content moderation.  In some ways it is a hidden employment, while being essential.  We must consider what kind of society we are living in when the kind of stuff that is put up on social media is so awful that it causes post-traumatic stress disorder among the people who are charged with taking it down.  There is a bigger question here about what kind of society we have.</p> <p>  I have heard of algorithms that are used to pick out certain issues and feed them to a certain kind of moderator, but I do not fully understand that.  Perhaps the witnesses will tell us about it.</p> <p>  Are there legal actions before the courts at the moment on any of this?  Are there legal actions on behalf of content moderators that are before the courts in Ireland or in any other jurisdictions, but especially in Ireland, in respect of this activity that is going on?</p></speech>

A few former content moderators who have contracted post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of their work have brought personal injury claims in the High Court.  Those are individual claims because Ireland does not have any class action proceedings.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the precise figure, but it may be about 30 cases.  This is a systemic problem, and it should not be.  Prevention is of course much better than waiting until people's entire lives have gone off the rails and they are unable to relate to their family members or seek other gainful employment because this job has essentially scarred them.  We would like to see much better preventative psychiatric measures in place that would stop people getting ill.  That is what must happen as opposed to relying on after-the-fact interventions and burdening the court system with sweeping up the pieces.  Such a situation is not ideal for anyone.  There are some existing cases, however.</p></speech>

I just wanted to clarify that issue.  As the Chair said, we must be careful about what we say if cases are before the courts.  I asked several other questions about the pandemic and whether its impact had made the situation worse.  Perhaps Ms Plunkett or Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in might be able to comment on that aspect.  I refer to the working from home situation and what is involved in that regard.</p> <p>  We can talk about psychiatric help, but from what has been said and what I have been reading about this issue, it strikes me that some of the content is so awful and shocking that I wonder whether people could be damaged so much by seeing this material in the first place that no amount of psychiatric help could assist.  Ms Plunkett said that people experience nightmares and it is impossible to get the content viewed out of their heads and that it is impossible to forget having seen something so awful and terrible.</p> <p>  This issue, therefore, comes back to the society we live in, how awful it is and whether anyone should be looking at this stuff.  However, is there another way of dealing with it?  Someone has to look at the content to judge it and then take it down, otherwise the whole system would collapse.  It is a very serious, deep and, as Ms Crider said, systemic issue right across society.  Prevention is better, but how would it be possible to prevent people from seeing something that is so awful that even seeing such content even once might leave them scarred for life?  I thank the witnesses for being here and sharing their stories with us.  I ask them to comment on those questions.</p></speech>

I can step in here and answer a couple of those questions.  Regarding the pandemic and content, crises unfold around the world daily, many of which we do not see and are not covered by the media.  However, I think the situation is the same in the pandemic as before it.  We have awful content every day, and I cannot really differentiate between the time before the pandemic and now.</p> <p>  Turning to the algorithms, to address another part of the Deputy's question, part of my team is training a machine to be able to pick up a ticket that involves, for example, hate speech or bullying.  That will remove the human aspect from doing the job, and the algorithm should be able to do it itself, almost like artificial intelligence.  We are still a long way away from that in reality, and of course in the interim people will be needed to do this job and it is a difficult job to do.  </p> <p>  Moving on to working from home, we were allowed to work from home on Christmas Day only in 2019.  In 2020, we were told we were not allowed to do so.  No clear reason was given as to why that was.  We were again left in the dark.  The communication is not good at all.  Of course, we wonder about this aspect, because we see our counterparts in Facebook doing essentially the same job as us.  They are viewing the same content at home as we do in the office.  They are able to work from home, but we are not.  We have to risk going into work every day and putting everyone else at risk as well.  I spoke about my mother, and that alone caused huge anxiety about going to the office every day, returning home and then having that burden on my shoulders.  I do not know exactly what can be done about that.  I do not know why we are not allowed to work from home, while Facebook workers are allowed to do so.  However, I really hope the situation changes in the future.  I thank the Deputy again for his questions.</p></speech>

I assume the content to be seen on Christmas Day is not any lighter than on at any other time.  Therefore, if contract moderators are able to work from home on Christmas Day, Facebook's argument regarding not being able to work from home for the other 364 days of the year does not stack up.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Crider, Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in and Ms Plunkett, in particular, for their contributions.  It is incredibly tough to hear about their experiences.  Several of the questions I was going to ask have been asked.  The answers have given rise to more questions for Facebook and the service providers than for the witnesses.  It is important in that regard that we bring representatives from Facebook and the service providers before the committee to be accountable for the decisions made by those companies.  </p> <p>  I do a good deal of work on mental health and services for people in communities, and I cannot think of anyone I dealt with who would have to deal with challenges from a mental health perspective more than Ms Plunkett would regarding the content she must see.  Services are available for doctors, nurses and garda&iacute; to enable them to cope with the traumatic situations they have to deal with, not necessarily daily but certainly regularly.  Ms Plunkett, however, knows she has to deal with such situations daily.  I do not know how she does it, to be perfectly honest.  I commend her on what she is doing.  It is phenomenal.</p> <p>  The advice that seems to be coming from Facebook in respect of not speaking to family members and not reaching out to support groups flies in the face of the view of how to cope with mental health challenges, which is all about opening up, speaking out and sharing experiences, pressures and problems.  Facebook must be accountable regarding the advice it is giving, because it goes against all the advice that anyone working in the area of mental health would give to someone who must deal with the kinds of pressures Ms Plunkett faces.</p> <p>  I will not ask the same questions as those that have been asked and answered already.  On staffing levels, however, what is the timeframe for most people who last in the job?  What is the turnover of staff like?  I ask the question especially because it seems to be a profession where no support is forthcoming from the employer and, therefore, one that is very difficult to stay in for a long time.  I sense that the only reason someone would stay in this job for a long time is for financial or personal reasons.  That is the option as they see it from a personal perspective, however, that is probably not good from a long-term mental health perspective.  I ask Ms Plunkett to comment on that aspect.</p> <p>  In addition, regarding reaching out and trying to talk to people, do moderators speak to each other about the pressures they are under and the content they must deal with?  Wellness coaches are good, and I am sure there are fine people in those roles, but that is a general chit-chat.  It is not a constant review weekly of how moderators are coping with the challenges they face.  If organisations and companies were taking this issue seriously, it should be addressed and dealt with specifically once every five days.  I have gone on for a little bit, but I feel there is an accountability issue here.  I would like to hear Ms Plunkett's view on the turnover of staff, the pressures they are under and how long people can last in such an environment when the requisite supports are clearly not in place.  </p></speech>

Starting with turnover, it is quite high now and has been throughout the pandemic.  A new employer in Ireland, a tech giant, has taken on many of these staff because it has better conditions and pay.  Equally, the contract is directly with the company concerned and not with an outsourced contractor, as ours are.  People obviously see that as a huge benefit.  To put an average on the time people remain in the job, I would say two years, maximum.  For want of a better term, you would be burnt out by then.  I came into this job, as I said in my opening statement, with positive expectations in respect of joining a big tech company and the career progression that might be possible.  It was all of those positive aspects.  Our job as content moderators is also very fulfilling, in a sense, because we are keeping the platform user friendly.  I am sure many of the committee members have kids and other family members who are on Facebook, and there is content there that people should not see.  It should not be seen by me, by kids or by anyone, even by the older generation.  It is challenging.</p><p> I will give the committee an example of what we do.  For the moment there are three people on my team in the office.  I think there are ten on my team in total.  The rest are working from home due to personal issues, perhaps because they are at high risk themselves.  The difference between working from home and working in the office is that they cannot do the sensitive queues from home.  This burdens the three of us in the office who are doing all the queues including the graphic violence, suicide and child exploitation queues.  We are not necessarily picking up the slack but we are doing the harder tickets because nobody else can do them because there is nobody to actually do them.  Of course that puts more pressure on me.  I am speaking on behalf of my team-mates in work as well, and I am sure there are other people in the office in the same situation.</p><p> On mental health, I totally agree with Senator Ahearn.  Then again, it was very hard for me to speak about my own mental health.  I struggle to speak about it with my own family and friends so of course to come before the committee and say this was a big thing for me.  You know yourself, a person might not feel comfortable talking to his or her colleagues about their mental health and would feel more comfortable with a friendly face, a mother, father, sibling or close friends.  Not having the ability to do that is horrible.  One feels limited, one feels alone in a sense.  I do not have any better words for it really, it is just very upsetting and I hope for some kind of change not just for me but for all my colleagues.</p></speech>

Their time is up.  Senator Garvey is next.  She has seven minutes.</p></speech>

Well done to Ms Plunkett.  She is a brave woman.  I am so glad Foxglove is involved as well.  I had a meeting with the organisation before.  I have been engaged with this issue since January when other employees reached out to me.  I had a meeting with Foxglove and then engaged with Facebook.  I have a few questions and perhaps the witnesses will bear with me.</p> <p>  On paper, Ms Plunkett is employed by this other company, we might call it a middleman or buffer zone.  Is any pressure put on this other company, by Foxglove or anybody else, to look at it being responsible for the employees' welfare?  It is easy for Facebook to say it is not responsible because it does not employ them directly.  Is there a way of putting pressure on the other company to see what it is doing, taking things at face value?  It seems the other company is the one protecting the big giant.  It is kind of the buffer zone so the first step would be to look at it and what it is doing to protect its employees.</p> <p>  In my correspondence with Facebook, it made a clear distinction about working from home and not being allowed to work from home as a moderator, which was the initial problem brought to me in January.  Facebook said there are certain categories of content review work which should only be carried out by reviewers in the office.  According to Facebook, these include some of the most critical and highly sensitive work streams, including child safety and things like that.  Facebook, therefore, sees a distinction.  This being the case, it must be asked of Facebook what it is doing to give extra protections and training to the moderators who must deal with that, because Facebook sees it as a distinction in the moderators.  It is saying it lets some work from home but the ones who work with this content cannot work from home, so it obviously sees a distinction.  If Facebook does so, where then is the distinction in the supports these moderators need and get?  I have it here in writing from Facebook that it sees a distinction.  What then is it doing about that?  It is something interesting to look that.</p> <p>  I think that was it.  I thank the witnesses and hope we can finally get to this.  It has been going on for quite a long time now and I really value Foxglove being involved.  Ms Crider mentioned there were cases pending.  Were any of them in Ireland?</p> <p>  A final query.  When Ms Plunkett took the job, was she given any particular training on how to deal with moderating darker content or is every moderator given the same training?  I ask because Facebook obviously distinguishes between them in the answer I got from it.</p></speech>

On the training, we all do the same onboarding.  It does not matter what team a person is going to, everyone does the set procedure.  Everything is just written down on a PowerPoint.  It basically says it is confidential information and we cannot share it.  Again, this includes not being able to speak to family and friends about issues we see in work and things like that.  In short, there is no distinct training, it is just standard.  It is the same for everybody.  There is no special treatment, different procedures for different teams or anything like that.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#F00500"><p>I might take some of the Senator's other questions.  First, on the number of cases, all of the cases I mentioned are Irish.</p> <p>  As to whether Foxglove is engaging both with Facebook and with the outsourcing firms, the answer is that we absolutely are.  For example, in the run-up to the meeting with the T&aacute;naiste in January we wrote to both of them about this question of secrecy.</p> <p>  On the mental health services, it seems to us that Facebook has set up this entire system of work and is really calling the shots.  For example, the software Ms Plunkett and her colleagues use does not vary from company to company.  Facebook designs the software.  The production targets are set by Facebook.  Even the requirements of counselling that are in the contract with the outsourcing firm are ultimately driven by Facebook.  There absolutely needs to be proper medical care and psychiatric support but that is actually not what the terms of the relationship between the outsourcing firms and Facebook currently require.  A Facebook employee with a considerably lesser level of exposure to toxic content could get PTSD, by the way.  I have spoken to Facebook employees who have developed PTSD with comparatively lesser levels of exposure.  Those people can still have sessions with a psychiatrist in a way that Isabella and her colleagues really struggle to access because it just is not a part of this system.</p> <p>  On the question of working from home, it sounds as if essentially the same response was given to the Senator as was given to the T&aacute;naiste - which I have only been able to review as of 7 p.m. last night - that is, Facebook says the really really bad stuff cannot be worked on from home.  I would welcome some clarification from Ms Plunkett about this but I am not sure that was the case when the moderators were doing the work at home over Christmas.  I am also not sure, from what I can see of Facebook's reply, whether the quality assurance people who are staffers - who check not all tickets but a selection, as part of their job - are not still seeing some of that content themselves.  I would not have said there is a perfect firewall, whereby all graphic violence and other really objectionable content is only dealt with in the office.  Putting that issue aside for a minute, the question we posed was not that no-one can ever come into the office.  We were saying there must be proper protections for people who come in.  If they are important and vital enough to the safe functioning of the platform they must take the risk of coming into the office when myself and many others are working in the comfort and safety of home, then why are they not staff?  That is the question.  There is a practical and moral question that should be looked at from a regulatory standpoint.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#F00600"><p>The question I was posing is that if Facebook clearly distinguishes the need to separate moderators between home and work, based on the level of darkness of the content, why is there no distinction in the training and supports?  If Facebook can see it, where is the backup for the moderators?  It is also interesting that Ms Plunkett has flagged that lots of people are leaving because another tech company has managed to do a much better job of employing people.  So there is obviously precedent there of another tech giant doing it better.  It is an interesting one to hold up to Facebook.</p></speech>

Time is really up on this question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#F00800"><p>On the Senator's question about the different content and working from home or the office, the company can alter this, it can change this through the system.  If a person is working from home, he or she is doing queues like bullying, harassment and hate speech.  They would be the lower-tier queues, priority-wise.  If a person is in the office he or she will be doing queues such as graphic violence, suicide and self-injury and child exploitation.  Through the pandemic, although we were working from home, for I believe six months there were people who were asked to do these high priority queues.  Again, as I mentioned in my statement, they were meant to be doing, for example, a child exploitation queue for a maximum of two hours a day but were actually doing it for the whole eight-hour day.  They needed to tell their team leader, TL, that they had done their two hours and that the TL needed to take them off that queue; it was not proactively looked at, with their TL going to them and saying they had done their time, that they should step off it now and go back to their standard queue.  That is just an example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00100"><p>I thank the three witnesses for the work they are doing and, in particular, Ms Plunkett for speaking out, which takes a lot of courage.  The benefit is one of shining a light on the treatment of this invisible army of essential workers, who are undervalued and are part of a two-tier workforce.  Ms Plunkett mentioned some of her workmates being scared or intimidated about speaking out about the conditions they faced.  Could she elaborate on that?  What are they worried about?  Why would they be worried about speaking out at an event like this or to a union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Many people have the fear instilled in them from within the company.  They have to sign an NDA, which is then taken away from them.  I would not be able to remember exactly what was in a document from two years ago.  Obviously, I do not want to cross a line and cause trouble either.  I want to do my job and get on with it but if I am not given a document that I can reference and stay within the boundaries of, then it is easier to instil that fear.  However, many people have families and kids and bills to pay.  People are intimidated and do not want to say anything in case they have to go through a disciplinary procedure and potentially lose their jobs.  There have been examples of that happening.  We have an internal workplace platform, like a Facebook for us.  When people were leaving the company in the middle of the pandemic last year, they were writing their goodbyes on that platform.  They were complaining about the treatment, what was going on and how they felt unsafe.  Many other people in situations like mine live with someone at high risk and were worried or concerned and these worries and concerns were not being taken into account.  It was clear that it was being censored because people's comments were being deleted, accounts were being disabled and people were put on disciplinary action and we never knew why.  Of course that makes people fearful because they see this action being taken by the company and wonder why.  Why do I not have the right to speak about such matters?  Why can I not stand up for what is right and what is fair?  I am a very fair person.  I believe fair is fair and I do not agree with what is happening but it took me a long time to come to this decision and agree with the Foxglove team to take part in this.  I had such a feeling that I needed to do it and needed to speak out for the people who are too afraid or feel they have too many responsibilities and cannot afford to take any risks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00300"><p>I thank Ms Plunkett for doing that.  How did she feel when she experienced that culture of secrecy and fear, contrasted with the kind of self-image Facebook has as a progressive, socially responsible corporation, with the slogans in the office and so on?  Is it fair to say Facebook is a hypocrite in how it treats its own workforce?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isabella Plunkett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00400"><p>I would tend to agree.  How can a company put a slogan up on its wall or say one of its pillars is "be brave" when none of its staff feel they can be brave or have the safety to speak?  It is horrible because this should not happen in any company.  People should be able to speak freely.  There is a big difference between crossing a line and actually speaking for what is right.  I did not come here today to cross that line; I came to be fair and speak about what is right.</p> <p>  The communication has always been really bad and that is part of the problem as well.  Everyone just wants simple communication about why these things have been going on, why we were brought back to the office and why we could not stay working from home like our counterparts at Facebook.  Again, we got no answer.  We asked the company to define how we fit into the essential worker category and we got no answer for six months.  The question was sent to HR and we heard nothing.  It could have been even longer than six months.  That is a clear example of how long we were waiting for a tiny bit of communication.  It is not good in the slightest. </p></speech>

How did that go from her perspective?  What commitments were given?  I ask her to reflect on the response she got from him last night.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00600"><p>I am very happy to do so.  In January, Foxglove and two content moderators who are not here today, Ibrahim Halawa and Paria Moshfeghi, met with the T&aacute;naiste and raised many of the same conditions and issues the committee is here to discuss today.  We raised the problems that arise both for Facebook's millions of users and for workers with the outsourcing model.  We raised the fact that workers are not permitted to retain their NDAs, we raised questions about mental health support and we also raised the matter of Covid safety.</p> <p>  On the Covid safety issues, we were directed to the HSA.  We sought to engage with the HSA and wrote letters asking if the authority was interested in speaking to witnesses and gathering testimony from people about the live Covid cases that have happened on the floor since the reopening.  We never received a reply from the HSA at any point, although I am given to understand that it later made contact with the outsourcing firm and it basically said everything was kosher and copacetic, which is perplexing given the extremely narrow and limited scope of its investigation into Covid safety and the fact that it did not talk to lots of relevant witnesses.  That is what it is.</p> <p>  We do not have a copy of the letter the T&aacute;naiste sent to Facebook.  What we have instead, as I understand it, is Facebook's reply to him and a covering note, which we received at 7 o'clock last night.  There are quotes in it from what the T&aacute;naiste said but I do not have the full thing that was ultimately set out so I do not know.  It seems there was a question about remote working and the engagement on that was the same as mentioned in the discussion with Senator Garvey, wherein Facebook said there are different kinds of content and that explains why the company was pulling people in.  It did not engage at all with the question of outsourcing and there was no indication in the covering note as to whether the T&aacute;naiste intends to take it up further.  Facebook basically said to take it up with the HSA as this is its problem.</p> <p>  Regarding mental health support, Facebook responded by saying its partners have to give access to on-site counselling.  It is essentially just reiterating the wellness coach provision but, as the committee has heard, those people are not doctors.  Facebook has refused to engage with the point that a cup of tea and a chat, as one member referred to it, is not enough.  This is a medical issue.  Facebook does not engage with that point and I am not clear from the tenor of the T&aacute;naiste's response to us, attached in a covering note, whether he intends to take that up.</p> <p>  It is the same with the issue of the NDAs.  I will not go over again the endless chase we have engaged in, running around the houses to try to get everybody to give us the documentation, but suffice it to say we have asked in many ways and multiple times, including on solicitors' letterheads, for all relevant documents and they have not been disclosed.  There is a job to do here and we at Foxglove and the moderators need the members' help as regulators to hold these companies to account.  I thank the Deputy for his question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#G00700"><p>I sincerely thank Ms Plunkett, Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in and Ms Crider.  Ms Plunkett's testimony was extremely powerful and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to her for telling her story, as well as to the CWU and Foxglove for working with her and the other workers and bringing us to where we are today, which is allowing this story to be told.  I thank them for all the work they have done with the other workers because it would be much easier not to do it.  Another member referred to hidden employment and Ms Plunkett's job is very much away from the public eye.  We enjoy a safer Facebook because of the work she does but she is coming here today at a potential personal cost to her and her work.</p><p>I thank her for that.  To think she is a number of weeks on antidepressants and still working is just mind-blowing and a reflection of the work that must be undertaken.</p><p> Thinking about the outcomes from this meeting, we, as legislators, cannot have a situation where in five or ten years we look back and say that we did nothing about regulating this work, particularly as Ireland is a global and EU headquarters for so many major social media platforms.  There must be very clear actions that we undertake as a committee arising from the testimony today.</p><p> I have four questions about this.  A number of members asked about the working environment.  I would like to hear more about the pay because we know it is a fraction of that earned by Facebook's direct employees.  I am not talking about the specific pay of the witnesses but rather the average pay of these workers.  There is also the question of qualifications that individuals may have coming into the role.</p><p> The second question may be for Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in and Ms Crider.  It seems these NDAs and the taking back of those agreements after they are signed is a breach of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994, which entitles any employee to be able to access his or her contract of employment.  From what I understand of the NDA, it is effectively part of the contract of employment.  Do the witnesses believe this is a breach of the legislation?</p><p> The next questions relate to regulation.  I would like to know what is the position with TikTok, YouTube and other social media companies.  How do they handle the content moderation in those companies, as Facebook is not the only social media platform having to deal with toxic, vile or challenging content?  In terms of regulation and health and safety legislation in particular, what do we need to put on the Statute Book to ensure content moderation is brought in-house as a hazardous activity rather than being outsourced?  I am throwing out all the questions but it is because I have very limited time.  Ms Plunkett can start before we go to Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in and Ms Crider.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate what everybody has said.  I can give some averages for the pay.  For the job I do, a person starts on approximately &euro;27,000 per year, with &euro;1,000 of a pay rise after a year when an 11-month probation period has passed.  I am not 100% sure of what a Facebook worker earns but I believe it is approximately &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000.</p></speech>

The question is whether NDAs form parts of the contract of employment.  If they do, the workers should be entitled to a copy of any document as it relates to their employment.  Beyond whether that legislation applies, in general, workers should have access to any documents that have an impact on their ability to interact with their employers and, in particular, in terms of interaction for raising internal or external grievances such as through the Workplace Relations Commission.  If a worker decided that he or she wanted to take an individual case through the mechanisms of the State but felt this document prohibited him or her from doing it, that is crucial to taking into account how those NDAs affect the contracts of employment.  I might have to defer to Ms Crider on whether this breaches the legislation mentioned by the Senator.</p></speech>

It is an interesting idea into which we will now look urgently.  God knows the subject access requests do not come back in a full way.  It seems obvious from a common sense way that a company should not be able to hold people to agreements they are not given copies of in a systematic way.  There is a wider cultural issue of how often this is repeated with periodic retraining or refreshers, with constant messages from management.  It is almost Pavlovian conditioning about this question of secrecy.</p> <p>  The Senator had other questions about TikTok and YouTube.  TikTok is the company that Ms Plunkett was referring to when she said people were leaving in droves to work for it because it is offering direct employment contracts.  A newer kind of upstart social media firm has decided to employ people directly.</p> <p>  Everybody knows YouTube is one of Google's companies and it operates the same outsourcing model as Facebook.  The outsourcing companies in Ireland do similar work for YouTube and the Senator is exactly right in that this raises the same questions relating to exposure to toxic content and precarity that Facebook puts people through.  It is another matter calling out for a regulatory response because we want a consistent standard to be applied across all these platforms that really are the public square these days.</p> <p>  This relates to the Senator's final question, which is how to regulate this appropriately and what needs to be put in the Statute Book.  With humility, I again say I am not a legislative draftsperson.  It seems, nonetheless, that this is an appropriate subject of health and safety regulation and questions such as limits on toxic content are appropriate to regulator.</p> <p>  There is also the question of outsourcing a core business function.  One does not need a particular ideological position about the wisdom or lack of wisdom of outsourcing in general.  This is a special case and it is about outsourcing a business function that is core to the health of the public square.  Stepping back for a moment, we are now more than 15 years into this experiment with social media and light-touch or no regulation has failed.  It has hurt workers and led to a public square that is really pretty problematic in many ways.  It ought to be regulated just like other forms of mass communication, such as broadcasting, both for workers and the health of the public square.</p></speech>

I find myself reflecting on what Mr. David Thompson said in asking what kind of society or world we are developing.  Some of what has been described is quite harrowing and all of us are exposed to it on different platforms at different times.  Service companies are being used to insulate Facebook and others from the full responsibility of the effects of the employment, which must be legally addressed.</p> <p>  I know it has been mentioned but I cannot understand how copies of NDAs are not being given to people.  If I sign a legal document that will bind me in future, I want to know what I have signed and I want a copy of it.  I cannot understand how NDAs have been skirted in a legal fashion.  I do not understand how that was achieved, although I understand that people must accept it as a term of employment.  I just do not know how it can stand.</p> <p>  What activity is Facebook doing to profile challenging contributors?  I refer specifically to the blacklisting of IP addresses and trying to target people who are generating content, which may be inside but is probably outside the EU.</p> <p>  I have no doubt the question of post-traumatic stress disorder is very real.  I have often been shocked by what I have seen online.  It seems benign compared with some of what has been mentioned here.</p><p>It is obvious that the moderation is supporting the platforms.  As has been pointed out, if it was not moderated it probably could not work.  This is part of the problem, that Facebook has a way out using moderators.  Is there anything the employees can do as a group to put pressure on Facebook?  As a parent, if I felt there was not proper moderation going on, I would not want my kids accessing Facebook.  That is obviously a much wider discussion globally for moderators.  I would welcome hearing any information they have about what Facebook is doing to try to identify and sanction those who are deliberately putting out more than challenging content that people should not see because it is very damaging for mental health and long-term well-being.</p></speech>

The work Ms Plunkett described is essentially Facebook's response.  Some stuff will be caught algorithmically such as spam or some kind of hate speech, but one of the things we observed over the course of the pandemic is that during the first wave when Ms Plunkett and her colleagues were sent home, there was apparently an experiment in much more automated content moderation.  They turned the knob up to 11, as it were, and tried to see what would happen if the algorithm as they have it was allowed to catch more content in order, as I understand it, to stop moderators working from home having to see so much graphic stuff while they were at home.  That experiment appears to have failed.  There was some good investigative reporting about it last year that showed, for example, that self-harm content stayed up and was not caught by the algorithm and that other problematic content stayed up as the algorithm just could not catch it but pretty anodyne stuff that should have stayed on the platform came down.  It shows that we are a very long way from this job going away.  It is absolutely essential if we are going to have a contemporary public square then what Ms Plunkett does has to be a part of it, but as we said, at the moment, the work is treated as disposable.  I would like to hear from Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in and Ms Plunkett on the question of what people can do by coming together because we have been trying to support people to come together but the obstacles are considerable.</p></speech>

In terms of what the workers can do collectively, we need to recognise that, as has been mentioned a couple of times by contributors, this is a new form of work in Ireland and globally, but some of the work that the moderators are doing models regular call centre work on an office-based model.  In terms of it being a new form of work, there are workers out there, in particular in the United States, who have come together collectively and formed a trade union and they have gone up against the global tech giants and made considerable gains for themselves and their colleagues.  They have given each other the strength to come out collectively and raise those issues that affect them, not always directly in the context of their terms and conditions but in many cases in the United States they are raising issues of ethics around how platforms are being used and what contracts the employers are signing with various bodies.  In my humble opinion, it is through coming together collectively as workers in the trade union that they can exercise their collective power.  Fundamentally, what many contributors have identified is that there are no social media platforms without content moderators.  They are the power behind these social media platforms.  Without them, we do not have a safe public square and these companies do not have a product.  Once content moderators come to realise the strength of their collective power, that is when they are going to start to see and achieve real improvements in their lives and their terms and conditions.  I would welcome Ms Plunkett's thoughts.</p></speech>

From my perspective as a representative and a content moderator, we have collectively come together and we have talked about it.  We are denied the right of a union, as the company does not recognise the union at all.  We cannot do anything about that, but it is one objective I am here to fight for today.  I am also here to bring up the fact that, as much as we try to communicate with the company, we are always given false hope.  We had a lot of meetings last year with HR and there were at least 300 attendees at some of those meetings.  HR might look at a pay rise, for example, sometime in the first quarter but we heard nothing about it.  There was no further communication on it.  That is an example of the false hope we are given.  That is why we are here today before the committee to raise this issue and to make it a bit more public.  We are hidden.  We are the silent workers and we want to be treated equally like everyone else.</p></speech>

I just cannot imagine how horrific it must be.  Could Senator Garvey please mute her microphone please?  What is happening here is absolutely appalling.  This is the dark underbelly of our shiny multinational social media companies.  As someone who used to organise workers for a living, I would like to hear from Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in.  We have heard about a climate of fear.  Let us think about the work these people do.  It is the most horrific work that ensures we do not have to see it.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned that we all see it, but clearly we do not see most of the worst of it, only thanks to Ms Plunkett and her colleagues.  It is quite clear to me from today's hearings that Facebook could not operate without these people, their work is so fundamental, and yet these people are denied the right to join a union.  They are denied basic rights of work.  I read in Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in's submission prior to this hearing that a couple of content moderators were contacted by the agency to reinforce its requirements on secrecy.  What is happening here is truly Orwellian.  It is that frightening.  Could Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in expand on that challenge and the outlook of secrecy?</p> <p>  I want to ask Ms Plunkett what the mood is like among her colleagues.  Presumably she is here today because she wants to see change and to give hope.  She contacted the T&aacute;naiste.  He has spoken out about how crucial the work is, but we need to see action.  As we come to the end of the meeting, I would like to understand what the specific asks are from Ms Crider of the Government, what it is that it needs to do now to take action for these workers because this has gone on for far too long.  You have my commitment, Chair, to bring the employers in, because I want to know, not just as a trade unionist, but as a father and a citizen how on earth Facebook can stand over the outsourcing of these jobs.  From what I can see, it is just for reasons of cost and liability.  I will leave it at that because I am conscious of leaving time for the answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#J01000"><p>I will take the question.  It is important for all content moderators and all workers in Ireland to understand that whether their employer chooses to recognise a trade union, they have a right to join a trade union.  That is enshrined in the Constitution whether their employer likes it or not.  They have the right to be individually represented by the trade union and to seek advice and guidance from it.  However, as was correctly stated, because of our voluntarist system, the employer is not required to engage.  I know that discussions taking place in Europe at the moment are looking to address the voluntarist system.  I see Deputy O'Reilly has joined us again.  Members who are trade union organisers themselves understand that the bread and butter of organising workers is meeting them, sitting down with them and getting them to tell their stories, listening to them and understanding what their issues are so that the organiser can empower them to address those issues and lift them up in their workplace as a collective.  If organisers cannot get content moderators to meet with them or speak to them because they are so afraid of the consequences of being caught then that highlights the difficulty of organising what are clearly some of the most unprotected workers currently in Ireland.</p><p>It has felt nearly insurmountable sometimes as a trade union when we meet a couple of workers.  It speaks to a question one of the other contributors asked earlier in terms of the length of service and attrition.  By the time we get somebody to trust us so that he or she can speak to us in a confidential manner and will not be exposed, the damage that has been done to that person means he or she can no longer stay in that employment, and that person is gone and we start all over again.</p><p> It is, therefore, enormously challenging.  It would be nice to go back to the old days of the old telecoms and logistics companies where there is a tradition of respecting the workers' collective voice.  As I mentioned earlier, however, this is a new form of work and these are global giants, which I believe requires a legislative response.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I want to emphasise that no matter how important the mental health supports are, and they are clearly absolutely crucial, this issue will not be resolved unless these workers are made direct employees to recognise the core work they do and are given rights as members of trade unions.</p> <p>  I want to hear from both Ms Plunkett and Ms Crider before I finish up, please.</p></speech>

I can quickly jump in and answer that.  We need action.  The reason I am here today and why I have plucked up the courage to speak out about this is that the morale is dreadful, as the Senator can imagine.  I do not think they are really doing anything positive to change or even give us some kind of hope that there will be change.  People come to me and say there will be no change and that I am mad.  That is a terrible attitude to have because at the end of the day, if one is not going to have a positive mindset from the very beginning then nothing good is ever going to happen.  If one is going to have a negative mindset then, of course, one is going to wallow in the negative.  I firmly believe that action will be taken and I firmly hope for better days ahead.</p></speech>

In terms of our recommendations, it seems that it would be appropriate to have a legislative requirement for social media platforms over a certain size.  One can set a threshold so that some blog with 15 posters obviously does not have to go through this.  We are, however, talking about some of the world's largest companies here, for example, the Google, YouTube and Facebooks of the world, which would have to in-house core content moderation staff.  That is one issue.</p> <p>  Another issue is the health and safety point.  There should be a requirement for psychiatric support as a basic workplace safety protection, and not simply wellness coaches who tell people to do deep breathing and yoga to deal with the medical risk of having to be exposed to this content.</p> <p>  Then, I believe we must do something, in a regulatory sense, about this culture of secrecy.  I do not know whether it is possible for the committee, for example, to write to all of the companies and ask them formally to clarify or disclose to the committee what they say about secrecy, or to clarify that, in fact, the workers have the right to raise legitimate workplace grievances.  We would welcome any action the committee could take in helping us in that respect.  Ms Plunkett has done much here in cracking that wall of secrecy and climate of fear, but actually, it is the companies that have to go on record and admit that Ms Plunkett and her colleagues have the perfect right to raise these legitimate workplace issues.</p></speech>

First of all, my apologies.  I was in the D&aacute;il speaking about mental health and health issues, so I missed Ms Plunkett's presentation, which I will certainly play back.  A few questions struck me while listening to the debate.  Is this a worldwide model that these platforms apply?  Are there better practices in other countries from which we should be learning?</p> <p>  I was disturbed to hear that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, which is an enforcement agency, had not taken some complaints seriously.  We should probably hear from the HSA so it can account for that.  I would like to understand a little bit more clearly what the defects were in that enforcement.  It would be a serious matter because the HSA is an independent body.  From listening to some of the contributions, it seems to me that there may be breaches of health and safety legislation without any new legislation.  I am not an expert in this field, however.</p> <p>  Has the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, addressed any of these issues?  I know cases are pending, which are obviously at the very serious end of damage.  In terms of the WRC responding to this concern, have there been any cases or are there evolving codes of practice that we might seek to accelerate?</p> <p>  I was involved in the preparation of legislation on online safety from the perspective of the user as opposed to the platform.  One of the things we proposed, however, was that there would be a digital safety commissioner who would oversee codes of practice so that one would be obliged to have those codes of practice meet certain expectations and principles and so forth.  Is that a potential route to go along?  That legislation is comparatively advanced, although it is not published.  Would that be a potential vehicle for meeting some of Ms Plunkett's concerns?</p></speech>

Definitely.  I do not know how or in which way this will be approached but I believe there needs to be some form of legislation.  The way I feel is that a person just does what he or she is told and cannot speak or is unable to say how he or she feels or anything like that.  I believe some kind of concrete legislation is needed so that content moderators, who would not be able to speak today or have the confidence to do so , can at least refer to that.  It would be in writing so, of course, that would always be helpful.  I thank the Deputy again.  I hope that answers his question on my behalf.</p></speech>

Generally, the larger companies, such as Facebook, Google and YouTube, employ the same model and, in fact, regularly use the same outsourcing companies.  In Ireland, there are a handful of outsourcing companies that work interchangeably for this grouping of social media companies.</p> <p>  Although it is the global norm, however, new and emerging tech giants are coming out and directly employing, as was mentioned earlier.  I am not sure if the Deputy was with us at the time.  TikTok, for example, is directly employing people and scooping up content moderators in their droves for the very fact that it recognises them as direct employees and treats them as such.</p></speech>

I do not have its legislation in front of me but I would have thought some of the things we are hearing about sound very close to legal breaches.  Ms Crider expressed the concern that the HSA had not responded or listened to people who should have been heard.  That sounds serious to me.  To clarify, what is the status of that investigation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#K01000"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I am very happy to clarify.  It is important to explain to the best of my understanding what the investigation did and did not cover.  My understanding is basically that just as we were about to meet with the T&aacute;naiste in January, somebody asked the HSA whether it was looking into the question of Covid safety at the outsourcing offices.  It was, therefore, only looking at the question of Covid safety, compliance with Ireland's Covid safety protocols and whether people should be working from home.  It did not address any of what we believe are workplace safety issues around mental health.  None of that was within scope.</p> <p>  Nonetheless, we engaged with the process and said that we had a bunch of people.  We basically just wrote to the entity and said that we had a number of people who were willing to engage.  We did not hear anything back about the investigation into Covid.  I could not honestly say to the Deputy what the HSA did other than that it apparently looked into it and said that from a Covid standpoint, what was happening in the office was, to its mind, acceptable.  That does not really answer the question about who should have to come in and who should be allowed to work from home.  I suppose it is more to do with spacing and ventilation.</p><p>We were concerned that there did not seem to be an interest in speaking to people who had something to say, even about those issues that were squarely within its remit and what it said it was investigating.  We are happy to send the committee the letter we sent to them, if it would be useful for its records and for it to see what we offered.  Basically, we did not hear anything back.</p></speech>

Apart from the Covid issues which may be all that it looked at, it seems to me there are wider issues here that it should be investigating.  Those questions are not for the witnesses here today, but for the HSA.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

I understand a case was settled in the United States for $52 million  Was that case heard in court, with a court adjudication or was it settled outside of court?  I understand that during those proceedings Facebook acknowledged that damage was being caused to the workers.  I am not sure whether the workers were directly employed by Facebook or outsourced.  I am interested to hear more about that case.  I know we do not have the type of class action in Ireland that was mentioned earlier, but I am interested in hearing more on the situation internationally.  Are any of the content moderators directly employed by Facebook?</p> <p>  The following question is for Ms Plunkett.  Is there a screening process for the job of content moderator?  It appears to me that not everybody would be suitable for this type of work.  As mentioned by Deputy Bruton, it is dangerous work and it damages people.  We need to be honest about that.  There should be some level of screening to ensure that a person is suitable for the type of work involved.  Does that happen and what training is provided?  Was Ms Plunkett told that the work could be damaging?  Is it possible that people are being asked to sign a disclaimer with respect to the damage that the work could cause?  Is it likely that people know it could cause them to suffer post-traumatic stress order, but they choose to do it anyway?  </p> <p>  I agree that this work is part of the critical infrastructure.  As stated by other members, Facebook and others cannot operate without the work of content moderators.  It is important work.  Is there ongoing research in this area?</p></speech>

For example, I said that content showing children suffering would bother me.  Nobody wants to see children suffering.  That would destroy me and, I think, many other people.  The response was that I could have to deal with such content and I was asked how I would handle it.  I gave my answer and that was it.  I was successful and I got the job.  If people knew at the outset that the work could impact on their mental health or cause post-traumatic stress disorder, I do not think they would apply for the job.  That would be a huge turn-off for a company, but, again, that is just my opinion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cori Crider" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051200002#L01000"><p>I thank Deputy Stanton for the question.  A class action was brought on behalf of content moderators from several American states where there are content moderation facilities, in which I was not involved.  That was settled out of court with Facebook paying $52 million dollars to settle for the whole class of thousands of workers, although all of the people in the class action were outsourced in exactly the way we have been discussing.  It amounted to $5,000 to $10,000 maximum, depending on the assessed level of PTSD per person who opted in to claim the settlement.  I hope it goes without saying, but serious clinical PTSD is difficult to treat.  It is not clear, particularly in the expensive American healthcare system, how far $5,000 to $10,000 will go.  My honest opinion is that it was a bargain basement settlement to avoid dealing with a systemic issue.  As I said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  We do not want to burden the courts system with these matters to sweep up in as best they can after the fact.  We want to, as best we can, stop people getting sick in the first instance.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, there are no direct employees at Facebook or Google doing this work, but there are people who are exposed to the content because the quality assurance, checking compliance with Facebook's rules and making sure that the outsourced moderators are getting it right, is done by staff.  There are staff who it has been estimated to me are exposed to ten to 12 hours per week of content.  In other words, only a fraction of their work is content review.  The people who are doing it in volume, in the way Ms Plunkett has described, are all outsourced. <br/><br/>There is ongoing research.  New York University published a report last year on who watches the social media giants, which we should have submitted as evidence, but we can send to the committee.  It calls explicitly for an end to outsourcing and states that this practice is core to the tech giants business, not just Facebook but others, and should be in-housed, and it is based on interviews with moderators internationally.  It also states that this is a growing problem that requires a regulatory response.  I would commend the NYU report to the committee.  An academic at University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA, Sarah Roberts, has written a book about this entitled <i>Behind the Screen</i>, which, again, is based on research with dozens of content moderators.  <br/><br/>As rightly pointed out, this is a global issue and a new form of work.  We are pleased that the committee has taken the initiative to investigate the work because it is not going away.</p></speech>

It has been a lengthy meeting.  I am sure the witnesses have other things to be doing.  This is a complete mess.  There is no point reiterating all that has been said.  We need to move towards action now.  I have two questions for the witnesses.  As they will be aware, the committee will be meeting representatives of Facebook.  I think we need to bring in the recruitment agencies as well.  They need to be stood up in front of us because they are doing the dirty work.  They are a protection for the big guys.  I do not think we should leavethem off the hook; they need to be brought in as well.  I would welcome clarity on whether it is proposed to do that or to only bring in Facebook.  Facebook can pawn off the issues to the others involved so we need them in the room too.  </p> <p>  Deputy Bruton made an interesting point regarding the Health and Safety Authority.  I acknowledge its work in regard to physical health and safety in terms of office space and so on.  What is its role around mental health and training and the treatment of staff with regard to mental health and safety?  If that is part of its role, it would be important to get its take on all of this.  </p></speech>

It is for the Legislature rather than us to say whether the HSA is equipped to do that.  Our experience did not build a huge amount of confidence.  I was interested in the idea raised previously regarding a pending regulation on online safety that it is, perhaps, not too late to amend to incorporate at least some of the issues that we are raising.  That sounds like a productive way forward.</p></speech>

I was able to keep an eye on what was going on.  I have a question on health and safety in respect of these roles.  This is a key issue we must focus on.  A culture of secrecy has clearly been outlined, and it is guarded by these non-disclosure agreements.  In many ways, however, it is not just that aspect; much more is going on that keeps this state of affairs secret and behind closed doors.  There are serious psychological implications for the workers doing this work.  My questions are probably mainly for Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in because they focus on human resource, HR, issues, but they are also for Ms Plunkett or Ms Crider, if they wish to contribute as well. </p><p> I am going to hazard a guess that risk assessments are not routinely carried out, given these workers are not screened before they start.  Therefore, is it possible to conduct risk assessments and to mitigate the risks that exist?  I ask that because this is dangerous work, but so is climbing up the side of a building.  In that case, however, we put in place measures to ensure that such workers are kept safe in their workplace.  Does Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in believe it is possible to legislate or to ensure regulations are put in place that will make this work safe?  In an ideal world, by the way, and no one will disagree with this, we would love if we did not need this work to be done and that everything on social media consisted of kittens on skateboards.  It does not, however, so we need some kind of robust way to deal with this situation.  Is it possible to conduct risk assessments?  I doubt if they are conducted, but I would be delighted if that was the case.  </p><p> Is there an analogous grade category?  Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in, and indeed Senator Gavan, will be familiar with this term.  There is such a category in the main employers, namely, Facebook and the other platforms.  However, is there any grade in the private or public sectors that Ms N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in would consider to be an analogous grade, one we could point to as having the correct supports in place?  My worry is that we will hear from the employers and others, and they will simply throw their hands up in the air and say this area just cannot be regulated because it is just awful and there is nothing we can do.  I believe, though, that we can do something and that we can make this workplace a safe one to work in and also one where workers are rewarded with decent pay and fair terms.  </p></speech>

Regarding the HSA, I share Ms Crider's perspective that I do not know if this area is within its remit currently.  If it is not, then it ought to be.  Mental health is a workplace health issue.  Turning to inspections, it is our position that any employment which puts the health and safety of workers at risk should be subject to regular inspections and regulation.  Forgive me, could the Deputy remind me of her second question?</p></speech>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other public bodies are required to deal with situations with traumatic content and are facilitated with the correct level of medical assistance.  Another example concerns operators of the 999 emergency line, who were previously outsourced and conducting the same work as those employed within the emergency ambulance and fire services.  Our union's position was that those directly employed workers were an analogous grade.  The 999 emergency line operators have now been taken back in-house and are dealing with 999 emergency calls as direct employees.  Therefore, I suggest those two instances could be considered analogous grades.</p></speech>

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. McGrath to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The UK's withdrawal from the European Union has presented challenges for both of our jurisdictions and we welcome the opportunity to work through those challenges.  Members will be aware that there are a range of views on the Committee for the Executive Office regarding the UK withdrawal and the associated Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol but we are united on the need to make the best of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p> <p>  The Committee for the Executive Office takes a strategic view of EU affairs in general and on the implications of the withdrawal in particular.  While the detail of the transition and adjustment lies with other statutory committees of the assembly, our committee scrutinises how the Department and the Executive engage with the issues at hand.  We have regular updates on EU matters from the junior Ministers of the Executive Office, we hear from the dedicated mechanism tasked with overseeing equality and human rights standards post-Brexit and we hear from officials on matters such as the EU funding programmes.</p> <p>  Intergovernmental relations are an important aspect of our scrutiny work.  How we engage, North and South, east and west and beyond, is more important than ever.  To that end, we have urged the Executive to be represented where decisions are being made and where negotiations are taking place, particularly on the various bodies associated with the withdrawal agreement and the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  The committee has also been making representation for the assembly to be represented on the parliamentary partnership assembly in order to be better connected with EU-related developments.  The changes that have come about have added considerable complexity to our work and it is only through partnership and interaction that we can negotiate a path through the challenges we face.  I look forward to the conversation today and I remind members of our committee that we are acting in our capacity as committee members.</p></speech>

This committee, no more than the Committee for the Executive Office, has been looking in some great detail at the outworking of the withdrawal agreement and, more particularly in recent times, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  An array of logistical and practical issues need to be outlined, sorted and addressed and there are structures within the agreement to do that.  I am optimistic that those structures can resolve most of the issues in question.</p> <p>  One of the things this committee has been most interested in is the interpersonal relations post Brexit and how we do not allow structures that existed in the past to diminish.  Northern Ireland institutions must maintain a presence in and link with European Union institutions, specifically because decisions made in the European institutions will continue to have an impact in Northern Ireland.  Is it envisaged that some of the suggestions made by Barry Andrews, MEP, would be implemented?  For example, he has suggested that there would be an enduring presence for a number of Northern Ireland institutions within the structures of the European Union.  Is the Committee for the Executive Office working on that, has it opened discussions on it and how does it see matters panning out?</p> <p>  There will be a requirement for a close North-South working relationship too.  The primary role up to now has been through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, both east-west and North-South.  Does the Committee for the Executive Office see BIPA continuing to be the main vehicle for that sort of interpersonal relationship and can we improve on it?</p></speech>

I will flesh out a few of the key issues.  One of the first things that jumped to mind is that we have explored the concept of the democratic deficit that is the result of the withdrawal agreement.  We will still have decisions taken that will impact us in the North but we have no way of having any democratic input into how those decisions are taken.  They will be taken at state level between the UK and the EU and therefore we will not have a say on how decisions that impact us are taken.  We are keen to make sure it is always front and centre that in the future there could be some form of democratic input from the North to be able to have some views on the decisions that will be taken that will impact us.  That is fairly basic in terms of democracy.  If people are taking decisions about one's daily life, one should be able, in a representative manner, to be included and be part of those decisions.  I know Ms Anderson would have articulated views on how that could have happened so I will let her mention those views when I pass to her.</p> <p>  Deputy Howlin also mentioned the logistical structures there are for the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  I was struck that our EU officer in the assembly, in trying to explain the outworkings of that for me, presented me with a spider diagram that was exceptionally complicated.   It had about 25 or 30 offshoots for various committees.  The Brexiteers used to bang the table and say there was far too much administration from Brussels and that things were too complicated.  Yet, what they have signed up to as a replacement is an exceptionally complex and complicated process.  From our perspective as an assembly, we need to be able to be fully aware of each of those various elements of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and exactly where we, as elected officials, can fit into that in order to be able to contribute.  As already stated, we are requesting that we would have some presence from our Executive and assembly on the structures that are being put in place.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned BIPA.  I am a member of BIPA and have been for a number of years.  I find that it is a worthwhile and appropriate way for people of different backgrounds to come together and share their thoughts and views on issues of the day.  I have been a member of BIPA since 2016 and Brexit has been one of the key issues that has been on the agenda on a regular basis.  We should focus on the fact that there are excellent interpersonal opportunities there.  However, I would think about the outcomes from BIPA because people can head away for a couple of days, accentuate their interpersonal relationships and get an opportunity to discuss issues but it is a question of what happens after that.  Are people bringing back what is being raised at BIPA to their various parliaments and assemblies so that there is some sort of follow-up?  The fear is that if the process is formalised too much, that will happen at the expense of the interpersonal aspect.  It is about getting the balance of that right.  BIPA presents a structure that includes all arts and parts that are involved in the decisions and the impacts of the decisions.  Therefore, we should take an opportunity to examine how we can enhance and formalise what takes place there in order to maximise what we can get from it.</p> <p>  I will pass to Ms Anderson MLA to talk about the representation side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051200002#B00400"><p>It is always great to get an opportunity to have these exchanges of views.  Members may note that when I was an MEP, I had foreseen that there would be a democratic deficit if we had a situation where part of the island remained in the EU and part of it remained partially in the EU.</p><p>Views would be expressed across the political divide, so to speak, in the North about a democratic deficit.  The one thing on which all parties have commented is that rules and procedures may be made in Brussels that will have an impact in the North and that will be done without the voice or views of people in the North being represented.  That is why we were keen to try to get some kind of observer status as we were being dragged out of the EU.  Significant work was done on this issue, particularly by the group of the left of which we were part.  It commissioned work on this.  Colin Harvey and Mark Bassett demonstrated how it was legally possible and politically feasible and considered other examples.  One that may be relevant for the committee is that 18 MEPs were given observer status at the time reunification in Germany as the latter was moving towards full transition to reunification.  It is stated that every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the European Union and that decisions should be made as close as possible to citizens.</p><p> I am conscious that the Seanad recently voted in favour of a citizens' assembly in the context of the constitutional change discussion and debate that is happening across the island.  I recommend to all in attendance and further afield to look at the work that has been done by Colin Harvey and Mark Bassett in this field in order that they can see that it is legally possible and politically feasible.  The one thing that even those within the unionist tradition who do not like the protocol - we all know the protocol is a consequence of the disaster of Brexit - recognise and complain about, and rightly so, is that there is a democratic deficit.  We have a situation in the North where we are in the customs union and the other regulatory alignment we have across this island and there is a difference between what is happening in the North and what is happening in Britain, but all of that is being done without democratic input.  I suggest that we work jointly to consider how that could be politically feasible to take forward.  The argument and the case has already been made.  What is required is for the Irish Government to pursue this issue of observer status in order that we would have representation in the North.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051200002#C00200"><p>It is great to see everyone.  Thankfully, many of my points follow on from the remarks of Deputy Howlin.  We are kind of consistently saying the same sort of thing, which is good.  That is the case across both jurisdictions.  I found the previous engagement we had with the Committee for the Executive Office to be extremely useful and very important.  I point out to Mr. McGrath and the Chairman that there is scope to formalise this and agree that this committee and the Committee for the Executive Office should meet at least once each quarter, with a set agenda to discuss these issues that impact all of our constituents on such a level.  I have been speaking for a long time about the fact that the strand 3 institutions of the Good Friday Agreement need to be formalised, locked into the calendar and made non-negotiable.  Is it feasible to get agreement for the two committees to meet on a quarterly basis to talk through the many issues we will have to discuss?  We need to keep working at this.  It is to be hoped that we will be able to do so in person in due course.</p> <p>  As regards the North-South Ministerial Council, our guests had a briefing from their junior Ministers in the past fortnight and one of the issues that came up was the attendance of Members of the Executive at the North-South Ministerial Council.  How can we ensure that political boycotts, for want of a better term, are not allowed to get in the way of the full operation and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement?  How can this committee hold our Ministers to account?  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  What part are our guests playing in terms of holding Ministers in the North to account?  These council meetings have nothing to do with wider politics but they have everything to do with the practical day-to-day lives of all our communities, such as people who take the train regularly from Belfast to Dublin, those from a farming background or whatever.  These are vital areas.  I was pleased that both the transport and enterprise ministerial meetings went ahead.  It goes to the nub of the practical issues not just in the post-Brexit era, but the everyday issues that we need to discuss.</p> <p>  Tied to that, Mr. McGrath referred to a spider diagram.  I was looking at it this morning before the meeting and it is another level of complexity.  All one needs to do is put it into 23 working languages and all the bureaucracy comes flooding back.  I do not wish to give Ms Anderson nightmares of former days in Brussels or Strasbourg.  I refer to the role of the parliamentary party assembly and how we can ensure that the voice of citizens of Northern Ireland is still heard in that.  Ms Anderson, Deputy Howlin and Barry Andrews, MEP, have touched on much of the work that can be done at governmental level and at observer level, but there is a need to ensure the voices of MLAs are heard in the structures that are there now.  Members of this committee could be proxy voices in that regard.  </p> <p>  My final point relates specifically to the protocol.  This is the big issue that affects this island and on which we, as parliamentarians, need to work.  The Government, Deputies, Senators and MEPs have a very specific role within the European Union to be the voice for common sense and flexibility on the ground with regard to ports of entry into Northern Ireland.  It is very difficult to do that when the North-South Ministerial Council is not necessarily fully operational.  On a parliamentary level, there are issues we need to consider.  In two weeks' time, half a dozen of us will attend a meeting of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will be coming back in front of the committee.  The Minister appeared before the committee just ten days ago and it was a really important session.  We need to constantly push for that flexibility.</p> <p>  I appreciate that, on the flip side, Lord Frost stated yesterday that the protocol he negotiated and ratified is unworkable.  That is a massive challenge.  Where can we play that role to ensure that common sense comes into it within the EU?   I know that common sense and Brexit do not exactly go hand in hand, but we have to try our best in that regard.</p></speech>

His remarks highlight the complexity of the whole Brexit process.  There are so many issues in there.  As regards the ability for our committees to meet regularly and to set out a schedule for doing so, we are certainly very open to that.  We have had several meetings with various committees and we agree that we benefit from those discussions.  I always believe that if you meet, then you are talking and when you are talking, you discuss problems and in that discussion you find solutions.  That kind of dovetails across the other areas, such as certain Ministers not attending North-South Ministerial Council.  If you are not there and you are not talking, you are not going to find solutions.  I believe it negates the ability of a Minister to stand up and say there are problems if he or she has not taken the opportunity to go and find the solutions.  Banging the drum is the easy thing for any person elected to public office to do but actually going, doing the hard yards, getting results and solutions and delivering for people are the most important things.</p><p> In terms of the two committees meeting, we will meet any committee we need to meet.  There are a number of committees, several within Dublin and several others within the assembly.  There are inputs from London, Edinburgh and Cardiff too that are important.  That leads me back to my response on BIPA.  It is about trying to find a forum wherein all of the voices, on a formal basis, can have input and discussions.</p><p> I was struck by Deputy Richmond's point that events and discussions at forums such at BIPA are important to the voice of MLAs in the North being heard.  During the three years when there was no assembly, BIPA continued to meet twice a year and that provided me and representatives of all of the parties with six two-day events at which to articulate our thoughts and views on Brexit and to make our views and concerns known to other elected representatives across the islands.  It is important, in the absence of something more formal between the EU and the North, that we maximise the opportunities to come together to have voices heard.  We should continue to strive for that.  For as long as an EU-North forum is not available, we should maximise the other opportunities for meeting.</p><p> On the protocol, the non-attendance by some unionist representatives and Ministers at the North-South Ministerial Council is a symptom of an unworkable protocol.  We have to regularly remind them in committee that the protocol is a symptom of Brexit, for which only a minority of people in the North voted, but it is being imposed on all of us.  The protocol is very much a symptom of Brexit, but if we take the practical approach of identifying that there are problems and issues then we have to find solutions.  People going back into communities and burying their heads in the sand, as happened in the past in some places, will not provide solutions for people.</p><p> In terms of the main issues, we need to be careful when we talk about the problems relating to the protocol.  There are issues but the nature or number of issues sometimes get talked up a lot more.  People continually say that there are problems, but when they are asked to identify them, the response always is simply that there are problems.  Many of the sectors in the North with which we meet on a regular basis in committee, and separately as representatives, are quick to highlight a couple of the key issues for them, but they also come to table with solutions.  It appears that the majority of the problems that have hit as a result of the protocol arose because businesses in GB were unprepared.  Businesses in the North had been told that forms would need to be filled in and that certain channels would need to be sorted out.  Business is very flexible.  It will always try to do its best to work through issues.  Businesses in the North have done that.</p><p> From an west-east point of view, I do not anticipate there will be major or significant problems, but there are major and significant problems coming the other way and that can cause logistical difficulties.  In terms of transportation, for example, fully-loaded lorries going to England without the correct paperwork will not be filled up for the return journey.  That can cause logistical concerns and issues.  At the root of that is the fact that many of the businesses in GB were not prepared and we then started to hear them saying that if the process was going to be very complex and there were not going to be offered a lot of help, they just would not bother with it.  There has been some interaction with businesses to help them understand that the process is not that complicated once they get over the first round of work, but further work needs to be done.  Grace periods are still in operation.  Should they stop at a cliff edge, as has happened in various other areas of the Brexit process, that may lead to significant problems very quickly.  There is need for an assessment by the Governments of the grace periods and what will happen when they expire and to then put in place measures to deal with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051200002#D00200"><p>I echo what has been said by Mr. McGrath and, in particular, Deputy Richmond in regard to the North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  It is crucial those meetings take place and that there is full attendance at them so that we can move issues forward.  The meetings are an avenue for discussions on perceptions or realities.  There are an excellent forum for an exchange of views.  All of us on this call would welcome regular communication.  It would be good for us to be aware of when they are scheduled to take place, if on a quarterly basis.</p> <p>  Following on from what Mr. McGrath said, it is important for committee members to hear our views on the protocol.  We are dealing with businesses in a number of sectors, be that manufacturers, farmers and traders, from across the North and elsewhere.  They want to see the protocol implemented.  They recognise that there is a degree of special status for the North remaining in the EU.  As we all know, in the North, the lion's share of business is in the SME sector and 80% of them trade on an all-Ireland basis.  None of us wanted to see any hardening of the borders.  We already have a border on land and a border at sea.  We have had a border at sea long before there was a protocol.  While the protocol is being flagged as a problem, the issue is the consequences and outworking of Brexit because many of the representatives within the unionist community had believed that the hardening of the border would happen on land.  Thankfully, all of us were able to prevent that happening.  As the MEP for the North, I voted for the Irish protocol in the European Parliament.  I could see that it was the least worst option in the context of the outworking of Brexit.</p> <p>  We need to see an end to the British Government solo run with regard to extensions.  We need agreement between the EU and the British and Irish Governments on how all of this will be handled and managed going forward.  We need not get caught up in the presentation of the Irish protocol being damaging to trade in the North.  Businesses will find, and have found, a way of working through all of that.  They obviously are frustrated that they have to fill in more forms and they did not want anything that was going to have a detrimental impact on what they do.  None of us wanted that, but we voted in the North against Brexit and we knew there were would be consequences of Brexit.  Unfortunately, for those of the British tradition who do not the border in the Irish Sea, there has been always a border in the Irish Sea but there has been an intensification of that border.  We understand that, but we all knew there would be consequences from Brexit.</p> <p>  Deputy Richmond spoke about the institutions working out how we can make sure that the voices of the people in the North are heard.  The people have a right to have their representatives heard in those institutions.  That is where the democratic deficit looms large.  We deeply appreciate the representatives in the South being our voice in those institutions when they get that opportunity, but we would like them to not get caught up in the Irish protocol being the problem.  Unfortunately, for those who did not want the protocol, it has formed part of the solution.  It is not the full solution.  For us, we need to get to a situation where all of Ireland is in the EU, but that is a conversation for another day.  This committee should at some point have a discussion on the planning and preparations for the constitutional change that is being discussed around kitchen tables across this island.  That is something that we need to do that with confidence.</p><p>Those of us in the committee from an Irish republican or nationalist tradition will meet with representatives from the British Government when they come to talk to us or with representatives from the House of Lords or the House of Commons.  We will engage with them with confidence about our position and what we want.  We hope that others will also find the space and place to be able to do that.  We ask the committee to hear everything that is going on and to be totally informed about this because the protocol is supported in the North, although people would like to see some kind of amendment to the protocol, if it is possible to do so without changing it, in order to have the flexibility we talked about and that Deputy Richmond referred to, that is required so that businesses can trade in a way that they want, with Britain and with the South.  However, they certainly do not want to do that at the expense of diluting the special status that they have in any way.  They want to see that protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051200002#E00200"><p>It is great to see everybody.  This is a terribly agreeable committee.  I will follow on from something that was said by both Mr. McGrath and Ms Anderson.  In fairness, it is in line with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said to this committee following his meetings with business interests, which is the fact that all that they are interested in is finding solutions.  I accept there are difficulties and teething problems that are the outworking of Brexit but it is about delivering results.  That is where we need to maintain a certain element of focus.</p> <p>  I also wish to follow up on what Deputy Richmond spoke about and on which everyone commented.  What we are talking about is keeping the show on the road in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a case of putting everything into the calendar, whether that is ensuring that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference happens or making sure that we the North-South Ministerial Council meetings take place properly and are attended by all.  We can deal with whatever issues arise.  I also support what Deputy Richmond said about the need to look at the possibility of formalising meetings of our two committees.  I accept what Mr. McGrath said about the fact that there are multiple committees dealing with multiple issues, but we have a responsibility, in particular, for EU affairs and their impact.</p> <p>  That leads me on to something on which we all agree, that is, Northern representation.  Ms Anderson did a significant piece of work on this as an MEP.  Barry Andrews, MEP, came before the committee and spoke about the possibility of what I will call the EU-British parliamentary association, but I believe there is another name on it.  We would probably need the British Government to be interested in doing it, while it would be under no compulsion to do it.  I spoke with our MEP, Chris MacManus, in recent days about the hope he sees in the fact that when the trade and co-operation agreement relating to Brexit was voted on, there was a resolution on accepting that there is a democratic deficit in terms of Northern representation.  There are a number of ways that this can be dealt with.  Ms Anderson would be better than most at fleshing out what sort of group there could be.  Sometimes, the setting can be very informal but we would need it to be formalised as much as possible.  I do not think there is any unionist representation here today.  We accept that.  We are in the situation we are in.  Brexit has been destabilising for unionism.  We are in the middle of a leadership contest and we will see the outworking of that, but it is an absolute necessity that the Good Friday Agreement train is kept on the track.  We must ensure that whoever they are, the leaders within unionism must play their part in that regard.</p> <p>  I will also follow up on what Ms Anderson about a citizens' assembly and just putting a reality to the conversation that is already happening on Irish unity.  Following on from what we saw in terms of the vote in Scotland at the weekend, it is apparent that the union is going to change in the very near future.  We all know that the North voted to stay in the European Union.  There is a responsibility on the Irish Government to step up to the mark in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of the existing difficulties, we constantly hear that things are going reasonably well between Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and David Frost, and then we suddenly hear something else.  I am interested to hear how the Executive's interaction is going at this point in dealing with the anomalies that exist.  There are probably new methods of dealing with issues under the trade and co-operation agreement.  I would be interested to hear how the witnesses consider the situation is progressing.</p> <p>  We are also dealing with the British Government.  At this stage, one could refer to "Unilateral Johnson" in the sense that the British Prime Minister is constantly threatening to do things.  Even people who probably like what they hear do not always see a follow-through, so nobody can guess the outcome of the promises.  I would be interested to get a response on that, in particular what the Northern representation could look like and how formalised it could be.</p></speech>

Farmers are facing a very uncertain time as a result of Brexit and they have concerns about how they carry out their practices in the future and how they secure the financial support they need to have.  The logical place for that voice to be articulated is in a North-South Ministerial Council so that there can be agreement across the island, across these islands and across Europe to try to help those farmers.  If the unionist representatives do not turn up, there is a massive voice that is missing.  That is another democratic deficit that is going to have a major ramification for people at community level.  I implore unionist representatives to turn up to the meetings at which there is due to be discussion about solutions.  They are doing an absolute injustice to the people who have elected them to the positions that they are in by not attending.  They are letting them down and shirking their responsibility.  That goes even for this meeting, at which we do not have any unionist representatives.  We can have an open and constructive conversation about the issues and problems and we can suggest methods to address them.  Thankfully, the committee takes on board what we say and implements it into its representations in its future work.  The unionist voice is again not being heard here today and that is an absolute let-down for those communities.</p> <p>  In terms of the substance of the answer, I will pass it to Ms Anderson because I went first on the previous two responses.  I will let her go first and then I will come in after on the specific points that have been raised.</p></speech>

As we indicated, Wednesday is a very busy day for me as I also have to attend an infrastructure committee.  I know that those in the north west will be keen to hear that we are dealing with the A5 as one of the many issues.</p> <p>  Observer status at the European Parliament is fixed by the Council in advance of every election.  I quoted Article 10.3 of the treaty earlier,  It states: "Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union."  We in the North, as EU rights holders and citizens, therefore have a right to participate in the Union.  I also direct members to rule 13 of the rules of procedure, which contains the specific reference to observer status, in this regard.</p><p> What is needed is political.  We would need the Irish Government to make a representation to the Council that we are in a unique situation because we are half in the EU and half out of it.  Therefore, the Irish Government needs to examine and explore how this can be done and to give a voice to those in the unionist community who want to be heard with regard to their concerns about what they believe is the Irish protocol and how they view it.  We want to be able to ensure that the wide representation on behalf of businesses and so on realises that this special status for the North to remain and be part of the EU is something that they value and want to see implemented in full.  I am a former MEP.  As the committee knows, we worked the corridors of power and spoke other MEPs in order to make sure that they understood the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, why there should not be a hardening of the Border in Ireland and why we needed to protect the all-island economy and how that could be done through special status for the North to remain within the EU, people understood it.  They understood it in the context of where we were and where we are now regarding the conflict.</p><p> In view of the connections that they have to the Irish Government, I appeal to the members of the committee ask it to consider this and do more than ask.  If we are really talking about meaningful representation and addressing the democratic deficit, as has been said by Professor Colin Harvey and Mr. Mark Bassett, it is politically feasible and legally possible.  The only thing that is missing is the political will.  I hope that gives the committee an opportunity to understand how it can be done.</p><p> I thank the Chair and members for affording me the opportunity to exchange views with them today.  I appreciate what has been said and I hope we can formalise these meetings into quarterly occurrences so that it will allow us to take these conversations further.  I am sorry that I have to go but I have another meeting in a few minutes.</p></speech>

I think we are all in agreement about and happy to meet more regularly and, as part of our committee's protocol, we would meet quarterly.  I think Mr. McGrath is receptive to that idea too.  I thank Deputy Richmond for raising the matter.  Politics is about bread and butter too.  We are talking about the protocol and Brexit but bread-and-butter matters are important.  I am delighted that Ms Anderson is attending that infrastructure meeting.  She can let those present know that the Irish Government will be committed to it.  It is in our programme for Government.  As far as representing citizens and our constituency in the north west is concerned, it is important.  I wish Ms Anderson well with that meeting and hopefully we can see progress with that in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>

I was conscious that I might end up here as the only representative from the committee.  Thankfully, Ms Sheerin is here to give me some back-up and I am not out on my own.</p></speech>

We can make noise about the need for that but, unfortunately, we do not have much sway to ask for it because it will have to be a decision taken between the UK and the EU.  Therefore, we would welcome support from the committee and the Irish Government in the EU to ask for it from that side, which could then be matched on the UK side.  I do not foresee the UK having any problems with that, if we were to have a formalised voice about decisions taken about us, if we could impress on the EU the absolute need for that.  With regard to lobbying for that, we are in a position of asking but we are not at the table when that decision will actually be taken.</p> <p>  With the other structures, such as citizens' assemblies, interparliamentary committees and various opportunities for us to participate, we have to face a glaring reality.  That reality is that unionism is not engaging with any of those structures in any substantial way.  Doug Beattie has attended various things.  He is the vice chair of this committee but he has his eye on other issues.</p> <p>  This dovetails into what I want to say, which is that unionism is in crisis.  The fact that both parties are now seeking new leaders suggests that there is a will in those parties to go in new and fresh directions.  That crisis is there.  We will have to manage it at the other end when they elect their new leadership.  I hope it will be leadership that will be prepared to acknowledge that there are realities and problems, that there will need to be cool heads, and that discussion and interaction will deliver results that people need.  Hopefully, when the new leadership is in place, it will be a unionism that is prepared to accept the current realities.  I could be cheeky and say that they caused what has happened because they voted for Brexit, which all these issues arise as a result of.  The reality is that we are where we are and we have to work our way forward.  Hopefully some new leadership in unionism will help in the period ahead.</p></speech>

I want to endorse much of what has been said.  One thing raised at this meeting, which I heard Nichola Mallon raise at another meeting on Monday night, is the number of people who are in favour of the protocol.  We do not hear about that.  We do not hear those business voices stating that we can make this work, that it needs tweaking but that they are used to this and are adaptable.  Could a coalition be put together to try to change the debate somewhat?  If that debate is changed, it might be changed in London too.  We had the Minister, Deputy Coveney, with us a few weeks ago and we got a sense that some progress has been made on many issues.  For the business voice in Northern Ireland to be involved in the process, a coalition such as that to which I refer would be important.</p> <p>  Would be an idea for Mr. McGrath to invite Commissioner &Scaron;efovi to address his committee?  I do not think permission is needed from London or Dublin to get people to address it.  The very fact of him taking that interest might wake people up about the work of Mr. McGrath's committee and participating in that work.  It would provide a direct forum for presenting the views of the committee and MLAs about Northern Ireland in future.  Some of the issues include the protocol and PEACE funding, and there are many things that the committee needs to have a role in.  We had an engagement with Commissioner &Scaron;efovi in respect of Article 16.  It was not necessarily the most enlightening engagement we ever had but we did it and he gave us time.  I suggest that might be a way to proceed.</p> <p>  I absolutely endorse holding these meetings quarterly.  All the sectoral committees should also have such meetings.  It would not so much be a ministerial meeting but a meeting of committees.  I am conscious of Mr. McGrath's comments on BIPA and the follow-on from it.  BIPA is great fun but there must also be a follow-on.  As a follow-on from this meeting, let us schedule what has been suggested into our work programme for the remainder of this year and for next year.</p></speech>

It is good to see him.  Looking at it from a slightly different angle, if things are going well and there are good opportunities, people will not say much because they are getting on with doing what they have to do.</p><p>I read that from the fact that businesses are not breaking my door down to tell me there are a huge number of problems.  That is why I am perceiving, and find very surprising, that only unionist politicians are having their doors knocked down and told there are huge amounts of problems.  With a healthy amount of scepticism, I wonder if there are lots of issues out there.  I am not naive about the fact that there are issues and problems.  This is about being able to address those issues, however  It would be very useful for businesses to come together to highlight the positives.  When one exudes business positives it actually attracts other businesses and one grows.  People say that good things are happening and that is the place to go.  If one highlights the available opportunities, people will tap into support and invest in those areas.</p><p> In fairness, Arlene Foster highlighted and suggested that.  She was quick enough to see that there were opportunities.  It obviously did not fit with the mantra that some within the party wanted to put forward because I believe it was ultimately was one of the reasons she ended up losing her job.  It is a sad reflection that whenever somebody can see a positive, which will provide opportunities and growth within the North and help us to develop our business sector, that person gets shot down within the party, which says "No" and focuses on the negative.  That can move into a very dangerous place.</p><p> There are also some mechanisms within the trade agreement to allow various bodies to come together.  I just hope that it is not so complicated and there are so many forums that those voices are lost because we need to be able to articulate the positive nature.</p><p> Something we could certainly take from that would be to perhaps look at bringing some of those business voices into our committee for them to be able to say whether opportunities are available.  And we will certainly do that.  Again, we can put forward the idea of inviting Commissioner &Scaron;efovi to meet with the committee.  I know Deputy Richmond at a previous meeting asked him if he would be prepared to meet with us.  I believe the answer the Deputy may have received was just another from that day which was not very fleshed out .  We can certainly ask, however, because again, having somebody there who can hear the concerns and issues, and can actually do something about it, is much better than waving a placard outside a harbour.  I would definitely agree with that.</p><p> I will pass over to Ms Sheerin if she wishes to add anything.</p></speech>

It probably goes to the heart of the conversation that has been had around the protocol since the beginning of the year.  Unionist politicians are telling us that X, Y or Z is wrong with the protocol.  An awful lot of the time, they are conflating their own concerns or worries about the state of the union or the constitutional position with the protocol risking identity.  We know that because of the Good Friday Agreement, our identities are protected as they are.  The protocol does not risk anyone's right to be British.  That is where we are seeing a bit of people playing politics and things being twisted or manipulated.  Deputy Calleary's idea is a good one.  I am not sure who came up with it but Deputy Calleary obviously made reference to it.  What Mr. McGrath said is key, however.  Constituents are not contacting me about issues with the protocol.  The vast majority of constituents who contacted me with initial concerns or worries worked through them and have had those problems sorted out.</p> <p>  There were some issues with documentation and the filling out of forms, and concerns about certain forms that the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs was supposed to provide but people had to go and get themselves.  I am referring to common health entry document checks and things like that.  Outside of that, however, the vast majority of people who contacted me are largely going about their business and are not being impacted by the protocol.  Mr. McGrath's assessment is correct and that is what I am also finding.</p> <p>  I know I was late arriving this morning and I apologise.  It is regrettable, however, that we are not seeing any unionist representation here.  A person who is not at the table cannot have his or her say and that is unfortunate.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will come back in and if anybody else wishes to ask a second question, they can let me know.</p></speech>

As was said earlier, businesses are all about getting the job done or it does not work out.  It is as simple as that.  Ideology rarely comes into it.</p> <p>  I will also follow up on the point about bringing Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi into the discussion.  I was told that during the debate on the  EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and, obviously, the conversation around all the resolutions, Mr. &Scaron;efovi stayed and commented on a number of matters.  We are talking about a four-hour debate, which I am sure was absolutely stimulating at all points.  Chris MacManus told me that one of the points to which Mr. &Scaron;efovi returned related to Northern representation.  He obviously accepts the point regarding the democratic deficit and is open to that conversation.  It would do no harm to follow through on that.</p> <p>  Let us be clear on the issue regarding unionism.  For a long period, unionists have rarely moved beyond the lowest common denominator, no matter the issue.  I hope we will see in the future, which Mr. McGrath put well, a unionist leadership that accepts the reality of the world in which we live and that can then deliver for its own people to a greater extent.</p> <p>  I want to follow up on the question of the protocols and modalities that exist for dealing issues as regards the Irish protocol and the engagement of the Executive.  Obviously, there are a greater number of methodologies for dealing with problems since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has been put in place.  Are the witnesses reasonably happy that the means exist to deal with the problems?</p></speech>

Various committees have been established within the hierarchy of the Executive office with which businesses can engage.  Some of them have only very recently been populated, however, and some have only met once or twice.</p> <p>  The other side of this is that Northern Ireland is not a big place.  Many of those key people who are involved in representative groups, therefore, know exactly how to be able to access the decision makers and are probably utilising that avenue much quicker than the formalised structures.  Take, for instance, the key agencies that represent manufacturing, retail and various organisations.  I have no doubt that they have Ministers' telephone numbers on speed dial and if they have issues or problems, they are able to get access.  I do not believe we should do that to the default of the actual structures that are in place, however.  Formally capturing what those issues are means we can start to identify patterns.  Then, we can also ensure that there is not some form of preferential treatment, or that certain organisations that get support from particular political parties with particular ministries get quicker access to some sort of resolution to the problems they have.  There are structures in place.</p> <p>  We use our quarterly meetings to ask the junior Ministers who sit on those forums.  We have been going through a process of asking when they will meet and we are now in a process of asking what issues are being raised.  We will continue to do that as part of our engagement with the Ministers within the department.  If it were a school report, however, it would ask, "Could do better?"  We need to keep putting the pressure on them.</p></speech>

I would endorse everything said by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  It is the pragmatic, practical approach to all this.  Brexit has been foisted upon us.  We can see now that we have a democratic deficit.</p><p>The North was probably going to be worst affected by Brexit and we can see that Northern voices are not being listened to by the British Government.  On the European side, there was grave concern for the island of Ireland and for protecting the integrity of the peace, the working relationships and the practicalities of people's lives, particularly those the Deputy represents and other Border representatives speak for.  Those people cross the Border on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.  All that has to be protected and the implementation of the protocol is about the practicality of that.  It is about finding solutions and that is our priority as well.</p></speech>

The message from today's meeting is to keep the lines of communication open.  We are happy to do that on a quarterly basis.  We can set that up with our respective teams.  We have so much to do and there is so much that can still be done.  We have focused on and talked about Brexit for the best part of half a decade.  How much does it consume political discourse in the North and take precedence over other important issues?  I am interested to hear Mr. McGrath and Ms Sheerin's perspectives on that.  There are so many other issues.  I do not have to tell somebody from the North how intrinsically our communities, society and economy are linked on this island.  It is in all our interests to keep the lines of communication open and try to act as a solution-focused mechanism.  We are happy to keep that engagement going.  Over the past five years we have been getting consumed by it and the assumption is that members for the North are also consumed by it.  How much has it become a focus at the expense of other important issues, such as the infrastructural issues we talked about?</p></speech>

After the challenges of managing Covid, we were, towards the end of last year, focused firmly on the end of the transition period and the issues resulting from Brexit.  The unfortunate thing is it always feels in politics in the North that there are all the real bread-and-butter issues to deal with but we never seem to get the time to address them.  This past week in the assembly, we have managed to have private member-led motions to discuss issues such as autism and climate and environmental problems.  We are not getting the chance to look at those issues with a more executive-based approach because of Brexit, which has consumed our time and deals with so many issues, and because of the dispute within our Executive Office, which means it is difficult to get other matters cleared.</p> <p>  I find it hugely frustrating that there are nearly 200 parliamentary questions tabled to the Executive Office which have not been answered.  We know there is a requirement for them to be signed off by both parties but issues such as Brexit cause problems that mean the normal day-to-day operation of democracy does not take place.  Some fundamental issues are not being dealt with.  In any other democracy, people would be aghast that one cannot ask a minister a question, but has to wait six months for a written answer.  Sometimes when the written answer comes through, it has two or three lines and directs one to a website.  The issues are not necessarily state secrets.  They are just general democratic principles and issues that people ask their representatives to raise but we do not have the space to deal with them.  If we can take the pragmatic and practical approach and keep geopolitics out of what impacts people on a daily basis, then we will start to address the daily issues and help citizens see real change taking place in their communities.  At the moment, much of that is frustrated because of the perspectives on Brexit preventing the daily work from taking place.</p></speech>

The Chairman spoke about Brexit and our removal from the EU as a distraction.  To me, Brexit exposes the reality of partition and of government in the North, in that we at all times are dependent on what another parliament does.  Stormont, as a structure, has no tax-raising powers or fiscal levers and depends on Westminster to give it a budget.  We do not have say over how many years that budget will be for, so we are working on a year-to-year basis.  The system we have is one of mandatory coalition.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath made reference to his and our frustration when one puts a question into the Executive Office, which is a joint ministerial office.  This morning's meeting and political unionism's approach to something as simple as this committee exposes what it is like to work with the DUP daily.  One cannot get an answer to a question because their Minister cannot get agreement in an office to sign off on an answer to a question.  New Decade, New Approach contains a list of commitments that still have not been delivered because the DUP is blocking them.  North-South Ministerial Council meetings cannot go ahead because the DUP is blocking them.  For these meetings of the Oireachtas joint committee, the DUP is not at the table.</p> <p>  Brexit was a decision by the English and, to a lesser extent, Welsh people which has been imposed upon the island of Ireland with massive implications for all people North and South, particularly those living in the North.  The DUP backed it and when there is an issue it does not like regarding the protocol, it does not engage.  It does not smooth or iron out the problems.  It sticks its head in the sand.  Government in the North is like that.</p> <p>  On delivery for projects on the ground,  I was out with a group from a local school in a rural area, comprising 85 pupils from 50 families, this morning.  They cannot get money to paint the front of their school because we have had 12 years of Tory austerity and our budget has been cut year on year.  All these things are interlinked.  None of them happens in a vacuum and none can be looked at in isolation.</p> <p>  Brexit has speeded up the conversation about Irish unity but it exposes the folly of partition, that there are six counties in Ireland where the people are reliant on what people in another country are doing.  Our future is dictated by voters in Manchester, Brighton and Bristol.  That is how frustrating it is.  I am a mid-Ulster representative in a rural area and I see people being impacted by decisions made far removed from them.  It is incredibly frustrating but that is where we are at.</p> <p>  I ended my last contribution on a positive note and this is much more negative but that is the reality of the situation.  Brexit is speeding up the unity conversation and that is what I want us to see.  Going forward, how can we build a future for everyone?  I would like to see unionism take part in this conversation, to be there and say it wants to see X, Y and Z and we will ask how we can work together to deliver for everybody.</p></speech>

The format will be that we will ask Ms McEvoy for her opening statement, and thereafter we can take questions and answers from the members.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on Ms McEvoy to give her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#A00500"><p>I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Brien.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018.  As the committee is aware, licensed moneylenders are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which sets out the specific regulatory regime for this sector, including provisions reflecting particular features of this sector and, in particular, the high cost of this type of credit.  The Central Bank assumed responsibility for licensing and supervising moneylenders in 2003, when responsibility transferred from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We fulfil this role within the parameters of the legislative regime.  Under the legislation, any firm involved in moneylending activity requires a licence from the Central Bank, which must be renewed every year.  In line with our mandate, working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy, we maintain a proactive and focused approach in supervising the sector, ensuring that the requirements imposed on the sector continue to be effective and provide suitable protections for consumers.</p> <p>  There are currently 35 moneylenders licensed to operate in Ireland.  The business model operated by licensed moneylenders generally falls within the following categories: home collection firms, firms operating a catalogue business model and other firms, including firms providing credit to fund gym membership, insurance premiums, etc., and firms involved in the provision of goods on credit.  Licensed moneylenders are required to carry out their business under the specific terms of their licence.  We have not permitted a maximum APR or costs charged within the sector to increase.  In line with our gatekeeping responsibilities, we have not allowed practices such as pay-day lending to enter the Irish licensed moneylending market.</p> <p>  There is a strong consumer protection framework in place for consumers who choose to use the services of licensed moneylenders.  Consumers are protected by a range of provisions that moneylenders must adhere to, including the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, the (Licensed Moneylenders) Regulations 2020, the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 and the Consumer Credit Act 1995, all of which include additional provisions specific to the moneylending sector.</p> <p>  In addition to the protections provided under these regulations, there are important protections provided for in legislation that mean licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges, including in the event of default or non-payment by the customer.  Therefore, a customer can never be asked to pay more than the total amount payable as stated on the moneylending agreement.  Moneylenders are also required to undertake a creditworthy assessment before entering into a moneylending agreement with the consumer.  We have made, and set out, our clear expectations to all credit providers, including licensed moneylenders, that they lend responsibly and act at all times in the best interests of the consumers.</p> <p>  Last year, following an extensive public consultation process, we introduced new regulations, which replaced the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, to further strengthen protections for consumers of the licensed moneylending sector and to enhance professional standards in this sector.</p> <p>  In addition to the existing requirements, moneylenders are now required to include prominent, high-cost warnings in all advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR of more than 23%.  The warning must also prompt consumers to consider alternatives.</p> <p>  Moneylenders may not be permitted to make unsolicited offers to apply for credit to consumers who have recently made, or are nearing, full repayment of a moneylending loan.  There is a limit on moneylenders&rsquo; contact with consumers and a limit the offer and promotions of loans to consumers.  Where a loan is required for basic needs, such as accommodation or electricity, moneylenders will be required to inform the consumer that a moneylending loan may not be in their best interest and to provide contact information for the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  There are also new requirements for staff and agents working in the sector, designed to enhance their professional standards.</p> <p>  While the regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021, due to the financial impact of Covid-19, the high-cost warning requirements in respect to advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR in excess of 23% came into effect earlier, from 1 September 2020.  We assertively supervise this sector, taking supervisory and enforcement action, where required, to protect consumers&rsquo; interests.  Compliance is required through supervision initially and at annual licensing processes.  Applying the fitness and probity regime, we undertake thematic and firm-specific inspections and engagements, we undertake market monitoring, we conduct consumer-based research and we monitor industry trends, including complaints made to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland, FSBO.</p> <p>  In respect to the new proposed legislation, the Central Bank is supportive of all initiatives that seek to enhance existing protections for consumers in the moneylending sector.  The Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, as drafted, proposes to place a cap of 36% of APR charged by moneylenders, which could present some specific challenges.  Moneylender loans are generally short term in nature.  Their cost and the associated APR can be very high when compared to other forms of credit.  APRs may appear to be extremely high on short-term loans when compared to the actual cost of credit over the longer term.  Therefore, lowering the APR may be ineffective and counterproductive and not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit if, for instance, a moneylender chooses instead to extend the duration of the loan, resulting in the consumer paying more over the longer duration of the loan.</p><p>Neither the 1995 Act nor the regulations provides for an interest rate cap, nor does the 1995 Act define "excessive" in the context of interest rates.  The Central Bank, therefore, has no statutory power to impose a market-wide cap on rates, and the introduction of an interest rate cap would require a legislative amendment.  Any legislative proposals seeking to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit to customers of moneylenders should be calibrated to ensure no unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.</p><p> Our focus has been on improving the transparency of these costs and increasing consumer awareness by setting of requirements such as the need to warn customers about the high-cost nature of loans and to disclose all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner prior to entering into the moneylending contract.  Our public register of licensed moneylenders also sets out product details such as the maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and collection charges, if applied.</p><p> One of the challenges in considering rates charged by moneylenders is finding a balance between the availability of credit for consumers who do not have access to regulated credit elsewhere or who do not use other regulated credit providers and the provision of short-term unsecured loans which can be at a high cost.  For small amounts of credit and for those consumers with an impaired credit history, there may be limited alternative credit options available to them from regulated credit providers.</p><p> We have concerns regarding the proposed legislation as currently drafted.  Any legislative proposal imposing such a cap would have to be carefully considered to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and to ensure unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion do not arise.  We recommend an assessment of the impact on consumers should be undertaken to inform this approach.</p></speech>

I expect Ms McEvoy has followed some of the discussion on it, including my intention to amend the legislation to deal with the issues of APR, which I also share.  That is the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny where we get a chance to hear from others who support the intention of the legislation but can refine and tweak the methods of getting to the end point and try to establish what that end point is.  Maybe to start off with I will ask Ms McEvoy whether she believes there is tension in the Central Bank's dual mandate between financial security and consumer protection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#B00400"><p>I would say "No".  Right across the breadth of the Central Bank, we protect the interests of consumers.  As the Deputy will be aware, our mandate is quite broad.  If we think about our role in terms of financial stability and the proper and effective functioning of the wider economy, any regime we have in place is ultimately to ensure the interests of consumers are protected by a well-functioning market and a well-functioning economy.  If you look to our prudential mandate, we ensure firms meet very high standards, are adequately resourced in terms of capital and are solvent.  That is to ensure they are in a position, for example, if I think of insurance firms, to pay out on policies or, if you are engaging in dealing with a bank, that your deposits are safe.</p> <p>  If you look to our consumer protection mandate, our core objective is to ensure firms act at all times in the best interests of consumers and treat their consumers fairly.  This is to ensure the regime we impose supervises these firms to ensure they do so and there are adequate and robust consumer protections in place in terms of our regulations and guidelines.</p> <p>  That, in turn, leads me to our role in terms of policy-setting.  We actively engage at a European level to enhance and support strong measures for the protections of consumers.  Similarly, at a domestic level, we will engage with the committee and other colleagues to ensure the domestic regime supports the protection of consumers and meets that desired objective.</p> <p>  Finally, the fifth component of our mandate extends to enforcement action.  If we find that firms operating in Ireland, or indeed on a cross-Border basis, are not acting in the consumers' best interests, and we have many cases where we have taken strong decisions in enforcement using our administrative sanction powers where we believe firms were not acting fairly or were not treating their customers fairly, right across the breadth of the Central Bank's mandate we seek to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected.  Therefore, I do not see there to be a conflict.</p></speech>

Usury is defined as making unethical or immoral monetary loans that unfairly enrich the lender.  They recommend "a policy that prohibits usurious rates of interest in the interests of fairness to the most vulnerable in Irish society by the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges".  Does Ms McEvoy agree with that policy?</p></speech>

From our perspective, our approach in terms of supervising this sector has always been proportionate and robust, but we have focused on greater transparency, that is, making it clear to the consumer the high-cost nature of these types of loans, what one would be paying back over the length of time of the loan and any charges that may apply in that context.  From our perspective, the approach we have taken has been very much around transparency and increasing awareness.  We have also imposed quite a lot of requirements on moneylending firms in terms of how they engage and interact with consumers in terms of being proportionate, being aware of their marketing strategy and engaging in a sympathetic manner with consumers who are experiencing financial distress.</p> <p>  We can stand over the regime we have.  The law at present does not allow the Central Bank to intervene and impose caps, either on interest rates or APRs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#B00700"><p>I appreciate the law does not allow that.  That is why I have drafted the Bill to change that.  I will go back to my original question.  Does Ms McEvoy agree with the recommendation in the report that was co-funded by the Central Bank which calls for the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#B00800"><p>It is not as straightforward as to address it in the context of a cap <i>per se</i>.  The important measure to look at in this context would be the total cost of credit for the customer because there are unintended consequences, as I outlined in the opening statement, in terms of a straightforward and clean cap.  In the legislation as currently drafted and in the regulations, the Central Bank has imposed a big degree of clarity for the customer about the total cost of credit over the length of time he or she is borrowing so that a person knows from the credit agreement right at the outset what he or she has borrowed, and if he or she is paying it back in the short term, on average nine months, exactly what it will cost by the time he or she has paid back the loan.  Furthermore, there is clarity in terms of the provisions of the law that do not allow customers who perhaps have defaulted through no fault of their own or are late in meeting a repayment to be subject to additional penalties or charges in that context.<br/><br/>From our perspective, it is a complex issue.  It is something that would require careful consideration.  The better way of looking at things might be in terms of the total cost of credit to the customer because a cap might mean the duration of the loan is extended far beyond and you end up paying much more for your initial &euro;200, &euro;300 or &euro;400 drawdown of the loan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#B00900"><p>The question I had was not whether Ms McEvoy supports a cap but whether she supports, as the report outlined, a restriction on interest rates and charges which can be in the form of the total cost of credit.  I want to get the director of consumer protection's view on to this. Is the consumer protection division of the Central Bank in favour of restrictions on interest rates and charges which, as Ms McEvoy has outlined, may be in the way of the cost of credit?  It is all well and good the Central Bank ensuring moneylenders tell their customers upfront they are screwing them, but we want Ms McEvoy's views on whether perhaps they should not be screwing them in the first place and we need to impose restrictions.  Is it the Central Bank's view that it does not mind what we legislate for and, indeed, we could go even higher than what is already in the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#B01000"><p>There are a couple of points in what the Deputy said there.  In the first instance, we would be supportive of any legislative regime that enhances and strengthens the protections for consumers of the moneylending sector and, indeed, right across all sectors.</p><p>It is important to note that.  </p><p> Regarding the Deputy's specific question, it is also important to note some other measures that exist.  For example, as I noted, the law does not give the Central Bank the powers to impose a cap.  However, in our supervision of the moneylending sector, encompassing new entrants and existing providers launching new products, we have ensured we have intervened where we felt the APR was excessive.  We have had success in that regard with firms reducing their APRs or, indeed, removing a product from the market.  In addition, from the outset when we took over responsibility, we restricted and never allowed payday lending, which is a feature of the UK moneylending sector.  </p><p> A proportionate, measured and considered response must be taken in respect of interventions, because I do not believe the Deputy or we in the Central Bank would want a situation where interventions were such that they perhaps resulted in people not having access to regulated financial services and not having the protections afforded by the Central Bank under its consumer protection regime.  One has to consider this area in its totality and ensure that measures achieve the desired objective of protecting consumers.</p></speech>

Let us go into the specifics some more.  Turning to the register, let us deal with some examples in the market.  The Central Bank has given licences to moneylenders which are permitted to charge APRs of 187%.  Does Ms McEvoy believe that is usurious?  Does she believe that rate is too high or does she think it is appropriate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00300"><p>That is the maximum rate moneylenders have been permitted to charge.  However, if we look across the register, it also calls out-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00400"><p>No, I said I was going to deal with specifics.  I acknowledge other moneylenders are charging 54%, and some of the catalogues, etc..  However, the largest moneylender in the State was charging that rate of 187%.  Therefore, let us deal with the specifics and I will ask Ms McEvoy a specific question.  Is it the Central Bank that determines that rate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00500"><p>No, the Central Bank does not determine the rate.  The rates are commercial decisions determined by the institution offering the services in Ireland.  That rate is up to the maximum, and the range is from 17% to 187%.  There are two other important points in this regard.  First, if we look at the UK regime, it has imposed a cap on the total cost of credit of 100% for a moneylending loan of up to one year.  In comparison, in the Irish market the total cost of credit in that context for loans from providers for up to one year is 56%.  That is a little over half the rate applied under the UK model.  Second, taking the APRs for periods up to three years, the average is 76%.  Those are important points to highlight, and the information is available on our website and on the register.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00600"><p>That is fine.  Ms McEvoy said it is a commercial decision.  She also made the point that the Central Bank can reject these proposals and it has done so in the past.  Therefore, the Central Bank deemed an APR of 187% appropriate in this case, and collection charges then further push up the cost of credit.  This legislation is about restricting that level of APR and it is intended to be achieved through a multiplier of the cost of credit in the market.  That is what my proposal would be on Committee Stage.  Does Ms McEvoy believe it would be appropriate to restrict that type of cost of credit, or does she, as the director of consumer protection in the Central Bank, actually regard an APR of 187% as what we need in the market in that case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00700"><p>I reiterate those are the commercial decisions of the lenders.  We can intervene where the law states those are "excessive", but it does not define what that term means.  I reiterate the point that a proportionate and measured approach must be taken.  We could put a cap on an APR, as I mentioned, but that could turn out to be counterproductive because the moneylender could then extend the duration of the loan.  In that case, the borrower would be paying back much more over a longer time.  Therefore, it is necessary to give a great deal of consideration to the potential impact of putting a cap in place.  As I also mentioned, it is also important to note that we do not want a situation where in some instances the customers of moneylenders may not have access to regulated credit elsewhere, be that through a credit union or bank.  Some customers of moneylenders do have that line of credit available, but some do not.  We must be very cautious in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C00800"><p>Ms McEvoy mentioned the cap again.  I signalled to the committee previously that it is my intention to move away from an absolute cap, as drafted in the legislation, to a multiplier of the cost of credit, which, in respect of her opening statement, would be in line with the Central Bank, the Social Finance Foundation and other organisations that have given their insights into this issue.  My intention, therefore, is that the cap would be a multiplier of the cost of credit in the market.  Can the Central Bank provide the committee with information regarding the cost of credit for short-term loans from the retail banks and credit unions?  Is it possible for the Central Bank to do that?  For example, could it be done for loan terms of zero to 12 weeks, 12 to 26 weeks and then 26 to 52 weeks, to enable us to use that information in our consideration of this legislation on Committee Stage?  Is it possible then for legislation that would allow, for example, moneylenders to charge up to three times the cost of credit in the market, as defined by the Central Bank at any given point in time?  Is that an appropriate or better way to deal with forms of restrictions on high-cost credit?</p></speech>

Taking the latter one first, it might be better to reflect on that proposal and then to come back to him and-or the committee regarding what is being proposed, because we have not given due consideration to that aspect.  Turning to the first point concerning availability of APRs, again, and with respect, I do not have those data to hand.  I would have to engage with my colleagues in that regard.  However, if we have that information, we can certainly make it available to the Deputy.  I just honestly do not know if we have that information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#C01000"><p>That is great.  I appreciate that.  It would be helpful if the Central Bank could gather that information for the committee.</p> <p>  Moneylenders have adapted their methods, which are extremely costly.  Door-to-door collection, for example, is very labour intensive.  The moneylender firms achieve high collection rates, but it also results in other issues, such as the rolling over of loans.  Ms McEvoy will be familiar with the fact that I, along with six whistle-blowers, brought information to the Central Bank regarding the main moneylender in the State and the Central Bank subsequently made a significant finding against that firm as a result.  That type of situation results from the intergenerational relationship and dependency that builds up in that context.  The moneylender gets to know the family and gets to know that communion day is coming up for young S&iacute;ofra or Donal, for example, and sells a loan to the family as a result.  In most cases, the people concerned will have access to lower interest finance through the credit unions or elsewhere.</p> <p>  The model has been adapted, therefore, because Covid-19 has resulted in no door-to-door collections.  Many of the customers of moneylenders are now making online payments and, as a result, costs are reduced.  Is now not the time, if ever there was a good time, to examine how we deal with high costs of credit?  There has been adaptation and the model is basically up in the air now.  It could, however, go back to the way it was once Covid-19 restrictions end.  The other option is that we could change the moneylending model into one that is less labour intensive and with lower costs, and, therefore, reduce the cost for consumers.  I would like Ms McEvoy's view on that point.  </p> <p>  My other question concerns the issue of Provident, which has ceased doorstep lending from this week.  It has a significant market share.  What is Ms McEvoy's view regarding the Department publishing the promised legislation to increase the cap that currently exists on credit unions?  It is mad that there is no cap on moneylenders, but there is a cap on credit unions, which only allows them to charge an APR of 12%.  I ask her to comment on increasing that cap to allow credit unions to offer more short-term loans to customers in the market for such products.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#D00100"><p>I will take the latter question first.  We are aware of that proposal.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the credit unions, but we would have no objection to the proposal as set out.  It is important that the Deputy would seek the views of the Irish League of Credit Unions and other credit union members as regards the commercial realities and practicalities of that because we would not play a role in that context.  However, on the level of principle we have no objection to it.</p> <p>  There is quite a lot in the Deputy's first point.  I agree with much of what he said, in the sense that Covid-19 has certainly impacted on the door-to-door model of moneylending.  Even more recently, we are seeing trends emerging where consumers are interacting with all financial services firms in a more digital manner.  Covid-19 expedited some of that as well.  There is an argument to be made that there are many different types of customers of moneylenders, and the Deputy alluded to some based on his knowledge and experience.  There are people who have good existing relationships with other forms of lenders, but they use moneylenders as an additional form.  There are those who are, perhaps, less fortunate and have been refused credit elsewhere and a moneylender is their only source of access to regulated finance or credit.  The Deputy asked if now is a good time.  As I said, we would be very supportive of examining any enhancements that strengthen the protections for consumers of moneylenders.  Our approach has always been that we will do so.  In our view, we have kept our regulatory and legislative regime up to date.  We have been clear about expectations.  We reacted to some of the examples the Deputy mentioned in terms of repeat lending to customers who are still on loans and so forth.  That is prohibited under the regulations we introduced last year.  From our perspective, we are very much in favour of a proportionate, but robust, regulatory model.</p> <p>  However, it is important to take into account that there are other key stakeholders in Ireland that should feed into this process.  We have been involved with colleagues from the Department of Social Protection, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, Abhaile, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many others on the high cost of credit working group so we are very happy to participate in any initiative like that.  We are supportive of the objective it is trying to achieve.  We have also engaged with the Department of Finance over the years on different proposals it put forward.  To echo the point, we would be very supportive of initiatives that seek to enhance protections for consumers in a proportionate and measured way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#D00200"><p>I have final questions on this for Ms McEvoy.  With her indulgence, it is straying from the issue of moneylenders and relates to her other role in consumer protection.  I have two questions on the insurance issue.  The issue of business interruption has not gone away.  Many are still complaining about it.  How satisfied is the Central Bank that all insurance policies it has deemed should be paid out are being paid, or does it believe that some case have to be tested in the courts before some final determinations can be made?  Perhaps she would also quantify that.</p> <p>  Second, a massive number of people are just scratching their heads and wondering what is happening.  After a long period, the Judicial Council Act 2019 was passed by the Oireachtas.  The judges have done their work.  They have reduced the cost of claims and the cost of awards is now officially reduced by 60% for minor recoverable injuries, yet we hear from businesses that their premiums are increasing and motorists who are renewing their policies are not getting the reductions that were promised by the industry.  Representatives of the industry appeared before this committee and told us bluntly, and we do not know if the figures are right, that if we are not seeing a 20% reduction, we need to be asking some serious questions.  That was based on a 50% reduction; the personal injury guidelines went further than that.</p> <p>  Turning to the Central Bank and the consumer protection role, what action is the bank taking?  Does the Central Bank have the ability to collect the data to ensure the euro for euro reduction in the level of awards that are being paid from now on has been passed on to the consumer, as opposed to just seeing the reduction in insurance premiums that might be happening from another factor that is not related to claims?  I make that point because when the British Government introduced legislation to cut the cost of whiplash injuries it passed a law to ensure that the insurance companies had to report to its central bank that the cost of premiums reduced in line with the reduction in awards.  As Ms McEvoy knows, the six largest insurance companies in Britain are also the six largest insurance companies in Ireland.  They have expectations that they must live up to in Britain in ensuring that the awards are passed on, which they do not have here.  Does the Central Bank have the ability to collect those data at that granular level and, rather than telling me or the public that insurance premiums have reduced by 4% or 5%, to know exactly that, euro for euro in terms of the awards that have come down, the reduction has been passed on to consumers?</p></speech>

First, with regard to business interruption insurance, from the outset we identified this as a key risk.  As the Deputy knows, under Covid-19 we were prompt and acted very quickly regarding our expectations of insurers, setting those out clearly in March 2020 and developing the supervisory framework.  We were clear in the framework that if there was any ambiguity, the insurer must at all times err on the side of the customer.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about test cases, we were clear that where individuals took test cases against insurers we expected that they would not be out of pocket as a result, that the insurer would be required to pay reasonable costs and, importantly, that the decision taken by the courts in the test case would be applied to all impacted customers, not just those who took the test case at the outset.  Since the courts have opined and made certain rulings on the issue of business interruption, our key priority for last year and carried forward into this year is to ensure that firms are honouring and meeting our expectations.  We have a dedicated team across multiple different skill sets in the Central Bank that is actively engaging with all firms that offer business interruption insurance and ensuring that they are meeting our expectations with regard to customer engagement and our expectation that if it is clear the cover is provided, they pay and pay promptly.  If they are awaiting decisions of the court relating to quantum, interim payments are made in lieu of or in anticipation of final authority being provided by the judge in the court.  I reiterate the point that any ambiguity errs on the side of the customer.  They are important principles enshrined in our supervisory framework for business interruption.  We continue to monitor and supervise.  We have had good engagement with the sector.  We know from our engagement with individual customers as well that the sector is meeting our expectations in many cases.  However, this is something that will span a longer period.  It will certainly span 2021.  I stress that it is a key area of supervisory focus for the Central Bank, and that will continue.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  On the second point, I may take that question away.  I know, for example, that there is quite a lot of information floating around relating to insurance and claims.  We have a national claims database, and there is quite a lot in terms of judicial review.  To give the Deputy a more accurate response, if I may I will take that question away and commit to reverting to him.</p></speech>

That is an important point.  Consumers must raise and express their concern with the firm.  If that matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the consumer, there are other supports in the wider national framework for protecting consumers.  They would then be advised and well guided, if the firm has not addressed their complaints, to refer onwards to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.</p> <p>  We are the regulator of all financial services activities in Ireland and our approach to protecting consumers is on a system-wide basis, so we look at things in aggregate.  That does not mean that if consumers have complaints, they cannot also refer them to the Central Bank, but the best course of action, in the first instance, is to approach the firm and then the FSPO.  If we receive it, we will examine the complaint and whether there is a trend or behavioural issue within the firm.  We may not always respond to the individual consumer.</p></speech>

Ms McEvoy might also address the issue of not replying to consumers.  If they go to the bother of making a complaint to the Central Bank, surely they are entitled to hear about the outcome?</p></speech>

It is an integral part of conduct supervision.  We have published findings on the outcomes of those thematic inspections and those findings will be in the form of a "Dear CEO" letter, which would send a wide message across a sector as to our expectations and findings.  Notwithstanding that the firm may not be subject to the specific themed inspection, all firms must adhere to and comply with our findings as a result of that work.  We would also pick up any issue we might have with the firm specifically and that would be on a confidential and bilateral basis.</p> <p>  In response to the Chairman's second point, we have always acknowledged complaints that have been received from individual consumers.  As I mentioned at the outset, we look at things at a system-wide level and we obviously cannot comment about engagement we might have with a particular firm because we are bound by confidentiality.  However, we would use the intelligence provided by customers to paint a picture of a firm's overarching compliance.  If we saw trends emerging or that the complaint in question was a part of a wider issue within a firm in terms of ineffective procedures or controls, poor claims handling, in the case of the example the Chairman gave, or poor customer support, they are matters on which we would engage directly and bilaterally with the firm.  We are bound by confidentiality and, therefore, it is not possible for the Central Bank to comment on its engagement with individual firms.</p></speech>

The bank does not deal with individual consumer complaints, as such.  In terms of our broad approach - which includes communications, the supervision work we carry out, updating the general public and so on - we try to capture feedback from the broad set of consumers but that individual complaint piece is not specifically part of our mandate.

There is a public communications desk in the Central Bank that deals with things more generally and we get complaints through that.  There is not a specific complaints avenue into the Central Bank on a firm-by-firm basis.  As set out in the moneylending regulations that came into force on 1 January, there is a detailed obligation on firms in terms of the frequency and process they need to carry out.  Our focus, primarily, is on checking with those firms that they are meeting their requirements by engaging with complaints and sorting out issues.  Where there is any evidence of a significant failure in that regard, that is when one sees the Central Bank's supervision work which can sometimes lead on to enforcement work.</p></speech>

We could come back to the Chairman to capture the extent of that more, but it would be quite infrequent and <i>ad hoc</i>.  Our main focus is on the firms themselves.  When activities of firms come into focus, as they can for moneylenders as well as other firms, we are not short in engaging with those firms, looking in detail at the communications and complaints they may have received from customers over time, but there is no automatic or set-out path for complaints to us from individual consumers.</p></speech>

The Central Bank plays a very important role in protecting the interests of consumers, including through our gatekeeping function, where we only allow those actors who have strong business models in place that are capable of being supervised on an ongoing basis and have a culture of compliance.  We apply robust fitness and probity assessments on individuals managing and running firms across the financial services sector.  We have very detailed and prescriptive rules in terms of guidance, regulations and code requirements, seeking to ensure firms at all times act in the best interests of their customers and treat them fairly.  We seek to ensure a strong and robust framework is in place to support the best interests of consumers.</p> <p>  We proactively and actively supervise a multitude of different sectors within our directorate.  At least 13, if not 14, different sectors are supervised within the Central Bank and specifically supervised within the consumer protection division in terms of their conduct and engagement with all of their consumers, both Irish and non-Irish.  We have a long history of very credible enforcement action relating to firms falling under our remit where we have found they are acting outside the legislation or the consumer protection code or, at its most basic, are not acting in the best interests of their customers or are not treating them fairly.  All of that information is publicly available on our website.</p> <p>  There is a national framework for protecting consumers and we are one of the actors in that framework.  The committee plays a role in terms of ensuring the legislative framework is robust and is there to guard and protect the best interests of consumers.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman plays its role in respect of dealing with individual consumer complaints across the financial services sector and we play our role in regulating the firms that provide services to customers and ensuring they meet our high standards, are proactive and positive in terms of their engagement with consumers and ensure their best interests are protected.</p></speech>

In each case, the maximum APR is listed  - the maximum cost of credit per &euro;100 borrowed - so there are good examples there that explain the mathematics of the cost of credit under those APRs for each moneylending product in the market.  We can send the Deputy details of how to access that.</p></speech>

I have not seen it.  We have seen that moneylenders can charge up to 187% APR.</p><p>There is talk of 288% when fees and charges are included.  In the past few days there were reports in <i>The Irish Times</i>regarding Provident Financial.  The country's largest moneylender has announced it will shut its doorstep lending not just here but also in Britain.  We have heard reports that there has been an increase here, as well as in Britain, in the number of complaints against moneylenders.  We know the British regulator decided to conduct an investigation.  Has anything similar been done here, such as the sanctioning of firms?  Can that level of detail be provided?  Have firms been sanctioned as a result of complaints?</p></speech>

We have taken administrative sanction action against firms in the moneylending sector.  That has included supervisory, as well as enforcement, action.  Details of any enforcement actions that firms were subject to are available on our website.  The Deputy can freely access the details of the specifics in that context.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. O'Brien, said that we have not seen a significant trend in complaints regarding the moneylending sector.  If the Deputy has evidence of trends or complaints emerging as is always the case we would welcome that she provide that evidence to us and, within our role as a regulator of the sector, we will take that information in hand and examine it as to the validity or otherwise of the complaints and ensure that our expectations are being met. </p> <p>  I need to reinforce a point.  Set out in the code are very specific criteria regarding complaints handling and how firms interact and engage with customers.  It is an important protection to have.  There are very strong expectations that we would set of firms regarding how they engage.  If people have a legitimate grievance and complaint they should at all times be treated respectfully, sympathetically and the firm should make every endeavour to address that complaint to the fullest extent possible. </p> <p>  It is worth reiterating that the door does not close to consumers.  If they feel a complaint has not been adequately addressed by the firm, they should use the supports that exist across the national wider framework for protecting consumers and use the office of the FSPO to investigate further if needs be.</p></speech>

One of the reasons credit unions began was to stop out of control interest rates being charged by moneylenders.  They have an active role in providing credit.  Credit unions are often the heart of local communities.  That is the case in my estate.  Credit unions have said they want to branch out and have a greater role in the sub-prime credit market.  I understand credit unions are currently subject to a cap of 1%.  Would the Central Bank support increasing that to 2%?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#G00400"><p>We would have no objection to that.  Ultimately, it is a matter for credit unions and the Department to engage with them regarding the feasibility or otherwise of the cap being increased.  From the Central Bank's perspective it is something to which we would have no objection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#G00500"><p>For the information of the Deputy, there is something called the it makes sense loan which credit unions have put in place.  People have to be in receipt of social welfare to participate in the scheme.  About two-thirds of credit unions have it in place.  It has been put in place to try to address the sub-prime market.  Recipients can borrow small amounts of money at credit unit rates.  It includes the option of applicants seeking credit union lending to pay off other high cost loans.  As Ms McEvoy said, it is for the credit unions to decide their business case and strategy around this.  It is part of the solution in terms of making credit available across society.</p></speech>

The Central Banks always says that a vigorous approach to competition policy leads to better outcomes for consumers.  My next question does not relate to this particular Bill.  Ms McEvoy has a background in investment funds and I would be interested in hearing her thoughts.  It is an issue that is very much on the agenda and in the news at the moment.</p> <p>  A variety of people have said that when it comes to housing there is a preferential tax system for investment funds.  There is concern that the tax system places ordinary householders and buyers at a competitive disadvantage relative to investor funds.  The Master of the High Court said the EU Commission could take a case against Ireland for its preferential tax treatment of such investment firms.  </p> <p>  The Central Bank cannot change tax policy.  From the perspective of competition and consumer protections, what recommendations has the Central Bank made to the Government regarding its housing policy?</p></speech>

Tax matters do not fall within our remit.  The current state of the housing market poses significant challenges for people and individuals seeking access to it.  I ask the Deputy to allow us to take that away and come back to her on that matter separately.  It is outside what I understood the remit of this discussion to be.  The Central Bank has engaged with Government more generally on housing matters, in particular when housing matters impact on mortgage measures and those types of areas.  It would be better suited to a bilateral engagement within the Deputy or another discussion by the committee.</p></speech>

The primary purpose of today's meeting is for us to hear the view of the Central Bank on the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill.  My understanding is that it welcomes proposals to protect consumers but has two concerns.  First, it is concerned that lowering the APR may be ineffective and counter-productive and may not lower the total cost of credit.  The second concern is that it may lead to financial exclusion.  In respect of the first concern, what type of legislation does the Central Bank believe would be appropriate in lowering the total cost of credit in the circumstances we are discussing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051200002#G01000"><p>I thank the Deputy.  To reiterate the point, we would support any legislative regime that strengthens and enhances protections for consumers.  As I mentioned earlier, we do not have the legislative power to impose a cap.  Any imposition of a cap would be a matter for lawmakers and politicians in that context.</p> <p>  I understand from the discussion earlier with Deputy Doherty that the proposals set out in the original Bill are being revised.  To look at APR in isolation could be ineffective and counter-productive, as Deputy O'Callaghan said.  A cap might, in one sense, provide one degree of stability but that can easily be circumvented by extending the duration of the loan.  In the long term a customer may pay back a loan over a longer term than he or she would in other circumstances.  That can often be the byproduct of the imposition of a cap. </p> <p>  Any proposals around this should be considered at a holistic level by all relevant stakeholders across Ireland.  We have undertaken quite a bit of research in terms of workshops with industry in 2018 and with Am&aacute;rach Research in 2013. T he UK has done quite a bit of work on the whole area of APR and their understanding and meaning, in particular in the context of high cost credit loans. </p> <p>  I do not have an alternative proposal, but I would caution that a proportionate and measured approach be taken.  The certainty afforded to the total cost of credit regime supports a borrower because he or she knows at the outset what he or she is borrowing and what it is going to cost.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the existing framework does not allow for the charging of late or default charges, which is an important protection for consumers.  </p></speech>

It falls outside our remit.  We would always support and provide technical assistance on draft legislation, in whatever form.  From our perspective, our regulatory regime has been strengthened and enhanced on a number of occasions over a number of years.  We are very much in the space of greater transparency and greater disclosure to empower consumers and make them aware that this is a high cost of credit and that there are supports elsewhere in the system if needed; to ensure rigour and additional regulation around firms to signal that these are high-cost loans; and to ensure the firms have appropriate marketing strategies that are not marketed at certain groups of customers.  We try to ensure that companies do not issue loans, or give pre-approval or pre-credit for a new loan, to a customer who is already paying off an existing loan.  This is to restrict or stifle that spiralling effect that can often happen whereby people, particularly customers of moneylenders, might find themselves in a downward spiral.</p></speech>

We have provision in law that requires the Central Bank to ensure that costs are not excessive.  This is very much done at the outset when a new entrant seeks access to the market and also upon renewal.  When the firms seek to launch new products we will review the product and make a judgment on the costs of that product and whether it is excessive.  This is very much done in comparison to the market average and the market costs, and the costs being charged by other actors in the market.</p> <p>  Aside from that, I believe that if the intention is to impose a cap or to restrict the total cost of credit, it is probably best served by way of a legislative amendment.</p></speech>

In the first instance one needs to look at who are the users of moneylenders.  There are many different types of users in that context.  Some have existing arrangements already with banks and with credit unions.  They may be paying back mortgages but they use money lending as an additional source of credit.  Some customers will have been refused credit already by the traditional banks or credit unions, or they may have a poor credit history and would not be granted further credit by those institutions.  They may have no other option than to secure sources of credit provided by moneylenders.  My expectation and my wish would be that every consumer in Ireland, at all times, deals and engages with a regulated financial service provider where they have the full suite of protections afforded to them through the Central Bank's regime in this context.  Nobody wants a situation where people find themselves excluded and perhaps having no other option but to turn to entities or individual firms that are not regulated by the Central Bank, and losing those protections.  I believe that would be the worst possible outcome.</p></speech>

Behind Bainne Beatha, our campaign for improved breastfeeding support services in Irish maternity units, are four working mothers: me, Megan Etherton, Lucia Prihodova and Felicienne Rahill.  We launched in February 2021, and are running this in our spare time without funding or political affiliations.  We are not a breast is best group.  We respect a parent&rsquo;s choice to formula, combination or breastfeed.  However, the Irish maternity service does not appear consistently to support those who wish to breastfeed.<br/><br/>We hear often about Ireland&rsquo;s breastfeeding rates being the lowest in Europe, but there is judgement of mothers in that language.  Mothers in Ireland know about the importance of breastfeeding, and according to the Irish Maternity Indicator System, IMIS, report, at 63.8%, the majority of them do initiate breastfeeding, but by the time they leave the hospital, this figure is almost halved to 37.3%.  What happens in those days between birth and discharge from the hospital?  Our report, personal experiences and the stories we have heard since launching provide some insight into the reasons behind this sharp decline.  We would like to share some of those insights with the committee and five key asks of our Government and action by the Houses of the Oireachtas to make vital interventions.<br/><br/>From our report, 37% of mothers reported that midwives were too busy and overworked to provide the assistance needed.  A quote:</p> <blockquote> 	I have had 3 babies and while the hospital did support breastfeeding, I never saw a lactation consultant despite requests each time.  I was a section mum so in for several days - never available.  Saying you support is not the same as providing hands-on support. Midwives were v good but v busy with everything else. </blockquote> <p>I also experienced this on the birth of my first child.  Therefore our first ask is for adequate staffing, and for the number of international board-certified lactation consultants to be increased in line with international benchmarks and to be accessible in all Irish maternity units.<br/><br/>One in three mothers in our report received conflicting advice about how to breastfeed.  One respondent said that &quot;All of the midwives said different things which was really hard to filter through as a new mother&quot;.  I too faced conflicting advice during my time in hospital.  Our second ask is to see mandatory evidence-based continuing professional development on breastfeeding for midwives and certified lactation consultants.<br/><br/>In our report, one in three mothers were offered formula despite stating their wishes to breastfeed.  One mother wrote, &quot;New mothers shouldn&rsquo;t need an advocate to defend their intention to breastfeed, fending off formula or conflicting advice from the 'experts' when they are exhausted and post partum in the middle of their baby&rsquo;s first night.&quot;  I too left the hospital formula-feeding my baby against my wishes.  Our third ask is a national audit of the implementation of the national infant feeding policy for maternity and neonatal services, and a review of the promotion and distribution of formula practices across all maternity units.<br/><br/>The national maternity experience survey of 2020 results showed 47.3% of women did not know how to give feedback or make a complaint about their maternity care.  Therefore our fourth ask is for the national maternity experience survey to expand to evaluate comprehensively service user experiences of breastfeeding support in maternity care, and to have service user representation on the national breastfeeding implementation group for current and future action plans.<br/><br/>In our report, we found 60% of mothers sought help with breastfeeding privately, spending an average of &euro;440.  I personally had to spend almost &euro;700 to be able to breastfeed after a difficult experience in hospital.  Maternity units can be a level playing field, offering a great opportunity to reach a cross section of the 60,000 plus women who give birth in Ireland each year and to extend the opportunity to anyone who wishes to breastfeed.  Therefore our final and most important ask is for the full implementation and assessment of the breastfeeding action plan to ensure proactive, skilled, timely breastfeeding assistance for mothers and babies, regardless of location, demographic or ability to pay.<br/><br/>There are amazing midwives, public health nurses, voluntary support groups, including Cuidi&uacute;, representatives of which are present today, and lactation consultants who manage to save mothers&rsquo; breastfeeding journeys after their difficult experience in hospital.  However, thousands are falling through the net every year, bringing about added potential health risks for mothers and their babies.  Not investing in this crucial period is a sure-fire way to guarantee we are cutting our breastfeeding rates within hours of birth.  We need to flip the narrative which blames mothers and instead address low breastfeeding support rates in Ireland.  Breastfeeding is a component of the national maternity strategy, the strategy on women and girls from the Department of Justice, the national obesity plan and the national cancer plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party identified breastfeeding as a priority in the programme for Government and we would like to see them honour this commitment.<br/><br/>We are grateful for the opportunity to be able to share these stories with the committee.  Now we are looking for the full implementation of what has been promised in the national maternity strategy and the breastfeeding action plan.  Breastfeeding reduces risks of multiple health issues for mothers and babies and they deserve the protection of the Government.</p></speech>

Healthy newborn infants are born with a host of natural reflexes and instincts that help them to breastfeed.

Our BFCs offer telephone support and host breastfeeding support groups and coffee mornings throughout the country.  During the recent pandemic, most groups swiftly pivoted to online support.

The parts that particularly relate to Cuidi&uacute; are as follows: "3.5 Provide infant feeding antenatal education for all pregnant women."  This has been allocated to the acute hospitals but there is also a place for Cuidi&uacute;, and other services, to provide breastfeeding education; "3.6 Develop a clear referral pathway for mothers requiring additional breastfeeding support before and after birth, to Lactation Consultants."  Again, we would see that Cuidi&uacute; could have a role here, giving us clear guidelines as to who we can and should refer to, and also having GPs and public health nurses, PHNs, refer to us when mums need support rather than clinical help; "3.9 Provide breastfeeding support groups in all CHO areas through: Maternity and public health nursing services. Grant agreement with voluntary organisations such as La Leche League and Cuidi&uacute;. Provide social support groups through grant agreement with Friends of Breastfeeding."  Cuidi&uacute; and the other groups have been working steadily in this area over many years now with support from the HSE.  We note, however, that the funding has been steadily decreasing while expectations grow; and, "3.11 Implement evidence-informed programmes and initiatives to promote breastfeeding, provide support and address barriers for women least likely to breastfeed."  We would see a role for Individuals who have been trained by Cuidi&uacute;, in being part of a multidisciplinary task force of stakeholders who have expertise and can help communities to set up their own support systems.</p></speech>

By supporting mothers to breastfeed, nearly 50% of diarrhoea episodes and a third of respiratory infections would be avoided.  Breastfeeding has been found to reduce the risk of childhood obesity and diabetes.  Breastfeeding contributes to delayed return of menstruation and, thereby, to birth spacing.  <i>The Lancet</i>has estimated that 20,000 breast cancer deaths could be prevented annually as a result of optimal breastfeeding.  <i>The Lancet </i>reported that shorter durations of breastfeeding for children were associated with a 2.6 point loss in intelligence quotient, IQ, scores.  We see Cuidi&uacute; being a partner in achieving the above goals for the Government and the new plan that will be organised going forward from 2022.</p></speech>

I have discussed this with a number of women because obviously they are better able to tell me about these things.  Some women have a preference for breastfeeding but some do not.

We do not give information to people about the risks of formula feeding so women are not making an informed choice.  Let us remember that breastfeeding is a human right of the baby and that is declared in the Innocenti Declaration of 1990.  It is a baby's human right to be breastfed.  While it is a woman's choice to breastfeed, if women do not have the information on the risks that they are causing their babies then they cannot make proper choices.</p></speech>

I am a little concerned that women would feel hustled into a situation.  I would like to see a situation whereby women had a choice.  I mean that all of the information that is needed would be made available to women to enable them to make an informed choice and that is what I would seek.</p></speech>

Let us remember that fewer people breastfeed than use  formula milk or feed artificially.  I do not understand where the choice comes in because choice already exists and fewer people choose to breastfeed.  While women might want a choice they are not being given it, and supported, to make the choice to breastfeed.  The <i>status quo</i>is formula feeding.  That is what everybody reverts to so I cannot see where the Deputy is coming from in his argument about choice because, in fact, it is being able to choose to breastfeed that is the problem, not the other way around.</p></speech>

There definitely are camps that have been set up that divide women into groups of "breast is best" versus "fed is best", which does not benefit either the mother or the baby.  We believe that women generally are aware of the benefits of breastfeeding and are very much encouraged to breastfeed but are extremely let down in maternity hospitals.</p><p>Sometimes there is shock from being led along the path of being told they would be helped and that women should do it because it is wonderful but then the choice to breastfeed is taken away because the women are left without any help or resources.  That does not happen in every case but in many of them.  We just want to level the playing field and, as Ms Cahill has pointed, ensure the choice to breastfeed is available to women.</p></speech>

In the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that breastfeeding is something close to my heart and I have nursed four children through various mechanisms because of different influences.  I will come back to that as we go through the questions.</p> <p>  I agree that choice is key but that choice must be fully informed.  The education should start before a woman becomes pregnant or a baby is born.  At a much younger age we should educate women about breastfeeding and how it can fit into a lifestyle, along with the difficulties it may present.  Having a baby disrupts a lifestyle as people may know it.  We can accept that and the universal health benefits to both the baby and the mother.</p> <p>  There is now a position where women are leaving hospitals, where most births take place, much earlier than they would have before.  That golden window of time and the first few days before a woman's milk comes in fully are absolutely key.  If there is no support or ineffective support, we will simply not have the level of breastfeeding we want to see and we need to see taken at that early stage.  The more women we have breastfeeding at the start clearly leads to higher rates of longer term breastfeeding.  That is a question that must be addressed.</p> <p>  I had conversations with various people before coming here this morning but I know from personal experience that we must see a societal shift in how we view, support and encourage breastfeeding mothers and remove some of the barriers that exist.  Another Deputy told me yesterday of her experience breastfeeding, and I told her how I nursed one of my children on the floor of a shopping centre, which was unacceptable.  That is an example of a real barrier that could be quite easily challenged or changed.  Again, it would rely on a societal shift.</p> <p>  We can consider the professional needs that exist, including lactation consultants, counsellors and peer support, and they must be matched on the other side with a societal shift in how we view breastfeeding.  I agree with Ms Byrne that we need an audit of the infant feeding policies of hospitals.  I would like to see formula being offered as opposed to being the predominantly accepted way in which a mother would feed a child.  It absolutely should be there and there is a role for it but it should be available on request.  Many more women would breastfeed if they knew they would be fully supported from those very early days right through whatever length of time they chose to nurse their children.</p> <p>  We must also have a review of our tax system to go with that.  We need to look at how it is we apply VAT to the likes of hospital-grade breast pumps, breast pads and nipple guards.  These are all tools to help a woman breastfeed for longer.  We do not acknowledge they exist and we certainly do not encourage women to use them.  Although we acknowledge there is a problem, we need to get to the point where women know they exist.</p> <p>  I say this as a woman whose second child was in the special care baby unit, SCBU, and due to various medical influences at the time, I was pumping and dumping.  I never knew I could hire a hospital-grade breast pump until somebody happened to mention it to me in passing.  It is a question for us to consider.  When we look to address these challenges and encourage women, we must be more varied in our thinking and have a more multifaceted approach to how we do this.  When we identify a challenge or barrier, we must approach it with evidence-based and target-based outcomes for what we want to see.</p> <p>  I spoke to a number of providers of breastfeeding support equipment and it was interesting that their view is the practice must be more accessible with better uptake.  When a woman experiences a problem without support or education, the first reaction is to stop, which presents a real challenge.  It is something we should take on board and listen to women about.</p> <p>  We must challenge the information and disinformation out there.  There is a lot of information bandied about and some of it is based on tutti-frutti or pie-in-the-sky type of stuff, and that must be challenged.  We must also actively promote the positive aspects of breastfeeding, which are varied.  When we speak of breastfeeding we tend to concentrate on the challenges but there are many positive aspects of breastfeeding.</p> <p>  We also need to see a network of professional supports.  Community healthcare organisations, CHOs, were mentioned and mine runs from Westmeath to Louth, so I ask for a significantly greater network than asking a woman in Westmeath to travel to Drogheda.  These networks must be accessible, fit for purpose and almost tailored to what a lady needs.  No two women encountering difficulties with breastfeeding will have the same problem, so such networks must be professional and easily accessible.  The people involved must be aware of a lady's need.</p> <p>  GPs and public health nurses are wonderful people but they must have more education and be aware of the supports in the communities in which they work.  When they encounter a lady experiencing difficulties, they should be able to refer her to the support groups, even if they are peer support groups.  They should also put the idea in the mind of a lady who is doing well that she might be able to encourage other women in her network who might be struggling a little bit.  We must have greater education around the supports and ask those who are doing well to relay their experience and perhaps promote breastfeeding.</p> <p>  I would like to see a new mother pack for every new mother in the country.  This would be a small pack with various travel-sized bits and pieces.  In that pack there should be more information on breastfeeding.  It could include a couple of breast pads or a nipple protector.  Something along those lines should be included in those packs.  This recognises there are women breastfeeding, feeding with formula or a combination of both.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their time as this has been a very informative discussion.  I hope to meet them again.</p></speech>

Cuidi&uacute;'s role in the community is to provide continuity of care, including to mothers coming from hospital.  Not only that, we provide education and support ahead of birth.  A big section of our organisation is antenatal education and we also give postnatal support.  Cuidi&uacute; sees community care and continuity of care as important.  As the Deputy and Ms Cahill have said, this is about information, and if mums do not have the information, they cannot be in a place to make a decision.  We need to improve the support we give to mothers ahead of birth.</p> <p>  Our group is really trying to remove isolation, not only arising from a lack of family support but also through women feeling they are not getting support with their breastfeeding.</p><p>This is one of the aims of Cuidi&uacute; and something we strive to continue to do.  We are trying to protect the mental health of mothers as well as the health of their babies and the physical health of mothers through breastfeeding.  As an organisation we are trying to hit all of these marks.</p><p> The funding we get is terrific and we are delighted with it.  It is fantastic to hear that &euro;1.58 million is being put into breastfeeding and that the WHO code will be fully adopted.  However, it is only a drop in the ocean.  Society needs to change its attitude towards breastfeeding.  Human milk is for human babies.  There is no two ways about it.  There are many reasons human milk is for human babies.  Anything else is substitute.  I agree that some people may feel under pressure but, as we have said, if they do not have any information, it takes away their choices.  We are all for choice and nobody wants anybody to do something they are not happy or comfortable to do.  As has been said, feeding on a shop floor is not acceptable so who will be comfortable breastfeeding if they have to feed in a toilet?  We have all heard the stories time and again.  It is disgraceful that in 2021 we still hear them.  These are the issues we have to address and move on from.</p></speech>

She mentioned the cost of breastfeeding and we have spoken about this previously with regard to the material required.  It has been a significant barrier.  In my opening statement, I mentioned that 60% of mothers who responded had to spend an average of &euro;440.  If a mother is struggling financially in any way, &euro;500 is a lot of money to have to hand when in a vulnerable state and already spending a lot of money on all of the baby paraphernalia required.  Breastfeeding is spoken about as the cheaper option but until the supports are in place so they can be accessed in hospitals and through community and peer groups, and all the areas are covered, mothers have to hire private lactation consultants and hire or buy pumps.  This adds up.  We agree that currently the price of it is exclusive and it should not be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#D00300"><p>One of the points I want to come back to is the interaction between the agencies and the voluntary groups.  We have some representation.  For instance, Cuidi&uacute; sits on a committee in the children's hospital in Tallaght but does not appear to have representation in Our Lady's children's hospital.  We sit on some of the maternity units but not all.  As volunteers it is quite difficult to get people to volunteer to be parent representatives on these committees but it is vital that women's voices are heard in this sphere.  In the past year, none of these committees has sat anyway as everything seems to have stopped, just like the public health nurses who do the well-baby care visits are no longer always doing so because they have been shifted to Covid and vaccination programmes.  Our mothers and babies are left in the community with absolutely no support.  Having to resort to a private lactation consultant is fine if people have the funding but if they do not have the funds, it means they go completely without help, including State help.  A lot needs to be done on hospital interaction with voluntary groups and with private lactation consultants.  There needs to be a multipronged approach so that stakeholder voices are heard rather than deciding from the top down what is needed in the country.</p></speech>

Given that our breastfeeding rates are disappointingly low at present, we have to wonder how much lower they would be if the voluntary groups were not involved.  At an official level in the health service clearly there are major gaps in the supports that should be available as a matter of course.  From this point of view I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing, as they are making a significant contribution.</p> <p>  I want to direct questions to Bainne Beatha.  I thank the witnesses for the documentation they sent in and for the report.  What do they think are the impacts on mothers who do not receive adequate breastfeeding support in hospital?  This seems to be the key period.  We know a large majority of women intend to breastfeed during pregnancy and when they go into hospital but at the point they are leaving hospital and going home these figures have dropped significantly.  Will the witnesses speak to us about this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deborah Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#D01000"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Cuidi&uacute; might also respond because it sees mothers after the hospital experience.  When we launched in February, we received an onslaught of messages and we continue to do so.  They are very lengthy messages and some are based on multiple births dating back years.  What has come across very strongly is a feeling of grief and trauma.  There is new research going into breastfeeding grief, which can last for many years.  Part of it is the feeling that choice was taken away.  Mothers might have decided to breastfeed but because of not receiving the support they needed they felt abandoned and vulnerable.  They feel isolated, particularly at present.  People very much look to the experts for guidance when at a vulnerable stage.  They might be after operations and after labour.  They are physically recovering.  They may have sleep deprivation.  New mothers are presented with a little infant and they have to figure out how to care for it.  It is very overwhelming.  To feel abandoned and to ask for help and not receive it is a very painful experience, particularly if someone has really hoped to breastfeed and then have the choice taken away.  These are some of the feelings we have heard.</p></speech>

This is how much we see it as an issue.  We as a voluntary organisation are looking at the mental health of parents and we are going to train our breastfeeding counsellors in trauma and how to deal with it.</p><p>It is not something we would have had to do 20 years ago perhaps, but it has been coming to the fore in the last ten years or so.  It is getting more and more difficult, and this trauma-informed care also needs to be part of our HSE system.  I am not sure, however, if it is looking at this aspect, and yet the voluntary organisations are.  Therefore, there is work to be done in this regard.</p></speech>

However, there is an action plan on breastfeeding.  The difficulty is with the slow pace of implementing it.  This committee can play a role in respect of taking this issue up with the Department.  Has anyone got an estimate of the cost of fully implementing the action plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#E00300"><p>Ms Etherton would like to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Megan Etherton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#E00400"><p>In our capacity as service users and running the campaigns, it is not within our remit or capability to assign costs to the action plan.  The biggest gap in understanding regarding the potential cost of the action plan is the lack of reporting on progress to date.  The most recent report we could find dates from 2017.  The HSE has offered to forward us the implementation reports we have not been able to find online, but which we have been told are public.  It would appear to a lay person that the costliest elements of any strategy will concern ongoing staffing costs.  A key part of the action plan we would like to see implemented is proper staffing and to see the ratio of births to support staff increase.  We were very happy with last night's announcement of the additional lactation consultant posts for maternity units.</p> <p>  However, the births to support staff ratio is not defined within the action plan.  It is difficult, therefore, to quantify what level of support we might be aiming for.  The New Zealand ratio was used as the benchmark for the additional posts announced last night.  It seems most important, however, to focus on the impact of not investing in this regard.  What will be the opportunity cost if we do not invest in women initiating breastfeeding?  That is not just a financial cost.  There are potential long-term impacts on the health service in respect of the health outcomes that women are missing out on by not being able to feed.  I refer to cancer risks, potential osteoporosis and also impacts on the health of the child.  There is an ongoing burden for the health service in that respect.  Obesity is also another long-term concern, and that is connected with last night's announcement regarding the Healthy Ireland concept and Sl&aacute;intecare.  </p> <p>  We are also talking, however, about the environmental impact of endorsing all this use of formula, when it is not necessarily wanted or needed by every woman.  It should definitely be available as an option, but we are now forcing people to use formula who might not necessarily want or need to do that.  In addition to increased healthcare costs, there is also the question of how not investing in our human capital impacts our society.  The financial costs involved in this regard must be considered as well.  In some situations, significant costs are associated with breastfeeding, but we must also consider the ongoing cost of formula use for a family that may not want to take that approach.  Equally, there is also the trauma we have just been speaking about.  We could go through numerous stories from women who shared their experiences with us and how long those experiences have been sitting with them.  They have told us that it has been such a relief to get this off their chests and to process their experiences.  </p> <p>  As Ms Cahill mentioned, Cuidi&uacute; has recognised that aspect and the impact of the trauma.  We would like to see some comparison made between the cost of the action plan on one hand and then the cost of not investing in this area on the other.  We must understand the cost of not breastfeeding, and that has been done in other countries.  Endeavours such as the World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative exist to allow us to benchmark how we are progressing and to see some transparency in respect of our progress.  We are obviously headed in the right direction with these new lactation consultant posts, but we need to be able to see the outcome of a comparison and understand exactly where we are now.  That is what is needed.</p></speech>

I have two more brief questions.  First, the research Bainne Beatha has done is excellent.  It is a really good report and I thank the witnesses for sending it to the committee.  Turning to the wider context of academic research, what added value does an informal project undertaken by Bainne Beatha, Cuidi&uacute; or any of the other support groups provide to the formal health system?  My second question concerns the issue of formula.  To what extent do the witnesses think that commercial interests are having a bearing on policy in this regard?  I refer not only to breastfeeding in Ireland, but also in other countries, where there may be a commercial interest in the export of formula.</p></speech>

This undertaking was never intended as research.  We have a disclaimer in the report stating this was an informal questionnaire that Ms Byrne created and then the project grew legs.  The respondents self-selected, and the results we have were determined by those people who wished to share their stories, and those were potentially more likely to be the more negative stories.  However, the national maternity survey 2020 has shown that over 40% of women did not know how to submit feedback about their maternity experience.  Our initiative therefore fills a gap in the absence of any larger project exploring the experience of breastfeeding support in hospitals.  Women would not be pouring their grief out on Instagram if there was some other way in which their experiences were being fed up to a national level, being acted upon and associated changes implemented in a realistic way.</p> <p>  The national maternity experience survey does not ask about specific breastfeeding experiences in maternity hospitals and that is a gap in the research.  We hope this qualitative information provides an impetus for a larger and more comprehensive study which will explore the characteristics of the environment.  Rather than just focusing on women who do or do not breastfeed, we want to understand the larger factors at work in this regard.  I refer to women coming out of a hospital, being told their experience may not have been as they might have wanted it to go, and that if their babies are being fed with formula, or however, they should be happy with that and that their babies are healthy and happy and what are they complaining about.  That type of attitude just negates the whole experience for women who may have intended to breastfeed.  Providing an open and independent questionnaire, as we did, allowed those mothers to speak freely and get these experiences off their chests.  It does allow people to coalesce around the issue, and I guess that is why we are here and why these stories have grown legs.  </p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's second question about formula, I will pass that over to be answered by Ms Byrne, Ms Cahill or Ms Rea from Cuidi&uacute;.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, these new lactation consultants are likely to be midwives as well, and therefore are also likely to have a midwifery role in addition to a lactation consultant role.  Sometimes, that midwifery role takes precedence over the lactation consultation role, which is what has happened with those consultants in post already.  They are not roles purely devoted to lactation consulting.  The people <i>in situ</i>are there in other roles, and the aspect of lactation consultant is almost an add-on element.  There might be one dedicated lactation consultant in Cork, one in the National Maternity Hospital and one in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, and those are the only people who have roles purely as lactation consultants and not as midwives as well.  The joint role of lactation consultant and midwife is muddying the waters for the postholders, because sometimes they have to go to a birth when instead they would like to be there in the role of going to see a mum postnatally with her baby.  That is not always possible.  Therefore, we must clarify these international board certified lactation consultants posts more than we do now.</p></speech>

It is fantastic that we have seen some movement from the Department on this with the announcement last night.  That is in no small part down to the huge amount of highlighting and work that both of our organisations have done on this issue.  Well done to them.</p> <p>  I want to go into that issue a little bit more.  Certainly, my experience was that the midwife is the first point of contact in those first few moments when a mother meets her baby.  The midwife is one's first direction about how to do all this.  I wish to talk a little bit about the role of the midwife.  The importance of the lactation consultant being a separate post is a point well made.  It seems to me that midwives will all have a role to play here.  Ms Rea spoke about the announcement last night being a drop in the ocean.  If midwives are the first circle that a person meets, perhaps the second circle includes community nurses and GPs, who have such a central role in many women's experience but who are often hugely overworked and underresourced.</p> <p>  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions.  In the next few years as we move into Sl&aacute;intecare, how do they see those tiers of influence in women's experience?  How can we support midwives to all be lactation consultants?  How can we carve out lactation consultants who have only that job to do?  What would that other support for GPs and community nurses look like?</p></speech>

Even the lady who does the cleaning on the maternity wards needs to have some training in breastfeeding because she is interacting with a new mum.  Even if all she ever says to her is that she is doing great, that makes a difference to a mother's experience.  We need, therefore, training at every level, particularly at the neonatal level and the obstetrician and GP level.</p> <p>  Very few GPs will refer women to lactation consultants.  They will refer for a skin disease or a little knobbly bit somewhere on a person's body and yet, women go into GPs with nipples that are literally torn apart and they do not refer them to a lactation consultant.  There is something missing in their education that GPs do not value this role of the specialist in breastfeeding.  That seems to happen right throughout the whole system.</p> <p>  Midwives are crucial and play a pivotal role in breastfeeding.  They do a tremendous job with the lack of resources they have.  Some of them will be really interested in breastfeeding and will go to loads of education sessions.   Some of them will not be that interested and will concentrate on the birth and pregnancy care, which is their main role.  We need them to have some education.  The lactation role is very separate and very postnatal, however.  That specialism is needed in order that people can get educated and develop their own skills and competencies in that area.</p> <p>  My view is that the competencies have not been put in place.  We have education into which people can go.  It is out there all the time.  However, we have not put in place competencies and we are not checking people's competencies.  The World Health Organization has much of that and the World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative, WBTI, looks at it.  Many tools are, therefore, available.  It is up to us to start using them.  That needs the Government to show the willingness to take that step to look at competencies.</p></speech>

A lack of data and of reporting on progress seems to be a recurring theme.  I am very much a supporter of evidence-based policymaking, which is built on data.  Data is a huge challenge to the system if we do not have it readily available.  The counterbalance to that, however, is creating a space within a system in terms of service development that listens to the lived experience of people who are having babies.</p> <p>  I believe Ms Cahill said earlier that there are some hospitals in which she has a role or is included in the conversation and others in which she is not.  I am interested in what Ms Cahill would like to see in terms of data gathering.  In terms of that counterbalance, how can we integrate women's actual experiences of the system into decision-making around service provision through both the Sl&aacute;intecare model of community health services, but also within hospitals?</p></speech>

People doing PhDs carry out research every day of the week .  It is all available in places like Trinity College Dublin.  We know people who are doing research.  It is about getting people within the Government to read that research and interpret it in a way that applies to policy.  There seems to be a gap in research into policy.</p> <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, used to do much work in this area.  I am not sure it is being funded to do any work in that area at the moment .  Again, that is a lack of knowledge on my part but it is also that idea of not giving us full information because we do not know.  We used to have a multi-stakeholder national breastfeeding committee but that is gone.  It does not exist anymore.  We do not, therefore, know what is happening in the field.  That data needs to be gathered.  Again, however, it is also the Government's-----</p></speech>

I welcome all the witnesses from Bainne Beatha and Cuidi&uacute;.</p> <p>  I am conscious that I am male.  I considered handing the slot over to one of my female colleagues, particularly as my wife and I, unfortunately, have not been lucky enough to have children.  I felt, however, that men also have an important role here because there are men in positions of influence within the Department of Health and the HSE.</p> <p>  On that point, would the witnesses agree that perhaps husbands and male partners of mothers, who have experience of their partners breastfeeding, are more likely to be sympathetic to the issues?  If men in positions of power have that experience, they are possibly more likely to be able to influence or be sympathetic to that issue.  That is the first point I will make.</p> <p>  What would be regarded as best practice internationally?  Is there any particular country?  Is it all a matter of finances?  Am I right in suggesting that witnesses would wish for full-time lactation consultants working exclusively in that role, who are available 24-7 in maternity hospitals and in the community after mother and baby go home?  Is this the gold standard that should be in place right across the country?</p></speech>

We, in our campaign, are very aware that we are preaching to the masses.  All of our Instagram followers tend to be female.  Many men have signed the campaign once they became aware of it.  The Senator has mentioned that it was his first instinct to hand this issue over to somebody else because it is not his area of expertise and he has no direct experience.  I am delighted to see that he changed his mind because we need male champions of change.  In the same way that the mother and baby dyad needs a partner to support them, and actually a whole village of support around them, to help the mother and baby achieve breastfeeding, the whole idea of breastfeeding and making a societal change needs everybody involved because, as we mentioned earlier, the knock-on effects of breastfeeding or not breastfeeding affect everyone.  Breastfeeding is a health equity issue that is not just limited to the mothers and infants that we are talking about.</p> <p>  In response to the question, potentially, it is easier for people who have had some direct experience of breastfeeding, whether they are male or female, to engage with this and feel that they have either a right or a responsibility to engage with it.  We have tried to make breastfeeding as accessible to anyone regardless of their experience, and regardless of whether they used formula, would like to use formula, did breastfeed, did not breastfeed, will not breastfeed, do not have children, plan on having children or whatever.  Breastfeeding is a bigger societal issue so our goal is to make sure that it is accessible and to get people, like the Senator, on board and feel engaged in the issue, and feel entitled to speak about the issue. </p></speech>

We very much see the partner's role as hugely important.  Support is key when it comes to breastfeeding.  It is very difficult to start out on one's breastfeeding journey alone without any support and who better to be one's primary supporter than one's partner?  In that regard, our membership is made up of families as opposed to just mothers.</p> <p>  Yes, lactation consultations must be available and, ideally, without cost or through a system where cost is not the reason people do not lift the phone to ask for help.  Primarily, from the hospital, we would have a referral pathway and midwives would send mothers home with a list of numbers for them to call, and GPs would have a list of numbers for the mothers to call.  All that would be great so there is never a question in any mother's mind that if she needs help and support, she has numerous numbers to ring, and will get support without question.</p> <p>  Mothers should be checked on more regularly.  There are baby checks and a six-week check for mums but we do not have check-ups where mums are asked how they are getting on with breastfeeding, whether they need support with breastfeeding or are having difficulties.  Many people will not speak up if they are not asked questions and they may feel that they lack something because they are unable to breastfeed.  We all know that breastfeeding is difficult to start with and having someone checking to see how one is getting on would really encourage mothers to avail of  support.  Also, word would go out that it is not unusual to need support with breastfeeding.  We are busy in Cuidi&uacute;.  Ms Cahill has been involved for 30 years and I have been involved for 20 years.  We can attest to the fact that many mothers have come through the system and gone on to train as counsellors, which is lovely.</p> <p>  Education is hugely important.  All of the lactation consultants in Ireland, as part of their qualification, re-certify every year with Continuing Education Recognition Points, CERPs, and by exam every five years.  We continually go to study days and educate ourselves because things change.  Breastfeeding is not rocket science but one learns more about it as the years go by and we top up our education.  All of the Cuidi&uacute; tutors make sure that they keep up to date with the latest research and avail of the latest conferences to educate themselves.  The same should happen for health nurses, GPs and midwives.  Twenty hours of breastfeeding education is not sufficient and that is perfectly clear.</p></speech>

I presume that it is not non-existent.  Does it need to be improved?</p></speech>

Yes, there is lots of education going on but breastfeeding is not promoted in the way that it should be.  Certainly, over the last year with Covid, classes have been delivered online and have worked well.  Obviously face-to-face classes would be better but we are trying to bridge the gaps.  We need continuity of what we are telling mothers and what they see in action, which is where there is a huge gap.  We are telling mums about their choices in antenatal classes yet when they arrive into maternity units to have their babies and try to breastfeed, what they are told is not the same as the information we give them and choice has been taken away from them.  A lot of the time midwives do not have time to spend with mothers.  I do not blame the midwives, they do a fantastic job.  However, staffing and education are issues.  What difference does the first bottle of top-up formula milk make to a baby?  Why should we not do that?  What should the first few hours of birth look like?  What should the start be for a baby?  Babies are not born starving.  The provision of simple information would have a huge impact on the start of a baby's life and on the start of a mother's breastfeeding journey.</p></speech>

For instance, Cork started providing antenatal education last week for the first time since Covid started.  So there has been a gap in the health system and nobody has had a class in Cork, from the hospital, since Covid started.  The classes are very infrequent anyway, and the number involved is very large.  We need to consider antenatal education in the health system as a whole both for birth and breastfeeding.</p></speech>

I asked my friend who works in the medical circle many questions on this topic and gave them my thoughts on the matter as breastfeeding is such a raw and lived experience for people, not one of which I have direct experience.  I cast the net far and wide, and the responses were revealing.  People mentioned two areas when I told them that this meeting was coming up.  There was the issue of support for the person who wishes to breastfeed her baby and the need for structural supports that support continued breastfeeding.</p> <p>  I commend my colleagues in F&oacute;rsa on the campaign for breastfeeding rights for special needs assistants, SNAs, that equal those enjoyed by teachers.  While we are talking about a breastfeeding strategy and stuff there is a huge role to be played in terms of the wider population and workplace to properly support anyone who wishes to breastfeed and express their milk.</p> <p>  One of the questions that arose, and I wonder whether it is something that the witnesses have come across or had a huge amount of discussion on, is the provision of breastfeeding and supports for mothers who have chronic diseases.  Many women with conditions like Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or Lupus must take very strong medications, including immunosuppressants, but would like to breastfeed.</p><p>There is now an accumulation of evidence that the benefits to mother and baby outweigh any risk of the baby's immune system being suppressed by the minuscule amount of drugs that cross into breast milk.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?  The person I spoke to said women should be supported to breastfeed through counselling and adjustments to the vaccination schedule for babies.  Some live vaccines may be best deferred in babies being breastfed by mothers taking certain medication.  Is it something that has ever arisen for the witnesses? </p><p> I will throw the questions out and they can answer them.  This is quite an unusual format.  Sometimes we ask questions in a pow, pow, pow format to try to get juicy answers.  The witnesses represent an advocacy group which is doing incredible work.  This is a very pleasant format in which to be able to converse.</p><p> There is a human donor milk bank in the North.  Are there any commitments towards developing and funding such a bank in the Republic?  The phrase used was "human milk is for human babies", yet it seems mad to me that we do not have such a facility and people instead have to go to the North. </p><p> We talked about hospital grade pumps.  A woman told me she would love to see the option of one free visit at home from a qualified IBCLC and the continuation of care at home.  We discussed workplaces.  It would be great to amend the regulations to allow mothers to take breastfeeding or pumping breaks for up to one year post birth.  The current regulation allows for such breaks for up to six months.  Many people shared many thoughts with me and I do not want to leave anything out.</p><p> Some of the people I spoke to said they felt they were being aggressively marketed formula through algorithms and stuff like that, as well as through their own spheres, friends and so on.  Would I be correct in saying that Ireland is quite poor at enforcing the WHO code on marketing formula?  Lots of events are sponsored by formula companies. </p><p> People said there is a wider cultural problem.  The generations before us were sometimes discouraged from breastfeeding.  Do the witnesses have any experience of what needs to be done to address what is being passed down through the generations?  It is an eternal cultural problem and not one that exists solely in our hospitals.  I have thrown a bazillion thoughts and questions out there.</p></speech>

In situations like those outlined by the Senator, they have to be dealt with on a case by case basis.  I come back to the education of obstetricians and people in other medical fields.  The first thing they say to women is an almost blanket statement that they cannot breastfeed because they are on medication.  In fact, a lot of research has been done on medication.  Some people may need to check change their medication to a lower risk one in order to breastfeed their babies.  Others will not need to do that.  It depends on the severity of their condition and what medication they are on.</p> <p>  Dr. Tom Hale in Texas is doing a lot of work on this area.  He has done a lot of testing.  Every lactation consultant that I know has an app with all of his information on the risk factors for every drug so that people can discuss with mothers who have a condition what the risk factors are and whether medication is high or low risk.  Mothers can then make their own informed decisions as to how they are going to feed their babies.</p> <p>  On the implementation of the WHO code, the Government said today that it will fully implement all of the recommendations and resolutions.  That will mean that all of the formula advertising will disappear off our televisions.  That will be significant.  There are two and three year olds who are able to say, "That is the best milk" because they have seen advertising on all sorts of platforms.  That is significant.  I cannot remember any of the other points so I will stop now.</p></speech>

On antenatal training, in a report we found 21% of mothers said the lack of such training through hospitals was a roadblock and that many women wanted to know about the challenges of breastfeeding.  I appreciate it is a fine balancing act because if all people hear are the challenges, that will be less appealing and people will not learn about the amazing benefits and rewards of breastfeeding, not just for the baby but also the mother.  There are long-term physical health benefits as well as emotional benefits.</p> <p>  I am in a WhatsApp group with several other mums and all of us said that we would breastfeed to six months.  Due to lockdown we have been at home with our babies for a lot longer and are extending breastfeeding until our children are one or two years old.  That is in line with the WHO recommendation to breastfeed to two years of age.  I had such a difficult start that it has been a real privilege to breastfeed my son for that long.</p> <p>  Women need to know about the realities of breastfeeding, and realise that when things are not working it is not just them and help is available.  Often difficulties require very simple solutions and IBCLC could assist them.  There may be difficulties with positioning.  Ms Rea and Ms Cahill are much more expert on this than we are.</p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the WHO code.  It is not an area we have researched.  The Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland, BFLGI, has done a lot of work on that and I recommend talking to it.  One mother in our report referred to formula being handed around like cups of tea in the hospital.  There seems to be a very heavy reliance on formula and anecdotally we have heard that is because midwives are very busy.  Given that establishing breastfeeding can sometimes take a lot of time, formula is a much easier way to ensure they know babies are being fed.  We need to examine staffing in order to make sure midwives have time to help women one and that there are lactation consultants whose specific role is to address challenges as they arise.  Like Ms Cahill, I cannot remember everything else the Senator said.</p></speech>

There was lack of partner support for breastfeeding, which is not an island and is not just about one person doing it.  Lots of negatives have come with the restrictions.  Could they also have had an impact on breastfeeding success for mothers?</p></speech>

Our responses relate mainly to pre-Covid experiences.  We have received follow-on feedback from mothers on their experiences during Covid.  The negative impact on women labouring, birthing and establishing breastfeeding alone in maternity hospitals has been well covered in the media.</p> <p>  We see a shocking consistency pre-Covid and during Covid.  The only difference is that the sense of isolation, vulnerability and lack of support has been exacerbated by Covid.  We have not conducted any research on that, but the anecdotal evidence from women is that the sense of feeling and being left alone has been exacerbated. </p> <p>  Other research being carried out suggests that women who, like Ms Byrne, have already initiated breastfeeding are breastfeeding for an extended period.  There are also some reports that contradict that.  I am not aware of any final summary or decision on whether the restrictions have had a positive or negative impact on breastfeeding rates overall.  I am sure Ms Cahill and Ms Rea will be able to speak to that much more, given that they are speaking to women every day.</p></speech>

I am seeing no great rise in numbers but my fear at the beginning was that many mothers were not getting the help they wanted due to the lack of support.  I had a fear that the rates would really plummet but it has been the case that many mothers who are concerned about Covid and their babies' health are breastfeeding where they may not have done so previously.  We are certainly seeing a rise in numbers in that regard.  I believe we will come out of it probably where we went into it.  The early studies on breastfeeding and protection for the baby came out quite quickly.  This impacted a lot for some mothers and it certainly had a bearing on the decisions made by a lot of mums.</p> <p>  Reference was made to donor milk.  It would be terrific if we had a donor milk bank down south.  They offer a terrific service and they are always looking for donors.  They are in very short supply.  A lot of the time they have busy times when they would be a little short.  We know it is so important for babies in a neonatal intensive care unit to receive donor milk if mum is not able to produce the milk herself.  A very informal system of milk sharing goes on around the country.  Lots of mothers share breast milk informally.  It would be terrific if it could be formalised in some way.  This, however, brings money into it and it would exclude some mothers from having the service.  A lot of it comes down to money and that should not be part of a mum's choice to breastfeed.</p> <p>  On the issue of antenatal classes and mothers feeling that they did not get enough education, Ms Cahill and I are both antenatal educators with Cuidi&uacute;, and we do cover it.  Anybody who has had a baby will know that on the first baby, one's thoughts are "How am I going to get this baby out?"  The mother hears all of the other bits about the baby such as changing nappies, but breastfeeding is on the periphery and she may not be focused on it until the baby arrives home.  Then she realises that perhaps she should have taken that information on board a little more.  Yes, it is absolutely included in all of the antenatal education, but potentially there should be a class very quickly after birth.  I love the idea of a free lactation consultant visit for everybody.  That would make it such an even playing field.  It would make it so much easier for mothers to get the help in a timely manner.  Very often it is just too late: they have made their decision and there is no going back for them.  As Ms Byrne and Ms Etherton have said through lots of their stories, those decisions live on for mothers.  They do not make those decisions lightly and they find it very hard to reconcile afterwards.  We find that with antenatal education, meeting a mother on her second baby is a totally different story to meeting a mother on her first baby.  She is a different person and her decisions are much firmer.  Mothers educate themselves so much differently at that point.  If we could somehow channel that for first-time mothers we would certainly make big strides and help lots more mothers in that way.</p></speech>

I have read the witness statements and I thank them for all the work they are doing.  Overnight we heard the positive announcement by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, of &euro;1.58 million to hire an additional 24 lactation consultants for hospitals.  I am also really delighted to hear that the Government accepts the WHO guidelines that will see a phasing out of the in-your-face marketing and advertising of formula products.  I believe this to be a good thing because a number of things are competing against each other here, including preparing for birth and getting ready, with all that this involves.  There is also the fact that people are consumers.  From a young age and from knee height we are bombarded with advertisements and all sorts of messages, be it from Smyth's Toys or Coca Cola.  This gets inside our heads.  We are brand people.  We go to supermarkets and it has been proven time and again that we pick up items such as Brennan's bread, for example, and certain other brands because we stick with what has been marketed to us.  I believe that the same applies to formula milks.  We need to break away from that.</p> <p>  It is good that in the opening statements the witnesses from Bainne Beatha stated that it is not a "breast is best" group.  This can often pressurise new mums who may feel they are doing something wrong by not breastfeeding and going the formula route.  It is good that the representatives have said that the groups are there to support and find avenues of making this more feasible and possible.</p> <p>  I will jump into a few comments and then I have a number of questions.  The first point is the obvious elephant in the room.  We are discussing babies, birthing and breastfeeding.  The real elephant in the room is that so many partners still cannot accompany the expectant mother to appointments at hospitals.  We have had the political statements and I heard what the Taoiseach said yesterday.  We have had a lot of talk from mums.  Joe Duffy's "Liveline" covered this.  Now we need each hospital group to standardise what they do around partners attending appointments.  In general terms, but not in all cases, a woman who is expecting a baby is healthy.  Giving birth is a medical condition but it is different to other hospital contexts in that the person is, generally, not unwell going into hospital to give birth.  Of course there are cases where it happens but, in general, the woman is going in for a few days to give birth to a healthy child, hopefully, and to go home again.  Those appointments leading up to birth are so important.  We need to see some standardisation very quickly on this.</p> <p>  My next point is for Ms Cahill.  I was absolutely shocked.  One of my take-home points from her contribution is that antenatal classes have not been happening.  I did not know that or understand that.  This amplifies the whole problem I have just referred to where partners cannot attend some appointments with expectant mums.  I am dad to three smallies - a six-year old, a four-year old and a two-year old.  We went to the antenatal classes for the first child because it is the big unknown at that point.  My knowledge of birthing was leaving certificate biology, a time when I would have been doodling in my copybook and not listening.  Fast forward 12 years, however, and suddenly I needed to know all about this.  My ears pricked up when they started talking about what would happen if we did not make it to the maternity hospital and if I as the dad had to help my wife to give birth at the side of the road.  Suddenly, God almighty, a dose of reality of what may be involved was like a smack in the face.  There has to be some capacity or some way, at least online, to address the lack of classes.  We have all embraced Zoom.  We are meeting today virtually.  There must be some capacity to get those classes up and running, pretty much immediately.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on if there is a need in Ireland for postnatal classes?  Breastfeeding comes into that realm.  As Ms Cahill and Ms Rea have said, when one goes to an antenatal class the focus is on how a baby is born and on the whole process from labour to birth and everything in between.  Is there a need for postnatal classes?  New parents have nothing to benchmark against.  We phone sisters and brothers, or go to Google and get atrocious answers.  We have people telling us our lives will never be the same again.  This is just from my perspective as dad: it is way worse from the mum's perspective.  There is probably a need, but not everyone will take it up, for postnatal classes.  The same cohort that goes together to antenatal classes may be giving birth in and around the same time.  It makes sense that the same service would be offered to them as a group after the births.  Perhaps the HSE would consider that.</p> <p>  I was quite shocked to see Ms Etherton's analysis in her opening statement that 60% of mothers sought help and advice privately on breastfeeding.  This is some 36,000 mums last year, at an average cost of &euro;440 each, who left the net of our public health service to go and get this advice.  This makes it even more important that the lactation consultants are hired.</p> <p>  On the points made by Ms Rea, as a person who has been in maternity hospitals a few times, I found that it is very hard to identify who is who.  They are all wearing scrubs.  I remember going down corridors and tapping a person on the shoulder, but they could have been a cleaning attendant, kitchen staff, an obstetrician, or someone on their way down to deliver an antenatal class.  It is very hard to identify people.  Identifying who is the lactation consultant could be a very simple thing each hospital group could do.  It is very hard for a person who is not in a hospital every day to see who is who in that context.</p><p>That more or less covers it.  Could the witnesses respond to some of those questions?  I encourage them to keep up the great work.  I wish all expectant mothers the very best over the months ahead.  Hopefully, their partners can start attending appointments with them.</p></speech>

Antenatal classes would involve a post-natal reunion.  The normal groups run by Cuidi&uacute; would run act in that way.  It is mother-to-mother support at that stage but they would have an antenatal educator or breastfeeding counsellor there so it is quite informal at that point where mothers are discussing issues among themselves and there is somebody there who has that bit more knowledge and training and is able to steer the conversation in the right direction.  In that regard, it is happening but it is online at the moment.  There is a massive amount of classes available online.  It is about getting people to attend them and getting the information out there.</p> <p>  Regarding partners being present at births, the Deputy said he was able to attend the birth of his child and was panicked and worried by the thought of not being able to attend it.  It is incredible that partners are still unable to be with their partners during birth because they are not a visitor.  They are part of that family that is about to be extended and it is a disgrace that this has not happened even now that the advice is that they can be there.  It should have happened as soon as there was mention of it being allowed to happen.  Their support is key.  They are going home with mum.  Their support is huge when it comes to birth and moving forward into their breastfeeding journey.  It should be recognised that they are not visitors; they are part of that same birthing team.  </p> <p>  Cuidi&uacute; tries to bridge those gaps but it is about getting the information out there, getting people to attend and getting the likes of GPs and public health nurses to help mothers find supports in their area.  Cuidi&uacute; is dotted around the country.  Each area has its own little branch or group and there is a Facebook group associated with each branch so we very much encourage mothers who are in the same area to mix because we are building a community.  We are helping mothers build the village they need because, as an earlier speaker said, culturally, we are not seeing breastfeeding.  We did not see breastfeeding when we were growing up so we need mothers and babies to see it in order for them to take it on as something for themselves.</p></speech>

Perhaps it will be the start of a movement here because it needs to be normalised.  We have far too many hang-ups in Ireland about small things like this.  So what if the woman in the corner having her lunch is breastfeeding her baby.  Is it not wonderful and why should that baby go without food while everyone else in that caf&eacute; can eat?  It needs to be normalised.  This committee needs to champion this becoming more normal practice in terms of State advertising.</p></speech>

A total of 145 mothers responded.  Regarding those who wished to breastfeed, the rate might not be directly comparable with the national rates.  We do not have access to data on those who have decided they wish to breast feed exclusively.  It may not be directly transferable but what was striking for us was the &euro;440, which is not an insignificant amount, particularly if somebody is on social welfare.  That is more than two weeks worth of social welfare so it is just not affordable.  We said in our opening statement that the hospital provides a level playing field and proactive support from the moment of birth will reduce the need to spend at a later stage, particularly in light of the fact that we have so many wonderful voluntary groups like Cuidi&uacute;.

I thank all the witnesses for appearing before us today.  I do not know a huge amount about this issue but I am obviously learning.  It is a fascinating subject.  I am not sure if anybody has mentioned a perinatal division in Ireland.  Approximately a year ago, I saw a report on perinatal care and mother and baby units in Great Britain on the BBC and was really struck by it.  These are specialised units for women suffering from postnatal depression.  I looked at the NHS website.  According to its research, 20% of all new mothers could experience mental health difficulties prior to birth, giving birth and after giving birth.  It was a fascinating report.  During the past year, there have been discussions about a mother and baby unit.  Obviously, that name has connotations in this country but this is a different type of unit.  I think it is going to be on the campus of St. Vincent's Hospital.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on perinatal care?  This unit would be the first of its kind in Ireland.  What outlet do such units give women?  When I watched that report, I was shocked.  When a woman gives birth, in some circumstances, she can experience terrible depression that can have a significant impact on her and her baby.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on a perinatal division in this country and the proposed mother and baby unit on the campus of St. Vincent's Hospital?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#K01500"><p>I am not 100% sure but I think the St. Patrick's unit in Dublin is the only place where somebody with very severe puerperal psychosis can be hospitalised.  There is a difference between puerperal psychosis where somebody needs to be hospitalised and postnatal depression.  A woman cannot have her baby with her when she is in St. Patrick's unit.  It is just not possible so there is always separation in the case of puerperal psychosis sometimes for the safety of the baby but usually because of staffing.  There are issues around that.  There should be a mother and baby unit but there is none.</p><p>In most cases of postnatal depression, and there is a lack of services for those with very severe postnatal depression, medication is the first route that people will go down and that will usually be accompanied by the statement "and you will need to give up breastfeeding".  In fact, the research shows that giving up breastfeeding will make their depression worse and that if they continue to breastfeed, their depression will eventually begin to drop.  They may still need medication, however, and many medications for depression are okay to use while breastfeeding.  Puerperal psychosis is a very different condition and needs to be medically supervised because it is very severe.  As far as I know, the mums and babies are separated and we do not have a mother and baby unit in this country.</p></speech>

How common is postnatal depression and how is it treated?  The mental health of a good friend of mine deteriorated in a number of months and I could not believe that somebody who had just given birth, who was in the throes of happiness and all that comes with that, suddenly went down a road of severe depression.  I could not understand it but she explained why, and others explained what can happen in such cases.  I was learning.  Is postnatal depression common or rare?</p></speech>

Postnatal depression can affect mums of children up to two years of age and they can show signs at any point during that time.  We also have to recognise that much postnatal depression can be a result of the mother's experience.  It can be driven by disappointment or upset.  Birth and breastfeeding are very much hormonally driven, and when many hormones are involved, there will be an imbalance some of the time.  These mothers need care and, as Ms Cahill said, it does not always need to be medication.  Support is the key in those circumstances.  Sometimes medication will be needed, and that is where they need proper guidance and GPs need proper information on what medication is suitable to continue with breastfeeding.  Stopping breastfeeding abruptly is never a good idea either.  We know there will be that drop of oxytocin and prolactin, which will send mothers into a low mood.  The experience of birth and breastfeeding for a particular mum is tied in greatly with the hormones of birth and breastfeeding.  There could also be a predisposition to it.  There is plenty of information out there on the matter.  I do not have the exact figures to hand but, according to the last study I read, the figure is between 6% and 10%.</p></speech>

It usually manifests itself within a few days of birth whereby somebody will exhibit extreme, manic behaviour, with a great deal of fear.  A couple of women I have worked with stated they were afraid that they themselves would drop or kill their babies.  They just did not feel in any way in control of any of their emotions, and usually went into a corner somewhere in their house and hid from their baby.  The first signs might be that a mum does not want to pick up her baby at all, and when that is explored with her, it is because of fear.</p> <p>  As people leave the hospital now after two or three days, it is not picked up.  When I was having my babies, mothers were in hospital for nearly a week and it was usually picked up within those five to seven days, whereas now people leave within two or three days and it is much more difficult to pick it up.  The partners, therefore, see this very strange behaviour and have to bring in a GP or whatever.  It is not picked up in the acute services, which is where it should be picked up.</p></speech>

I am married to someone who has worked in maternity services for many years, so I have for 25 years been getting a daily briefing on the challenges in the maternity services.  To give an example of where we have come from, when my wife was applying for a job in Dublin many years ago, she was asked how she could apply for a job in Dublin when her husband was working in Cork.  I think we have moved on a bit from that kind of approach in respect of maternity care and there have been many changes, but there remain many challenges in this area of breastfeeding and the supports required.</p> <p>  One of our guests stated that 29% of women said they had received conflicting advice from hospital staff.  How can we deal with that kind of challenge?  Obviously, there are rotas of staff, with different staff at work at different times of the day and night.  How can we ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to how individual patients and mothers are handled, given that almost one third receive conflicting advice?</p></speech>

We are not competent to make a decision on what those levels should be but the 2015 competence framework sets out three levels, namely, awareness, generalist and specialist competencies, within the area of lactation consultancy or lactation support in the hospital.  The intention, as set out by the HSE at a recent meeting we had with its representatives, is that that role of lactation consultant should operate at that higher level of specialty, offer in-depth care to people with complex challenges and provide education and support to other staff within the hospital setting.</p><p>I guess it is a trickle down mode of education in that a mother might present with a challenge, the lactation consultant is called and then that midwife learns how to deal with that challenge for the next time.  We would see that the two main issues.  There are obviously the ongoing education and establishing international board certified lactation consultants, IBCLCs, with specialist skills in the roles and having enough of those lactation consultant roles and having appropriate staffing of midwives within the hospital.  They may have the skills and knowledge already but they do not have the time to transmit it.  What will change in the future if they have the skills and knowledge and they still do not have time to transmit it and to sit down with a woman?  I am not sure that fully answers the question.</p></speech>

Is it a case that there are not proper follow-up notes put in place.  For instance, that if nurse A or whoever is attending - whether it be a doctor or a nurse - giving advices, sets out on a chart what advice was given so that whoever comes on at 8 p.m. will know exactly the line that was being taken by his or her predecessor?  Is that one of the problems that is occurring as well?</p></speech>

Sometimes it is at a very simple level.  One woman said:</p> <blockquote> 	I got mixed advice from midwives in the hospital about feeding and ended up YouTubing videos about getting a deeper latch as my nipples were already bleeding 12 hours after the birth.  The midwife I asked about it said it was normal to be sore and bleeding. </blockquote> <p>That is not something I would imagine would be necessarily charted and available there for the next person.  Somebody who has done her antenatal classes and done the breastfeeding research following the IBCLCs on Instagram knows full well that her nipples should not be bleeding 12 hours after birth when she is attempting to breastfeed.  There is inconsistency there.  There are issues at that minute practical hands-on help level.  Some of the help that one would get is nuanced.  It can be around positioning and attachment.</p></speech>

Pacify, which is a company based in the US, is looking to come to Ireland where it is offering 24-hour support to women who want to breastfeed.  Obviously, it sees a gap in the market in Ireland if it wants to come in.  In relation to support if a mother has a difficulty, say, at 10 p.m., and she is at home, what range of services are available for someone at that hour to contact anyone here in Ireland?  Is what we should further develop a 24-hour service?  Somebody might clarify what is available at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Rea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051200002#M00500"><p>As far as the support groups would be concerned, certainly with Cuidi&uacute;, we have breastfeeding counsellors who are available.  I would not say 24-hour availability for sure, but some will be available late in the evening and at weekends.  Some of the lactation consultants working in private practice will state on their information that they are available all of the time.  The HSE has lactation consultants who mothers send questions to online.  They are available five days a week, not 24-hours a day either.  We do not have that system but certainly a mother in the hospital should be getting the same level of care for the 24 hours - however many of those she is in the hospital.</p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's point about the note-taking, that would cut out much of the misinformation.  If somebody was seeing the plan for that particular mother as noted in the chart, he or she will not sweep into the room and completely change what information somebody else has given.  Many of the stories that the Bainne Beatha ladies have heard are sweeping statements that are made with very little thought, whereas if it had to be charted there would be much more thought given to the information that is being given to that mother.</p> <p>  It is such a vulnerable time for mothers.  They are exhausted.  They have had the best gift of their lives given to them but they are at a loss as to the right thing to do.  Any education they have had prior to that goes out the window.  They are looking for solid information.  It is not acceptable at this stage to tell a mother that bleeding nipples at 12 hours is normal and she will just have to toughen up and get over it.  We have all heard it frequently and we are still hearing it.</p> <p>  If they note everything throughout the birth, they should continue noting everything.  One can be sure the medications are noted.  Any checks that are done on mum are noted.  It is only one other step.</p></speech>

They are very knowledgeable.  I would count myself as somebody who would know a little about breastfeeding but I have learned a great deal about the structural problems that exist currently.</p> <p>  I would be of the opinion that we need a strong public information campaign on breastfeeding to break that intergenerational cycle in relation to breastfeeding.  Many of us would come from families in which nobody that we would know, not our mothers, aunts or other extended family members, would have breastfed.  It is not the norm in Irish families because we have such a low breastfeeding uptake.  A public awareness campaign should definitely be looked into to raise the possibility.</p> <p>  I found when I was pregnant that breastfeeding was almost mentioned to me as an afterthought.  It was almost sprung on me the week before I gave birth as to what I would do.  One is completely bombarded.  One is trying to process all this information.  Having that conversation at such a late stage is not healthy and it is not good.  It should be incorporated into secondary school education.  It should be a much broader education for society, not only women but their partners because they are such a vital part in the breastfeeding journey.  One needs the full support of one's partner because it is so difficult.  There is almost pressure on some women to ease the burden at home and give it up, as though it would make everybody's lives much easier if one stopped with this kind of almost nonsense.  Without firm support from one's partner at home, it is very difficult.</p> <p>  There are many women who might not have breastfed on their first child.  We need to get the message to them that it is okay, that was their experience but when one is having a second child and subsequent children, perhaps a different choice is there for them.  It is to give women the confidence to say that they want to change their mind on it.  It is not any reflection on their initial decision but that they want to try something different now.</p> <p>  I would like to ask a question in relation to the initial outlay on breastfeeding.  The witnesses mentioned it was in or around &euro;500.  That is a huge amount of money for anybody.  It lends credence to the idea that breastfeeding is some sort of middle-class pursuit and it is not suitable for women who would not fall into this well-off, middle-class category.  Would they support a grant being given to women who choose to breastfeed to cover those initial outlays that one would have?  Can they suggest any other measures that can be taken to encourage and support more women who would not be from a middle-class background who would not have many financial resources to breastfeed because it is a costly outlay at the start?</p> <p>  My second question would be in relation to the role of local authorities in creating public spaces to allow breastfeeding in our communities out and about in town.  One of the witnesses mentioned Dundrum Shopping Centre.  If we are to rely on commercial entities to provide public spaces, we will not get them.  That is the bottom line.  Should local authorities have a role in providing breastfeeding supports?</p><p>What do the witnesses see in relation to that?</p><p> Another issue, which may have been touched upon in earlier contributions, concerns the impact of the pandemic on breastfeeding rates.  Like Ms Byrne, I have many friends who have actually extended their breastfeeding or who initially thought they would do it for a couple of weeks but have continued to do it far beyond it because they are at home, they are not being disturbed, there is no pressure to get out and about and bounce back to normal and carry on like nothing has happened, so for them it has been positive.</p><p> However, there has also been a negative impact, and a number of contributors spoke about the maternity service restrictions.  Do the witnesses feel that a lack of support in relation to the other maternity issues and the lack of an advocate standing by their side to speak up for them impacts on the number of women who are choosing to breastfeed?  Do the witnesses feel that because all of this has been so difficult and women do not have someone to speak up and advocate for them in the couple of days after they give birth, perhaps they want to make things easier for themselves?  Perhaps the witnesses have some further views on that.</p></speech>

That is an area where people of all different backgrounds will be, so if they get the support from the get-go, it is to be hoped the 63% of mothers who do initiate breastfeeding will be converted to continuing to breastfeed beyond hospital discharge.</p> <p>  We focus a lot on the low rates of breastfeeding, but it is also about enabling those who have decided to give it a go and helping them continue with it.  Basically, the more we see breastfeeding in society, the more people will do it.  I have friends and family who work within the maternity services and I did not know that extended breastfeeding reduces the risk of ovarian, cervical and breast cancers.  Therefore, there is work to do on the promotional and educational piece.</p> <p>  I believe Ms Cahill mentioned having a free international board certified lactation, IBCL, consultant visit as part of the public health service.  The public nurse does these checks, but if that proposal could be incorporated, it would also enable people of different backgrounds and incomes to address issues at an early stage.</p></speech>

To answer the Senator's question on the cost, lactation consultants in private practice usually give a patient two hours.  That is a huge difference in timing.  Referrals could be made to lactation consultants in private practice.  Public health nurses spend a maximum on 20 minutes with a mother.  If, upon the identification of a problem, they could refer a mother on to a private lactation consultant who would have the time to visit the mother and get paid by the health system to do so, it would be ideal for everybody, but that is not what is happening.  Therefore, breastfeeding is still, more or less, a middle-class pursuit.  That is just the way of it, really.</p></speech>

I am absolutely in favour of that, but is it not appalling we are even talking about it as a thing?  Women should not need a special place to go to breastfeed.  There should not be a question of a mother being moved on from sitting on a park bench or feeding her child wherever she chooses to do so.  Yes, it would be terrific if there were some public spacing given to mothers so they felt comfortable and there was no question of them being asked to move on, but it is disgraceful we are even talking about it as a thing.</p></speech>

I apologise that the last member had to be cut off, but I am working to a schedule.</p> <p>  If the witnesses feel there is anything further that they wish to contribute to the committee on this matter, they might forward it in writing.  I would certainly like to hear more of their views on why breastfeeding rates in Ireland are so low, and in particular, the drop in rates from the 63.8% majority that do breastfeed in hospital to the rate of 37% after leaving hospital.  That issue would be well worth further exploration in respect of questions.  I would also like to hear more about the actual supports that are in place, the fact that, as the Bainne Beatha report states, people have to go to private practice to access supports, and the importance of that.</p> <p>  I appreciate the contributions made.  I know other groups wanted to take part in the proceedings but there would not have been time.

In particular I am struck by a remark in An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's correspondence with me and which is a public remark.  His remark was to the effect that if a member of the public deals with a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there can be an imbalance in power in that relationship and that if they wish to converse in Irish and the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only converse in English, that is putting them at a disadvantage right from the start and in effect a power imbalance is created.</p> <p>  From our inception, respect towards the Irish language and the provision of services in the Gaeltacht has been in legislation on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We accept the responsibility we are given in that regard.  I will turn to Ms N&iacute; Cheallaigh to read out our opening statement in full.</p></speech>

One of our biggest issues is around the workforce resource challenge we face in matching the skills, in this case Irish language fluency, with allocation to the Gaeltacht areas.  The original complaint in 2011 was made at a time when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was going through a period of contraction and this negatively impacted on recruitment in those years in the Gaeltacht areas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.418" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021051200002#D00400"><p>In 2014 we commenced recruitment again and we had a specific Irish language recruitment stream with 10% set aside.  Regrettably, that has been unsuccessful for us.  The rationale at the time was that this would create a pool of qualified individuals who could serve in Gaeltachta&iacute; and other areas and provide a service through the medium of the Irish language.  There are some other human resource issues around where members can serve.  We have a general rule around how close an individual can serve to one's original residence, that of a relative or that of a spouse's relative.  These restrictions are there for good reasons, namely reducing the risk of familial influence and maintaining impartiality in policing.  Garda members who are recruited through the Irish language stream are initially allocated to larger training stations but they undertake to undergo a period in a Gaeltacht station.  Only 55 garda&iacute; have been recruited through the Irish language stream since 2013, 18 of whom are not serving in a division with a Gaeltacht but 13 of those 18 did serve in such a division and then subsequently asked for a transfer.  I have insisted that for anyone who comes through that stream or for any individual who expresses a wish to serve in a Gaeltacht area, after they have passed the competency test, which is level 4 and which is a stringent standard, they are available to transfer at the next available opportunity to a Gaeltacht area.  That is the situation.</p> <p>  The longer-term solution lies in a number of areas.  We will continue with the recruitment stream for garda&iacute;.  We also want to encourage the same approach with our Garda staff.  More of our Garda staff are becoming front-line workers in their interaction with the public and in Gaeltacht areas we want to encourage those who may be from the local area to provide the policing service and their service in particular through the medium of the Irish language.  Beyond that, I would look to the recruitment of the Garda Reserve.  We wish to use the Garda Reserve as a means to increase the representation of the whole Garda organisation.  One of those areas is in respect of those who can speak Irish.  We want to have a recruitment campaign for reserve garda&iacute; and that will focus on the Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  To provide a service more nationally, we have procured a contract of service for Irish language phone interpretation.  As is well known, we have issued a mobility device, which is a telephone and it has many apps for policing purposes but it can also be used for interpretation at the side of the road at any location.  Beyond that again, we have 80 members of the organisation whose names are on the portal and who are confident that should an Irish language speaker be required anywhere in the country, they can either respond or be available on the phone.  We have an Irish language proficiency panel, which has on it those members who are proficient at level 4.  That has been extended to Garda staff as well.</p> <p>  When we look to ensuring that garda&iacute; are competent in Irish and deployed to Gaeltacht stations, things have moved on since 2011.  One of the most significant areas is the competency test.  At the recommendation of an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, the competency test has become more stringent.  It is an EU standard at level 4 and I have details of this.  Level 4 means that one is very proficient in both normal and professional conversation.  It is true that within the Gaeltacht stations we have people at levels 2 and 3.  That is an obvious point where we can seek to increase their skills so that they can move, in a tested process, from level 2 to level 3.</p> <p>  As part of our initial training process, all Garda trainees must meet certain critical goals, one of which is that no matter what stream one joins from, one gets the optimum exposure to policing experiences.  That means trainees are placed in the busier towns before being transferred to more rural stations.  I have insisted that once that probation and training period is over, they are then transferred to Gaeltacht stations.  We have an Irish language proficiency panel.  We also have other campaigns ongoing, including an information and awareness campaign, throughout the organisation.  We have looked to those divisions where there are Gaeltachta&iacute; and we have a strategy group which includes all of the divisional officers and the chief superintendents from those Gaeltachta&iacute; together with the executive director of human resources.  They meet twice a year to give feedback on the provision of services in Gaeltachta&iacute;.</p> <p>  There is quite a bit of detail on staffing but in summary we have 12 stations where 100% of members are fluent; one station where over 50% of members are fluent; and eight stations where fewer than 50% of members are fluent.  In those stations, we have individual members who have a fluency of either level 2 or level 3.  As I have said, that is an obvious place for us to try to build on that fluency.</p> <p>  I first met an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in March 2019 during my first six months in the organisation.  Correspondence flowed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and in September 2019 he made contact again with my office and I intervened to make sure there was a prompt and expeditious response to his correspondence.</p> <p>  We intend to increase the resources we have put towards this.</p><p>We recently appointed an inspector with responsibility for Gaeltacht areas.  In the north-western region, the office of Irish language champion has been created in each division.  We are going to replicate this nationally.  Where we have Irish speakers stationed outside Gaeltacht areas, they are used in innovative ways.  We have seven such officers in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR.  These are used for interviews in the media and to operate on social media platforms.</p><p> In respect of our deadline or target with regard to deployment to Gaeltacht areas, part of this will depend on recruitment and the supply of Irish speakers to the organisations while another part depends on our success in upskilling individuals.  I have set out details of our phone translation service and our internal website which outlines 80 Irish-speaking members who are available.  They are on 24-7 duties and are contactable in that regard.  I accept that this is an unusual situation.  I believe there are things we can remedy as we move forward.  The organisation recruits hundreds and hundreds every year between Garda members and Garda staff, so there is still an opportunity for those with Irish skills to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will be the same in the years to come.  We are very committed to meeting our responsibilities, which we take seriously.  The steps we have taken show our determination to ensure we are fully compliant with our legislative responsibilities.</p></speech>

The Commissioner and his team are very welcome.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam.  Roimh dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an lae inniu, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh ar mo chara, Garda Odhr&aacute;n Mac Ghiolla Bhr&iacute;de, a bh&iacute; lonnaithe i nGleann Cholm Cille agus ag obair sa cheantar.  A friend of my mine, Garda Odhran McBride was based in Gleann Cholm Cille in Donegal a couple of years ago.  Bh&iacute; suim mh&oacute;r aige sa teanga.  Fuair s&eacute; spreagadh m&oacute;r, taca&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r agus cuidi&uacute; m&oacute;r &oacute;n bpobal uilig sa cheantar sin.  He had an interest in the language and got a lot of support, help and inspiration from the people around him.  D'fhoghlaim s&eacute; an teanga ar&iacute;s.  He learned the language again.  T&aacute;im ag smaoineamh faoi na daoine uilig timpeall na t&iacute;re at&aacute; lonnaithe sna ceantair leathGhaeltachta n&oacute; sna ceantair nach Gaeltacht iad.</p><p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag smaoineamh faoi na daoine uilig at&aacute; suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  I am thinking of all the garda&iacute; who have that same interest but who do not have that same chance to learn that Odhran did in Gleann Cholm Cille.  An bhfuil buis&eacute;ad suntasach ar f&aacute;il f&aacute; choinne na ngarda&iacute; uilig at&aacute; ag smaoineamh ar an teanga a athfhoghlaim n&oacute; a fhoghlaim ar&iacute;s?  Is there a significant budget for garda&iacute; who are thinking of going back to learn Irish or to relearn Irish?  Chas m&eacute; le n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine leis an suim agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh deis buis&eacute;ad traen&aacute;il a fh&aacute;il f&aacute; choinne na ndaoine sin.  If there was a budget ready for that training for na daoine uilig at&aacute; ag smaoineamh ar dul go dt&iacute; an ionad oideachais i nGleann Cholm Cille, i gContae Chiarra&iacute;, i bPort L&aacute;irge n&oacute; cib&eacute; &aacute;it, so whether they want to learn Irish in Gleann Cholm Cille, Kerry, Waterford or wherever, that would be n&iacute;os fearr f&aacute; choinne na ndaoine uilig.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, there is a great Irish saying, "M&aacute; theasta&iacute;onn uait aithne a chur orainn, mair in&aacute;r dteannta" or"If you want to get to know us, live with us".  Sin &iacute; an fhadhb sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  If garda&iacute; are not able to converse with the people of the Gaeltacht that creates a barrier straight away.  Sin &iacute; an fhadhb at&aacute; ann.</p><p> Bh&iacute; an Teachta Aindrias Moynihan ag labhairt faoi na bailte seirbh&iacute;se.  T&aacute; Leitir Ceanainn creidi&uacute;naithe mar an ch&eacute;ad baile seirbh&iacute;se sa t&iacute;r.  Letterkenny has accreditation as the first baile seirbh&iacute;se in the country.  An bhfuil aon seans acmhainn&iacute; n&oacute; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a bhogadh ar aghaidh ar son na teanga sa st&aacute;isi&uacute;n sa bhaile sin, Leitir Ceanainn i nD&uacute;n na nGall?  T&aacute; a fhios ag na daoine uilig agus na garda&iacute; uilig at&aacute; aithne agamsa orthu sa Gharda ansin, d&aacute; mbeadh deis ag an st&aacute;isi&uacute;in sin an tseirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il, a spreagadh agus a chur i bhfeidhm sa cheantar sin, bheadh sin iontach dearfach.  Letterkenny is a Gaeltacht service town so is there a chance to put some sort of services or scheme together there to enhance and promote the language as part of that language plan?</p></speech>

The chief superintendent for that area in Donegal has informed me that she has discussed the matter with her other business partners, including Tusla and the local authority, and that they are working together to put dedicated teams in place to provide a service in Irish.  A divisional officer who is a fluent Irish speaker was recently appointed as a new member of staff and we are encouraging that person to be one of the front-facing members for the provision of policing services in Letterkenny.  We are also going to draw together a cohort of our other personnel to ensure that a service can be provided in Letterkenny through the medium of Irish.  That has all been in response to Letterkenny becoming a Gaeltacht service town, as announced last August.  The divisional officer and her staff have been at the forefront in making sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding effectively to that.</p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Mulligan to assist me on the issue of training.  There is a budget and there is support for training.  There is a desire within the organisation for people to be fluent and we want to support them in those terms.  I ask Mr. Mulligan to outline all the training provisions we have put in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021051200002#F00300"><p>Members are probably aware that all Garda trainees in the training college undergo Irish training, particularly to equip them to deal with operational and traffic issues, as well as making arrests etc.  That is done, it is part of the degree programme and it has to be passed.</p> <p>  One of the things we homed in on is that, as the Commissioner mentioned earlier, we were disappointed with the results and the numbers we got in over the last five to six years under the Irish stream of the competition we run with the Public Appointments Service.  To put that into perspective for members, we have brought in and attested 3,000 new garda&iacute; in that period and we have only got 55 trainees in the Irish language stream.  The numbers applying have been disappointing.  For example, the last time we ran the competition in 2019 we got 132 applications to the Irish language stream.  We will be running a competition later this year and we are talking to our partners in the Public Appointments Service to see if there are reasons for this and why is it happening.  My understanding from talking to the Public Appointments Service is that it has had those issues with other competitions as well.  One of the things that was mentioned is that there is a huge demand for many of the people who have good language skills so we are competing for that in the marketplace.</p> <p>  We will look at it again and as the Commissioner said, we will particularly target the new Garda Reserve competition when we run it.  We have done a lot of research on that and the Garda Reserve is a good way to get to the hard-to-get communities.  We will also advertise that differently.  While we will announce nationally, rather than just having a national competition, we will recruit locally and we will go into the communities themselves.  I hope there will be a lot of interest from people.  There is a great tradition of volunteerism in Ireland.  We hope that when we target Gaeltacht areas we will get a big interest.  That will be a first and an important step.</p> <p>  On training, if we are not getting trainees in we have to look at what else we can do.  One of the areas we have targeted is that of our governance structures because we have an opportunity coming out of Covid to tackle this and to get it moving as we go forward.  One of the things we have done is we have asked and paid Gaelchult&uacute;r to devise courses for us, which it is doing.  The first step will be to bring our people who are at level 2 up to level 3.  We have also asked that when we achieve that we will bring them from level 3 up to level 4.  Those courses will be online.  We are working with the Garda College on it to make it easier for our people to do the courses.  It will be a combination of people doing it online and other situations we will design in which we bring people together.  For the last two years, one of the most popular initiatives we had on Irish were Gaeltacht trips.  We used to have three or four every year and they were always very popular and oversubscribed.  We went to Gaeltacht areas in Waterford, Kerry and Donegal.  Last year and so far this year, because of Covid we have not been able to do that, unfortunately, but we intend on getting that out again.</p> <p>  We are devising a new strategy as well.  As I said, this is a chance for us to start again and to try to get these numbers up, particularly in areas such as Donegal and in parts of Mayo, to make sure we can provide those services in Irish.  Between governance, recruitment, the training programmes and some of the other initiatives the Commissioner mentioned, it is an opportunity for a fresh start.  We are determined to do what we need to do.</p> <p>  The allowance was mentioned earlier.  This was done away with in 2012 after the downturn in the economy when different allowances across different sectors, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, were looked at.  It used to be 7.5% of salary but that is no longer there for anybody new.  Our officers who already had it did not lose it but any new garda&iacute; we have put in do not get that allowance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021051200002#F00400"><p>On the allowance, it is hard to determine how successful that was because our position has not significantly changed since we have been without it.  I have been asked about specific figures, etc.</p><p>We need to be ambitious and not think about just the Gaeltacht areas when we are thinking about proficiency.  There is more we can do around technology and even communication.  We have all become proficient with Zoom and dealing with things over the telephone.  We have had a large investment in technology so there are alternative means by which we can also provide services in Irish and we need to explore that.</p><p> In terms of chairing the overall governance of this, it will make a difference in the prioritisation of where resources go in the organisation.  This will require investment.  Some of that investment is in respect of the training and assistance we provide to each other.  We always have a large requirement and great demand for training.  We must make sure this does not get muscled out by the many other demands on training, particularly at this time as we come out of Covid.  We have had a period when much of our normal training has not happened, which will create a particular tail.  My involvement is to ensure this area remains an important one.</p><p> Referring back to one of the other points made, I think there is a desire in the organisation for this.  From my point of view, I often speak in public.  It is a matter of courtesy, and to save myself some embarrassment, that I can at least top and tail my graduation and passing-out speeches with some Irish.  I was engaged in one-to-one tuition but Covid brought that to an end.  I think there is a strong recognition of the central importance of it in terms of public confidence in the organisation and the diversity of the service we must provide.</p></speech>

That has not happened so while that policy can continue, it gives us very limited numbers.  We have to then look within the organisation and at those who would wish either to learn or relearn the Irish language.</p> <p>  I agree entirely about the importance of practical leadership being demonstrated by those in senior positions in the organisation.  That is why I referred specifically to myself.  I have no Irish language skills but I felt I should learn some due to a sense of good manners and respect for my audience, as well as to save my own embarrassment as I could at least open and close events in Irish.  Covid interrupted that learning but I will re-engage with it. </p></speech>

I do not know that the situation has deteriorated but what we have done has not actually found sufficient traction to move the matter on.</p> <p>  Other police services have had more success than ourselves and we are looking at what has happened in those.  We can draw some examples from how they have improved their services in a second language and we intend to do that.  We can come back quickly then with the overall plan and I will be responsible for its governance.  I give that undertaking to the committee. </p> <p>  In respect of the hiring process, we had 10% set aside for an Irish language stream and there were advantages involved for those individuals.  They gave a commitment that they would serve for a period of time in the Gaeltacht but the advantage for them was that they would be, in effect, fast-tracked and would gain admittance to the organisation more quickly.  Last year we swore in 600 Garda members, of whom only three had level 4 proficiency in Irish.  If we were anywhere near that 10% target it would just take an administrative decision and a stroke of the pen to increase it to 15% or 20% but we are not actually in that position.  That is regretted.  I do not think we will be in that position but if we got to it then we would obviously look at it afresh.  Given the requirement on us to provide a bilingual service, we would look very favourably on increasing that target from 10%.</p> <p>  We are looking towards how to address our recruitment campaign for next year.  As I said, we are recruiting both full-time members and Garda reserves.  I ask Mr. Mulligan to set out some of the specific actions we hope to take to have better outreach for our recruitment.</p></speech>

We will deal with the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga regarding the Garda Reserve, for example.  Senator Clifford-Lee mentioned going into the Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, which is a very good idea, although I assume it would have come up.  I thank her for that suggestion and we will take it on board.  She is right that we need to engage with them.  We already engage with career guidance teachers at second level and college level and have done so for our next competition.  We have a relationship with them.  To be clear, the Public Appointments Service runs these competitions for us.  As members are aware, that service is responsible for recruiting public servants across the public sector.  It is very professional in what it does and would engage in a lot of these issues.  We would support that as we move forward.</p> <p>  We are now going to take a number of different actions.  Communication is a huge part of this.  That is the first thing that struck us from the research we have done to date.  The bottom line on recruitment is that we need to concentrate more.  Rather than running a national competition, we need to start going to the communities and that would include Gaeltacht areas as well.  We need to start doing that and that is one thing we will definitely do.  We are drawing up a communication plan at the moment with our press office and that will be part of the campaign as we go forward.  We will probably have the main garda trainee competition first and it should be advertised around the end of October.  We will then follow very quickly with an advertisement for the Garda Reserve.  We are preparing at the moment to do things a little differently.  For the reserve recruitment, rather then everybody doing a competition in Dublin or a national competition we are going to go down to the areas themselves.  We are in discussions with the Public Appointments Service at the moment because we are not sure whether we will do that on a regional basis, for the four operational regions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or whether we will go down to divisional level.</p><p>I imagine that if we want to target areas such as the Gaeltacht, we will have to go down to divisional level and go into those areas when we are recruiting.  They are some of the things we are looking at.</p></speech>

Deputy Moynihan asked specific questions about the administration of that allowance and I do not have the detail on that in terms of what happens for an individual who moves from a Gaeltacht area.  We are going through a restructuring, in which the district structure we have had for decades is being replaced by a divisional structure, so we will have to have a look at the impact of that because people may be moving within a division.</p> <p>  I do not know the answer in respect of how the allowance is administered in respect of people moving.  It might be better for us to give Deputy Moynihan a written response because it will be bound by regulation.</p></speech>

We could certainly look at target dates.

We will obviously carry on with that.  More has been suggested to us with regard to outreach.  We will take that on.  Our competitions are run through the Public Appointments Service.  There are typically between 5,000 and 7,000 applicants to become sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is good deal of interest in becoming a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na among young people.  If we wish to expand that further, we will.

That is why we wish to revisit our approach, as I have said.  We will do that.  We also have to look to the skills that lie within the organisation.  I thank the Senator for her suggestions as to how we might do that.  We will take those forward.</p> <p>  As to the way in which a member of the community would know whether a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is competent in Irish, the f&aacute;inne is the only emblem outside of our uniform emblems that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may wear.  We allow both the silver f&aacute;inne and the gold f&aacute;inne and we are having specific badges designed to show that members are in the process of learning Irish.  These are the only emblems allowed outside of the normal uniform commitment.</p> <p>  There are possibilities for us overall with regard to recruitment.  It is not only about members, but also staff.  I take the point that was made in respect of members of Garda staff who are working on our front desks and answering our phones and their competency in the language.  That is obviously another important point.  Again, there is a technological answer to this issue.  Although a phone call may at the moment be transferred to Tralee, it could be transferred further to a specific Irish language speaker who could then deal with the individual and input into our systems appropriately.  I would suggest there is a technical fix to that issue.  We need to be innovative in responding to that.</p> <p>  In comparison to the situation in respect of how we test people now to that in 2011 or even in the 2000s, the test we now apply, this level 4, undoubtedly represents a more stringent standard.  This level indicates a far more fluent and competent speaker of Irish, one who can engage in everyday business and professional policing business in an entirely acceptable manner with regard to the service we provide.  I may ask Mr. Mulligan or Assistant Commissioner McMahon to comment on the training provided to students in Templemore.</p></speech>

A lot of the training relates to practical matters such as dealing with road traffic, arrests and so on.  We have full-time Irish teachers who work with the students.  Feedback from the college suggests that those students who go to areas in which they are not using Irish find it harder to keep their skills.  That is one of the new challenges we have to look at in the new strategy we are drawing up at the moment.</p> <p>  To come back to another point, it is important to state that we are one of the few public sector organisations that sets aside 10% of positions for people with Irish.  We and the Public Appointments Service advertise this.  We make sure it is advertised right across the country in both Gaeltacht areas and all other areas.  Nobody is more disappointed than ourselves by the response we have had but that is the response.  As I said earlier, we have attested 3,000 new Garda members since 2014.  We would have thought that, with a fair wind, that would have given us 300 people through the Irish stream but the reality is that we got 55.  I already gave some statistics as to the number of applications we got and I can certainly send in others going back through each competition over the years if the committee wishes. This outcome was not, however, the result of any lack of trying to make sure that people in those communities knew about the competition, that 10% of jobs were to be allocated to an Irish stream and that such applications would be fast-tracked.  As I have said, nobody was more disappointed than ourselves.  When we set out at the time, we really did expect a bigger response but that is the fact of the situation as it is.</p></speech>

There is a queue.  Many people do not necessarily want to go to a Gaeltacht area.  Having said that, I can assure the Deputy that with regard to the panel of people who have done the assessment and attained the level 4 standard, we do not have a problem with Kerry or Galway.  In some other areas, we do not have the numbers we want.  I mentioned Donegal earlier as one of those.</p> <p>  The organisation would be well aware that there is an assessment in Irish for people want to get on to that panel.  A previous one was done by the college, but it was not as stringent as this one.  We changed it and adapted it to European levels based on the advice we received from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.</p> <p>  This gives me an opportunity to speak on the numbers.  There have been improvements.  If I recall correctly, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga said we have 37% who are fluent in Irish.  It is down from 42%, but that is not counting like with like because the earlier figure was under the old testing regime which was not as stringent.  If we applied that testing regime now we would be up to 52% because we have increased by 11 or 12 points on that.  However, as I said, the new testing regime which we have now is more stringent and fit for purpose, to be honest. </p> <p>  The opportunity is there.  The missing piece, which we mentioned earlier, is the work we will be doing with Gaelchult&uacute;r on a course which will enable our police officers and our Garda staff who wish to transfer to these areas to avail of an opportunity to bring their Irish up to the requisite standard.  The advantage of what we are having done at the moment is that they will not have to go to classrooms.  Many of them could be living in rural areas or other areas where it is more difficult to do that.  This will be online.  The Garda College will facilitate that.  There will be an opportunity to do that.  The point made by the Deputy is very good.  When we have the Gaelchult&uacute;r courses online, they will give a better opportunity to people who might wish to go.  Hopefully, some of them will look to the north west, to the Donegal area, and we will facilitate that.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; a pr&iacute;omhrud at&aacute;im ag iarraidh a r&aacute; faoi n&aacute; go bhfuil na fadhbanna c&eacute;anna ann beagnach 100 bliain n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus a bh&iacute; ann in 1925.  Deir an tuarasc&aacute;il:  </p><blockquote>	In the case of the G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all native Irish Speaking G&aacute;rda&iacute;, all G&aacute;rda&iacute; with the F&aacute;inne qualification in Irish, and others with a good knowledge of the language, should be transferred, forthwith, to the Gaeltacht, concentrating, in the first instance, on Court districts ... </blockquote><p>Thuig siad an fhadhb ag an am sin.  Is &iacute; ceann de fadhbanna a bh&iacute; ann mar a deir an tuarasc&aacute;il n&iacute;os faide anonn:</p><blockquote>	So as to meet any deficiency in the supply of Officers, volunteers might be asked for from among Officers with a fair knowledge of Irish, to go to Irish Speaking Districts, with a view to perfecting themselves in their knowledge of the language.  Steps should be taken to select some of the most intelligent and diligent members of the G&aacute;rda, who are Native Speakers, for training as Officers for those Districts.  The Commission recommends that existing members of the G&aacute;rda retained in or transferred to the Gaeltacht, as competent to perform their work entirely in Irish should be paid, under conditions similar to those in the case of Civil Servants (paragraph 99), the following special grants ... </blockquote><p>T&oacute;gann s&eacute; sin muid ar ais go dt&iacute; an li&uacute;ntas a bh&iacute;odh ann.  Bh&iacute; aitheantas ann an tr&aacute;th sin gur ualach a bh&iacute; sa mh&eacute;id seo do daoine &oacute;ga leis an gc&aacute;il&iacute;ocht seo, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeid&iacute;s ag iarraidh dul go dt&iacute; an chathair.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, bh&iacute; siad lac&aacute;iste &aacute; thabhairt d&oacute;ibh chun cuidi&uacute; leo.  N&iacute;or &eacute;irigh go maith leo leis an earc&uacute; in 1923, mar a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an tuarasc&aacute;il freisin:</p><blockquote>	The percentage of Native Speakers among the G&aacute;rda&iacute; generally is 3.4.  It is essential that a much larger number of Native Speakers should be recruited.  Evidence was given that early in 1923, 500 recruits from the Gaeltacht were called for, but that no recruits came forward in response.  This failure was no doubt due to the disturbed state of the country at the time ... </blockquote><p>Bh&iacute; an Cogadh Cathartha ar si&uacute;l sa t&iacute;r ag an am.  Ach mar aitheantas ar an gceost seo, lean an tuarasc&aacute;il ar aghaidh: </p><blockquote>	The Commission recommends ... that 75% of the annual vacancies be reserved, forth with, for them until such time as 500 G&aacute;rda&iacute; at least have been recruited from the Gaeltacht. </blockquote><p>Ag an am sin chuir an coimisi&uacute;n leibh&eacute;al i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os airde chun cinn maidir leis an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n a bh&iacute; orthu.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh go smaoineoidh An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, m&aacute; t&aacute; an fhadhb seo ann i gceann bliana n&oacute; dh&aacute; bhliain gur g&aacute; d&uacute;inn c&eacute;im n&iacute;os airde a ghlacadh agus lac&aacute;iste a thabhairt isteach ar&iacute;s, n&oacute; &aacute;iteanna n&oacute; sp&aacute;sanna a choime&aacute;d d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Tagann s&eacute; seo ar ais go dt&iacute; an pointe a rinne an Seanad&oacute;ir Clifford-Lee - go gcaithfidh comhalta&iacute; den Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dul isteach sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge timpeall na t&iacute;re ar fad, agus sna bunscoileanna freisin m&aacute;s g&aacute;, chun daoine a mhealladh i dtreo An Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ionas go dtuigfidh siad gur sl&iacute; bheatha &eacute; amach anseo.  <br/><br/>B'fh&eacute;idir go dtiocfaimid ar ais go dt&iacute; Baile Atha Cliath mar fhocal scoir.  Bh&iacute;omar i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag gear&aacute;n go raibh na garda&iacute; ar fad &oacute; lasmuigh de Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus go raibh siad m&oacute;r agus gro&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; Gaeilge ag a l&aacute;n d&iacute;obh, ach n&iacute; raibh siad ag iarraidh fanacht sa bhaile sa Ghaeltacht.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gurb &eacute; sin ceann de na fadhbanna a gcaithfimid tabhairt faoi amach anseo.  M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir freagra gasta a thabhairt dom ar na ceisteanna sin, bheinn bu&iacute;och d&aacute;r n-a&iacute;onna agus cuirfimid cr&iacute;och leis an gcruinni&uacute; ansin.</p></speech>

Without wishing to create any confusion, we have 240 members with competence but we have 80 members who have said that they are ready and able to assist in operational scenarios as well.  That is known on our intranet, and their services are available.</p> <p>  On resources, we are a growing organisation and our budget grows commensurately with that.  The situation in Letterkenny illustrates that if one pump-primes some money, ourselves and other State bodies can act accordingly and do small works, in money terms, which have a big impact in the service that we provide.  We are very interested in seeing what success we will have with other agencies in Letterkenny in providing our service through the Irish language.  That is interesting in itself.</p> <p>  I cannot say that I can put my hand on the 1925 commission report, but we can certainly have a look for it.  I understand that it is quoted in some of the documents.  They set a target and I appreciate that a target concentrates minds.  We want to concentrate our minds on this.  Overall, we do not want to find ourselves in these precise circumstances.  I have no objection whatsoever in coming back to explain what we have done in the interim, as I am sure the committee will understand.  We want to be coming back with a better news story - number one on recruitment; number two on training; and number three on the overall picture, not just the placement of individuals in the Gaeltacht but the overall service we are providing in the medium of the Irish language.</p></speech>

We have one item of committee business to address before I call on the witnesses to present, that is, the draft minutes of our meetings on 5 and 6 May, both the public and private sessions.  Are those minutes agreed?  Agreed.  There are no matters arising.</p> <p>  We will now proceed to our pre-legislative scrutiny.  This meeting has been convened with representatives of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, the special rapporteur on child protection, Professor Conor O'Mahony, representatives from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre and from the DCU institute of future media, democracy and society.  This is the fourth of our public hearings to discuss the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.</p> <p>  Our guests are all very welcome.  We have to hold these meetings virtually and, of course, it never feels the same as having our guests present in the committee rooms, but we are delighted to be joined by them.  I thank them very much for their presence.</p> <p>  I would like to welcome the witnesses who are joining us remotely.  I welcome Dr. Karen McAuley, head of policy at the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO; Professor Conor O'Mahony, special rapporteur on child protection; Dr. Eileen Culloty from institute for future media, democracy and society in DCU; and Dr. Tijana Milosvevic from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make their opening statements, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  I will call the representatives of each organisation to deliver their opening statement in the following order: Dr. McAuley, Professor O'Mahony and a representative of the institute for future media, democracy and society.  The opening statements are limited to three minutes per organisation.</p> <p>  I would advise witnesses of the following regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements whereby members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirements.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I ask members to please identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback and to use the raise hand button when they wish to make a contribution.  I remind those joining today's meeting to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. McAuley to make her opening statement on behalf of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO.</p></speech>

I would also like to convey the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s apologies that he is unable to attend today&rsquo;s meeting due to a prior engagement.  As members of the committee are aware, the OCO is an independent statutory body which was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Under the 2002 Act, the OCO has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age and to examine and investigate complaints made by or for children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have or may have adversely affected a child.</p> <p>  The OCO&rsquo;s engagement with developments that have given rise to the current general scheme, and with the general scheme itself, has focused on proposals for the establishment of an online safety commissioner and, as such, on Part 4 of the current scheme.</p> <p>  In a new general comment published in March this year, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recalls that while the digital environment is playing an increasingly important role in many aspects of children&rsquo;s lives, it was not originally designed for children.  As the UN committee notes, and as we all know, alongside the opportunities the digital environment affords for the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights are the risks it poses to their violation or abuse.</p> <p>  The proposals set out in the general scheme to establish a regulatory framework for online safety to address the spread and amplification of harmful online content, represent a significant opportunity to strengthen the protection of children from such content.  This is not to suggest, however, that the proposals do not require further refinement.  In this regard, our submission to the committee identifies elements of Part 4 that we believe require further attention.  They include the proposals relating to categories of harmful online content and to a systemic complaints scheme.</p> <p>  The OCO&rsquo;s work is underpinned by primary legislation.  Therefore, we understand how important it is that legislation is enabling.  The prospective authority, credibility and effectiveness of the proposed media commission are largely contingent on the statutory framework that is ultimately put in place for it, as well as on the resources allocated to enable the commission to discharge its functions, including in respect of online safety.</p> <p>  The online environment is constantly evolving and expanding.  Therefore, it is foreseeable that, once enacted, this legislation will be subject to future amendments.  This being the case, we would suggest that work to develop and progress the current legislative proposals may benefit from a focus on getting the fundamentals right, so as to ensure that the commission is placed on a sound statutory footing and can get off to a good start.</p> <p>  In relation to the prospective work of the online safety commissioner specifically, this will involve making sure that the regulatory tools available to the commissioner have the potential to be effective, that the provisions made about the online content and material that fall within the scope of the commissioner&rsquo;s work are rights compliant, understood and workable and the complaints scheme put in place upholds the right, including the right of children, to an effective remedy.</p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the invitation to meet it today.  I am happy to take questions, if required.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with members about the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  This is an important Bill because of the digital environment is largely unregulated in Ireland at present.  The Bill presents an important opportunity to address a number of concerns relating to the risk of harm that may occur to children during their online activities.  At the outset, I would like to emphasise that the digital environment is not an inherently bad thing for children.</p><p>We often focus on the negatives but the reality is that the digital environment is somewhere we all increasingly live our lives.  Children spend a significant amount of time there and it offers enormous opportunities to children to express themselves, play and socialise, avail of educational opportunities and participate in society.  Children&rsquo;s rights principles require that we ensure children are allowed to benefit from these opportunities and that measures aimed at protecting children from harm avoid unduly restricting children&rsquo;s capacity to so engage.  </p><p> However, we should acknowledge that there are important and significant risks of harm in the digital environment.  As children now spend so much time online, they are exposed to increasing risks of cyberbullying, exposure to harmful material, exploitation and abuse.  Although children&rsquo;s rights principles require that children should have the freedom to engage in online activities, they equally require that children should be protected from harm while they so do.</p><p> My submission draws in particular on international guidance from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe.  I have extrapolated from that guidance three key principles of which we need to be aware.  First, the legislative and regulatory environment must be clear and predictable.  Second, the law must require businesses to meet their responsibilities to respect children&rsquo;s rights in the digital environment.  Third, the law must provide for accessible non-judicial remedies and grievance mechanisms while ensuring that judicial remedies remain available.</p><p> Looking at the general scheme of the Bill in its current form, there are several ways in which it falls somewhat short of these principles.  As regards a clear and predictable legal environment, the Bill lacks clear definitions of several concepts, such as pornography or gross or gratuitous violence and this, in turn, leaves the concept of age-inappropriate material somewhat unclear in the Bill.  It omits financial harm as a type of online harm, meaning that it has no implications around the exposure of children to online gambling.  The references to the concepts of the best interests of the child and the evolving capacities of the child are quite vague and do not sufficiently explain what those principles require of regulatory bodies or service providers.  Most important, the Bill does not provide for a system of individual complaints that can lead to the removal of harmful content.  Finally, it does not require service providers to carry out any form of children's rights due diligence, such as risk assessments on possible forms of online harm to children.</p><p> The final point I wish to make is that international guidance has repeatedly emphasised the importance of including child participation in any process leading to the enactment of laws regulating the digital environment.  No one understands better than children and young people themselves how they experience and navigate the digital environment.  We would be doing them a disservice if we did not afford them the opportunity to contribute their views before this legislation is enacted.</p><p> I thank the committee members for their attention.  My written submission elaborates on these points.  I am happy to deal with any questions members may have.</p></speech>

The Bill is important legislation because the media environment has changed fundamentally and there are major concerns regarding online harms.  These are complex issues.  They relate to debates about the regulation of online platforms and the need to balance the mitigation of harms with the protection of rights and freedoms.  In that context, it is imperative that the Bill provides sufficient clarity about the roles and functions of the new media commission.  Only one role is identified in the Bill, that of the child safety commissioner.  We recommend the inclusion of a media pluralism commissioner.  This would, in keeping with the EU media freedom Act, address these critical concerns and threats with regard to the future of a viable media system in Ireland and a vibrant public sphere.  Relatedly, we recommend that action be taken quickly on the content levy because it is imperative for the viability of Irish media and should be broadened to include wider support for the sector.</p> <p>  We note that the Bill does not reference disinformation.  This is out of step with the EU Digital Services Act and the democracy action plan, both of which recognise disinformation as a harm that threatens society and democracy.  Media regulators across Europe, including the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, are already monitoring the implementation of the code of practice on disinformation, so this falls within the remit of the media commission.</p> <p>  To date, there has been widespread criticism of online platforms.  Much of this is about the lack of transparency and accountability relating to automated decision making, moderation and the responses of the platforms to harms.  Much of the reporting and their transparency measures are in aggregate.  For example, reports will note that three million pieces of bullying and harassment content were actioned in a given quarter but, unless there is sufficient context, it is impossible to analyse these data in a meaningful way or to evaluate whether the actions of the platforms are actually effective.  Research is needed, as are clear obligations to report meaningful data, rather than more transparency reports.</p> <p>  In Australia, the Online Safety Act and the Office of the eSafety Commissioner have implemented an individual complaints mechanism.  If the implementation of such a mechanism is not possible here, we recommend that platforms catering to children be required to fund a portion of prevention and intervention measures, such as counselling services and helpline services.  This could also be considered as a component of providers&rsquo; duty of care.</p> <p>  In conclusion, we believe the Bill is a concrete step towards establishing media regulation that is fit for the 21st century.  Our comments are intended to enhance the design and operation of a media commission that will serve the needs of the public and the media industry.  I am happy to answer members' questions on behalf of the DCU institute for future media, society and democracy.  My colleague, Dr. Milosevic, is present representing the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre.</p></speech>

We know that Australia has a system in place whereby an individual complaints mechanism is available.  I know from personal experience that when hundreds of tweets are aimed at you on Twitter, and one in particular on Instagram is the one you want to remove and chase, the tweets on Twitter essentially do not matter in that context as far as Instagram is concerned.  I believe in an individual complaints mechanism.  How important do our guests consider such a mechanism is in the context of the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051200002#B00600"><p>To my mind, the absence of an individual complaints mechanism is the single biggest weakness in the Bill as it stands.  If we persist with an approach that does not include provision for individual complaints, it is probable that we will be heavily criticised in the near future by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for that failure.  The thing about the risk of it being overwhelmed is that we do not need to think of an individual complaints mechanism in a State agency as the first port of call.  Ideally, the law should be structured in such a way that one imposes strong obligations on the service providers themselves to have local-level complaints mechanisms such that the complaint would in the first instance go to the service provider, which would have a legal obligation to have a mechanism for dealing with that complaint, responding to it and removing content.  It would only be in cases where that fails at local level with the service provider that the complaint would then be escalated to whichever State agency is regulating this area of activity.  In that way, one tries to filter out the majority of the complaints before they reach the relevant State agency and that avoids the risk of it being overwhelmed in the way that has been identified.</p><p>As I have said, it is not sustainable to leave this out of the Bill.</p></speech>

From our perspective, what is proposed at present does not appear to be aligned with children's right to an effective remedy, as conceived by the Council of Europe in its 2018 recommendation which Professor O'Mahony referenced and several general comments issued by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, including its most recent comment on children's rights in the digital environment.</p> <p>  In respect of children's rights to an effective remedy, reference is made to the need for child-sensitive mechanisms.  That means mechanisms that are prompt, genuinely available and accessible, and able to receive, investigate and address complaints.  Therefore, t is important to give further consideration to the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism.  We understand the Department's concerns, and clearly it would not be in service users' interests, including those of children, for the commissioner to be overwhelmed by complaints such as to create significant delays or backlogs in addressing them.  However, as Professor O'Mahony indicated, it would not be anticipated that the commissioner would be the first port of call.  Really, what needs to happen is that online services are provided with the competencies to be able to deal with complaints appropriately, effectively, which means swiftly, and that where the manner of dealing with it does not resolve the problem, service users including children and parents acting on their behalf have the opportunity to approach the commissioner with their concerns.</p></speech>

If this is impossible to institute for some reasons, we wish to underscore the point that it is important to provide psychological and counselling supports to children who experience this.  We have found, and I believe it was indicated by the children who appeared as witnesses before the committee last week, that very often they find themselves in a situation where the reporting of it does not work for some reason.  What happens is that content spills over from one platform to another, and it is the case that the content is spreading and the child is not able to get the right support.  As we have seen from research, very often it is not enough to have the content taken down.  What also matters to children is to have that follow-up, where they get the educational and psychological support as victims, particularly of cyberbullying which is the focus of our research.  Therefore, in addition to having content removed, supports for an individual must be in place.  We recommend that it is most important to consider that there is a good infrastructure to support children when they find themselves in these situations and to support them individually.</p></speech>

I will read from the submission of two of the girls from Kinsale, which states: "Sometimes it can be infuriating for students to be lectured on the dangers of social media by parents who perhaps don't understand that this is an integral part of growing up."  Everyone here this morning has touched on that point and the issue of finding that balancing act.  However, I refer back to the remarks made by Dr. McAuley in her opening statement on guaranteeing the fundamental rights.  I ask all of the witnesses the following.  Currently, how far short is the general scheme of the legislation in respect of getting the fundamental rights and the definitions right?  Already we have touched on a number of points in respect of defining pornography and abuse.  How far short are we in that respect?</p> <p>  I have a follow-up question, specifically for Professor O'Mahony.  I am delighted that he touched on the category of harmful online content, in particular, in the area of gambling.  He noted in his submission that about three quarters of teenagers of between 12 and 17 years of age gamble annually, higher than any other age group.  I fully support him in the point he made about the failure to deal with this.  I ask him to allude to that.  By way of illustrating the dangers and the very devious way in which gambling companies can use these platforms to target children,  I will use the following example.  Just last week, a prominent Dublin GAA star, acting as an ambassador for one of these gambling companies, spoke about underage football.  In the body of the article, when reference was made to the gambling company for which he was acting as ambassador, the name of the gambling company was highlighted so that a user could click on it and be brought to the live online betting odds for last weekend's fixtures.  That is how deceptive and devious they are.  They are able to use these platforms to attack young underage children.  It galls me to think that there are sports stars being complicit in this area and are letting their good names be used for the exploitation of others.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

He asked about ways in which the proposals fall short.  We have already spoken briefly about the provisions made in respect of the availability for redress and how it is proposed that complaints may be dealt with by the commissioner, or not, as the case may be.  That is one very important area that, from our perspective, needs further work in order to ensure that it safeguards children's right to an effective remedy in an appropriate and effective way.</p> <p>  As we indicated in our submission and I noted in my opening statement briefly, there are other areas about which we have residual concerns.  In respect of the proposed approach to defining harmful content, it has less to do with the four categories that have been proposed so far than the use of categories as a mechanism.  We understand the rationale for it, but we do have concerns about whether the use of categories is sufficiently specific to be rights-compliant.  Clearly, it is absolutely essential that the provisions made in this regard and in other areas are rights-compliant so as to mitigate against any risk of future challenge.  It is really about legal certainty around this.</p> <p>  We also have concerns in terms of specificity about whether the use of categories, as currently conceived, is sufficiently clear as to support a shared understanding about what falls within the scope of each category, and with that, that the categories will be workable for the commission.  Again, it is about mitigating risk at this juncture of differences of understanding as to what does and does not fall within the scope and perspective disagreement between the commission and other stakeholders on this point.  I will hand over to others to give them an opportunity to speak.  We have similar concerns around proposals currently around age-inappropriate material.  We need further clarification and information and the proposals need further refinement. </p></speech>

I do not think it is a case of it needing to be scrapped and to start all over again.  It is a case of it needing to go further in a number of respects.  To take a few examples that I mentioned, it is the right thing to make reference to principles like the best interests of the child and the child's evolving capacities.  It is good to include that.  However, we need to go further and clarify what that means and what obligations flow from those principles in respect of the media commission or the online safety commissioner or service providers.  It should be clarified what they have to do on foot of those principles to make them a reality.  The thrust of my submission is that the general direction is good, but there are a number of places in which the proposals need to go further and be refined and developed more.</p> <p>  On the gambling point, I agree with the Senator.  The issue is that we must ensure that we do not leave loopholes, because we know that service providers will try to exploit those loopholes where they exist.  If the evidence suggests - which I believe it does - that online gambling poses a risk of harm to children, then we need to be sure that the Bill really calls that out and puts in place specific safeguards that address that rather than leaving loopholes, of which service providers will be only too happy to take advantage.</p></speech>

It is important to understand that this media environment is going to keep changing and there will be new platforms and practices.  Dr. McAuley was talking about the danger of focusing on categories of content.  In five years' time, the dynamics could be completely different.  It will be important to build in some element of future-proofing, which is what we are trying to get at with this idea of a media pluralism commissioner.  While that may not be the correct term, I am referring to somebody who takes a very broad perspective of the environment and the trends that are happening.  Perhaps we could also move out of this cycle of reacting to all the digital problems that are coming at us and being on the back foot, and actually think forward with some vision of what kind of media environment we want for all citizens, whatever age they are.</p></speech>

I have two sets of questions.  The first is for Dr. McAuley around the question of advertising and micro-targeting of children online.  I have a particular concern in this regard.  I am rather frightened by the news that Facebook is now talking about developing Instagram for kids, and I think it is an appalling idea.  I would be grateful to hear what Dr. McAuley feels we need to put into the legislation to deal with advertising that specifically targets children, and how we can address that.</p> <p>  On a question to Dr. Culloty, an area of concern is around the whole question of algorithmic decision-making and machine learning.  We have been looking at the idea that the new media commission would develop specific codes in these areas to ensure transparency and awareness of when algorithmic decision-making is taking place.  Will Dr. Culloty elaborate on what she believes we should look to have in the legislation?  I may come back in later but those are my first two sets of questions.</p></speech>

We have not had an opportunity to look in detail at the whole question of advertising in the context of this general scheme.  However, as the committee knows, children have a right to protection from material that is potentially harmful to their well-being, and that could include advertising and the risk of commercial exploitation associated with that.  From our perspective, and to refer back to what Professor O'Mahony was discussing in his opening statement, there is an international human rights framework that talks about the responsibilities of business in the round in regard to human rights and children's rights.  It is an area that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and others have looked at.  There are two potential codes that are referenced in the general scheme that, if developed and implemented, may assist in this area.  The first is around impact assessment and, as Professor O'Mahony indicated, there is currently no explicit reference to children's rights and due diligence.  As regards child rights impact assessment, that is a mechanism we would like to see promoted through the legislation.  There is also a code in regard to the whole area of commercial engagement and advertising, so there may be scope to develop it in the legislation.</p></speech>

At present, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has specific codes around advertising and children, and dealing with issues like junk food and other areas.  I am looking for clarity on what we should have in the legislation around those areas of advertising but, obviously, in regard to specific platforms.  I am frightened by the idea of Instagram for kids.  What can we do, as legislators, to address that?</p></speech>

If we look, for example, at the most recent general comment from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, it particularly highlights the risk of profiling and the risk of advertising based on data which have been collected about the characteristics of service users, or implied characteristics.  We know that when we use our devices and search for a particular service, the next thing is that advertisements are thrown at us for that service.  That sort of process, whereby online services can, to an extent, covertly gather data on children and then seek to bombard them with particular types of advertising based on those data, is particularly flagged by the UN committee as something which needs to be regulated.  Although I might have to double-check this, I believe it said that sort of profiling and targeting should be prohibited by law.</p> <p>  It is important that those kinds of things are captured because the existing regulatory environment around other forms of advertising might not have the detail.  While I am not an expert on that area of law, we might not find the detail we need in some other laws to deal with that sort of activity.</p></speech>

The platforms often talk about transparency and provide transparency reports but when we are talking about something as complicated as algorithms, transparency means very little, definitely for most members of the public.  What accountability requires is, first, that people with expertise are able to ask the right questions of the platforms and, hopefully, this will be within the commission itself.  It also requires that the platforms share sufficient data to allow independent oversight of what they are doing.  That second part has been a huge gap where the platforms have not provided any kind of data that would allow us to understand what actions they are actually taking.  Dr. Milosevic might have something to add in regard to content moderation.</p></speech>

What we are lacking currently, and this has been my point for a long time, is an understanding of the impact and effectiveness of how moderation affects children, so we need to embed their own feedback into the design and development of these moderation systems.  Currently, a platform may say that, proactively, it is able to detect a certain amount of content, for example, bullying content, without it being reported first by children.  However, that does not mean much to us without sufficient context as to how much bullying there is overall, what the platform has done with this and whether children have actually been satisfied with the initiatives the platform has taken with that content.  In order to evaluate that, as Dr. Culloty pointed out, we should have access to data but also greater understanding of what these numbers actually mean.</p></speech>

It has been a very informative session and I thank them for taking time out to be with us.  My question is general in its approach and is for all the witnesses.  It is to get an understanding of their feelings on the Bill in its current general scheme format and the provisions they would like to see in order to provide a clear legal obligation to remove harmful content on foot of an appropriate complaints system.  In his submission, Professor O'Mahony referenced international approaches, including in the UK and Germany.  The latter adopted the Network Enforcement Act to remove harmful content within 24 hours of notification of a complaint and, basically, to remove any unlawful content within seven days.  We have seen that France recently proposed fines of up to 4% of online providers' global revenue for repeat offenders.  A number of other international legislative measures have been enacted and Australia has established the eSafety Commissioner.  How do the witnesses feel the Bill needs to be strengthened in this area?</p> <p>  With regard to misinformation, would the witnesses foresee platforms using fact checkers and how would the future shape of this be implemented?  We all know different platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, use different forms in terms of how they police misinformation.</p><p>I would like to hear the witnesses' understanding of it.  </p></speech>

It is very important for all of us to bear in mind that there will be circumstances where a child could be very distressed by virtue of content they have been exposed to, for example, online cyberbullying.  They and their parents will be looking to have something done about it.  Speed is of the essence here.  While safeguards are in place in terms of procedural fairness, rights balancing and so on, one of our concerns is that there is nothing currently set out under the legislative proposals that suggests speed is possible.  I am not suggesting short cuts by any means, but speed is one of the things we need to think about.  In that regard, there is currently no obligation on online services to remove harmful content.  That area needs to be looked at further in the interests of ensuring that what is put in place is not only effective but does not cause undue delay.</p></speech>

If there is content which falls within the definition of some form of harmful content in one of the various categories in the Bill there needs to be a consequence.  First, there needs to be a very clear legal obligation on a service provider to remove content identified on its platform which falls foul of one of those provisions in the Bill.  If it is only a soft measure through some form of code of practice, or a document of that nature, we are likely to see non-compliance.</p> <p>  In my submission, I referenced an anecdote from the CEO of CyberSafeIreland who talked about a parent taking more than two years to seek to have harmful material in relation to one of their children removed.  There is a risk that if we do not create a very clear obligation to remove material that scenario will be repeated in future.  A clear obligation that harmful material must be removed is currently absent, but there also needs to be a process which leads up to that point because in order to identify that material there needs to be a very clear complaints mechanism.</p> <p>  The key elements are, first, the obligation to remove material and, second, a local complaints mechanism at service provider level so issues can be brought to a service provider's attention without having to go near the online safety commissioner.  Third, as a safety net, the online safety commissioner complaints mechanism would address cases where service providers are not meeting their obligations.  Those are the three components I would like to see. </p></speech>

What happens on each platform differs.  One of the big problems is that we do not know whether those actions are effective.  We also do not know the extent of the impact of disinformation on these platforms.  All of that comes back to the fact that platforms are not obliged to share this data with independent researchers or authorities who could actually verify what is happening.  That is why we are arguing that disinformation should be included, explicitly named, in the Bill because it already falls within the remit of the BAI, which currently has a role in monitoring the EU code of practice on disinformation.  The EU Digital Services Act, the democracy action plan and the media action plan all clearly reference disinformation.</p> <p>  We should also note that all these issues are interrelated.  We tend to talk about them as completely separate issues, as though problems with online harms and child safety, attacks on journalists and disinformation that might undermine democracy were not related.  These are all interrelated and the common denominator is the online platforms.  It makes sense for a new media regulator to have that broad perspective, which would give it more power in dealing with platforms.</p></speech>

We need to be able to see them with that comprehensive view.  That is why we think a role specifically aimed at that is needed.  For example, we know worldwide media freedom has been eroded and Ireland is not immune to this.  It is already a big issue at European level which is why proposals for the European media freedom Act have been announced.</p> <p>  The traditional issue of diversity of ownership has normally been viewed as a competition issue, but pluralism in the market is not just about competition anymore.  For example, in a very small English-speaking country like Ireland, which is dominated by a huge English-language market, there is a real concern about the future viability of Irish cultural production in Irish media.  We know there are huge problems in journalism with the viability of its financial model.  We are already seeing the closure of many local media outlets, especially regional newspapers, creating these news deserts where information is not covered.</p> <p>  Of course, all the issues we discussed today around regulating online content raise freedom of information and freedom of expression concerns.  There ought to be a dedicated role that thinks about all these matters in a comprehensive way.  Again, it is future-looking and assessing changing trends and future threats.</p></speech>

Most people would agree that makes sense.  Can Dr. Culloty tell us what that will look like, very briefly?  Is she talking about a levy on a percentage of profits?</p></speech>

We would have to, of course, leave the administrative decision-making up to Government because it is not within our area of expertise.  At the moment, companies normally voluntarily donate money to individual research groups, charities or organisations, but the idea is to institute that through the Government.  What we propose, envisage or suggest could be part of the statutory duty of care which has been proposed in other legislation.  The rationale for this is that we often see that infrastructural support for a child would be beneficial as part of an individual complaints scheme.  For instance, we have Coco's Law within the Department of Justice, which relates to a young person, not a child, who was affected and did not receive adequate help.  What happened to her was a series of online harassment cases.  She was not getting adequate infrastructural support from the Garda, from the online companies or adequate counselling and psychological and educational help.</p> <p>  We are proposing the Government really thinks about supporting an infrastructure that involves education and counselling, so when this happens every individual child and parent knows where to go.  This should be streamlined, rather than having a series of individual organisations that might not be working in tandem.  It should be concertedly thought through how the infrastructure is unified, to ensure we know who people go to in order to get the help they need when this happens when they are not able to deal with an individual piece of content that, in cyberbullying cases, usually happens in tandem with what is going on offline.  That is what we are proposing.  The details and administrative part are outside my domain of expertise.</p></speech>

They flagged the lack of resources.  The option at the moment is to hold platforms accountable.  It has been done in Australia, so it is possible.  The idea is for us to take our time with this Bill to ensure it is fit for purpose and that it covers as many aspects as possible.  That is what we want it to do.  I am sure the witnesses would agree that fundamental to that is having sufficient resources.  Would they agree with Professor O'Mahony that that would be the single biggest weakness if we want to have accountability and oversight of all this?  Not having the option of an individual complaints mechanism automatically weakens the Bill from the get-go.  </p></speech>

We share Professor O'Mahony's concerns in that regard.  Our submission to the committee made reference to the proposed systemic complaints scheme which obviously cannot be viewed in isolation.  It needs to be looked at with the other tools that are proposed for the commissioner.  We are not suggesting that having a systemic complaints scheme is inherently flawed.  However, while the proposed commission is being tasked with it, the general scheme and indeed the regulatory impact analysis provide very little detail about it.  Therefore, it is not clear whether it could work as an effective alternative.</p> <p>  Regarding individual complaints handling, as we noted in our submission to the committee we feel it is very important that online service providers are tasked and equipped with the knowledge and competences to be able to deal effectively, appropriately and efficiently with complaints that come to them.  Ultimately, if service providers are adept at good complaints handling practice and are able to resolve the concerns that complaints may come to their attention, that serves service users, including children, well because it supports a swift resolution of the issue.  As I said earlier, it is still important to allow for that not being the case at all times.  People need a further avenue.  That is where the question of prospective individual complaints handling by the online safety commission itself needs to be considered.  It is not a question of suggesting that the online safety commissioner should be the first port of call but rather that it should be an avenue that is available.  In other words, we should have an independent non-judicial mechanism.</p> <p>  We are very aware of the Department's concerns about the capacity of the commission to deal with the potential quantity of complaints that may come to it if an individual complaints-handling mechanism is put in place.  We are not sure about the extent to which the Department may have considered introducing a third strand.  It is not a question of having one or the other.  Rather than a systemic scheme or an individual complaints handling scheme, is there a way in which we can introduce an individual complaints-handling component which would complement the roles performed, for example, by a systemic complaint scheme by the auditing measures that are there and which would be set up in such a way that would mitigate the risk of the commission being overwhelmed by the volume of complaints?</p></speech>

How important will the media pluralism commissioner be?  The Bill makes reference to a child safety commissioner, but it merely provides that the Minister may appoint a child safety commissioner.  I ask the witnesses to outline their views on the importance of that.</p> <p>  It was stated earlier that before the legislation was enacted, it would be doing young people a disservice if they were not afforded the opportunity to contribute their views.  After this legislation is enacted, should children have an active role in this?</p></speech>

There are many threats on multiple systems, including the harassment of journalists and media workers as well as the decline of media companies at national, regional and local level.  Some previous witnesses have spoken about community media.  It is about ensuring that we have a very vibrant national system for media throughout the system, including the public broadcaster.  We believe that one role could tie together the various strands of concern and also have a future-looking perspective.</p></speech>

As outlined in our submission, we understand the reasons for that.  To ensure that the legislation is agile and to future-proof it as far as possible, our preference would be for explicit provision to be made for an online safety commissioner.</p> <p>  Regarding children's participation, our initial submission in 2019 strongly encouraged the Department to include children and young people in its work to develop the current legislative proposals.  We are disappointed that has not occurred.  Equally, we very much welcome that the committee invited young people to appear before it last week.  If there is scope, given that this legislation has the distance to travel, we would really like to see children and young people being afforded a child-friendly opportunity to be able to express their views and concerns in respect of the legislation prior to it being enacted.  Equally, when the commission is set up, we would hope that children and young people, as very important stakeholders, would be consulted about the work of the commission.  </p></speech>

I also welcome that young people were invited to appear before the committee last week.  I had not been aware of that before today and it is good to hear.  It is incredibly important that any child participation is meaningful and not just a tokenistic thing.  It should not be done just to give the appearance that children have been involved.  They need to be given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, contribute to the process, and to have their views properly considered and taken on board as part of that process.</p> <p>  The important point has been made that this is an ongoing process.  As we are all aware, the digital environment evolves very quickly and how it looks today may not be how it looks in a few years.  Dr. Culloty has repeatedly made the point about future-proofing.  Part of that future-proofing process must involve staying in touch with young people to hear their experiences of how it has changed and evolved, and for that feed into reviews of codes of practice or reviews of the legislation itself in years to come.</p></speech>

As it stands, the definitions in the Bill would not capture a child suffering harm through exposure to gambling.  That could take a number of different forms.  I drew the term "financial harm" from work of the British children's commissioner who had recommended in their framework that the concept of financial harm was an appropriate vehicle for ensuring that laws regulating harm online could capture exposure of children to gambling.  That was the thinking behind that.</p></speech>

They have brought very detailed observations on the Bill.  I will ask them to extrapolate further on some of the points they have made.</p><p>My first question is for Dr. Culloty.  She spoke about future-proofing, which is the idea behind having a commissioner for media pluralism.  The problem for any Bill like this is the fluidity of social media platforms and how they change to reach larger audiences.  It will be difficult to keep on top of the issue, which I believe was Dr. Culloty's point.  Is research ongoing into online enforcement of community standards by social media platforms?  I had a recent experience of this with one of the platforms in question.  What issues do researchers encounter when trying to research these platforms?  Dr. Culloty mentioned that the platforms were not that willing to share information with independent researchers.  Perhaps that is where the issue of disinformation comes into this.</p><p> Professor O'Mahony stated that the Bill did not require service providers to carry out any form of due diligence in respect of children's rights, for example, risk assessment of possible forms of online harm that might result from their services.  We have touched on this matter already, but will he expand on it further?</p><p> Dr. McAuley made many observations.  Someone mentioned the consequences and obligations stemming from harmful online content.  I did not write down the person's name, although it may have been Professor O'Mahony.  This is an important matter.  How does Dr. McAuley suggest the Bill could address it better?  Dr. Culloty spoke about how the speed of removal of harmful content was not what it should be.  Perhaps that point feeds into this matter.</p></speech>

The children who spoke last week were clear about that.  It is how we communicate with our families, friends and colleagues.  It is also where small businesses operate.  The platforms are private companies, though, and they are free to set the terms and conditions for participation on their platforms as they wish.  This is something with which we are struggling to grapple.  We treat them like they are a public space, but they are not.  They are private commercial spaces.</p> <p>  One of the reasons we struggle to understand the extent of the phenomenon that we are concerned about is that the platforms do not provide access to data that would allow us to research it.  In terms of the way they implement community standards, the research suggests it is inconsistent.  We saw this in the wake of the riots at the US Capitol, where platforms wanted to take various actions.  Some of them were in compliance with their community standards.  Most of the time, they did not even reference their community standards or terms of service.  They just took the actions they wanted to take.  There is no pushback against that.</p> <p>  It is a larger, blue-sky academic question.  I hope that something that comes out of the Future of Media Commission is a decision on what we want from these online public spaces and how citizen participation can be imbedded into them.  In Ireland, there is a proposal for the development of social media councils involving various independent experts and citizens who would engage in discussions on what types of content and behaviour are suitable online and what we want from these spaces.  Platforms might participate in those discussions.</p> <p>  All of these conversations are in their early days, but the question about the future is a major one and we cannot sleepwalk into more of these mistakes.  Significant discussions need to be had.</p></speech>

This point was emphasised in an earlier general comment in respect of children's rights in the business sector and has been re-emphasised in terms of the digital environment specifically in the CRC's most recent general comment.</p> <p>  Head 50A of the Bill makes reference to requirements on service providers to undertake actions like risk assessments, but it does not specify that such risk assessments should include an examination of risks posed to children's rights in the delivery of their services.  The important point to emphasise in this regard is that children's rights are still a relatively emerging concept in some ways and the concept's buy-in by society at large and the business sector is not as strong as it could be.  Children's rights are a more detailed and involved concept than just the child's right to protection from harm.  The CRC's general comment No. 25 on children's rights in the digital environment spells out a range of different rights that children have that are implicated in online activities.  If we are to ensure that these rights are protected in the digital environment, the CRC says that we need to impose obligations on service providers to assess how the delivery of their services will impact across the range of children's rights and what risks will be presented in that regard.  My fear is that, when head 50A refers simply to a risk assessment without making any reference to what kinds of risk need to be covered by that assessment, children's rights could be left behind in the process.</p></speech>

As an organisation, we are not best placed to comment on the prospective efficacy of those sanctions.  We would like to think that they might work as a deterrent.</p> <p>  We welcome an important aspect of the Bill, although it needs further development, namely, the focus on prevention and early intervention, on trying to reduce children's exposure to harmful content, and on putting in place a system that understands what that means and is able to deal with it appropriately in the interests of children.</p></speech>

We would be concerned if such a mechanism was part of the media commission yet the regulator had to deal with complaints in the first instance.  In those circumstances, we will be looking at drawing up codes and setting a statutory duty of care on some of the platforms.  What do the witnesses believe we should include in that duty of care?  Should there be variations depending on the type of platform?  For example, Facebook and Twitter are very outward facing.  Should they be subject to different expectations than WhatsApp or a private messaging group?  The Chair posed Dr. McAuley some questions about sanctions.  They are crucial in this regard.  There is also the question of remedies.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on same.  For anyone, but children in particular, what remedies do they believe could be offered?</p> <p>  My final question is a general one and gets to the crux of much of this debate.  Do the witnesses consider a number of these social media platforms to be platforms or publishers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-12a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051200002#G01100"><p>There were many questions and I might not get to all of them.  On the question of sanctions, I echo Dr. McAuley's point about their use as a deterrent.  There is that value to them.  It was mentioned that some of the sanctions seen in other jurisdictions were very much at the higher end.  If those were put in place in Ireland and providers realised that the consequences could be significant financially if they fell foul of them, we would create a strong deterrent.</p><p>Deterrents, by their nature, will never catch everything but they have an important role to play in focusing the mind of certain providers in respect of the nature of their obligations.</p><p> On the question of remedies, the remedy is emphasised in the international guidance from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe.  The idea that there should be an individual remedy for the individual child is stressed by both organisations.  Financial compensation is obviously one version of that.  The idea is that where the service provider has failed in its obligations and children have suffered harm as a result, there would be a possibility of redress on foot of it.  This serves to have a deterrent effect in the first instance because there is potentially a further financial consequence for the service provider and it provides a degree of redress for the person affected.  Mentioned several times, particularly by Dr. Milosevic, has been the idea of supports for children affected.  From a children's rights perspective, where children do suffer harm, particularly the very serious harm that can occur online, providing them with the necessary therapeutic services and supports is a really important part of the picture.  The reality in Ireland is that, across the spectrum of ways in which children suffer harm, we do not always provide very good services to children who experience sexual abuse or other such forms of harm.  Therefore, there is a lot that needs to be done to improve the services.  That applies in the digital environment as well as in the everyday world.  Perhaps fines or damages awarded against service providers who fall foul of their obligations could be channelled into supporting those kinds of services or access thereto.  Perhaps this could be explored further.</p></speech>

The early regulation on the Internet defined what we call online platforms as something akin to a telephone line provider, which is providing a service and is not responsible for what people say over the phone.  That is perfectly reasonable.  The platforms we have now, however, are clearly a lot more involved than a telephone line.  Therefore, they are more than just neutral.  They are also not publishers in the traditional sense of media broadcasters or newspapers.  From regulatory and policy perspectives, we have not really grappled with the fact that we have a new type of entity with enormous influence.</p> <p>  On the point on media pluralism, when we talk about pluralism in the media market we mean media owners.  We should also think about pluralism on the Internet because the Internet is a lot bigger than the handful of platforms that dominate the online world.  It is lax regulation internationally that has allowed them to buy up competitors and new entrants to the market.  They are fundamentally anti-competitive and giving the view that a handful of platforms own the Internet.  They do not.  There is an important role for regulators internationally, not just in Ireland, to push back against that.</p></speech>

It may not be all that relevant but I will ask it just in case.  A number of years ago, there was a considerable conversation on the digital age of consent.  The Ombudsman for Children had a strong view on being realistic about children's Internet usage.  Should we keep that in sight in respect of this Bill?  We have one of the highest digital ages of consent, at 16.  Is there anything that would concern the delegation about that in regard to this Bill?  I have not fully thought out my question.</p></speech>

As he knows, the digital age of consent is provided for under the Data Protection Act.  There is an attendant provision within that Act to the effect that the age will be reviewed three years after coming into effect.  Therefore, there is an obligation to have a review of the current digital age of consent.  Based on the timeline, that should be initiated this month.  We have not heard any details on when it is going to start but, under the legislation, it should be initiated this month.  We look forward to the discussion and associated developments.  It will be interesting to see the extent to which the digital age of consent, set at 16 in Ireland, has been monitored and evaluated in terms of its impact.  We believe that is important in order to support and strengthen the debate on the issue.</p> <p>  On the question on the relationship between the digital age of consent and this legislation, I am not sure I have an answer.  Suffice it to say that ultimately the digital age of consent is in our GDPR and Data Protection Act as a protective measure.  It is one of several measures related to acknowledging the additional vulnerability of children and the need for special measures to ensure their protection.  In that respect, there may be a connection.  In this Bill and in that measure, we are seeking to protect children.</p></speech>

Therefore, something like the review of the digital age of consent would have an important role to play in determining the extent to which it complies with those principles.  We have to recall that while children have a right to be protected from harm, they also have rights to express themselves, participate in society and engage in play and social activities online.  It is a tricky one; there is a balance to be struck between the two.</p></speech>

From our research, many parents, but also children, are not quite aware of why the digital age of consent, 16, is related to privacy.  There seems to be an idea that it is about safety and driven by safety legislation.  It is distinct issue.  Media literacy education is required so parents and children will understand what this is all about and what the digital age consent means.  We know from legislating in the United States and research from ten years ago that parents were helping underage children to get on social media platforms if they believed they were supposed to be on them, even if they were under the allowed age.  Many of them did not know why the provision existed in the first place.  Many of them believed it was about safety, not about privacy.  It is extremely important to understand that it is actually about privacy.  It had not been intended as a safety measure although it has been used in that manner.  This leads to the issue of balancing the right to protection, on the one hand, and the right to provision and participation, on the other.  It is important to have education in that regard.</p></speech>

He mentioned that financial harm was not covered in the general scheme of the Bill and discussed the statistics on the number of teenagers engaged in gambling annually but I would like to mention the importance of definitions of concepts such as pornography and gross or gratuitous violence.  Does he have any comments or recommendations in that regard?</p></speech>

One of the key guiding principles is that the legal and regulatory environment needs to be predictable.  If concepts are left undefined in a way that allows for a huge amount of subjectivity concerning what falls within a definition &mdash; the term "pornography" is notorious in legal terms in that respect &mdash; people will often not agree on what comes within the meaning of a term.</p><p>It is a matter of trying to comply with the requirement of clarity and predictability for people.  I do not want to offer a particular view on how that definition should be phrased.  However, it would be better to have a definition of key concepts that determine what is or is not captured by the Bill rather than leaving terms that are known to be subjective undefined in a way that invites disputes.</p></speech>

It seems members are happy that they have got to ask all the questions they wanted to ask.</p> <p>  I will take this opportunity to thank Dr. Culloty, Dr. McAuley, Professor O'Mahony and Dr. Milosevic for their presentations.  They were comprehensive and interesting.  The witnesses have given us a new body of work to do in terms of the Bill.  There is nothing the witnesses have suggested today that any of the members would be in disagreement with.  My thanks to the witnesses for their input.  It has been impressive and helpful.  We will continue our work with the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill tomorrow with representatives from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Children's Rights Alliance and CyberSafeKids.</p></speech>
