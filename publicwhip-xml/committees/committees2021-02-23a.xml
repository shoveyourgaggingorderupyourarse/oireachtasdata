    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#A00400"><p>I welcome everyone to this online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I ask that committee members confirm their locations before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 4 and 9 February at our private meeting last week.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Today we are engaging with officials from Horse Racing Ireland to examine matters relating to its 2019 financial statement.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials: Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, and Ms Suzanne Eade, chief financial officer.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they have prepared for us.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask that members and witnesses mute themselves when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hands to indicate when they wish to contribute and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  When people have finished contributing, they should not forget to use the button to lower their hands.  It can be confusing otherwise.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Our witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have viewed it as appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask the witnesses to state their names the first time they contribute.</p> <p>  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#A00500"><p>Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, was established to provide a statutory basis for the control, regulation and development of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  It operates racing and betting activities through eight subsidiaries.  In addition, it has a one third shareholding in an associated company called Curragh Racecourse Limited, CRL.</p> <p>  HRI received State funding of &euro;67.2 million in 2019, sourced from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  HRI's other main sources of income in the year were contributions from horse owners and sponsors towards racing prize money, totalling &euro;23.4 million; sales of media rights to the value of &euro;6.8 million; registration fee income of &euro;2.6 million; industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing of &euro;443,000; and net income of &euro;294,000 from racing activities arising from totaliser betting and HRI-owned racecourses.  On the expenditure side in 2019, HRI paid out &euro;67.6 million in prize money.  Expenditure of &euro;12.6 million was incurred on integrity and racecourse services, mainly comprising grants to the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board.  Overall, the HRI group incurred a deficit of just over &euro;1 million for 2019.</p> <p>  The 2019 financial statements received a clear audit opinion.  However, without qualifying that opinion, my report drew attention to two matters related to HRI's activity in the year.  First, I drew attention to the fact that the statement of income and expenditure disclosed a group loss of &euro;2.064 million in 2019 relating to HRI's investment in CRL.  This is a company established to provide for the redevelopment and management of the Curragh racecourse.  The redevelopment involved the construction of a new stand and other racing facilities, which opened in mid-2019.  Ownership of the company is split between HRI, the Turf Club and private investors.  Notes Nos. 37 and 39 of the group financial statements explain that HRI had contributed funding to CRL totalling &euro;36 million up to the end of 2019.  This comprised an investment of &euro;23 million in return for an equity share, grant funding of &euro;12.5 million for the construction project, and &euro;500,000 paid for the right to use a hospitality suite at the racecourse for 30 years.  In addition, the group financial statements reflect a loan of &euro;500,000 given by HRI to CRL during 2019 to fund additional works on the racecourse's parade ring.  As at 31 December 2019, HRI held a 35.29% economic share in CRL.  The carrying value of HRI's investment at 31 December 2019 was &euro;18.5 million, indicating cumulative losses incurred by HRI amounting to &euro;4.5 million.</p> <p>  Second, I drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control for 2019 of a financial loss by HRI of &euro;389,000 in respect of cash-in-transit services.  The service provider went into liquidation while holding cash relating to HRI's racecourses and its Tote Ireland subsidiary.</p> <p>  The chief executive will be able to update the committee on these matters.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#A00700"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to assist with its examination of the 2019 financial statements of HRI.  As members will be aware, HRI is a commercial semiState body responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and operates a corporate structure that comprises the main body and nine subsidiary companies, one of which is dormant.  Its functions are set out in legislation.</p> <p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General set out, HRI's primary sources of funding are the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, race entry fees from owners, race sponsorship fees through racecourses, profits from commercial subsidiaries, a statutory foal levy on breeders, the sale of media rights, industry contributions to Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and a turnover levy on oncourse bookmakers.</p><p> We are based in Ballymany, the Curragh, County Kildare, and including our subsidiary companies, we employ a total of 247 people.  Since the establishment of the Racing Board in 1945, the horse racing and thoroughbred industry in Ireland has been overseen by a State body and has been the subject of legislation.  The reason for this is the unique position which the sector holds in Ireland.  Horses are something which Ireland does well, and for a small country we hold leadership positions in many elements of the industry which makes a valuable contribution to the social, economic and cultural fabric of the country.  This was well summed up recently by An tUachtar&aacute;n, Michael D. Higgins, when he said the horse has a special place in Irish life and culture and, "A love of horses, their breeding and training, are an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s identity and of our reputation abroad."</p><p> Supportive Government policy over the years has enabled a significant rural industry to develop, and in 2017, Deloitte issued a comprehensive report on the value of the industry which made a number of important findings. The key findings were that the industry stimulates almost &euro;2 billion of expenditure per annum in the Irish economy.  This expenditure supports a workforce of 28,900 full-time equivalent jobs.  After the United States, Ireland is the second biggest seller of bloodstock at public sales.  In a normal year, 1.3 million people attend race meetings in Ireland.  Bloodstock sales are valued at approximately &euro;438 million per annum, much of which is exported.</p><p> The industry operates on an all-island basis, and every four years, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine appoints a representative of the industry in Northern Ireland to the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  The board comprises a chairman and 13 ordinary board members who are a mixture of industry representatives and ministerial nominees.</p><p> The industry is multi-layered and comprises much more than just a day at the races.  Despite our small size, Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world, the second largest exporter of horses to more than 33 countries in terms of value, and arguably the leading country in terms of quality.  In terms of size and scale, the thoroughbred industry is a significant one with a wide geographical reach.  There are breeders in every county in Ireland and most of them, 92%, have five mares or fewer.</p><p> In terms of economic value and the value of exports through sales, the industry compares very favourably with other vital agrifood sectors such as fishing, poultry, pigs and sheep.  One feature of the industry is its regional reach, and the Deloitte report pointed to significant economic activity and investment reaching into every county in the country.  A previous industry analysis took the case of Bagenalstown in County Carlow and found that within a ten-mile radius of that town, more than 600 full-time jobs were accounted for through the horse racing and breeding industries and ancillary services.  That picture is replicated in many other parts of the country.</p><p> The year 2019 was the last normal year experienced by most businesses.  Ms Eade and I will be happy to deal with any questions the committee may have on our 2019 financial statements.  Since then, much has changed and the industry is currently facing two massive challenges in Covid-19 and Brexit, both of which are having a significant impact.  Covid-19 saw horse racing cancelled for 11 weeks last year and since the resumption on 8 June, racing has been run behind closed doors, under strict protocols, with only essential staff in attendance.  Point-to-point racing is currently cancelled, which is a major problem for the national hunt sector and those whose livelihoods depend on it.  Irish bloodstock sales, at which most of our international trade takes place, were heavily disrupted in 2020 with key sales either cancelled, deferred, or in some cases, moved to England.  The industry is extremely grateful to be able to continue racing and is cognisant of the bigger picture.  However, like many other sectors, the impact of Covid-19 will be felt for a long time.</p><p> As I said earlier, Ireland is one of the largest exporters of thoroughbreds in the world and Britain is our main market, which has meant that significant changes and readjustments are occurring as a result of Brexit.  Over the past two years, together with various industry bodies and Government authorities, we have been working through the implications on the movement of horses between Ireland and Britain in the following areas: sanitary and phytosanitary applications, customs and VAT.  Undoubtedly, the situation is more difficult since 1 January.  Much work remains to mitigate the barriers to trade and prevent the industry in Ireland being marginalised as a result of geographical location.</p><p> Horse Racing Ireland has ambitious plans for the racing and breeding industry, and in March 2020 we published a strategic plan for the years 2020 to 2024, which sets challenging growth targets.  While the industry is facing up to serious challenges, if properly supported it will play an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  It is a valuable source of employment and investment into rural Ireland, an area in which Ireland has natural advantages of climate and soil structure.  It is one that capitalises on our native skills and has a global reach which enhances Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.  Moreover, it is an environmentally friendly agricultural activity.  The key elements of the strategic plan are increased participation at all levels of the industry thereby increasing employment and economic activity, investment in areas that are critical to the development of the industry, raising the profile and attractiveness of horse racing to all its customers, world-leading standards of integrity and equine welfare, development of people within the industry to support sustainable employment, and securing a sustainable funding model for the future.</p><p> The key capital projects under this plan will be the redevelopment of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown, County Kildare, and the development of a new all-weather racetrack in Tipperary.  The plan signals ambition to grow the direct and indirect employment in our industry to 35,000 people and the economic activity to &euro;2.5 billion per annum.</p><p> The 2019 financial statements are before the committee.  That was a good year for Irish horse racing and breeding, with increases in most of the key industry metrics and continued success for Irish horses on the racetracks of the world.  The year 2019 saw the completion of the long-awaited redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse and the introduction of new broadcasting arrangements for Irish racing.  It was also the year in which the threats to the industry from Brexit began to crystalise.</p><p> As requested, we have provided the committee with briefing material on three specific issues.  As I said earlier, Ms Eade and I will be happy to address any questions members may have on those matters or any other aspect of our finances.</p></speech>

The lead speakers today are Deputy Carthy, who will speak first for 15 minutes, and Deputy Verona Murphy, who has ten minutes.

I thank Mr. Kavanagh for his opening statement.  I will put on record that I am a big fan of Irish horse racing in the sense that I understand and appreciate the value it brings to many rural economies.  I am sure many people will be impressed to hear about some of the financial benefits from the sector in terms of how it permeates to local communities, which is what I want to focus on this morning.</p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned that 92% of breeders are operations of five mares or fewer, and they are the small operators many of us will be aware of within our own communities.  Where does Horse Racing Ireland fit in with their operations in terms of the supports it gives them to maintain their operations, support newer entrants and allow those smaller operators to expand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#B00600"><p>I believe that is the key to it.  As the Deputy said, the industry has a strong rural and regional reach and the small breeders, trainers and owners are the backbone of the industry.  Sometimes, the headlines go to the bigger owners.  When one analyses the industry, however, the picture shows a nationwide distribution of activities, full-time, part-time etc.  We put in place programmes to support all levels of the industry.</p> <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, 92% of breeders have fewer than five mares.  Some 90% of our races are non-black tie races, that is, they are races below the elite level and are available for all small owners and trainers.  I mentioned our intention to build a second all-weather track in Tipperary.  That is to facilitate and replicate the Dundalk experience in terms of creating opportunities for the type of operators the Deputy referred to .  We operate a pyramid-based structure or meritocracy within racing, which leads to the championship races at the top level.</p><p> We will shortly launch a new support scheme for breeders, which is a direct response to the Brexit concerns.  Many small breeders feel isolated.  Britain is our main market for horses, with 80% of exports of Irish horses going to the UK, so there is great anxiety with regard to Brexit.  In the past couple of years we have expanded the race programme for horses, particularly at the lower level.  We have introduced specific races, called option races, for horses at the lower level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#C00200"><p>We are tight for time.  Would I be correct in saying that prize money is the key component of how Horse Racing Ireland uses Exchequer funding to support the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#C00300"><p>Yes, prize money is our most significant expenditure.  That acts as a stimulus to encourage people to have horses in training.  The studies show that the total outlay on horses in training is of the order of &euro;400 million to &euro;450 million per year.  That is really supporting rural economies.  It is not just people indulging a hobby.  On the other side of the equation, it is people being employed, such as farriers, vets, feed companies and trainers and their staff.  The prize money, which is an internationally competitive issue in our business, serves as a stimulus to generate that economic activity.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that the amount given in Exchequer funding is remarkably similar to the amount that is distributed in prize money?</p></speech>

It is in the region of 35%, and approximately 65% of the prize fund comes from Horse Racing Ireland.  As I said, that serves as a stimulus to encourage horses to be kept in training.  The figures on that are positive.  Even last year there was a 3% increase in the number of horses in training.  On the other side of the equation, 25% of the prize fund goes to the trainer, the jockey and the stable staff involved with the horses.  It forms a key part of their earnings.</p></speech>

In the year we are examining, 2019, Government funding to the organisation was approximately &euro;67 million and the prize money distributed was &euro;66 million.  Looking back over the years, I see that in 2012 there was &euro;45 million in Exchequer funding and &euro;45 million in prize money.  There is clearly a correlation between the two.  Is Mr. Kavanagh satisfied that this method of front-loading prize money is the best and fairest way to distribute Horse Racing Ireland's funds to race owners, trainers and the associated and ancillary personnel he mentioned, such as stable hands and so forth?</p></speech>

Rather than just look at the narrow issue of prize money, it stimulates investment and encourages owners to have horses in training and to buy horses.  It drives rural economic activity, the sales and the decision to have horses in training here.  Regarding the link with the horse and greyhound fund, the Deputy is correct to point out the proximity of the figures, but they are not directly linked.  It is not the case that we get X amount from the Government, so we put X into prize money and offer prize money of X amount.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, we have other sources of income as well.  Prize money is the subject of competition internationally, particularly at the higher level where one is seeking to attract horses.  We have been quite successful at this over the years, getting international owners to base their horses in Ireland rather than the alternatives there might be in France or the UK.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#C01500"><p>I am trying to get to the heart of whether Exchequer funding is having the biggest impact.  To repeat Mr. Kavanagh's figures, 92% of horse trainers have five or fewer mares.  Looking at the distribution of the prize money in terms of flat racing, and I believe these figures are from 2019 as well, the top trainer managed to secure 25% of the overall prize money.  The top ten trainers secured 63.29% of the prize money.  In the case of the national hunt, the top trainer drew down 17% and the top ten trainers drew down 63% of the funding.  The flat all-weather did a little better in terms of balance, but the funds were much smaller.  Some 46.23% of owners drew down the overall amount of the money in terms of the top ten.  One can see there is great disparity and understand why some would question whether the model of front-loading the prize money is the best way to make the economic impact Mr. Kavanagh rightly said this money can deliver, if it is utilised correctly.  It appears that the model in place will ensure that the big trainers, who do great work and are great ambassadors, will keep getting bigger while the stables of five or fewer mares will remain very much bit players.  There will not be much scope for them to expand because it is very hard to break into this prize money, which would allow them to have the same resources as their competitors.</p></speech>

Many of the horses that are winning for the bigger trainers are bred by those breeders the Deputy referred to, the small breeders who are selling their horses to the owners to keep them in training.  The other factor is that many of our top trainers started off as small trainers.  Our two leading national hunt trainers, Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott, both started with four or five horses in training and have been able to develop their businesses to their current scale.  Obviously, the scale of those operations increases the scale of the economic activity and the scale of the trickle-down into the local economy.  I mentioned in my introduction that there are 600 jobs in the Bagenalstown area.  A number of those would be related to Willie Mullins, a trainer, Jim Bolger, a trainer, and Red Mills horse feeds.</p></speech>

There is a distinction, but there is a reality, if one looks at the figures as they have evolved over the past decade, that some are drawing down ever-increasing shares of the pot.  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the breeders, as opposed to the trainers.  I have not been able to find the equivalent figures for breeders.  Would HRI be able to make those available to the committee?</p></speech>

It is not a figure we would have at our fingertips, but we can certainly equate the analysis the Deputy has set out for trainers among breeders.  It will be a much broader picture because a number of these horses are bred in France.  A number of the horses that are successful are bred in the United States or in the UK as well as in Ireland, so it will not just be Irish breeders.  It will give a global picture.</p></speech>

I do not have much time left.  I wish to refer briefly to HRI's investment in the Curragh racecourse.  I note there was an increase of &euro;10.7 million between the contracted price and the final price.  Was there a specific reason for that or were there a number of factors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#C02400"><p>It was a number of issues.  It was decisions that were taken by the board for the long-term good of the project.</p><p>For example, some &euro;2.5 million of that figure would be for work on new stable yards and refurbishment of some of the stables.  The decision was taken not to build a new stand and then have old stables.  There were also issues with building inflation and the nature of the contract with the contractor, whereby the Curragh had to contract not just with the builder but also with the various subcontractors.  In the briefing material we sent to the committee, we set out the key elements of that difference.</p></speech>

That seems like a strange number.  Why not go to 50% or 51% and have a deciding say in the matter?  How and why was that figure reached for a 49% contribution?</p></speech>

We have required the racecourse partaking of the scheme to come up with the balance of the funding, and that approach is to minimise our exposure and to drive the racecourses, most of which are privately owned, to generate their own funding to allow them to be part of the scheme.  In fairness, the racecourses do that to a significant degree.  They generate large amounts of funds from parties in the bloodstock industry to add to the overall funding.  The initial breakdown worked out therefore as a split of one third of funding coming from all three parties.  The Turf Club, however, obviously put the racecourse rather than funding into the new company.  As the situation evolved, the contribution of HRI went up slightly.  It was never our ambition to take over the Curragh racecourse, however, if that is the question being asked by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Returning to the situation with the Curragh racecourse, some &euro;1.5 million has been reclassified in the 2019 accounts as fixed assets to reflect better the transaction regarding the right to use a suite at the Curragh racecourse for more than 30 years.  Why though would the HRI have to pay &euro;500,000 for something to which it has already contributed some &euro;45 million?  I ask Mr. Kavanagh to bear in mind that we have a tight timeframe.</p></speech>

A tranche of contributions came from private partners and from HRI, and agreement at the time was that contributors of significant amounts of funding would have access to a suite during the lifetime of the racecourse.  That clearly included HRI, so it is purely a financial transaction.  It was not like we came in separately and stated that we wanted to buy a suite or a box for entertaining.  It is something which is very useful to our subsidiary company Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, because its brief is to promote Irish bloodstock around the globe.

To move on, Mr. Kavanagh has been the CEO of HRI for a long time, from 2001.  Well done on that, which is extraordinary longevity in these times.

The reason I ask that question is that we are now in a situation where we no longer have point-to-point racing.  It is a significant issue, as Mr. Kavanagh can imagine.  I am from Wexford, which is a county where point-to-point racing is a serious activity.  What engagement has HRI had concerning finding a solution to this problem?  It was mooted that perhaps point-to-point racing could be run on the racecourses.  Has HRI come up with a solution in conjunction with the Department, or suggested any such solution?</p></speech>

It is a real grassroots activity which filters into the national hunt industry.  We have been working with the point-to-point racing community and with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make the case for the safe resumption of this activity.  It is not really that different from horse racing and it was run safely for 11 weeks before Christmas.

It would need to have strict protocols, which would be those that have been safely applied on race tracks since last June.  Failing that, we can seek to accommodate some of the point-to-point races that trainers and handlers use for their horses on race tracks.  They have, however, told us that is not ideal.</p></speech>

If we go back to the time of foot and mouth restrictions, however, horse racing was closed down for nigh on eight months, in most instances.  Approximately 92% of our trainers take part in point-to-point racing.  Surely Mr. Kavanagh in his capacity as the CEO of HRI can offer some serious solution to this problem.  We are running out of time, as Mr. Kavanagh can imagine.</p></speech>

The way the weather has been in the last couple of weeks has meant that there has simply been nowhere to race.  Racing has been called off pretty much every day for the last two weeks because of the condition of the ground.

The alliance started on 1 January this year and is for a seven-year period.  The issue, of course, is that we are in the midst of a Covid situation where there is nobody on racetracks and many betting shops in the UK are closed.

What impact is Brexit having on horse racing in Ireland since 1 January?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#E03500"><p>It is a really worrying development for us.  As I said earlier, we export 60% of the horses we produce every year.  While those exports go to 33 countries, by far the largest market is the UK.  The industries in the two countries are practically interlinked.  If we look at racing in the UK today, almost half the horses running will be Irish horses and almost half the jockeys riding will be Irish jockeys who are based in the UK.  If betting shops were open at the moment, anybody who went into one would see Irish and UK racing beside each other.  They buy the pictures of Irish racing and we buy the pictures of UK racing.</p> <p>  Before Brexit, we had free and completely unhindered movement of horses between Britain, Ireland and France under a tripartite agreement.  That is now gone and Britain has become a third country.  Therefore, the movement of horses between the countries becomes a VAT and customs event.  Under EU animal health law, there are new phytosanitary requirements in terms of veterinary certification and details that need to be checked before a horse can move from a third country into the EU.  We are endeavouring to smooth that passage as much as possible because there are 25,000 horse movements a year between Ireland, Britain and France.  It is the most intense movement of equines anywhere in the world and it is key to our trade that we have easy access to our markets.</p></speech>

It is a bit like the debate we might have seen on television about fisheries or any of the other areas.  We are very keen to minimise those barriers.  Many British breeders send horses over here to be bred to Irish stallions and it is a valuable source of income both for the stallion owners, the farms on which the mares stay and the veterinary services provided to them.  There is a host of economic activity that was very simple before Christmas and is now more complicated.</p><p> We are getting excellent support on this from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and we are working our way through it, but there are big challenges.  It is a real amber light for us and our industry with the impact that Brexit is having on the market for Irish horses in the UK.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the point about breeders, the distribution of prize funds and so on.  Breeders still have to go through this without any horse racing going on.  There is a new breeders' incentive scheme so when will that emerge and what does it entail?</p></speech>

Last year the value of sales of horses in Ireland dropped by 35% from &euro;165 million to &euro;106 million.  That was because the sales season was severely disrupted.  As we said, a number of sales were relocated to England from Ireland, so Goffs and Tattersalls Ireland in Fairyhouse did not hold sales and they were relocated to England.  We are concerned about the impact of Brexit on the Irish breeders and their ability to access the UK market.  We will shortly launch a breeders' support scheme, which will support all breeders of Irish-bred horses through an incentive payment to the owners of those horses to encourage them to buy horses at Irish sales the following year.  The incentive is to stimulate trade in the market and reinvigorate the sale of Irish-bred horses.</p></speech>

The land is not on the vacant site register and it was removed last year.  After the sale of the land referred to by the Deputy, the level of surplus land is limited.  The long-term ambition of Leopardstown is to rebuild the sprint track that was previously located there.  As I have said, 6.5 acres of our land was sold last year to the Department of Education for the building of a much-needed school in that area.  There is no surplus land there or in any of the other HRI-owned courses.</p> <p>  I am struggling to hear the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

My first question relates to the remuneration disclosure in note 3 of page 11 of the accounts.  The HRA sought and received a derogation on the requirement under the code of governance from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine around the commercial sensitivity regarding disclosure of the aggregate pay bill.  What is the background or the reason the HRA does not disclose the remuneration bands for employees?</p></speech>

We applied to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for dispensation from that circular and received it.</p> <p>  Likewise, there is a circular that requires disclosure of that information for parties to which we provide grant funding.  Again, the grant funding we provide is for capital projects or vouched expenditure and it is not for salaries.  We discussed this at length with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We provide the necessary information to the Department by band, etc., but it is not published in our annual report.</p></speech>

It is impossible for us to get that information published on their private accounts.  Where we ask for the information, we get it.  As part of the compliance reporting process that is done annually to the Minister, we submit the full disclosure on the bands.</p></speech>

We are very familiar with the racing that takes place in distant countries, such as Australia, America and Hong Kong, for example.  They are also becoming more familiar with the racing that takes place in Ireland and the UK.  Co-mingling is where international or overseas punters would bet into the home pool, and will be a significant area of future growth for betting.  The UK Tote Group will have greater resources and ability to access those markets than the Irish Tote group, which is a very small player.  I mentioned earlier that the betting sector in Ireland is worth &euro;5 billion so with turnover of &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million, Tote Ireland is tiny in that context.</p><p>It does not have the ability to access international markets in the same way that the UK Tote Group would.  Tote Ireland retains control of the tote pools and operates the tote pools in Irish racing.  A marketing and distribution agreement with the UK Tote Group group kicked in from 1 January last.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on the cash in transit issue and issues with the Senaca Group.  I appreciate the opening statements which outline the details of that.  I found it difficult to understand how cash which was being transited became part of the assets of the company being liquidated.  Surely the process of putting that cash, which was being transited, into the bank account of the transit company was in itself a matter of fraud.  Has there been any investigation into whether fraud took place?  One would imagine it did.  What measures has Horse Racing Ireland taken to investigate that fraud, work with the Garda and, more important, try to avail of insurance provisions that cover fraud?</p></speech>

That may limit what we are able to say.  I hope that the note explains the sequence of events which led to this unfortunate situation.  To clarify, of the amount lost, 45% was money collected in the previous four days which could never have been lodged in the bank because it was collected on a Thursday night, Friday or Saturday.  It was Sunday so the lodgement would have been on Monday but that was the day the company went into liquidation.  I have set out the basis on which the service was to be provided.  It involved the delivery to the racecourse of cash floats for the tote and for racecourses in the case of Horse Racing Ireland-owned racecourses and the collection of the day's takings both for the tote and racecourse, plus the floats at the end of the day.</p></speech>

I am still scratching my head since a company responsible for transporting a good managed, through its liquidation, to take ownership of the goods.  If it was anything other than cash, I think we would also be scratching our heads about that.  While Mr. Kavanagh cannot comment on the investigation, what measures has HRI taken, in a positive way, to try to recoup that from its insurers?</p></speech>

That is normally fraud on the part of an employee rather than on the part of a third party.  The tote did not have that insurance and it is apparently not something that insurance companies offer to gambling companies.  We are investigating that further.</p> <p>  An important point is that this was a company licensed by a State body to carry out this service.  We received tax clearance certificates monthly from this company to state that it was tax compliant but when the liquidation happened, there was a tax liability to the Revenue Commissioners of &euro;670,000.  It was an unfortunate event from our point of view.  We have built up controls and we are looking to see if insurance can be provided against this type of activity.  Ms Eade knows more detail than I do.  The type of insurance which is available to address fraud is normally for fraud against an organisation by an individual, specifically an employee.</p></speech>

We were strong about going back on that point.  The issue was the number of other companies involved.  There were 61 companies involved and they all had the same claim that this cash should not be part of the assets.  The cash was not the company's to redistribute.  As there is a Garda investigation ongoing, we will not go too far into this but what the Deputy is alluding to is perfectly in line with what we were pushing for with the liquidator.</p></speech>

When somebody has potentially perpetrated a crime against us but we have a contractual relationship with that entity, that is where the argument falls down.  When we were back on track, the new provider has been bang on with our requirements.  It is a watching brief for us.  We keep a close eye on it.  I take the Deputy's point about seeing if there is an opportunity to seek better insurance.</p></speech>

I have a short time so if I can have a rapid fire round of questions, I would be grateful for that opportunity.  Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing?  Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses.  I speak specifically for Cork.  I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time.  Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that.  We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit.  In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane?  How soon will that happen?</p></speech>

I made a written submission last Wednesday formally asking that the resumption of point-to-point races be considered at the earliest possible date.  We are all waiting to see what comes out of the news this week.  In response to the second question, these could be turned around with a reasonable amount of notice, perhaps one week or ten days.  There is a great hunger in the point-to-point community to get going again.  I stress that this is all outdoor activity with fewer people involved than at a racecourse.  The racecourses have operated successfully since last June with strict protocols and no issue arising with Covid at a race meeting.  That has enabled the racing industry to keep the wheels turning, which we are appreciative of and grateful for.  The same applies to point-to-point races.  There is the animal aspect too.  These horses are bought and trained to race and they do not have anywhere to go.</p> <p>  We made a written submission to the Department last Wednesday and we are in daily dialogue with it.</p><p>It could be turned around at ten days' notice, I believe.  There is a lot of focus on 5 March as a date in everyone's calendar.</p></speech>

I want to be very clear about this.  If we cannot get the information from HRI directly, can this committee, in this era of transparency, seek it directly from the Department?  Where an individual is serving on a State body, is a member of a board or holds an executive position, and where significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money are being given to the board or organisation in question, the least we should expect is the notification of the remuneration package.  I do not believe it is fair to say the information is commercially sensitive because HRI is, de facto, operating a monopoly in respect of the horse racing industry in Ireland.  Does Mr. Kavanagh agree?</p></speech>

Whether it is through private correspondence with the Deputy or through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or working with that Department, we will be more than happy to work with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse.  I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman.  HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow.  There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair.  Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar?  I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity.  I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them.  I am putting my hand up for the garden fair that takes place in Mallow every year.  Can we expect the resumption of events like that in the not-too-distant future, subject to public health guidelines?</p></speech>

To clarify, Mallow is not a HRI track.  We do own a 30% shareholding in it but it is a privately owned track.  As the Deputy knows, it was redeveloped at the turn of the century.  The types of events mentioned are absolutely vital to any racecourse.  It is a real challenge for racecourses not just to be locations where people come to race and leave.  A racecourse has to engage with its local community and get people to use it.  If it is for purposes other than racing, all the better.  The Deputy will know that Mallow was used as a Covid testing centre.  We were delighted that Galway and Punchestown racecourses were on the list of 37 venues announced as vaccination centres.  The community engagement piece is vital for racecourses.  The most successful racecourses in the country, regarding which I have repeatedly quoted the example of Ballinrobe Racecourse in the west, are those that are absolutely rooted in the local community and seen as the people&rsquo;s racecourse in their area.  That is when one hits the magic spot.  I am pretty sure that when we are able to have garden shows and such events again, Mallow will be delighted to welcome back its fair.</p></speech>

I am joining the meeting from the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  I appreciate the value of the horse racing industry.  Indeed, I represent a Kildare constituency.  Kildare adopted the motto "The Thoroughbred County" in the 1990s.  This says it all about the importance of the horse to Kildare and the rural economy.</p> <p>  On the integrity fund and CCTV, CCTV was to be installed at the racecourse stables.  It was to protect the industry in its totality.  It was only in recent days or weeks that the matter of the tender for the CCTV came into the public arena.  Obviously, this matter relates to unauthorised remedies, doping and other such things that could undermine such an important industry.  With hindsight, will Mr. Kavanagh state whether there was proper control over the spending of the money on CCTV?  It was provided for that purpose.  Is Mr. Kavanagh unhappy that the CCTV was not installed in all the racecourses?</p></speech>

The important thing to stress is that the case was prosecuted in the absence of CCTV.  It was an exceptional case.  It was the first case of that nature that has taken place in 30 years.</p> <p>  With regard to the specific question on controls, there absolutely were controls.  Let me explain the process, of which I believe Deputy Murphy is aware.  The IHRB is a separate body to which we provide funding annually on the basis of an agreed annual budget.  The organisation was formerly known as the Turf Club.  It is set out in statute as the racing regulatory body.  The idea is that the referee is kept at a one step remove from the commercial side of the industry.  We agree an annual budget with the regulatory body.  As mentioned, that included, in 2018, the start of a roll-out system for CCTV in stable yards.  We conduct quarterly budgetary reviews and performance reviews, and halfway though the year-----</p></speech>

The investment made in the new laboratory was there, has applied since 2018 and has been effective.  That spend was always in the budget and was going to be spent on that.  There was no change in that.  In fact, we increased our investment in that area because we wanted them to increase the number of out-of-competition tests that were done.  CCTV is a separate issue in relation to security in stable yards.  It was an issue in the case we are speaking about but it is a separate issue in terms of access.  Access to stable yards is limited to people with stable staff cards that are issued by the IHRB.  It is a limited group of people and we take the view they are the experts in this area.</p></speech>

If one reads the legislation, the IHRB is solely and independently responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing and for the area of doping control and security.  As I said to Deputy Catherine Murphy, hindsight is great wisdom.  Our board took a decision at its last meeting to roll out a tender to install CCTV, so that will be addressed.</p></speech>

There is one member of the board who has served longer than the two four-year terms stated in the HRI's governance documents and in the board member report.

The board member the Deputy is referring to represents the Irish Stable Staff Association.  He represented that association in one capacity prior to 2016 and in another post 2016 when the industry services committee was set up.  He is effectively the stable staff representative on that committee.  While the person stayed the same, the capacity under which he was appointed to the board changed under that 2016 Act.</p></speech>

That is a matter for a Minister to decide.  The individual in question was appointed under a different nomination process arising out of the 2016 legislation.

Mr. Kavanagh raised the oncoming challenges HRI faces from Brexit and Covid for the next year.  I have two follow-up questions about that matter.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to the publication last March of the strategic plan up to 2024.  I have read that report and it identifies a reliance on media rights as a weakness.  At the moment, based on the accounts, the amount involved seems to be in the region of &euro;7 million.  Will Mr. Kavanagh outline how access to media rights is characterised as a weakness.  What is the outlook up to 2024 for HRI regarding media rights?</p> <p>  There has been some discussion in the Oireachtas about controlling advertising relating to gambling.  Has the organisation done any kind of a risk analysis on the impact a ban on gambling advertising would have on its business model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#K00500"><p>That is a significant item on our risk register.  There is much more to racing than just gambling.  Interestingly, our research shows that having a bet was only the fourth ranked reason for people going racing.</p> <p>  With regard to media rights, the risk in the strategic plan relates to the dependence of racecourses on them, not HRI.  Media rights comprise pictures and commentaries of races and data.  The runners in the newspaper this morning and the data are merged together to provide a single media rights package.  HRI produces those data.  We produce the fields for all races and we have copyright over those data.  As the property owners, the racecourses own the pictures.  The Deputy is right that we said in our strategic plan that the dependence of racecourses on media rights is a challenge and we are always looking for racecourses to broaden their income base.  However, during the Covid crisis it has proven to be a strength because while racecourses have had no commercial revenue from racegoers, as we have had no racegoers at Irish racetracks since last March, they have been able to continue to trade because of the income they get from selling the pictures.  With a combination of Government supports and costs that they have been able to take out of their own business, as they have lower costs because the public are not attending race meetings, they have been able to offset their loss of revenue due to the fact that there is an increased demand for the pictures of Irish races.  The streaming of races is very popular now.  We had an average of 62,000 streams per race at the big Dublin racing festival in Leopardstown two weeks ago.  The way in which racing is being broadcast is changing and there is a concern about that.  As with all analyses, sometimes one will look at something and see it as a weakness but it can also be a strength if dealt with properly.</p></speech>

I will revert to the CCTV issue.  Some &euro;9.1 million was allocated to IHRB for this back in 2018.

It had also done a preliminary element of development in 2007 and 2008 on a ring road and the demolition of a hotel in the vicinity, which set the basis for the redevelopment taking place.  HRI exercises a significant level of activity in the Curragh through our three directors on the board and we operate a service level agreement with the Curragh racecourse whereby we provide a lot of services to it.  These include financial services, company secretarial services and IT services.  The Curragh racecourse's finances are produced through the HRI finance function.  We have got approvals that are necessary from our board in relation to the annual budget.  Ms Eade has to approve any expenditure in excess-----</p></speech>

A significant element of that loss is depreciation.  The Curragh racecourse is profitable and it generated a cash profit in 2020, despite the Covid impact and it will be profitable going forward.  It will generate a significant return for the State, not just through the company but also through the racing that takes place there.  It is Ireland's premier international racecourse.  It is the window that most people see the Irish racing industry through when they are looking at it.  Members have seen the pictures in the submission we made on the redevelopment-----</p></speech>

I have a question on the appointment process for board members.  During previous questions, Mr. Kavanagh distinguished between appointees of the Minister and representatives of the sectoral interests.  Is it the case that while sectoral interests make nominations for the board, it is essentially the Minister who makes the formal appointment?  I would like that to be clarified.  We spoke about the instance where there has been a board member <i>in situ</i>since 2008.  I do not personally know that board member and I am sure he is an able representative of that sector.  This committee has long-standing experience of coming across bad practice where executives or board members are <i>in situ</i>for long periods of time.  That is the reason the guidelines are in place.  Is it the case that once those sectoral interests or representatives nominate somebody, the Minister has no authority to deny that or what is the process exactly?  I would like a little clarity on that, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021022300002#L01400"><p>The Deputy has it spot on.  The board members are all equal and they are all appointed by the Minister.  My clarification in my opening statement was to point out that a number of board members are specified to be put forward from various industry sectors.  For example, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association put forward nominations.  There are provisions in the legislation for the Minister to accept or reject nominations or to come up with alternative nomination methods, if desired.  There is a distinction in the 1994 Act and the theory is that there would be various representatives of different parts of the industry and that, on top of that, the Minister would make ministerial nominations.  These board members are no different from other board members in terms of their status but the intention is that the sectors of the industry would be complemented by people from outside the industry or those with other skill sets that might be missing on the board.  They are all ministerial appointees, however, so it is not as if the Minister does not have any say on who is the trainers' representative, the breeders' representative and so on.</p> <p>  On Deputy Carthy's earlier question, there were 25 overseas winners in Ireland in 2019 and they won &euro;3.4 million.  There were 188 Irish winners in the UK and they won &euro;15.3 million.  That gives an indication of the balance of payment and power to some extent.</p></speech>

The most significant recommendation was that the board would conduct its own needs analysis every time an appointment was coming up, that it would look at itself in the mirror to examine skill set gaps and communicate them with the Department and the Minister when the nomination process was being looked at.</p></speech>

In recent years, we have divided our board meetings into strategic matters in the first half and matters for noting or operational matters, such as updates from executives, in the second half.  The board surveyed itself and found that it should focus on more strategic matters, the challenging of executives and all of those sort of things.  A comprehensive questionnaire of each board member and of the senior executives was completed and the board is committed, during the course of next year, to implementing the recommendations.  The chair is in discussion with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that.</p></speech>

My colleagues, Deputies Catherine Murphy and Munster, will probably cover this and I concur with their views.  Even though IHRB, as Mr. Kavanagh says, is an independent regulatory body, it still had to come to HRI for funding.  Given Deputy Munster's point about such a massive increase in positive testing, it was a poorly made decision not to continue with installing CCTV or at least not to have a discussion on it.  How much was spent on the IT system that Mr. Kavanagh said it was decided to change to?</p></speech>

The board is required to complete the standard forms every year and return them to the company's secretary.  We do have board members sometimes sitting on a racecourse board or various other industry body boards in a representative capacity, and they will step out of a discussion.  For example, if a board member is sitting on the board of Cork, as Deputy Sherlock mentioned earlier, and we were discussing a grant to Cork, that person would step out of the room for that discussion, or if we were discussing funding for the IHRB, IHRB nominated directors might step out.  Most of those potential conflict issues are not in a personal capacity, if I could put it that way.  Members of the IHRB do not hold shares in a company or anything like that.</p></speech>

In 2019, when the fund going to horse racing was &euro;67.2 million, the betting tax and betting levy generated was &euro;95 million.  There was a significant surplus there.</p> <p>  In most other racing countries that Ireland competes with, the funding of the industry is based on a statutory mechanism.  In the UK, it is a levy on betting which goes directly to the British levy board and funds the industry over there.  In countries like France, it is state monopoly of tote betting and the funding model works that way.  Ireland is unusual in having a statutory mechanism to fund its industry.</p> <p>  As I said, the funding that comes from betting tax, which we believe is too low and should be increased, but that is probably a policy matter, more than covers the funding that goes into the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, in particular to horse racing.  That, as we said earlier, stimulates the economic activity that this industry generates.</p> <p>  This is a sector in which Ireland has qualities which other countries cannot match and it cannot operate without a proper funding basis.  As I said, it is, to the extent that the Chairman asks the question-----</p></speech>

I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely, and all members are required to attend from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senator Gavin.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be able to continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.  The principal objective of the Bill is to transpose the EU&rsquo;s European Competition Network, ECN, directive that will make the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPG, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, more effective in overseeing and enforcing competition law.  The directive was adopted in 2019 with a transposition deadline of 4 February 2021.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, recently sent the general scheme of the Bill to the committee asking that we prioritise our consideration of this matter. Having received a briefing on the matter from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am pleased that we will develop our understanding of the Bill when we hear from witnesses of the CCPG and ComReg in relation to the proposed legislation.  These bodies will be the two most affected by the directive and proposed Bill.</p> <p>  From the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, I welcome Ms Isolde Goggin, chairperson, Mr. Brian McHugh and members of the commission, and from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Mr. Garrett Blaney, chairperson, and Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such decision.</p> <p>  Witnesses&rsquo; opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite the chairperson of the CCPC, Ms Goggin, to make her contribution.  I remind witnesses and members that when contributing remotely, they should clarify their name for recording purposes.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Brian McHugh who is a member of the commission with responsibility for our competition enforcement and mergers functions.  I thank committee members for the opportunity to speak to them today and to provide our views on the competition (amendment) Bill 2021.</p> <p>  As the primary enforcement body for competition law, both the CCPC and our predecessor, the Competition Authority, used all their powers and resources to investigate suspected anti-competitive practices, and bring those damaging practices to an end.  In doing so, we have built up a strong  record of enforcement.  However, developments in enforcement mechanisms have left Ireland out of step with the rest of Europe.  Our ability to act is grounded in our statutory powers and, therefore, it is essential that those laws provide the CCPC with the right enforcement tools to effectively deter, detect and address white-collar crime relating to competition law.  This Bill provides a significant opportunity for major change and will enable the CCPC to be more effective for the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole.  However, the devil is in the detail and the specifics of how this European legislation is transposed will determine how effective it is.</p> <p>  Turning to the CCPC&rsquo;s enforcement powers, competition law investigations are built on physical and digital evidence, and they require in-depth economic and legal analysis.  We have consistently used our current powers to challenge anti-competitive practices in a wide variety of sectors.  We secured Ireland&rsquo;s first conviction for bid rigging and we recently referred a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, into potential bid rigging in the procurement of publicly-funded transport services.  Last year, we issued preliminary findings against a number of businesses in the motor insurance sector and most recently we secured a High Court order in respect of a commitment agreement with Ticketmaster.</p> <p>  We have a substantial enforcement track record but there are areas where we could have done more if we had the same powers as other competition agencies in the EU.  For example, the most the CCPC can achieve at present, in a significant number of competition cases, is to seek commitments that the business will cease the practice or behaviour and not do it again.  If we cannot obtain commitments ourselves, we can apply to the courts for a declaration that the behaviour is unlawful and obtain an injunction.  In our view, this is not an effective deterrent to practices that harm competition and, ultimately, consumers.</p> <p>  Unlike other competition agencies, the CCPC cannot impose financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Also, we cannot operate a leniency programme, which would allow for the reduction in fines when a business provides evidence that it has participated in a breach of competition law.  Leniency programmes encourage companies to come forward with evidence and result in more effective, and efficient, investigations and enforcement.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about our investigative powers.  Secret cartels are extremely damaging and are therefore considered a serious breach of competition law.  This type of activity has a very harmful effect on consumers and the wider economy, as any or all of the following can happen as a result of businesses coming together to agree prices or to share out a market between them: prices go up while efficiency, innovation and the options available to consumers go down.  They are also the most challenging breaches to detect and investigate as, by their nature, they involve a secret conspiracy.  The parties involved often make a considerable efforts to hide their involvement from their customers and, indeed, from the CCPC.  International experience has shown that cartelists have become more sophisticated in using electronic communications technology and social media apps to co-ordinate their behaviour.  Indeed, many cartelists work diligently to avoid leaving a paper trail and only communicate verbally on their mobile phones.</p> <p>  For this reason, the CCPC is seeking investigative and surveillance powers which are appropriate to detect white-collar crime.  We are very aware that the powers we seek must be balanced with safeguards for the rights of the individual.  Currently, for the CCPC to search a premises, we must present sufficient evidence to a judge in order to obtain a warrant and we anticipate this level of judicial oversight will be maintained in our new powers.</p> <p>  As regards its implementation, this Bill will allow the use of important enforcement tools commonly used across the EU for the first time in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that giving us these enforcement tools will fill a significant gap in the existing competition law enforcement regime in Ireland.  The detail of how the regime works is crucial in ensuring that the legislation is effective.  From our experience, we know that for there to be a meaningful deterrent, the threat of enforcement must be real and go beyond reputational damage.  The CCPC is of the view that we require the power to: adopt infringement decisions; grant immunity from or reductions in fines; make orders; grant remedies; and impose fines in respect of breaches of competition law, subject to the appropriate judicial oversight.</p> <p>  As chair of the CCPC, and previously chair of the Competition Authority over a number of years, I can confidently say that we have spent many years enforcing the law to the best of our ability.  I can assure members of the committee that the views put before them today come from much consideration over this time.</p><p>I firmly believe that the competition (amendment) Bill 2021 is a once in a generation opportunity to reform Irish competition law and align our enforcement regime with the rest of the EU, something that is long overdue.  These are major changes and the detail of the Bill will be very important if we are to realise the full potential of these reforms and enable the CCPC to be more efficient, effective and impactful when tackling white collar crime in Ireland. </p><p> We recognise the CCPC must play its part in this, and in this regard we have been working very closely with our parent Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, both in terms of working through the detail of the legislation and considering the impact such powers will have on our organisation, particularly in ensuring there are sufficient resources, expertise and oversight.  Our mission is to make markets work better and we are committed to playing our part in ensuring that this legislation benefits consumers, businesses and ultimately the economy.</p><p> We are happy to take any questions and further explain our views in more detail.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, I welcome the opportunity to appear before today&rsquo;s hearing regarding the competition (amendment) Bill.  I am joined by my fellow ComReg commissioner, Jeremy Godfrey.<br/><br/>ComReg was established by the Communications Regulation Act in 2002 and is now in its third decade.  As part of our statutory functions and objectives, we promote competition and investment in the telecoms and electronic communications sector.  We uphold end-user rights and we manage the radio spectrum.  Our vision for the electronic communications sector is that consumers and businesses in Ireland have affordable, high quality and widespread access to communications services and applications that support their social and economic needs.<br/><br/>European law recognises that there are specific competition issues that arise in the telecoms sector and has established a bespoke regime for regulating the sector that operates alongside general competition law.  The bespoke telecoms regime provides for national regulatory authorities to take <i>ex ante</i>action to prevent likely competition problems arising, even before they materialise.  The general competition law regime, which provides for <i>ex post</i>enforcement against cartels and abuse of dominance, also applies in the sector.<br/><br/>ComReg is the national regulatory authority responsible for implementation of the specific telecoms regulatory regime in Ireland.  Under the bespoke telecoms regime, we have used our <i>ex ante</i>powers to promote competition in markets such as broadband, voice telephony and broadcast of television signals.  For example, we require Eir to make its network available to competing providers of broadband services.  As a result, operators such as Sky and Vodafone have been able to enter the market.  Today, around a third of all fixed broadband customers get their service from competitors using the Eir network for the final connection to customer premises.<br/><br/>ComReg also shares responsibility with the CCPC for enforcement of general competition law, other than merger control, in the electronic communications sector.  ComReg and the CCPC have in place a co-operation agreement.  This facilitates the performance by the CCPC and ComReg of their respective functions as competition authorities, to avoid duplication of activities and to ensure consistency of approach. In practical terms, notification and consultation between ComReg and the CCPC are promoted.<br/><br/>The competition (amendment) Bill will transpose the ECN+ directive into Irish law.  It will only have an impact on ComReg&rsquo;s powers and functions as a competition authority.  Changes to our powers and functions under the bespoke telecoms regime, and transposition of new EU law in that area, require separate legislation.  I will comment briefly on three issues in the Bill: sanctions, investigation powers and administrative arrangements.  The directive requires civil financial sanctions for breaches of competition law.  Ireland is one of only two EU member states that do not already have a system of administrative fines for breaches of competition law.  This means we rely solely on criminal enforcement for financial sanctions of competition law breaches.  However, the evidentiary requirements, the complex economic analysis involved in many cases and the criminal standard of proof mean that criminal prosecution is neither practical nor appropriate in most competition law cases.<br/><br/>ComReg therefore welcomes and supports the approach in the general scheme giving the Irish administrative competition authorities - the CCPC and ComReg - administrative fining powers, subject to appeal or confirmation by the High Court.  ComReg believes that the proposed scheme, whereby the Irish competition authorities may, subject to court confirmation, impose fines at levels that are sufficiently high to act as a credible deterrent, is essential for the effective enforcement of competition law.<br/><br/>ComReg recognises nevertheless that there is a continuing role for criminal sanctions and welcomes the approach in the scheme for a dual civil and criminal sanction regime.  For the enforcement regime to be as effective as possible, civil financial sanctions need to be complemented by enhanced investigations and enforcement powers and an effective leniency regime that encourages early resolution of cases.  Some of the necessary powers are already available to both ComReg and the CCPC.  We welcome the opportunity to enhance ComReg and CCPC powers so that both authorities have all the powers required by the directive.<br/><br/>It is vital for competition authorities to be able to obtain information that is relevant to their investigations, including by way of unannounced inspections.  Information-gathering powers need to be underpinned by an ability to impose sanctions if the information required is not forthcoming.  We welcome proposals in the scheme to enable the CCPC and ComReg to punish non-compliance in the context of an investigation by way of periodic penalty payments.  These will assist a speedy and efficient enforcement regime.<br/><br/>It is also necessary for competition authorities to be able to stop egregious behaviours and protect consumers and competitors from harm in the short term by adopting appropriate and proportionate interim measures.  Interim measures are essential to ensure competition law breaches do not profit those responsible pending completion of often complex investigations.  Such measures are therefore a key component of the effectiveness of the enforcement regime and public confidence in it.  In addition to the deterrence of breaches, effective enforcement also involves giving incentives to perpetrators to come forward and put an end to a breach and benefit from reductions in the fines where conditions are met.  ComReg welcomes the proposals governing the establishment of a leniency regime.<br/><br/>We recognise the importance of fully and adequately protecting the rights of undertakings that are under investigation.  We consider that competition authorities should have the flexibility to determine the precise administrative arrangements to achieve this in the light of their responsibility to organise themselves and deploy their resources as efficiently as possible.  For this reason, we would urge that the Bill set out the principles about fairness contained in the directive rather than specifying administrative arrangements in detail.  This will allow ComReg and the CCPC to define appropriate internal processes and procedures and to publish guidance for undertakings that provide transparency and legal certainty about how these processes will operate.<br/><br/>The transposition of the ECN+ directive paves the way for more effective deterrents to, and sanctions for, anti-competitive behaviour in Ireland.  ComReg believes that the proposals in the Bill will have a positive effect on the effective enforcement of national and EU competition rules.  However, I should emphasise that the Bill&rsquo;s impact on ComReg will be limited to our role as an <i>ex post</i>competition authority.  Similar enhancements to our enforcement powers are also required in respect of our functions under the bespoke telecoms regulatory regime if we are to become more effective at promoting competition and upholding end user rights. <br/><br/>ComReg has consistently advocated for such powers, for example in our submissions to the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on regulatory issues and corporate offences.  We welcome that enhancement of such powers is also included in the programme for Government.  We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>We are discussing the details with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We have also raised that topic when giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks last December.  We welcome this Bill and the commitment by the Government and other parties and we hope this important legislative change can be implemented as soon as possible.  ComReg supports the views of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and as a competition authority for the electronic communication sector, considers the sector needs the same competition rules as those applying to other sectors in which the CCPC is the national competition authority.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  Time is tight and we have to careful in managing our time.  As the witnesses are aware, this is the third time in four weeks we are considering this legislation.  We have spoken to the T&aacute;naiste, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and Department officials.</p> <p>  In their opening statements, the witnesses referred to the further development of enforcement mechanisms and how we are our of kilter in this State.  Are human and financial resources adequately provided for?  Will additional resources be needed following the enactment of this legislation?  Do the witnesses have clear sight of what those additional resources are?  I have asked the following question to every contributor we have had so far.  Can the extent to which white-collar crime is going undetected or is not pursued due to lack of financial resources, human resources or legislative powers be estimated?</p></speech>

What form the  new recruits or structure of the organisation take will depend on the final shape of the legislation.</p> <p>  Digital investigations is the other important area.  It that goes right across the board for us, including criminal and consumer investigations and some of our regulatory functions.  Within the last year or so, we set up a digital investigations unit within the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, that provides resources to all the investigative and enforcement divisions across the organisation.  It is quite small at the moment but we are hoping to staff it up and grow the in-house resources within the divisions.</p> <p>  The prevalence of white-collar crime is the great question for us.  The problem with white-collar crime is its degree of invisibility.  There is no dead body or smoking gun.  The existence of the crime has to be proven before proving who did it.  However, there is much evidence to suggest that price fixing and bid rigging cartels are prevalent.  I refer to public procurement, in particular.  I mentioned some we have investigated in the last couple of years.</p> <p>  International estimates from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, suggest the rate of overcharge is between 20% and 30%.  Considering annual State spending of approximately &euro;16 billion on goods and services, if even 1% of it was subject to price fixing or bid rigging, a surcharge of 20% or 30% would be a substantial sum of money.</p></speech>

Enhanced human, financial and technological resources will be needed.  It is obvious that given the legislative and resource constraints, significant or otherwise, a certain level of white-collar crime must be going undetected.  We would not be having this conversation if Ms Goggin had all the powers and resources needed.</p> <p>  I am trying to get a picture of what this legislation will do, in terms of improvements, if certain white-collar crime goes undetected but Ms Goggins is confident these enhanced powers will assist in addressing that.</p></speech>

It is a tool we have not had available to us.  Under the current system where we do the investigation and the courts decide on the sentencing, there is great difficulty in encouraging or incentivising people to come forward with evidence.  We have a cartel immunity programme that we worked out with the Director of Public Prosecutions for hard core cartels.  </p> <p>  The great thing about the leniency programme, as implemented in other member states, is that the competition agency operates it.  It is in control of the process from start to finish, so can encourage people to provide evidence by providing a guarantee that they will get a reduction in fines which does not happen when the investigative and the fining agency are split.</p> <p>  I refer back to bid rigging.  We are keen on bid rigging being outlined as an offence in the general scheme.  It is sometimes seen as a form of price fixing.  We are keen on using screening and have been working with our parent Department and others to consider the issue of getting into the data for public procurement in particular.  We are convinced that bid rigging happens in private procurement as well.  </p> <p>  However, the public sector is such a big repeat purchaser of goods and services that there is great data to be mined out of that.  We are considering potential legislative changes to bring this in, which would represent a substantial detection with an immediate deterrent effect.  There is much to be detected and this will help us to do that.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a real need to tackle bid rigging if one considers it is going on to the extent that Ms Goggin referred to as "hard core".  Will these powers mean the CCPC will be able to go after that which is not necessarily appropriate to the criminal route but would still be of great concern and interest to taxpayers and small businesses?  I refer to the area that is less than hard core.  Is it a big issue?  Would Ms Goggin be confident she would be able to tackle it with the enactment of this legislation or would she need additional resources?</p></speech>

This legislation gives us a suite of powers appropriate to many different situations with different levels of evidence.  White-collar crime is crime.  It is very serious crime.  We will continue to bring prosecutions where we get the evidence appropriate to criminal prosecution because it is right to do so.</p> <p>  However, this allows one to look at other areas where the level of evidence is susceptible to proof on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard.  It gives a wider range of enforcement policies.  We would expect to see detection rates increased.</p></speech>

I do not think one will ever hear the head of a State agency say he or she is confident there are enough resources forever and ever.  However, we have plenty to be going on with.  We will work hard to build up the organisation to the point we can spend the additional budget we have been given and absorb those resources.  Perhaps we will come back to the Deputy in future years about future requirements.</p></speech>

Most if not all members of the committee have spoken in the past about the need to enhance the authority of agencies to enforce competition law and provide greater protection for the consumers.  There is a need for effective deterrents in order to ensure compliance with competition law.  The power to impose financial penalties is naturally required and very welcome.</p> <p>  I believe there is some concern about the proposed additional powers related to video and audio surveillance.  I recognise it is intended that such powers would only be used when investigating serious and criminal breaches of competition law under specific conditions.  It is something that was discussed at a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago when Department officials said that it was not envisaged to have such powers without court involvement and oversight.  Nonetheless, my understanding is that similar powers in other European jurisdictions have been struck down by courts and the European Courts of Human Rights.  I refer, in particular, to a UK case involving the interception of telephone, email and data communications where the European Courts of Human Rights found that there was a violation of Article 8 of the convention as domestic law lacked clarity and did not provide protection against the abuse of power and, I suppose, with the scope or manner of the exercise there was very wide discretion conferred on the authorities.  I would also note that the European Competition Network, ECN, directive does contain provision relating to such powers.  I have one or two question in light of this.  Is it the view that current legislation is sufficiently clear?  From my perspective, the Bill does not seem to provide much certainty about which communications could be monitored.  My reading is that it is intended that these powers would be used at the investigation stage, so at a point when the persons involved have not breached any laws.  Is there a concern that this impacts their fundamental rights at a point when there is no legal charge against them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021022300002#D00400"><p>There has been much commentary about the powers proposed in the Bill.  The first point I would make is that serious crime requires serious powers to deal with it.  On the criminal side, these are offences that carry a ten-year jail sentence, prosecution to the Central Criminal Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  White-collar crime is crime.  It is up there with other forms of crime in terms of the appropriate penalties.  We would be very used to exercising the criminal powers that we have under the supervision of the courts.  Again, we are a little bit different from some of our counterparts in Europe where they are used to doing things on the civil basis of proof.  We come from the other end of the spectrum where we are used to the supervision of the courts in obtaining a search warrant, and we are used to proving our case in court to that level of proof.</p> <p>  In terms of the surveillance powers, they are just used in order to get one to the point where one has evidence to bring to a court or a tribunal.  At the point that one uses the surveillance powers there is no certainty of guilt or otherwise but they are a very important investigative tool.  We have certainly had cases in the past where we have had evidence, for instance, that a group was meeting in an hotel, that a group of businesses engaged in the same trade were meeting, we knew that meeting was going to happen and we had suspicions that it was a cartel meeting but we could not do anything in order to find out what went on at it.  This was somewhat back in the day where, I think, people used to write down what they were talking about during the cartel meetings and one would be able to find stuff in the bin or whatever.  Nowadays, as I mentioned, people are much more tech savvy and so on.  There is a distinction between the powers that are proposed in this Bill, which are very targeted and would be exercised on foot of a warrant versus mass surveillance, which I think was the subject of the UK case that has been mentioned about communications, the retention of data and so on.  We would see these powers as being exercised very narrowly and very much under the supervision of the courts.  Again, I am sure that any input into the details of the legislation that make it clear that this is narrow, targeted and evidence-based would be very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021022300002#D00500"><p>To clarify, European law requires any legislation in this area of surveillance to be extremely clear and have strong protections against abuse.  Is it the view of Ms Goggin that the Bill has these attributes?  Is there a concern about such powers being used at the investigation stage when there is no legal charge against a person?</p></speech>

We would imagine that any warrant that would be granted would be very narrow in its application.  It is an investigative tool.  One has to use it before there is any indication of guilt.  Does the Senator know what I mean?  It comes in at that stage of the process.  Again, the safeguards that would be there as regards not keeping any data that one was not warranted to have in the first place, etc., I would imagine that those would be very strictly enforced as well.</p></speech>

I am familiar with both of their operations, so I know that they put in a good shift on behalf of the consumer, for which I thank them.</p> <p>  In respect of this Bill, Ireland suffers from having a small number of big players in many sectors.  As, increasingly, these become data smart players, they have new sources of power to abuse dominance, to use the term that is used in competition law.  With these new civil powers, will there be an opportunity for either or both of the agencies to develop codes of practice that might set a standard for activities across a range of behaviours that influence competition?  That might help us to get a better handle on this abusive dominance often which can be a little hidden and, I suspect, hard to prosecute and certainly under criminal sanction.  Do we see new codes of practice or standards being promulgated by the agencies, on the back of these changed powers?</p> <p>  Ms Goggin said, a bit intriguingly, that the devil is in the detail in terms of how this is transposed into Irish law.  What exactly are we supposed to be looking out for to make sure that the transposition is adequate?</p> <p>  More generally, we have, I suspect, somewhat weak consumer protections.  Certainly in the telco area there have been many grounds for criticism.  Some of the codes of practices do not seem to have been adequately enforced, and there is much complaint about a slow response from big players and difficulties in getting responses.</p><p>As we move to the civil standard again can we expect an uplift in consumer protection?  Are there ways in which we can ensure this legislation has positive spillover effects into the consumer protection environment, apart from the strictly enforceable dimensions of the commission's work? </p></speech>

On the point of the devil being in the detail, we really need an holistic view of the process from start to finish where it is clear that whoever grants leniency at the beginning of the process is in a position to implement that at the end of it.  If one is in charge of granting leniency then one is also in charge of developing the level of fines at the end of the process.  That was the difficulty in the system we had previously, or the system that pertains in criminal investigations whereby the investigative agency and the agency that makes the decision on whether an offence has been committed and on the level of fines are separate.  It is strict enough because obviously there needs to be a separation of the investigative and the adjudicative functions in the interests of natural justice, which is very clear.  One cannot have a leniency programme, however, if one is not in charge of determining the ultimate level of the fine.  This was one of our concerns.  We absolutely understand and respect the need for the provisions of natural justice but we are aware that there are lots of agencies in this space in the EU that are not huge.  We would look particularly at the Scandinavian and the Baltic agencies that are relatively small agencies in relatively small countries, and they seem to be able to do this to the satisfaction of the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  We cannot see why Ireland would not be able to do it.  I will ask Mr. McHugh to address the code of practice issue, and then I will come back in on the consumer protections.</p></speech>

There are also block exemptions, on which there is a lot of guidance around what does and does not fall within competition law.  We do an amount of this and we publish, as does the European Commission, and we work with the European Commission on that.</p> <p>  Another element is that when we do an investigation we try to publish the investigation note by guidance to the industry on what does and does not fall within breaches of competition law.  We believe it is useful to send out a message to industry.  Ultimately, with the new legislation we will have new powers in areas such as the abuse of dominance.  As Ms Goggin has mentioned, if a company is abusing its dominance today there is no financial punishment available from us or from the courts.  This proposed legislation is a game changer for an area of competition law such as abuse of dominance.  Like other countries in the EU, where the evidence is in place and where the decision is appropriate, Ireland would now be able to fine companies for those abuses. </p></speech>

We are talking about major firms that have legal advisers.  They will not be advised to enter a leniency programme unless the organisation can provide legal certainty as to what will happen to them at the end.  We see this as a huge issue in ensuring that the leniency programme actually becomes effective.</p> <p>  On the point about weak consumer protections, I would not see this legislation as being particularly relevant in that area.  There is a raft of consumer protection legislation coming down the tracks with a substantial amount of consumer protection regulations and directives coming through from Brussels at the moment, which we are working our way through with the Department.  I imagine that many of those will come before the committee in due course.  Those regulations reflect what Deputy Bruton said about the generally weak level of consumer protections.  It is about trying to get a level of protection that is the same across the European Union, and which enables agencies like ours to move more quickly and with a greater degree of certainty.</p></speech>

Certainly last year there were some significant problems with customer care in the telecoms sector.  We had said that the experience consumers were having was unacceptable.  I agree with Ms Isolde Goggin that this particular Bill is not relevant to the consumer protection issue.  In principle, ComReg enforces the various obligations of operators with regard to consumer protection.  The same principle of enforcement of obligations needs to be backed up by administrative fining powers and by effective sanctioning and investigation powers.  We have advocated for those for some time.  We are in discussion, as Mr. Blaney has said, with our own Department about them.  That is what will make a difference to protection issues in the telecoms sector, and more generally in the economy.<br/><br/>Reference was made to potential abuses by data intensive companies.  I draw the committee's attention to the digital markets Act that is being discussed in Brussels at the moment.  This is a proposal to introduce an <i>ex ante</i>regulation for the major platforms.  That will be a vehicle for addressing some of the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

On the public sector build awards, has the CCPC any powers or input in simplifying build tenders?  I believe that in many cases, these appear to exclude people because of the complexity of the build tender that is put out in the public system.</p> <p>  Has the CCPC an opinion on companies bidding for build tenders when they are already defending existing legal cases in the courts in the State?  These cases are to do with previous builds where they are accused of substandard supply, and yet the companies are still on bidding lists and are winning further awards for public sector builds.</p> <p>  Does the CCPC have any function in allowing wider access to an approved tenderers' list?  If a contractor wants to build in the hospital space in Ireland the tender list is probably no wider than five large-scale builders who are looked at.  There are other contractors in the private sector which, if they have not built a hospital or a large medical unit previously, are perceived to be excluded.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on those questions please.</p></speech>

We produced some guidance a couple of years ago, which I can send on to the committee, about how smaller companies might be able to group together to make bids for such tenders.  There had been a concern that such a grouping of smaller competitors getting together might be seen as anti-competitive.  If they are in a situation where they are facing some very large competitors, then it simply is not an issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy's query would come under our advocacy role rather than an enforcement role, where we want to promote competition.  We do not have any role or expertise in determining what the criteria should be for getting access to those tenders.  These are technical issues that belong to the tendering bodies.  We certainly would encourage procuring bodies to make the field as wide as possible to encourage companies that are capable of providing the service to do so, and to avoid putting any barriers in their way that would stop them from doing so.</p> <p>  We do not have a view on the issue of whether companies currently defending court cases should be allowed to tender.  That would be a matter for the courts and for the tendering agencies themselves to decide.</p></speech>

Does Ms Goggin have any comment to make on the ongoing legal review of personal injuries such as soft tissue injuries where legal costs can be up to 20 times higher than cases taken through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021022300002#F00500"><p>On dual pricing, we did undertake to do some market research on the issue.  From the point of view of a competition and consumer protection agency, it is a little complicated.  We are aware that the committee has been concerned about it but, undoubtedly, price discrimination can give rise to negative effects.  It is clear that there is a loyalty penalty for people who have stuck with a company over the years and that they have gradually been more and more disadvantaged as better packages are offered to new entrants.  On the other hand, we are also aware that dual pricing can be the way for entrants to break into a market, particularly one dominated by a couple of substantial players.  Where it is difficult for somebody to build market share, offering a better deal to new customers can be a way for them to build that market share and, over time, it can help to improve competition in an industry to the benefit of consumers.  We are carrying out market research on the area to try to determine the issues at play, the ways in which people behave and who is advantaged or disadvantaged by such factors.  When we have the results of that, we will be in a better position to take a position on whether dual pricing is a negative.  We will wait for the results of that.</p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy raised related to insurance.  I am sorry but I did not write it down.</p></speech>

Essentially, it relates to soft tissue injuries and the propensity for those cases to end up with very high legal costs, up to 20 times higher when taken through the courts than when solved through the PIAB.</p></speech>

We have been involved in it ourselves.  We did carry out a study at the behest of the previous Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on public liability insurance, which we published last year.  We found there were various factors contributing to a perception of high prices and a lack of product offerings in the market.  We are aware that the Judicial Council has been working on those recommendations as regards what used to be called the book of quantum.  There is a great deal going on in this space, including in our area.  We took some enforcement in respect of motor insurance.  We are also aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is establishing an office for competition in the insurance industry.  We hope that, over time, all of those factors coming together will result in an improvement in the market for consumers, but it is a very complex market and those matters will take time.  Perhaps Mr. McHugh would like to come in to speak about our own actions.</p></speech>

We are all aware the Judicial Council will make a decision in that area.  One of the elements we thought was important in our market study was to give a greater role to the PIAB because it takes a much less intensive legal route through the process.  What the market study showed is the two approaches tend to end up at quite similar points in terms of the compensation levels.  One of the recommendations of the market study was to give the PIAB a greater role, which could have the benefit of reducing the overall legal costs for those involved in compensation claims.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the issue of bid rigging.  Could Ms Goggin estimate how much this is costing the Exchequer?  From talking to small businesses, in particular in the building area, they are absolutely convinced that bid rigging goes on.  The people who contact us are those who feel that they have lost out in this regard.  I know there are people who are responsible for spending some of this money and who regard it as something of a victimless crime.  However, it is the taxpayer who is on the hook for it.  Could Ms Goggin estimate the cost to the Exchequer of the practice of bid rigging?  Could she outline the extent to which she thinks she will be able to make an impact on it in the short to medium term?  I am sure she is as aware as I am of how angry people are about this matter, because a lot of business people who are trying to do the right thing feel that they are losing out.  They feel they are in a competition that is over before they even get to enter.</p></speech>

We end up going around in circles on it.  If we had the tools, we could get more evidence and then we would know how much it was.  If one looks at the scale of public procurement it would not take long to get into the hundreds of millions even if the scale of bid rigging is quite low.  We know from the experience in other countries that it can easily be up to 1% or 2% of public procurement.  It would not take one long to get into very substantial amounts of money.  What we think is that having bid rigging as a separate offence will make it easier to prosecute because it will make it clearer what the event is that is occurring.  We know, for instance, from our colleagues in Germany, the Bundeskartellamt, which has a separate offence of bid rigging, that they are kept very busy.  It has a separate unit that does nothing but investigations into bid rigging.  I could see us potentially getting to that scale.  It has to be brought out into the open because the more people see something like this happen, the more they will look at it and say it is wrong, that it is not right because it is taxpayers' money that is being stolen.</p></speech>

This is effectively taxpayers' money that is being stolen.  Trying to quantify the extent of it would be helpful inasmuch as it would act as a marker in terms of judging how the legislation and any additional powers are performing.  Does Ms Goggin get the point I am making?  I understand that it is tough because it is a secret practice.  That is one of the most awful things about it.  Equally, I would be concerned if we are not in a position to set a target to say that this is the extent of it and that we are going to tackle it, because that would send a very powerful message to those people who are engaged in the practice at the moment, that this is quantified and it will not be tolerated.  I understand that none of us tolerate it willingly or intentionally, but it is happening and a very clear message should and could be sent to the people who are engaged in that practice at the moment.</p></speech>

We think that screening and being able to get access to the information on eTenders in order to see what is happening would be useful.  That has not happened.  We know from our counterparts internationally that where it has been done it has thrown up a lot of very useful information.  Screening is important.  It is great if we do the screening and it shows nothing because we have a good public procurement system, but screening has been helpful in showing up issues in other countries.  Once one gets a few cases, one can usually use them as a deterrent.</p><p>The deterrents show what is happening, how bad the situation is and the consequences for those who engage in the practice.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to get involved, take cases in this area and show that the matter is being pursued and will be detected.  We would then use that in our advocacy function to talk to others in a procurement space.</p></speech>

Recently, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, issued a fine of &euro;450,000.  To us, that may be a substantial amount of money but to those who were fined, it is not.  International and European agencies commented on this case.  For example, it was stated that in Germany, the fine would have been somewhere between &euro;7 million and &euro;22 million.  I am not suggesting that the case in question will establish a precedent for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission but something of a precedent has been established.  Will the CCPC have the necessary resolve to go hard after the guilty parties and to issue fines in the context of the leniency regime?  Will the fines issued reflect international best practice?  Clearly, a &euro;450,000 fine for a multilbillion euro company is not an effective deterrent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021022300002#G00300"><p>The maximum level of the fine is set in the legislation.  It is up to 10% of annual turnover.  The normal practice is that there are fining guidelines which set out the aggravating and mitigating factors.  Certain factors might result in a reduction in the fine and others might result in an increase in it.  It is important to reiterate that leniency is the way the information is obtained, which leads to the investigation in the first place.  Leniency is an investigative tool used at the start of the process, not a tool of justice used at the end of the process.  The purpose of leniency is not to be nice to parties; it is to get the information that allows others to be pursued.  The pool of those eligible for leniency is quite small.  The idea is that it facilitates the cracking of the cartel.</p> <p>  The European Commission has been using this method and imposing fines for years.  Some of the fines imposed in the cartel cases are very substantial.  For example, there was a whole series of related cartels in the car parts industry.  That resulted in fines that amounted to &euro;2 billion.  The Commission has also imposed some very substantial fines for the abuse of dominance on companies in the technology sector.  The levels of fines imposed in this area are certainly a few orders of magnitude higher than the fines imposed in cases such as that referred to by the Deputy.  Again, it comes down to the evidence.</p> <p>  Coming back to the point raised about natural justice, we envisage that the fines would be overseen by the courts.  The fines in competition cases have been more related to the level of damage caused and the turnover of the companies involved.  They can be very substantial indeed.  I might ask Mr. McHugh to add to that.</p></speech>

The issue of resourcing has been raised already by Deputy O'Reilly.  Does Ms Goggin have any thoughts about ensuring that staff have adequate proficiency in languages and the IT specialisation required for working in that sector?  Perhaps recruiting those with hacking skills may be the way to go when trying to monitor IT.</p> <p>  I am also wondering about the cross-European co-ordination that Ms Goggins spoke about, considering that many conspiracies are inter-country in nature.  In the US, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO legislation, was introduced to tackle narcotics.  Could a kind of RICO law be introduced to cover this area, so that rather than just getting the satellite companies of group companies, the holding companies and directors could be targeted and sanctioned in the cases of significant breaches such as bid rigging or price-fixing?</p></speech>

I believe there are people of 12 different nationalities working in the organisation so we have been able to co-operate with our colleagues across Europe.  There is a European competition network, which comprises representatives from all the member states, as well as the European Commission.  We have legal cover to exchange information and provide mutual assistance to one another, so the network works quite well.</p> <p>  The IT side is always an issue.  Data science and big data is the current trend, but those with proficiency in that area are few and far between as well as expensive to recruit.  We have been quite happy with how we have been able to use our staff internally to date.  We head up a digital investigations network which comprises the CCPC and members of other investigative agencies across the State that do similar work.  We talk to each other often and try to resolve problems that we have.  We also participate in networks with other competition agencies across Europe.  We try to pick people's brains as best we can and get a lot of bang for our buck.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the RICO legislation is most interesting.  I will ask Mr. McHugh to respond to that.  The issue of what is referred to as parental liability has been much discussed throughout Europe.  It means that in a case where a company that has committed an offence goes out of business or ceases to exist, the parent company, up to where the final decisions were actually made, can be pursued.  There are some good provisions in EU law which allow us to co-operate with each other and pursue cases across national boundaries.</p></speech>

As Ms Goggins said, there have been cases in which subsidiaries subject to investigation have gone out of business but the holding companies have been held responsible for the behaviour and punished accordingly, with a fine, for example.  It is quite a technical legal point but there is precedent for this.</p></speech>

In her reply, Ms Goggin talked about block exemptions.  However, that is a very narrow competition response to cases where parties are trying to get exemptions for behaviour that might be construed as anti-competitive.  Is there a wider range of areas for which codes of practice could be established?  I am thinking of dominant companies in particular.  I have seen predatory pricing carried out by companies that appears to be wrong.  Could a code of practice on predatory pricing by dominant players be introduced?  Could codes of practice be brought in around the adequacy of complaint procedures and the ability of consumers to contact companies in the event that service is unsatisfactory?  It is a real mark of a dominant player that it can start to become lazy around the provision of service to its consumers.  With this new civil standard, if codes were developed in some of the areas I mentioned, could they become a more effective means of tackling such behaviour?  Ultimately, civil action can be taken if companies fail to comply with what appear to be good codes.  Is there further capacity to develop codes and set standards so that good practice can evolve in the sector, rather than having to rely on "Gotcha" options?  Civil and criminal action is always difficult.  I am wondering whether the new civil standard opens up that option.</p></speech>

We thought we would be able to address many of the behaviours with the new powers.  In the competition space, we have generally shied away from getting involved in codes of practice and developments that could almost be seen as regulatory functions.</p><p>Perhaps the witnesses from ComReg will want to come in on this.  We have not done it much, probably because we feel that dominant companies should not need a code of practice.  They are big, well resourced and stuffed with lawyers.  They should know the law and abide by it.  I am always a little reluctant to get State agencies involved in taking over a part of what should be a company's responsibilities.  It is certainly something we will take away and think about but it might be something to consider further a few years down the road.  Our big drive at the moment is to try to establish a track record of enforcement with the new powers we have.  When those boundaries have been set, it can be discussed with people how to comply with them and how they will be enforced.  There will have to be a little more drawing of the boundaries before we get to that point.</p><p> Mr. McHugh might like to come in on that.</p></speech>

Codes of practice tend to be used for matters such as complaints and how companies should interact with and treat their customers.  They can follow a code of practice and if they breach it, there may be a punishment.  We are dealing with breaches of the law.  The law has not changed because of these new powers; it is just the punishment that has changed.  It is a more difficult and risky task to put a code of practice in place to define the law in some detail, given that the law is the law.  What has tended to happen, quite successfully, is that precedent is set as cases are taken and won or lost and as competition agencies and courts make decisions on different cases.  The issues for each company are very detailed, such as whether and how the company is dominant, what the markets are and what the abuse might be.  There is a wide range of issues within that and it is very case-specific.  Codes of practice, therefore, would not lend themselves to competition law as well as they would to other areas such as consumer protection.</p></speech>

Our <i>ex ante</i>regulation is what drives us mainly.  My fellow commissioner Mr. Godfrey might talk a bit about our experience of codes of practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Godfrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021022300002#H00400"><p>I want to talk about codes of practice for complaint handling.  It is really important that when things go wrong, customers have an adequate means of redress.  In the telecoms sector, under the <i>ex ante</i>bespoke regime, ComReg requires each operator to have a code of practice for complaint handling.  We have outlined some requirements of what must be in that code of practice.  There must be a telephone number and other ways by which people can register complaints, complaints must be acknowledged within two working days and resolved within ten working days, customers who are not happy with the resolution must be told that they have the right to bring the case to ComReg, which can get involved, and ultimately there is a form of binding alternative dispute resolution.<br/><br/>What we would like to be enhanced, as Mr. McHugh said, are the penalties and sanctions when the codes of practice are not abided by.  It is not just a question of taking a long and extensive compliance action.  We would also like there to be measures such as automatic penalties or compensation for customers when the codes of practice for handling complaints are not delivered on.  Again, that is not really within the scope of the Bill but the question of enforcement powers is really important to us.  Consequently, it is not just a question of ComReg imposing obligations on operators but rather ensuring that those obligations will be complied with, with deterrents against non-compliance.  That is an ongoing conversation we are having with our parent Department and we look forward to it bearing some fruit.</p></speech>

A recent report showed that Dublin City Council is paying about &euro;100,000 more for construction than it would in the private sector.  Practices can be seen in respect of public procurement, particularly for large-scale projects; it is not just bid-rigging.  When we addressed this issue at another meeting, we talked about the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the powers it has.  Would there be value in giving powers to the witnesses' agencies similar to those possessed by CAB or will the focus be more on regulation and guidelines?  I refer not just to bid-rigging but to other anti-competitive practices that might be going on.  The witnesses might comment on the construction sector in particular because that issue has been raised with me and with people who believe there are anti-competitive practices.  That is despite the fact that, as I have said previously, others believe that this sort of activity is something of a victimless crime, which we know it is not.  Might additional powers such as those that CAB has be required?  The taxpayer is being ripped off to the tune of quite a substantial amount of money and we need to change the attitude to this because it is not a victimless crime.  We need to go after white-collar crime with the same vigour that CAB goes after blue-collar criminal activity.</p></speech>

It is our intention to go after white-collar crime with all the resources and powers that we have at our disposal.<br/><br/>The issue of the cost of public procurement has been ongoing for centuries.  Funnily enough, the other day I was reading something written by Samuel Pepys in the 1660s.  He was in charge of the royal dockyards in England, or something like that.  He wrote that it was impossible for the king to buy anything as cheaply as other men.  It has been around for centuries that once the public purse is available, people seem to get very good at finding ways of exploiting it.<br/><br/>I would not consider the CAB-type powers, particularly in the context of the seizure of assets and so on, to be useful to us at this point.  When we talk about competition offences, we look at quite a wide range.  There are matters that we see as clearly in the criminal space, such as bid-rigging, price-fixing, market-sharing and so on, but there are other practices such as vertical agreements and abuse of dominance that are not subject to proof at that criminal standard but which can be proved in other ways.  We think the appropriate step to do in such cases is to investigate those cases and to use the new powers we are being given to do so.<br/><br/>Part of the issue of competition investigation is that there are parties that are damaged.  If a criminal offence is proved, according to the current legislation that is <i>res judicata</i>.  Anyone who is damaged by the practice can come forward to seek damages, and the case is regarded as having been proved to the extent that the facts are the same.  That is not necessarily the same in the civil arena, but we hope that if the level of enforcement of competition offences, as a public agency, can be improved, that would stimulate an increase in the number of private sector cases, which includes the likes of public procurers.  People who could prove they had been damaged by an anti-competitive practice could go after the company and get damages as recompense for that.</p><p>We see companies being pursued and the possibility of damages as being the most valuable ways to deter people from engaging in these practices.  It will take a couple of years, but our focus for those first years will certainly be to build up a track record in enforcement and then to enable the damaged parties, if one likes, to be able to exercise their rights in court to seek redress and get the damages back.</p></speech>

If the EU directive is transposed and the new powers of deterrence and enforcement are made available, will there be a need for additional specialist staff?  If so, how many staff will ComReg and the CCPC require?  A linked question is whether the witnesses foresee a need for increased funding.  What level of increased funding would be required annually?</p></speech>

Last year, we engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the formulation of our budget ask for this year.  I am very happy to say that we were given a substantial increase in our pay budget for this year.   We are still working out, based on the detail of what is in the Bill, what sort of people we need and who goes where.  We certainly need economists and lawyers.  We will probably need people in the IT space as well.  That is really one of the areas where we are looking at the prospects of attracting and retaining people because it is very specialised and there is a lot of demand for it.  We have a little bit of concern about how to do it but we are still working through that.  We are happy that we have built up the unit we currently have and that we are building up specialist expertise within each of the divisions as well, including competition enforcement, consumer protection, product safety, criminal investigation and so on.  We cannot complain at the moment.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Bill relates to one such function, but there are many other functions that ComReg has taken on.  We have requested extra staff and, similar to the CCPC, our extra ask was granted.  In terms of funding, we are a self-funding agency.  We are funded from a levy on industry and there is also funding from the sale of spectrum.  Both of those sources set funding for us, so we do not have a call on the Exchequer.  However, similar to the CCPC, we have been successful in securing extra resources.</p></speech>

That interest is obvious from the debate and level of engagement we have had and the way in which people are getting stuck into this issue and really understanding it.  What we would like to see coming out of this is an enforcement regime that is straightforward, simple and pretty much on par with what goes on across the board in Europe and which gives us the powers our colleagues have.  We are very conscious that giving us powers of this scale and scope is a big deal.  We absolutely understand our responsibility to exercise those powers judiciously, proportionately and within the law.  We will absolutely commit to using them within those constraints, but to the best of our ability to procure the best deal for consumers and the public purse.</p></speech>

I have worked in research and policy on climate action and sustainability for 17 years.  Currently independent, I am an adviser to the Finland Futures Research Centre and was lead author of the transport chapter in the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 state of the environment report.<br/><br/>It is to be welcomed that the committee seeks to scrutinise action on transport.  The target to reduce emissions by 51% or more by 2030 must focus minds.  Ireland's national transport carbon emissions are <i>per capita</i>the fourth highest in the EU.  Emissions have continued to grow even while we require them to decrease rapidly.<br/><br/>It is important to understand why we have been going in the wrong direction.  An extensive rail system that existed at the formation of the State was largely decommissioned over the past century.  In more recent decades, we have delivered the perfect conditions for lock-in to a carbon-intensive transport system.  Through urban sprawl, our settlement pattern has increased travel distances.  At the same time, transport policy directed major investment towards roads and motorways and allowed walking, cycling and public transport to stagnate or decline in comparison.  As our wealth grew and increased demand for transport, decades of policy and private choices funnelled passengers into cars and freight onto trucks.  A lock-in to an unsustainable system was inevitable.<br/><br/>The Climate Action Plan 2019, initiated by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, was a laudable effort at progress.  However, it had a problematic relationship with transport.  Key decisions on spatial and transport planning had already been taken in the national planning framework and the national development plan, NDP.  They included modest, shorter term aims for compact growth and for shifting journeys to sustainable modes.  As a result, it became clear that we would miss our 2030 emissions targets considerably.  To plug this gap, the climate action plan was forced to ramp up the goal for the number of electric vehicles to a level that was difficult to achieve.  We now have a far deeper emissions reduction target and it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet it.  More importantly, this would make our 2050 emissions commitments harder to achieve and deepen the many sustainability problems associated with our transport system.  Just some of these include world-leading traffic congestion, damage to economic competitiveness, road traffic accidents and the many impacts of particulate pollution on human health.<br/><br/>The commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling.  They are not consistent with the scale of the challenge we now face.  In response, the avoid-shift-improve approach is recognised internationally by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and others as the standard for deep emissions reductions and sustainability.  This transformative approach demands that policy move from short term to long, from marginal tweaks to big vision, and from improving technology to transforming systems fundamentally.<br/><br/>&quot;Avoid&quot; means avoiding the generation of more and longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing our existing sprawl.  It has common aims with providing affordable, high-quality housing in vibrant, well-serviced communities.  It uses spatial planning tools to channel virtually all future development into the existing footprints of our cities and into revitalising the physical core of the villages and towns of rural Ireland.  &quot;Avoid&quot; also includes short-term demand management.<br/><br/>&quot;Shift&quot; is the next priority.  It means moving journeys from private cars to walking, cycling and public transport.  It implements the settlement and transport planning necessary to make these sustainable modes the dominant forms of movement in the years to come.  There needs to be a particular priority on rail for passengers and freight.  Rail is the safest and most sustainable option over longer distances and can support greatly increasing walking and cycling.</p><p>"Improve" means smaller vehicles, better engines and moving to alternatives such as electric.  This will remain a necessary, but not a sufficient approach for a sustainable low-carbon future.</p><p> Transformation involves bringing together spatial, transport and climate action policy.  It begins with 2050 goals and implements the short-term plans necessary to meet them.  In Ireland, we have major gaps to address.  Our vision, our analysis and our policy all need a shot in the arm.</p><p> To conclude, if our severely congested, emissions-intensive and economically costly transport system were a heart patient, it would be in cardiac failure.  Our policy is providing an aspirin when the patient needs a triple heart bypass.  Making progress will require vision and political leadership.  Through the disruption of the pandemic, we now have a unique opportunity to reset and put ourselves on the right side of history.</p><p> I thank the committee once more for this opportunity to speak and I am happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I have submitted a statement so I will cover some highlights from it.  The remit of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, is as an independent overseer of the implementation by planning authorities and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the regulatory and policy framework for planning set by the Oireachtas and Government.  I will cover the various topics such as: avoiding increasing energy demands, accelerating the shift towards sustainable travel patterns and diversifying our energy systems.</p> <p>  Starting with avoiding increasing energy demands through proper planning, it is fair to say that, historically, our model of development has hardwired us to mainly low-density development dependent on car-based transport, perhaps due to a low awareness of the impacts on the environment and the weakness of sustainable alternatives.  Legislative reforms introduced in 2010 included stricter controls on how, where and how much land would be sold for development but it has been very challenging to implement these reforms which has required dezoning in commuter locations and rezoning land for development in underutilised urban areas.  Today, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework, NPF, commits to securing an average of 40% of the delivery of all new homes on brownfield and infilled development land, rising to 50% in cities and 30% in our towns and villages, through good local authority planning.</p> <p>  From our vantage point on the implementation of this we see a mixed picture.  Some local authorities work hard on climate action-centred planning policy despite significant vested interest, political and sometimes public opposition where the link between certain developments and climate are perhaps not fully appreciated.  Other local authorities increasingly point to brownfield and higher density development being much less economic compared to lower density greenfield development and point out that following traditional patterns of development might be essential in meeting housing supply pressures.  Communities often want to retain familiar 19th century skylines as our cities and towns struggle to address 21st century challenges, including an extra 1 million people predicted by the by the national planning framework by 2040.</p> <p>  Building upwards and making better use of underutilised urban land, providing attractive, affordable and well-located urban housing and connected communities are many of the antidotes to our historical business-as-usual outwards pattern of energy-intensive urban sprawl.  Yet urban regeneration, as many members of the committee will know, is massively time and resource-consuming, often litigious, and, if one does not have good participatory-based planning, can be locally contentious.</p> <p>  As we highlighted in the annual report of the OPR, until the NPF is properly reflected and acted upon, we will continue to approve and develop too much development in locations that continue to hardwire us into increasing energy demand.</p> <p>  Turning around the affordability, attractiveness and viability of large-scale housing development within our city and town centres is very critical as will a national brownfield and infill development land register to identify what compact growth means.  Land activation measures such as progressing the Land Development Agency Bill, empowering local authorities to implement the vacant and derelict sites legislation and swift despatch of litigation arising are also vital.</p> <p>  Turning to the shift towards active and sustainable travel, all members of the committee will agree that spatial planning policies have a great influence in determining transport patterns.  Technology can break old links between work and mobility.  There is no doubt that Government is making unprecedented investment but we are championing the critical importance of full integration between transport and land use planning, like some of the recent plans such as the local area plan for Athy and the Dingle hub project.</p> <p>  We want to engage in skilling programmes for the local authorities in delivering sustainable mobility but in the context of shifting from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing, which never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.</p> <p>  Turning briefly to improving the sustainability of our energy sources, communities want real action on climate.  One of the best ways to tap that desire would be to show how every county in the country could play its part in delivering an estimated extra 4 GW of renewable electricity to 2030 and, indeed, more offshore energy generation to a carbon-free society by 2050.  Yet our assessments of some local authority development plans find effective bans on the roll-out of sustainable energy sources.  On top of the updated Wind Energy Development Guidelines we need a national renewable energy roadmap with county-specific targets and the designation of sustainable energy zones which can be built by the regional assemblies working with the local authority climate action regional offices.</p> <p>  The Planning Act under section 10(2)(n) already demands forward planning that reduces future patterns of energy consumption, shifts our present energy needs towards renewable sources and adapts to climate changes already happening.  The pace in implementing this law is quickening since the publication of the NPF, the establishment of our office and the coming into being of local authority climate action plans under the legislation promised.  Local government and local authority planning, however, has a central role to play in the Avoid-Shift-Improve approach I mentioned but it needs clear policy frameworks and resources to work with to ensure that local authority members focus on the task at hand.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding this and our statutory mandate, legislated for by the Oireachtas and supported by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we will work to ensure that all the constituent cogs in our country&rsquo;s planning process work together in the planet&rsquo;s and not just in local interests.</p></speech>

Transport &amp;amp; Environment, T&amp;E, is a Brussels-based European-level NGO, advocating a more sustainable transport network at European and national level.  T&amp;E&rsquo;s vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment.  I have been with T&amp;E for almost seven years, focusing largely on the aviation sector.  A graduate of NUI Galway, I have been living in Brussels for ten years, moving there initially to work for the European Commission&rsquo;s transport directorate.</p> <p>  Ireland is not alone in witnessing a growth in transport emissions, with this sector now the largest source of emissions across Europe.  However, the absolute growth in emissions from Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector - an increase of 136% since 1990 - is stark compared to an EU average increase of 20%.</p> <p>  It would be tempting to ascribe such exceptional growth to Ireland&rsquo;s increase in GDP and population over that period.  However, this would ignore the role that policy decisions at all levels have played.  After all, it is Ireland&rsquo;s choice where we put this population growth and how we invested this wealth.</p> <p>  Nearly all aspects of the Avoid, Shift, Improve approach are impacted, directly or indirectly, by European legislation.  How this legislation is amended in the coming years will be crucial to achieving substantial emission reductions in the transport sector.</p> <p>  Europe's effort sharing regulation incentivises avoid and shift through target setting for parts of the economy, including transport.  That regulation is, however, under threat.  Vehicle regulations set targets for large and small vehicles, and have been decisive in driving the uptake of both low emission and high emissions vehicles.   The environmental and climate impact of fuels is regulated through the fuel quality and renewable energy directives, shaping the development of biofuels policy in Europe.  Aviation and shipping have to date received only passing interest from European regulators.  That has led to damaging consequences for these sectors' ability to decarbonise.</p> <p>  In addition to these regulations, the EU also plays an important role in financing transport infrastructure.  For example, the EIB has in the past lent heavily to carbon intensive projects, especially airports and roads, a position which is evolving as the bank aligns its lending with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p> <p>  European legislation is now starting to pay dividends where, for example, the reforms to car standards introduced in the wake of VW&rsquo;s "dieselgate" scandal are driving the deployment of zero-emission vehicles.  The bulk of European legislation is now under review under Europe&rsquo;s Green Deal which will touch on issues in respect of electric vehicles, batteries and biofuels.</p> <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy &ndash; Putting European Transport on Track for the Future, published last December, will guide European policy in this area.  It envisages smart and climate neutral cities across Europe, delivered through a range of measures, including shared mobility and increased cycling and walking infrastructure.  There is no one single fix to eliminating emissions from transport.</p> <p>  Policy developments are mutually reinforced by technological developments.</p><p>Improvements in battery technology, with regard to both range and price, have repeatedly exceeded expectations.  The price of batteries has fallen 85% in a decade and they can now go further and charge faster.  I consider myself one of the strongest proponents of the direct electrification of the transport system via electric vehicles.  We are far from realising the full potential of this area, due in part to some persisting myths regarding battery electrification.  Nevertheless, I have no intention of owning an electric vehicle because I have no intention of owning a private vehicle of any type.  I live in a major city with ample access to cheap public transport and where an increasing priority is given to walking and cycling.</p><p> This gets us to the key issue of decarbonising transport.  Stricter regulations and developments in technology mean we can, for most modes, offer people access to low-carbon mobility.  However, the public should always be given a choice and no one should be forced into a 20th century model of private car ownership which continues to have substantial negative financial, social and economic consequences.  A one-for-one switch between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles would be a missed opportunity.  It would undermine the effectiveness of public transport investments, place continued financial pressure on families and would risk putting Irish cities further out of step with their European counterparts.</p><p> Our transport policy is linked with our industrial and economic policy.  The right choices in decarbonising our transport sector can have enormous benefits for our economy, creating employment opportunities across the island.  With 97% of our transport energy demand met by imported fossil fuels in 2017, we have an opportunity to switch to developing our own fuels in Ireland, including fuels for the shipping and aviation sectors, through presently untapped offshore renewable energy potential. </p><p> I said &ldquo;most modes&rdquo; have an immediate pathway to decarbonisation.  A major exception is aviation which, before Covid, was the fastest growing source of emissions in Europe.  That is not by accident.  Our failure to effectively regulate aviation emissions, and instead to subsidise their growth, has created this situation.  This lack of regulation has consequences.  Measures put in place to decarbonise other sectors, including measures relating to cars, buildings and electricity, are starting to pay dividends.  Aviation is increasingly isolated as a high emitter of carbon, a problem which will return to threaten the sector post Covid.  This lack of regulation does the sector no favours and Ireland&rsquo;s role in resisting such regulation at European level is short-sighted in the extreme.  As an Irish citizen living overseas, I am acutely aware of the role aviation plays in connecting Ireland.  Those who talk up the strategic importance of aviation to Ireland should be equally vocal in ensuring the sector cuts its emissions.  With effort, and in time, we can develop solutions for aviation too.  I look forward to taking members' questions.</p></speech>

This meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours.  I propose that each member be given two minutes to address their questions to the witnesses to ensure that all members get an opportunity to pose their questions and to allow witnesses sufficient time to answer.  We will have a second round of questions if there is time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I will take members in the order in which they raise their hands.  While the clerk is noting the order, I will start off the questioning.</p><p>Given the scale of the challenge ahead in achieving at least 51% decarbonisation in transport by 2030, there is a fear that our planning policy is not aligned with our ambition.  In other words, is the national planning framework fit for purpose?  As Mr. Cussen pointed out in his opening statement, the national planning framework commits to securing an average of 40% of all new homes on brownfield and in-fill development land, with this average to rise to 50% in cities and to fall to 30% in towns and villages.  However, this indicates that 50% of homes are to be developed around cities and 70% around towns and villages.  This seems to pull against the principles of compact growth and the town centres first approach.  It will also continue our problem of urban sprawl, which beds in dependency on cars.  This dependency is at its worst in towns and villages, given the lack of public and active travel options.  As Mr. Cussen points out, we must away move from promoting sprawling estates and scattered housing which, to quote Mr. Cussen, will &quot;never work from a public transport and active travel perspective.&quot;</p><p>All three witnesses mentioned the approach of avoid, shift and improve.  Dr. O'Mahony commented that the commitments in the national planning framework and the NDP must be seen as a floor of ambition rather than a ceiling and that it is not consistent with the scale of the challenge we face.  The highest priority in this approach is given to avoiding, which is to say avoiding the generation of longer trips by preventing low-density development and repairing the sprawl we already have.  As Dr. O'Mahony points out, this approach channels virtually all future development into the existing footprints of our cities and into revitalising the physical core of the villages and towns of rural Ireland.</p><p>I address this question to all three witnesses; is the national planning framework fit for purpose when it comes to achieving our targets for the reduction of transport emissions?  I also have a question for Mr. Cussen in particular.  We have seen evidence of local authorities enabling schemes that are quite dependent on cars at the periphery of urban centres through local area plans but it is claimed on paper that they are aligned with the national planning framework, NPF.  As regulator, is Mr. Cussen prepared to intervene in such cases to prevent their development if they will lock in dependency on cars and greenhouse gas emissions?</p></speech>

We are not ourselves a policymaker.  Our job is to enforce the national planning framework and the targets contained within it.  It is not for me to comment on whether the NPF is fit for purpose or whether we should have some other framework.  My job is to enforce the NPF as it has been laid out.  As the record will show in respect of the submissions we make on development plans and the points and recommendations we have made to Ministers regarding the power of direction in respect of development plans, we are very active in enforcing that regulatory and policy framework.  We will also not be shy with regard to the implementation of section 10(2)(<i>n</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, which requires local authorities to comprehensively address the issue of climate change in their development plans with regard to patterns of development, transportation, adaptation to the effects of climate change and so on.</p></speech>

The first reason for this is that it is for the period to 2040.  To consider transformation options, we need to look at 2050 or beyond.  These are big systemic changes and this is very important.  A second reason is that it needs to look at alternatives.  Rather than just looking at small changes or redirecting 40% of new developments into existing footprints, it needs to look at the possibilities for approaches that are more transformative and more radical.  If one does not consider radical measures when looking at transformation, one is not seeking transformation.</p> <p>  I know the national planning framework was formed a number of years ago, before the real urgency of this issue came to bear, but we do not have analysis available in Ireland which can support choices.  We do not know what it would mean by 2050, were we to redirect all development into existing footprints.  We do not know what would be involved in taking a transformative approach to sustainable modes of transport in order that they dominate mobility in the future.  There would be capital costs and other implications but our current approach is very costly for our economy in terms of competitiveness.  It is widely accepted at this stage that this is not an emissions problem but a sustainable development problem.  I do not think it is credible to claim that the national planning framework is in line with our commitments.  It is, however, very important that it is protected because it is what we have.  We cannot backslide on this and adopt a weaker approach but we also need to urgently study the alternatives that can be put in place.  The political process will then decide what is desirable for the nation.</p></speech>

This is absolutely the case.  One example of this is the shift to rail freight.</p><p>Ireland has the lowest amount of rail freight in Europe.  It is very near the bottom, perhaps after Malta and Cyprus.  We should also be evidence driven on how much we can actually shift to rail, particularly in a short period like ten years.  Across Europe, we have about 18% of freight transferred by rail.  On a good day, we can get maybe 23% of freight transferred by rail.  There is not going to be an easy solution to shifting to rail.  That is why it is important to drive forward electrification in those sectors which cannot be so easily changed by a switch to public transport or planning changes.</p><p> Both the 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government are either quite weak on the application of freight transport or they pursue some of the wrong solutions, such as using natural gas or using biogas for freight transport.  To some extent that is understandable.  The technology in this area is moving fast.  Just this month, Scania ditched plans for hydrogen-powered trucks and instead is going all out on battery electric vehicles.</p><p> When we are talking about this, we need to be clear on what we can achieve through changes in planning, the shift to rail and what needs to be electrified.  The pace of electrification needs to be accelerated if we are going to reach that 2030 goal.</p></speech>

I confirm I am on the parliamentary premises.</p> <p>  Given the subject matter we are discussing this afternoon, I want to focus on the difficulties we have in achieving sustainable communities because of urban sprawl.  In equal measure, we also have very well-thought-out and well-worked plans on large-scale, higher density development, especially in our cities.  We regularly see, however, planning applications refused.</p> <p>  As the planning regulator who operates under a policy framework issued by the Oireachtas, what are Mr. Cussen's views on how he proposes to assist in achieving those sustainable goals and large-scale, sustainable developments within Dublin city boundaries?  Deputy Devlin and I, as the city representatives, would agree we pass local area plans and strategic goals and yet here we are a decade later and still nothing.</p> <p>  On large-scale transport systems, I was heartened to hear Dr. O'Mahony and Mr. Murphy mention rail in particular.  It is really close to my heart.  Oireachtas Members have been derided for even suggesting that rail freight should become a larger part of the offering in the State.  We have, of course, a chequered history with closure of lines throughout the country.  Will our guests comment on the slowness of getting metro and DART extension projects off the ground, not just in my constituency but in parts of west Dublin, Kildare and Meath?</p></speech>

We statutorily assess the plans of the planning authorities and examine them rigorously.  If they go far enough, we would be obviously supportive of them.  If they do not, we point that out through our recommendations and the observations we submit.  They have statutory effect.  It is obviously an obligation on the planning authority to address those.</p> <p>  Public awareness is important in terms of what compact growth means and how we can achieve that in practice.  We are very engaged around that.  We have published toolkits for public engagement.  We sponsor the "Eco Eye" series and there is a programme airing tonight on the very topic the Deputy has raised.  I would recommend it as good viewing.</p> <p>  This is about raising public awareness about the urgency of this issue and its connectedness to other challenges that we face as a society, whether they are climate, economic, social, mobility and so on.  We are also engaged in training programmes with elected members.  To date, we have had seven events with an eighth one coming up this Friday.  We have had hundreds of engagements with the 949 councillors the length and breadth of the country.  They tune into our monthly webinars on these very matters.  There is strong evidence of elected council members becoming much more aware around these issues and indeed understanding some of their cruxes and the trade-offs which have to be addressed in securing compact development.</p> <p>  To help get things moving, we will have reviews of local authorities.  We are a statutory reviewer of local authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have a pilot programme with four local authorities being reviewed this year.  We will be building up to a series of six per annum thereafter.  We will be looking closely at local authority policies and programmes regarding active land management.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about local area plans being adopted and particular opportunity sites identified.  What has been the progress since the last plan adoption and moving matters forward?  We will be asking straight questions on capacity and agility.  In fairness to our local authorities, having much experience of working in them myself over recent years, they are extremely hard pressed.  They need to be supported, resourced and funded appropriately to take on these functions.  Some of the pointers around that are also included in our annual report.</p></speech>

We have been talking about metro in Dublin since 1971 when it was first proposed by An Foras Forbartha.  Some 50 years later, we are still talking about it.  While it is about to go to planning - or so we believe - these are the difficulties we have in this jurisdiction.  I do not have time to talk about DART expansion north and west.  What are the witnesses' views on this and the difficulties that we have in actually delivering on these ambitions?</p></speech>

From my experience of engaging with my opposite numbers or professional links in other European countries, they often work with the benefit of a sustained and continuous programme of public capital investment, particularly around public transport.  I alluded to this in my statement.  Even the knowledge and the momentum of that creates a basis then for corresponding public and private investment and the achievement of the compact growth objectives.  For various reasons, many of which will be familiar to members of this committee, we have had a stop-start cycle.</p> <p>  However, on quite a positive note, for the first time we have an integrated spatial plan backed by a capital investment plan.  That of itself is actually quite unusual as one goes around other European countries.  It is not so often that one will see such a strong alignment between a national planning framework and national development plan.  We might well argue does it go far enough and so on.  The very fact that we have that as a building block of public policy in this country is a huge breakthrough, however.  It obviously gives us a platform to work through.</p><p>There have been very encouraging and positive signs from Government that the commitment is there, notwithstanding the Covid headwinds and economic challenges, to maintain that public capital programme, which is absolutely vital to give the planning authorities, elected members, communities and so on the certainty that public transport infrastructure is being invested in and progressed.  Then we can work out all of the other relevant details.  There is another issue, of course, namely, the extent to which there are legal challenges around large planning cases but that is another matter.</p></speech>

We are tight for time so I will focus on electric vehicles, EVs.  Dr. O'Mahony made some interesting comments in his opening statement.  He said that because of the deeper emissions reduction target, it is a risky and potentially costly gamble to rely on electric vehicles to meet that target.  Our target is for 950,000 EVs by 2030.  It is obvious we have not had a very good track record in rolling out EVs or the infrastructure for same.  We are still struggling on that front, with only 7.4% of new passenger sales in 2020 being EVs.  That compares with 74.8% in Norway or indeed 18.1% in Finland.  If the target of 950,000 by 2030 is not achievable, what kind of target does Dr. O'Mahony think is feasible?  What are the kind of changes the Government would need to put in place to ensure the target was met, because meeting even a significantly reduced target would be difficult at this stage?</p> <p>  I am also interested in Dr. O'Mahony's opinion on using EVs to meet that target and how cost-prohibitive they are.  Is there a risk there will be a whole section of our community who cannot afford to use this technology and therefore, when it comes to a just transition and ensuring everyone can play their part the cost will exclude them from that?</p></speech>

It relies on the supply of minerals required to make the batteries being constantly available globally, including sufficient supply to manufacture the vehicles that would come to Ireland.  That is not guaranteed.  It also means we have a system that just requires more technological change overall.  That already becomes more costly.  It is the wrong approach to start at 2030.  We must always start with 2050 and with the preventative approaches of avoid and shift, only coming to improve at the end.  I would not say it is not possible, but our target in the climate action plan to move up to 936,000 electric vehicles is the same diffusion rate as Norway's.  Norway is the world leader and that has cost a lot in terms of public subvention.  If we are relying on the cost of electric vehicles coming down, we are taking a little bit of a risk that it will happen on an expected timeline.  It also embeds the other sustainability issues.</p> <p>  Electric vehicles cannot deal with the issue of particulate matter completely.  A total of 50% of emissions will remain because they come from tyre and break wear.  It affects cognitive development of the unborn child, mental health and cardiovascular disease.  There are a whole range of human health impacts so, again, relying on that is ceding ground to an approach to transport systems which is not sustainable.  That being said we should still do it.  We should still pursue EVs and alternative drivetrains but not prioritise them.</p> <p>  The Deputy has hit on a really important issue of people who may not be able to afford this.  If we rely on EVs and potentially on retiring cars before their usual end of life and give public subvention to help people to do that - scrappage schemes and other things, that is a direct transfer of wealth from the State to people who are usually wealthier.  It leaves out people who may be on the minimum wage or may be earning less.  To provide a mobility system, not a transport system, that serves all is another reason from a just transition equity perspective to prioritise avoid and shift and not just improve in EVs.</p></speech>

The primary reason is that the range of cars available in a showroom and their prices are largely decided by EU legislation.  This legislation forces manufacturers to lower the CO2 produced by those vehicles and therefore puts more electric vehicles on the road.  In the last quarter of 2019 and 2020 there was an uptick in sales of EVs in Ireland.  They were offered at lower rates to encourage uptake.  On the issue of cost, those who have bet against the cost of EVs declining have lost every time.  Batteries have reduced in price by 85% in the past decade and have decreased by 17% in the last year alone.  Batteries are one third of the cost of electric vehicles.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which is among the most optimistic about the cost of EVs, upgraded its forecast for price parity between EVs and internal combustion vehicles to between 2023 and 2025.  EVs are cheaper to produce, maintain and power.</p> <p>  The next ten years will be very different.  People point to Norway and say we will need Norway-type subsidies to ensure the deployment of EVs but that is not necessarily the case.  If they are going to become this cheap, they can be deployed.  However, I would stress, and this is very evident in yesterday's figures on the sale of EVs of Ireland, that there is a big difference between battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The Irish taxation regime needs to be amended to reflect some misleading figures by manufacturers and the European legislation needs to be amended to fix some of the loopholes which are emerging with EVs.  Targets for Ireland refer to zero or low-emissions vehicles.  We need to drop the reference to low-emissions vehicles and just go all in on zero-emissions ones.</p></speech>

I thank also colleagues whose questions and contributions will probably inform what I am about to ask.  Mr. Murphy is advocating for a complete switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.  The question has been asked a little bit by Deputy Whitmore, but to what extent does Mr. Murphy think it gets us off the hook when we are talking about the avoid part of the strategy?  I wish to address specifically a project near me which the contributors may be familiar with, which is the Galway ring road.  One of the arguments there is that it would increase emissions by 37%.  Electric vehicles address some of that issue.  Dr. O'Mahony talked about urban sprawl and the increased travel distance.  In some parts of that proposal, it would increase what is a 5.5 km journey to 22 km.  Taking all that into consideration, should we be looking at these types of approaches or is it getting us off the hook when it comes to investment in a proper transport system for a city?</p> <p>  I also wish to ask Dr. O'Mahony about rail freight.  The horse has bolted to a certain extent as far as reaching our targets by 2030 and 2050 is concerned.  It might be too late for a huge investment in rail.  However, if we are looking at the reopening of existing lines, such as the western rail corridor, for freight, this would require only a small amount of investment.  Could this be part of the solution?</p> <p>  Mr. Cussen has answered about his remit as it relates to the national planning framework.</p><p>To what extent do the witnesses think it would be logistically possible to tweak the framework as we go, now that we have more scientific evidence?  Do they think it is quite dangerous not to tweak it from a planning perspective if not doing so would mean we see changes to our settlement patterns that would create a difficulty in implementing the framework?</p></speech>

It is ten years since I left Galway but when I last lived there, the outer bypass was a major issue and it is still being debated.  I remember reading the impact assessment for the proposed bypass ten years ago.  The evidence then was pretty clear that building the road would cause more cars to be used in Galway and would make the city more car dependent.  Is our vision to have electric buses stuck in traffic behind electric cars?  That is what we will get if we pursue both the electrification of vehicles and the construction of more roads.  When we talk about the electrification of cars, we always talk about Norway and how great it is but we should look at what Oslo is doing.  Oslo as a city is being very aggressive in getting cars out of the city.  It has been closing streets to cars and removing on-street car parking.  Supporting the electrification of vehicles is not the same as supporting endless road building.</p> <p>  To touch on the mineral issues which were raised by Deputy Whitmore, there is a problem with the minerals used in battery production.  Last December the EU proposed the world's first law to regulate the mineral content of batteries, including enforcing social conditions for extraction and recycling targets for some of those minerals.  Obviously, the more vehicles we have to produce, the more challenging it is to ensure that production is done sustainably.  We should electrify as much as we can but we must focus on the electrification element and not the road building part.</p></speech>

We may not be able to go full-throttle with putting in new rail lines but where we already have rail lines, such as the western rail corridor, should we be looking at recommissioning them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#F00700"><p>First, it is usually argued that the Irish rail system is underutilised.  A decade or two ago, around 4% or 5% of freight was rail freight so there are opportunities to look at that.  Reopening existing lines is an option and the all-Ireland strategic rail review provides an enormous opportunity to examine this further.  Instead of taking the possible expansion of rail off the table, we should look at it.  Just because we look at an option does not mean that we go down the road of taking it.  What I am advocating in terms of transformative approaches does not mean that we go to the extremes of this.  It means that we look at those extremes and see what the implications are in terms of the capital investment costs, the positives that come from them in terms of the public good <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>reductions in road traffic accidents, air pollution and all of the other impacts of an unsustainable system.  Looking out to 2050, we need to be considering the implications of moving the bulk of freight over to rail.  What would that mean?  How much expansion would it mean?  How many new rail heads or hubs would it mean?  What would it mean in terms of technological approaches to logistics and bundling goods together from different companies, whether they are intermediate products for industry or final products for consumers?  We need to look at all of this.  We do not necessarily switch everything over but at the moment we are working in a vacuum, on both the passenger and freight sides, because we do not have the evidence to allow us to look at transformative approaches.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cussen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#F00800"><p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for her question.  It is important to remember that as with local authority development plans, the national planning framework is a cyclical plan that will have to be reviewed or revisited by the Government in conjunction with all stakeholders on a regular basis.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 established the legislative basis for the national planning framework and its renewal out into the future.  That will ultimately be a matter for the Government and the processes are laid out in the legislation, including Oireachtas scrutiny of the preparation of revisions to the national planning framework.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my paper, a very important starting point would be the compilation of a national brownfield land register or database.  As it stands, with regard to the laudable objective of 30% for villages, 50% for cities and 40% in overall urban terms, it is actually very hard for us to monitor the effectiveness of development plans in a very precise way.  It is very important that we start down the road of having those strong objectives in planning frameworks but the measurement of it, in terms of how it is actually being achieved on the ground, is still somewhat uncertain.  That is an issue that we are continuing to research and to engage on with our parent department and the local authorities more generally.  </p> <p>  In regard to the Senator's point about tweaking the framework while taking on board the latest scientific evidence and the evolving climate action objectives, that will naturally come in the round in terms of the evolution of the national planning framework.  We need to think through the unintended consequences of having extremely ambitious targets for brownfield development without considering the deliverability and affordability of same.  As Deputy Farrell mentioned earlier, in many cases local authority development plans will include brownfield regeneration sites and yet members will see, some years later, that progress towards getting those activated is slow.  The effectiveness of our vacant and derelict sites legislation is an issue.  The mechanisms and the tools that are available to local authorities to get brownfield development sites into production so that they provide sustainable, high-quality and affordable options for people are very important.  If we have very high targets that are unattainable, effectively that displaces demand to other locations, as we have seen with some of the patterns of development around our cities, where we see suburban development.</p></speech>

I am giving some latitude to witnesses but we are against the clock and I want to be fair to everyone.  Deputy Bruton is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#F01000"><p>I will comment briefly and then pose a few questions.  There may be a risk of a false dichotomy being created between electrification versus compact development.  The reality is that we need both.  In terms of compact development, at best 1% of our housing stock is built each year.  We would like to be at 2% but that is still a small proportion that will be delivered by 2030.  Obviously, as Dr. O'Mahony said, by 2050 the number will be bigger and will have much more impact.  Our entire car fleet will change over the next decade so there is an opportunity to have a significant influence on the fleet that is purchased over that period.  That will have an immediate impact.  Dr. Murphy is right that electrification is an available and usable option.  We must bear in mind that 90% of journeys over 8 km in Ireland are driven journeys and it is difficult to replace a lot of them with public transport, no matter how ambitious we become.  We have an immediate problem as well as a long-term one.</p> <p>  As we move from the climate action plan, which was built around a 30% target, to a 51% target, what changes would the witnesses propose we make to that climate plan?  In that context, how do we measure the cost-effectiveness of interventions?  I speak from experience with the national broadband plan, which was expensive but, in my view, absolutely essential.  I found it very difficult to get public support for that within the system because the tendency is to look at the short-term costs.  How do we deal with the issue of the choices that have long-term benefits but high short-term costs?</p><p>How important do the witnesses believe pricing is in achieving the objectives of transition?  Carbon pricing has its supporters and its opponents.  I refer to road pricing.  How important will they be as we move towards the 2050 target?</p><p> My final question relates to compact development.  Do we need to move to some sort of planning gain model whereby communities in which high density development is taking place get something back?  Do we need to see deeper integration of the local development plan with the national plan?  I am happy with written responses if there is not enough time now.</p></speech>

I will go to Mr. Murphy first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#G00300"><p>I will be as brief as I can because they are all excellent questions.  We can improve the climate action plan through more focus on freight.  It is suggested that there are no low-emission freight vehicles in the climate action plan but technology has changed rapidly in two years.</p> <p>  In terms of cost-benefit, I would drop the increase in the biofuel lending rate.  If we look at where we are getting the ethanol from and the competition we have with land, the most recent National Oil Reserves Agency report on the sourcing of biofuels in Ireland, be they advanced biodiesel or bioethanol, raises some flags regarding origins of such fuels.</p> <p>  On where else we can increase ambition, the T&aacute;naiste has launched his working-from-home proposal, which will study the potential benefits of working from home.  We should await that study but that is another obvious way to increase ambition.</p> <p>  Carbon pricing is not the most effective way of reducing transport emissions because the consumer is forced into a particular model and if the price goes up, he or she is not necessarily able to then switch out to a different model.  The Deputy mentioned that carbon pricing has supporters and opponents.  The big supporters of carbon pricing are car manufacturers who would rather shift the burden onto the consumers and individuals as a way of having to do less themselves.  We think of car standards at European level.  Carbon pricing always involves a social equity issue.  If there are ways to address the social equity issue but there will not be a big climate benefit from engaging in carbon pricing why go to the hassle of the potential risk of social inequity?</p></speech>

I will try to be brief.  On the climate action plan, in terms of short-term actions progress has already been made on spending almost &euro;1 million per day on cycling and walking.  That needs to be embedded further.  In addition, demand management and the result of the pandemic in terms of working from home, as Mr. Murphy mentioned, is very important.  It is important because it has been acknowledged internationally that looking at 2030 is not the right way forward.  We need to look at 2050 and look at 2030 and 2040 as the way-posts to decarbonisation.  To do that, we will need better evidence of what we can do with avoid and shift.  The estimates in the literature vary from a 20% to 50% reduction in emissions in terms of avoid and shift.  There is potential that that will be higher in Ireland because our population growth is estimated and it is the higher population projection of 6.7 million.  That could be higher.  We do not know.  We do not have the evidence.</p> <p>  In terms of cost-effectiveness analysis, relying only on such an analysis is not appropriate to understanding systemic transformations.  It gives one the results and the implications in terms of the cost per unit carbon that is reduced but it does not answer any of the equity questions.  It usually involves a forecast rather than alternative scenarios that explore avoid and shift so it is necessary but not sufficient.</p> <p>  In terms of pricing, I agree with Mr. Murphy.  There is a conclusion in the literature that pricing is not enough.  Carbon pricing is a supplemental measure that can prevent rebounds if the price of fuel comes down but the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its transport chapter were very clear.  We need to do the systemic long-term changes, with 2030 and 2040 changes supporting that, and carbon pricing can assist.  It is not one's first measure no more than electric vehicles.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Bruton for his questions.  As I indicated earlier, some changes that would really help in achieving the reductions would be that roadmap, that translation of the national RES-E, the 70% by 30%, and what will come after that, targets into more regional and county specific allocations, particularly in the context of onshore renewable energy deployment probably being, in the short- to medium-term sense, a much more cost effective solution <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the longer-term offshore solutions.  That is important to address.<br/><br/>Pricing is very important in terms of shifting behaviour.  In terms of the way we build housing currently, the cost on the development side in respect of greenfield land can be much lower than in an urban or brownfield context, even though, in a greenfield context, it costs the State and the taxpayer a lot more to service it from an infrastructural perspective.  Brownfield locations very often having access to existing infrastructure.  Pricing and the price of land and how we get that shift towards brownfield development are important instruments.<br/><br/>With regard to compact development, I agree absolutely with the Deputy that community benefit and, indeed, development contribution schemes are mechanisms in the planning Acts that could be used more in the context of ensuring that local communities see the benefit from the regeneration of their areas.  Again, in terms of the link between local area plans and national policy, that is something we will be paying very close attention to once many of the local area plans are reviewed into next year and in the years beyond and the current round of city and county development plan reviews are completed.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions as I am conscious of the time.  The first is to Dr. O'Mahony.  I am interested in his opinions on the potential for the expansion of rail.  There are a number of proposals for expanding and improving the services and the infrastructure but many of them fail to meet the cost benefit analysis threshold of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Does he believe our tools for assessing these projects are suitably robust to appreciate and estimate the true value of rail?</p> <p>  The second question is to Mr. Cussen.  I ask him to speak to his powers of enforcement or the opportunity to improve the policy or regulatory or legislative tools available to deliver on the national planning framework or the compact proposals.  He mentioned a number of pieces in his opening statement.  He touched on the national brownfield and infill development land register, the Land Development Agency Bill, the vacant and derelict sites legislation and also the dispatch of litigation.  He might comment on those matters.</p> <p>  Finally, will he expand on the point in terms of renewable energy?  He mentioned the need for the updated wind energy guidelines, which is something I have raised repeatedly with the Minister.  I see communities in conflict with planners on a regular basis in respect of renewable energy.  Where does he see the opportunity to resolve that with his proposal for a spatial plan?</p></speech>

That is a very interesting point.  It is absolutely crucial.  In Ireland, we are using time horizons of our cost-benefit analysis that are short.  We are using discount rates that are very high for a wealthy country.  What that means in terms of an actual cost benefit analysis is that it will devalue the benefit of a mitigation project, which is something that improves a situation and reduces emissions, and also devalue the cost of a project such as a road that increases emissions.  The way we are applying our system currently is directly biased towards emissions intensive and low sustainability projects because of the way we set up our cost-benefit analysis.</p></speech>

Regarding our powers of enforcement, the way the legislation works is that we independently assess the plans of the local authorities by reference to the requirements of the legislation, the national planning framework regional and spatial economic strategies, and various guidelines and policies set out by the Minister and the Government that are relevant to planning.  At a strategic level we determine the fit between what the local authorities set out in their plans and that broader context.  If we feel they are broadly up to the mark, we will support those plans.  If we feel there are gaps or breaches of that regulatory and policy framework, we will set that out in our statutory observations, which include recommendations and which effectively have to be followed through, and other observations, which may cover more detailed points.  If the local authority does not follow our recommendations, we have the option to recommend to the Minister the use of his or her power under section 31 of the Act to direct the local authority to take such steps as are necessary to close that policy breach.  That is just how the enforcement process works.  As for some of the references in my statement to, for example, the brownfield register and some of the other areas such as that, we are engaged in research programmes and in constant dialogue with our parent Department and local authorities on how that can be done, particularly regarding the use of cutting-edge geographic information systems, GIS, and we have some ideas about that.</p> <p>  Yes, it is very important to progress the wind energy guidelines.  From constant engagement with both the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I understand that is a top priority, and I think that will be seen before too long.  The addition of the roadmap in terms of how the RES-E targets will be delivered and the relevance of that at a local authority level also create the opportunity for community participation in some of those projects.  We have seen very good practice in Ireland of community renewable energy projects, especially in wind, and that should be looked at.</p></speech>

I have just one question for Mr. Cussen.  It concerns local development plans.  In my home county the restrictions Louth County Council is imposing on the development plan and the criteria for one-off rural housing are too severe.  I am from Dundalk.  The goal is to try to push people in rural County Louth into, say, an urban centre in Dundalk.  There are about 40,000 people and the goal is to try to expand that to 80,000 over the next 20 years, according to the chief executive.  In Mr. Cussen's view, is there a compromise ground?  Would it be something like serviced sites in rural areas where there can be much smaller urban settlements and where people can continue to live in rural Ireland and are not forced to move perhaps 20 km into the next largest urban centre?</p></speech>

The Senator might note, however, that there is some strong content in the national planning framework relating to that, in particular the putting in place of a programme that would in effect incentivise or enable the coming forward of brownfield and regeneration opportunities in smaller towns and villages, so the very alternative he is talking about is there.  I think many people who choose, in effect, the rural settlement option are often very interested in the option of being able to locate in a smaller town or village, particularly if self-build site options etc. are available at modest cost with the infrastructure laid out.  Going back to our public awareness brief, we raised this in our sponsorship of one of the "Eco Eye" series which looked at this very topic and how some local authorities, especially Tipperary County Council, have been very proactive in this space.  There are certainly some opportunities to look at those examples, and we are very happy to engage with Louth County Council on how to square that circle or address that dilemma in a positive and proactive way.</p></speech>

I will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  The first is to Dr. O'Mahony.  In his opening statement I think one of the very first sentences concerned the decommissioning of our rail system throughout the 20th century.  Part of that happened where I am from.  I am from west Cork and I represent Cork South-West.  There was the west Cork railway, as it was called.  It went from Cork through to Bandon and Enniskeane and on to Bantry and extended right out to the west, with branches off to Clonakilty, Courtmacsherry and other areas.  It must have been an amazing thing to witness.  However, if I were to stand up in the D&aacute;il tomorrow and call for a return of the west Cork railway and ask for it to be rebuilt, I would be laughed out of the Chamber.  A lot of the old rail lines - in this instance almost 100% - have been taken back into farmland, so the process of starting up a project such as this would be described as pie in the sky by many.  My question for Dr. O'Mahony is this: how do we get to a point where this becomes a more real conversation that is not one of dreams and unachievable aspirations but one that may be achieved?  As he has rightly stated, we have a road network but the N71 is not fit for purpose.  In non-Covid times it is absolutely logjammed because of the amount of vehicular traffic on it.  A railway would go a long way towards relieving that pressure and reducing carbon emissions.  What is the best approach in that regard that would make this a more realistic proposal?</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. O'Mahony as well.  He mentioned roads and road building, but would he not agree that certain road infrastructure does have a place in terms of the vibrancy of our towns and villages?  Mr. Cussen spoke a lot about "Eco Eye".  It recently featured a piece on Clonakilty and how it was held up as a model for how things should be done in terms of public realm works and giving people back public spaces.  Clonakilty happens to be my home town.  One of the things that was mentioned-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#H01000"><p>All right.  I feel like I have not been given as much liberty as everyone else, but that is fine.  A big part of how that happened was that we have a southern relief road built.  Some towns are crying out for relief roads to take that big volume of traffic from the town centre which chokes up the town, allowing town centres to take back their public space for pedestrians and footfall.  That is a really important question.</p> <p>  I have one more question for Dr. O'Mahony about schools.  The busiest time in most of our towns and villages is school time, when there is mayhem and traffic runs.  Can public transport play a role, even within our smaller towns of 5,000 or 6,000 people, in the form of pickups in different estates to take that volume of traffic away from towns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.451" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#H01100"><p>The rail question is an interesting one.  It is a reflection of where we are that it sounds outlandish to propose something that could be hugely beneficial to the public good.  That is because we have essentially run down the system for decades upon decades, and it is now almost a cultural thing that it is not regarded as a viable option.  I would suggest that in the climate action plan we need to see a commitment to a study on transformation of spatial planning and of mobility to see what is plausible and to see all the implications and costs.  Then a politician can make a claim of a desirable policy without it being pie in the sky because there is some evidence and analysis to back it up.</p><p>It is very important that in the next climate action plan we look not just at short-term measures but also at really improving our evidence base.</p><p> Of course roads have a role.  I am not advocating that we get rid of cars.  What I am saying is we need to re-tip the system away from cars because they are damaging many parts of the public good that we value, such as our well-being, our economy and emissions.</p><p> It is sensible to look at school and public transport.  I am old enough to remember when I used to always walk and cycle, partly because there were fewer cars on the road.  It is also important to think of how we would look at active modes, which are good for children's health, whereby we have segregated cycle lanes in all towns that children can use to get to school and then also look at the public transport options.  The cheapest and healthiest way of doing it is to start with walking and cycling.  I encourage the use of the hierarchy of a wide shift to active modes and then public transport.</p></speech>

This is a topic I could speak about all day but I will not.  I know the Chair will make sure that does not happen.  As a representative of an urban area, I want to ask Dr. O'Mahony and Mr. Murphy about the Dublin bikes scheme, which was referenced in the opening remarks.  It has been a great success and it has provided that shift.  Unfortunately for the region of Dublin, there has not been a bike sharing scheme to cover the entire area.  This presents limitations to the benefits one can enjoy from this type of scheme.  Will the witnesses touch on the regionalisation of bike and car sharing schemes and the benefits that would accrue from them?</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Cussen.  I thank him for his opening statement and remarks.  With regard to the guide to the planning process and the document he gave to us in advance of this meeting, I compliment his office on the information that has been given to the public about the planning process.  The new leaflets are very beneficial and I compliment everyone involved.  In saying this, recently we have witnessed a large volume of strategic housing developments, which I hope will come to an end quite shortly.  Mr. Cussen spoke about sustainable planning.  Does he have enough resources to deal with the large-scale developments, which, it has to be said, are mainly infill sites in urban areas?  I am interested to hear his thoughts on this.</p> <p>  Mr. Cussen also spoke about the role and responsibility of the regional assembly.  Taking in context the role of the regional assembly, and of the councils with regard to the climate action plans that each local authority is working through, what is Mr. Cussen's view of how we could reform or strengthen their role in all of this?  At times, local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have their own individual climate action plans and on top of all of this is a regional strategy.  I know they are all meant to intermingle at various levels but I find it cumbersome.  Mr. Cussen might touch on this.  Mr.  Cussen also mentioned the brownfield land register and that it is his intention to have it complete.  By when will this be done?</p></speech>

Specifically on the Dublin bikes scheme and car sharing, car sharing has usually been private so local authorities can assist in support of it but in practice it has been more private.  The Dublin bikes scheme is a little bit different from the schemes in other European countries because we have basically required it to pay for itself.  If we look at the emissions reduction per euro spent on it, it is very low.  It has all sorts of public good benefits because cars are taken off the road and public health is improved.  It is a very cheap way of getting around.  I was quite sceptical of it at the time.  I remember people saying they expected the bikes to end up in the Grand Canal.  It has been fantastically successful and must be applauded, and it needs to be extended.</p> <p>  Many of these measures, and this is also true of rail, and Mr. Cussen mentioned serviced sites and achieving compact growth, have a cost element.  We need to look at what these potential costs are and come up with innovative arrangements to finance them.  Finance is very important and was given a section of the transport chapter of the EPA's report.  I agree with the Deputy 100% that we should be looking at regionalising a bike share scheme and pushing car share schemes.  They are very sensible measures that do not have a huge financial or fiscal footprint but in some cases we may need to look at whether it is possible to give more public subvention or whether we can look at innovative financing arrangements.  It is also important that there is leadership from politicians to push and say that it is hugely beneficial to the public good and that they want it for the people of wider Dublin, Limerick or Cork.   We must ask whether we can push this through, such as through drawing down new funding to support walking and cycling.</p></speech>

That is great feedback and I appreciate it.  I will pass it on to the team.  We hope to do a lot more on this, including videos.  We will do further leaflets.  Many ordinary people often find it somewhat difficult to understand or fathom the workings of the planning process.  What we want to try to do in terms of our public awareness is to dispel some of those myths and put better information into the public's hands on how they can really influence the planning process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a number of questions.  It is fair to say the strategic housing development process has put all the various strands, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities, under a lot of pressure, particularly in terms of resources.  Perhaps it was an initiative to jump start the assembly of planning consents, which had almost completely withered away after the banking crash.  As the Government has clearly signalled, it will run its course in the very near future.  This may allow some reorganisation of resources.  To this point, the Deputy mentioned the regional assemblies.  Certainly they have more potential in delivering a shared service or a collective approach in co-ordinating the work of local authorities.  There is some evidence of this already happening through the climate action regional offices, which, in effect, work across a number of local authorities.  There is certainly a very strong case for more on this, as is referenced in my statement.</p> <p>  To clarify one point on the brownfield register, it is something for the Government to progress.  I was merely making the point that it would be really helpful in measuring progress to achieve the existing brownfield development targets in the national planning framework.  We are doing some research to support this if work on it is prioritised in the very near future.</p></speech>

Paris is going in an equal direction as is Amsterdam.  This does seem to be the way cities are going.  If we want more people to live in the cities we need to make them more liveable.  This means reducing a lot of congestion and reducing the amount of air pollution that comes from freight, which is powered by compressed natural gas.  It also means looking at the issue of night flights in Dublin airport, which are under consideration, and the impact they will have on people living in these urban areas.</p> <p>  On the point on rolling out rail, we should always analyse various scenarios of what might be beneficial in terms of the climate benefit and the benefit to the Exchequer.  As I understand it, Irish Rail has an ambitious plan to expand many suburban connections throughout the country.  They need to be pursued as quickly as possible.  We also have the need to roll out charging infrastructure as quickly as possible, particularly to decarbonise freight which, as I said, cannot be switched to public transport.</p><p>An additional level of investment in expanding rural rail should be examined but we should be prepared to not like the answer much if it comes back that electrification of the car fleet is cheaper.  The cost of installing new rail lines is not getting any cheaper, whereas the cost of electric vehicles is.  Second, we certainly should not delay the necessary investments in charging infrastructure and suburban rail while we study further development of rail in Ireland.  </p></speech>

On overall strategy and thinking, has there been examination of the general outlook as a result of the pandemic?  Anecdotally, there is a suggestion that people want to live in less densely populated areas.  According to the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, people seem to want to move from the more densely populated urban areas to more rural areas.  Does that have an impact on what the planning framework is trying to achieve?  Could Dr. O'Mahony talk to us about that?</p> <p>  I represent a broadly rural community.  What will the rural village of the future be like?</p> <p>  It is good to hear from Mr. Cussen that there is engagement with the local authorities and their members.  Will he comment generally about their preparedness for what is coming down the track?  It seems to me, from talking to local authority members, that they are now starting to realise the implications for them and for the work they have to do.  Can Mr. Cussen give the committee some measurement of where they are at in terms of their acceptance of it or otherwise?  Notwithstanding what we have to do on the transport side, there are real concerns - returning to Dr. O'Mahony's point on the quality of life issue for people, which is what we need to be about and should be the central focus - about what those homes of the future will look like.  </p> <p>  The witnesses should comment on the lack of willingness by local authorities to invest more heavily in addressing the dereliction that exists in rural villages and towns.  I see local authorities across the country which would much rather buy a site on the edge of a village or town and build 20 or 25 local authority houses - this is not coming from private investors, but local authorities - rather than looking through each village and realising that there are 35 or maybe 40 derelict buildings that could be brought back to use.  While it is more expensive and more labour intensive, it seems to be the appropriate route to take.</p></speech>

There have often been up to 200 members tuning in on webinars and staying for the duration of the two hours or two and a half hours.  There is certainly an appetite out there.  It is an appetite that one can find articulated more among the urban members and younger members, that is, some of the newer entrants into the ranks of local government members.  There are 949 councillors and in the last local election in 2019, there was a turnover of just over a third.  There is a section among the members which is still coming to grips with this and trying to work through its implications.  I am strongly of the view, however, that the continued rolling out of our training programme, as well as that of the climate action regional offices, which is under way at present, is crucial in reaching out to each and every member.  The last analysis by the Association of Irish Local Government, which represents councillors across the country, showed that in some local authority chambers, there is participation by up to 80% of members in at least one of our training sessions.  These are positive indicators of the level of engagement but we have a lot of progress to make, particularly in respect of understanding some of the practical issues the Senator raised.  That sense of a lack of willingness by local authorities to tackle dereliction goes to the very heart of the matter.  There is criticism of the slow pace of progress in the housing capital programme but when one looks more closely at some of the questions which the parent Department often asks of local authorities about why they are progressing in a particular way, it can be because the Department is raising the very point the Senator has raised.  Sometimes, the questions that come down from the centre to the local authorities, as a means to perhaps try a bit harder, are sometimes taken as criticism of the four-stage housing programme.  However, there are some local authorities which are very proactive in this space.  Members should consider Monaghan County Council and the Dublin Street regeneration in Monaghan town.  That is a local authority that really has started to look much more assertively at how it can itself be an agent of regeneration and renewal in its towns.  That is something about which our reviews programme will examine and disseminate a broader awareness across the sector.  The Senator also raised an important point about quality of life and what the villages and towns of the future could and should look like.  Some of the media pieces we sponsored are trying to highlight that.  We will do more work on that and I will be very happy to follow up with the committee on this.</p></speech>

Something that comes through quite strongly in how we approach mitigation, transition and transformation is that we really need to think about the future of our country in how we deliver well-being sustainability.  It is not about how we deliver transport or how we look at agriculture but about starting with a strong concept that can be brought through the analysis and then ultimately to the political decision making.  That is really important.  We do not have a model that allows us to do that and to look at the real win-wins.</p> <p>  On whether preferences have changed during the pandemic, it is very likely that they will.  People are reacting to what is almost a traumatic occurrence in how we live our lives.  Some people may want to push out further away from towns and villages.  It may push towards more dispersed housing and that is problematic because living with the pandemic is something that in its extreme impacts is something that goes on for a relatively short time in the context of our long history.  This will pass and then we are back to the same issues.  </p> <p>  To return to well-being and sustainability and how we can give an idea of a positive future, Senator Dooley mentioned rural Ireland.  We need to consider how the cores of villages can provide all the services, potential employment opportunities and provide affordable housing and affordable rents.  These are the big issues that we need to deal with to get a handle on this because otherwise, we will feel as though we are taking things away from people.  To answer this question appropriately, it is necessary to look at win-wins, which means starting with well-being and sustainability and examining how to really change things fundamentally to deliver better outcomes.  </p></speech>

We all agree there is a need for urgent transformation of public priorities.  Dr. O'Mahony mentioned rail.  Should we look at rail electrification on a similar scale as the weight we gave to rural electrification?  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned trains earlier.  There is currently discussion of electrifying the trains to Maynooth but Kilcock is literally only a stone's throw away.</p><p>A cost-benefit analysis might show it is not worth doing now, but it will be worth it.  There is no doubt that the train line will be electrified as far as Kilcock.  Why not do it now?</p><p> I appreciate the comments of Mr. Murphy.  He did not talk in the abstract.  He said he does not intend to have a car.  My son never intended to have one until he had a child.  Due to the fact he lives in north Kildare, he has had to succumb to having a car.  It goes back to the lack of planning.  We do not have a history of urban planning in Ireland.  We need a sense of urgency around that.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Cussen.  I was a councillor in Kildare County Council before being elected as a Deputy.  He said there is nothing worse than sprawling housing estates.  There is nothing worse than sprawling housing estates with one way in and out.  Somebody who lives at the back of such an estate has to travel a significant distance to get to a school that is just behind his or her wall.</p><p> I mentioned that we do not have a long history of urban planning.  I know Mr. Cussen only has an oversight role.  The planners in Kildare County Council were interested in this as well.  When we are planning cities and villages, we should not hand all of the power to developers.  Local authorities could plan how a town or city is going to expand and ensure every road goes somewhere.  We are trying to introduce permeability into estates, but no estate wants to have a breakthrough.  They do not want lanes and so on.  I appreciate that Mr. Cussen has an oversight facility and I know there are difficulties in terms of joined-up thinking.  Does he believe that communities should drive the systemic transformation that we need for the future?</p></speech>

We know from the statistics that 50% of journeys made in this country are under 2 km and a very large proportion of those journeys are done by private car.  Those figures come from the national travel survey from the CSO.</p> <p>  The points the Deputy has raised are important in respect of how residential areas are laid out.  As somebody who is familiar with the north Kildare area and the issues she has raised, I can also point to examples of sophisticated thinking about permeability, the provision of pedestrian access and creating shorter routes to walk children to school rather than a family member feeling he or she has to drive because it is the only way round.  I know of places where that was achieved, permitted, approved and developed.  As soon as such places opened up, things became very contentious.  They are sometimes politically contentious issues. </p> <p>  It is important that the political process shows leadership at local and national level on how things are connected.  When there are good local area plans and urban design, and all of that has been built into the process, including cycling and pedestrian networks, it is important that the political system stands firm in maintaining those linkages in the face of opposition that might come from a particular group which might not like such a plan.  It is important that there is integrity in the process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#L00500"><p>I will comment more broadly on the issue of economic sustainability and, in particular, what we are doing to our rural communities in response to the point made by Senator Dooley.  We have discussed our current model.  We can sum it up by pointing out that we import most of our energy from abroad for our transport system and we concentrate most of our employment in big cities.  If we do things right in transforming our transport system, we will be able to upend that in two ways.  First, we can move a lot more manufacturing, even for batteries, to Ireland.  Science Foundation Ireland is sponsoring some exciting work via Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research, AMBER.  Battery factories are opening up in other parts of Europe that previously lost employment.  We should be targeting that in Ireland.  Second, we will have an abundant amount of renewable electricity in Ireland.  From 2030 onwards, the SEAI suggests that we will have more than enough for what we need in Ireland.  It is not inconceivable that from the 2030s onwards we can produce zero-emission jet and shipping fuels in Ireland.  That can take place in areas around the Shannon which have had low employment in recent years.  This is what we should be looking for when we talk about transforming our economy and transport system, and doing both together.  This can be a powerful driver of employment across Ireland.  In our next economic recovery, we should always prioritise a model which disperses employment across Ireland as much as possible.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their brilliant contributions . Most of my questions are for Mr. Murphy.  He referred to Scania and its move away from fuels towards electric freight, and the fact that the EU has a new hydrogen strategy.  From an Irish perspective, should we consider hydrogen from an energy storage basis rather than for freight, rail or anything like that?  Would it be misguided to go down that road?</p> <p>  I refer to shared mobility services.  As someone who spent a lot of time in Brussels and Europe for five years, I realised that one can get from a train to a bus and park one's bike.  One of the issues in Ireland is that we do not have a joined-up approach.  In Ghent or Leuven one will see hundreds of bikes.  People are able to cycle to a point and then get a train to the city to go to work.  We always hear that cities like Dublin are very old.  There are lots of older cities in Europe that have such schemes.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Murphy could give us some examples of cities which have done shared mobility really well.  Even though we have a history of one-off developments, perhaps people can drive a car to a point and park and then get public transport or live close enough to work to be able to cycle.  How do we join up the transport system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#L00800"><p>There is a debate about hydrogen in Europe.  We should ramp up it up.  Green hydrogen should be produced from excess renewables in Ireland.  The question is where we put hydrogen once it has been produced.  I am not an expert on electricity grids or heating.  There is a role there.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, it does not make sense in cars and vehicles.  It is too expensive - it is more costly than batteries.  It makes a lot of sense in shipping and aviation because those modes of transport do not have low-carbon alternatives.  One cannot put a battery in a plane because it would be too heavy.  Likewise, they are too heavy for ships.  We are an island, and rely on shipping and aviation to remain connected.  We are an island which can have abundant offshore wind.</p> <p>  Other European countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, are moving ahead with a hydrogen strategy which is producing fuels for their shipping and aviation sectors.  I wonder why we are not doing that in Ireland.  As I understand it, the programme for Government has a commitment to a hydrogen strategy.  It is very important that this is set up.  It is important that we are incredibly optimistic about the employment potential that can bring to all parts of Ireland.</p> <p>  On the Senator's final point on shared mobility, it comes back to not seeing this as a case of public transport versus private cars.  There is a grey space in between where, as she said, there is shared mobility.  Twenty years ago, we did not have the option of using an app or a website to book time in private cars and book cars in advance.  It is now possible to do so.  The International Transport Forum said two years ago that Dublin can meet most of its mobility needs with 2% private car ownership.  We can be a lot more exciting.</p> <p>  I share the Senator's enthusiasm for how Brussels has evolved over the years.  There are ample examples of such development around Brussels.  It is about finding the right role for public transport and making sure people have access to it when they need it.</p></speech>

It is also his area of expertise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tadhg O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#L01000"><p>On cities, in response to Senator Boylan there are lots of examples of cities that have been successful.  Seville is one such city.  It moved from a very low base in terms of cycling and for a relatively small amount of investment managed to ramp up its level of cycling.</p><p>It is also important that this links up.  We often call it the first, last or only mile because it links up directly with public transport.  With regard to the examples of Vienna, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, there are lots of more established cities as well.  The sustainable urban mobility plan process can be used to really empower that kind of positive change.  It comes back to an issue to which Deputy Cronin referred a moment ago.  Is it something that is not relevant or possible now?  Transformation is fundamentally about thinking about how we get to desirable outcomes.  It is not about predict and provide or saying there is a problem and let us react to it.  We need to think long term, have 2030 to 2040 as the way-post to that and then consider how we can really ramp up walking and cycling and how one links that with public transport, which was also mentioned by Mr. Murphy, because public transport can facilitate walking and cycling and <i>vice versa</i>.  It involves that systemic aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021022300002#M00300"><p>Those were very interesting contributions.  Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan said earlier that if he stood up in the D&aacute;il and called for the reinstatement of the west Cork railway, he would be scoffed at.  I would applaud him because I think that is the future, particularly for long-term planning and freight.  We have so many trucks on our roads - dirty, big, smelly and dangerous vehicles that go up and down our roads all the time.  Back in the day, everything from coal to Guinness was transported on trains but we hardly use them for freight today.  We must think about this.  As one of the witnesses noted, we should look at financing freight and transport by railway and price and study it.  This is really important.  I do not think we should frame this as a question of whether railway is better than electric cars.  That is the wrong way to go because what we are looking at here is not just managing costs but the price we will pay if we do not get it right in terms of climate chaos.  Having to produce loads of cars at the other end of the planet regardless of whether they are made in Germany or Japan will not be good for the climate so the less of that kind of big machinery we produce, the better.</p> <p>  My next question concerns something I am passionate about, namely, free frequent public transport.  It has been introduced in Luxembourg and Melbourne in Australia and, to a lesser degree, in parts of the Netherlands.  I think it is coming up on a year since it was introduced in Luxembourg and studies are showing that it has taken a significant number of cars off the roads.  Since public transport is free and frequent and people can use it conveniently, they use it both with their bicycles and when they are walking.  They get on and off it.  This is removing cars from the roads.  To come back to cost, whatever we would pay to introduce that would be worth it given the outcome.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that.  </p></speech>

We need a holistic approach to free public transport, with price being just one aspect.  The Government has a 2:1 commitment in favour of sustainable transport and I hope this will improve the public transport system over time.</p></speech>

For many users or would-be users of public transport, the availability of a good quality service and its good performance, particularly in terms of travel time, are crucial.  We must remember that public transport is not free to provide.</p></speech>

It is very important that we improve our evidence base.  What was the second question about?</p></speech>

Again, it is a measure that could incentivise the use of public transport so it obviously has that plus.  In terms of making political decisions, again, we need the kind of analysis that allows policymakers to make informed decisions knowing who this will benefit and by how much.  All of these measures have different characters.  They may be win-wins or have trade-offs.  We need to consider that with cost being one of them.  It is sensible to consider that.  The Deputy's point that this is not just about cost is very important.  It is very difficult to cost the impact in terms of loss of life from air pollution and road traffic accidents and the cost on the economy from the drag caused by congestion.  It is the political process that needs to make those value-based decisions after we have appropriate analysis that can inform it.</p></speech>

One question is on the review of the TEN-T programme - the idea of funding new projects and looking to engage with Europe on the western rail project and those kinds of large-scale projects - while another concerns land use by local authorities and how we can look more at funding.  Again, when we look at the recovery and resilience strategy, it concerns the idea of giving local authorities not just the power but the funding they need to directly develop.</p> <p>  My three questions are really about permeability.  When we talk about compact growth, does that need to be reimagined so it is not technical density of office buildings, empty or not, but a liveable space in our cities?  It concerns the idea of the 15-minute city, about which there were comments, and permeability in terms of better use of public rights of way.  Can public rights of way - the network of laneways in our towns and the network of connections in estates that were built before intensive car usage - be reimagined so that we are not just talking about cycling and walking on the sides of roads but around other networks in respect of walking and cycling?  Could the witnesses comment on better use of that public right of way infrastructure and the possible formalisation of that?  </p> <p>  Should there be better use of environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment at a much earlier stage in the planning process so that these issues get caught, we do not have a backlog later at the judicial review level and better quality decisions are made at an earlier point?  Those are the key points I wish to make.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which are now mandated in local development, specifically SDG 11 around sustainable cities and communities and how that might be one of the imperatives or mandates for change in how we approach liveable and walkable cities?</p></speech>

The Minister of State may call on the officials to speak briefly for clarification during the meeting when a specific or technical point arises.  The officials may clarify issues for the committee.  Any follow-up questions should be directed to the Minister of State as the accountable person before the committee.  Members should ensure that questions are directed to the Minister of State rather than to anybody else.</p> <p>  I am aware that a wide range of issues will be the subject of discussion.  If necessary, further and more detailed information on certain issues raised can be sent to the clerk to the committee for circulation to members.  The committee and I wish to assist the witnesses in every way possible to ensure this meeting is beneficial for members and witnesses and that we have a good and productive session to try to get information for the general public through the committee.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making a contribution that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.  For those watching the meeting online, the Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only the Chairman and the necessary back-up team who are essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us if any technical issues arise during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I commence formal proceedings, I wish to deal with some formalities and advise witnesses on the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protections afforded to those attending in person to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss how Ireland's special education policy aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and matters arising in respect of disability issues.  I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am accompanied in this virtual setting by: Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary and head of inclusion in the Department; Mr. Eamonn Murtagh, director in the planning and building unit; and Ms Shirley Kearney, acting principal officer in the school transport section.</p> <p>  The breadth of my responsibilities and those of the officials concerned reflect the breadth of the issues highlighted by the committee in its invitation but also, perhaps more importantly, the importance that I and my Department give to the delivery of education to children with additional needs.  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  The Department has well-established structures for engaging with the partners in education and I wish to ensure that students and their families are at the heart of the education system.</p> <p>  I was pleased to see that the committee in its invitation referenced the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how our education provision for children with special and additional educational needs sits with the convention.  I have no doubt that committee members will be aware that on 3 December 2020, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, published a consultation draft of Ireland's first report to the UN under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There are education-specific references in the draft report regarding Article 24, which sets out the principal education content, and also, under the heading of Covid-19, responses to the education response to Covid-19 for school students with additional needs.  Submissions on the draft report can be made to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth until 3 March 2021.  With just a week to go until that deadline, I encourage all those with an interest in this area to offer their views and perspectives.  The report will then be finalised and submitted to the United Nations committee for the convention.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, my Department has provide this committee with several submissions in response to its request for regular briefings.  I am, of course, always happy to facilitate this and my officials will continue with this briefing until we see a full return to school for all students.  Of course, the reopening of schools remains a priority for my Department.  The first steps in the phased return of schools took place on 11 February, with special schools reopening on a 50% basis.  This was followed yesterday by the return of children in special classes at both primary and post-primary levels, comprising approximately 10,300 pupils.  This is a significant and welcome development which saw more than one third of primary schools and a quarter of all post-primary schools open for children with special education needs in special classes.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are committed to the full and safe return and sustained reopening of all schools at the earliest opportunity and we are working tirelessly with stakeholders and public health officials to make this happen.  As the committee is aware, the Government is currently finalising the living with Covid plan which will place children's education at the core of our priorities.  It is essential that, as a society, we continue to make progress in curbing the spread of the disease in order to allow all children to return to school as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I, along with all in the Government and our officials, know that the return to classrooms for students with additional needs and their families is much more than just a return to learning.  We know that some families will still have concerns about the return, and so too will school staff, but all of the decisions made by the Government since last March have been about achieving a balance between the overarching aim of protecting the health of our people and the need, among other things, to deliver services such as education in the most appropriate way for all students.  We may not always agree in politics, but I know Deputies and Senators across both Houses share the objective of wanting to see our country emerge from Covid-19 restrictions successfully and as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The Government has prioritised the provision of education and, specifically, in-class provision.  This prioritisation was not just in terms of funding the return to school last autumn, but also in strengthening school support teams following the October mid-term break to ensure schools remained open during level 5 restrictions up to the Christmas break, as well as issuing revised guidance to schools prior to Christmas in terms of supporting remote teaching and learning.  The intensive engagement with the education partners since January, when it was not possible to return to school, demonstrates the desire of the Government to see all students return to their classrooms at the earliest opportunity.  The decision last week in respect of the leaving certificate and the fact that school-related construction has been able to continue, which will ensure crucial additional capacity will be available for the new school year, are practical demonstrations of the priority and commitment this Government gives to education.</p> <p>  While ensuring that the return to in-school learning for pupils with special educational needs, SEN, can happen as quickly as possible in recognition of the fact that such pupils may find it more difficult to engage in remote learning, my Department has also put in place a supplementary support scheme to provide for home-based, one-to-one support for such pupils.  In addition, I am committed to supporting an enhanced summer programme for children with SEN in summer 2021 that is as successful as the programme provided last year.  It provided a strong basis to support students on their return to in-school learning in September 2020 following the long summer break.  It also allowed schools and educationalists to target learning loss in their students in a way that made the transition back to school easier for these students and their families.</p><p>Since my appointment, we have successfully run that expanded summer provision programme, secured a record budget of &euro;2 billion for special education, provided the resources for the creation of 1,200 additional special class places this year, and worked to put special education first as part of our school reopening.</p><p> Challenges remain and I am determined to tackle them.  The committee has highlighted a range of issues on which it would like to focus today.  My officials and I are happy to hear, at first hand, members' perspectives on these issues and to provide updates or further information where we can.  The fully remote nature of today's session is a first for me, so I hope we can work together to make the best use of our time.  I apologise in advance for any technical limitations, although I hope there will not be any.</p></speech>

Before we commence with questions, it is fair to say that the Covid pandemic of the past 12 months has shone a light on the challenges for parents and children trying to access special education in a wide variety of forums, and on the transport issue.  I wish to raise two issues with the Minister of State and hope to have an opportunity before the end of the meeting to discuss them with her.  They relate to transport, and the response from the Department to specific transport issues, and to the unavailability of school places in second level education for children with special needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State and her officials for giving of their time.  I appreciate that this is a very busy time and that an awful lot of work is being done.  Over the past 48 hours in particular but throughout recent months, we have received emails that share how difficult it is for parents at home to cope with children with special educational needs.  There has been a cycle of expectation whereby children were going back to school and then not going back to school, and that has been a difficulty.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Government concluded its negotiations in this regard yesterday.</p> <p>  For children, there have been both setbacks to their development and regression.  It is difficult to read about children self-harming or engaging in aggressive behaviour, let alone to experience it as a parent.  One of the emails to which I refer cites an example of photographs of the child at school having to be put away because it was just too traumatic for the child to look at them.  Next week will see the return to mainstream schools of children from junior infants to second class.  Ideally, we would have a timeline of when we can expect the same for those in third class to sixth class.  Could they be brought back in order that there could be special education provision for third class to sixth class in mainstream schools?</p> <p>  Finally, the 50% capacity has been difficult for parents to manage.  I would appreciate the Minister of State's views in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#C00400"><p>I understand the frustrations that families of children with special needs have had over recent months.  It has been extremely difficult for them and we can all share that concern.  I appreciate the Senator's acknowledgement that children in special classes, a total of 10,300, returned to school yesterday.  It was not before time but they have got back and that is a positive development.  The Senator mentioned that special schools are at 50% capacity.  We want to get them back to 100% at the earliest opportunity.  While I am not a member of the Cabinet and cannot make those decisions, I imagine that will happen in early March, although no decision on that has yet been made.  I hope that will be the case.  Further light may emerge following the Cabinet meeting later; that remains to be seen.</p> <p>  In the meantime, it is important that we try to look after children with special educational needs, SEN, who are in mainstream classes.  The Senator mentioned junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class.  Children with SEN within those class groups will return to in-person learning next week but there is a cohort of children who will fall outside that.  She referred in that context to third class, fourth class, fifth class and sixth class.  Again, I am not in a position to give any definitive information on when those classes will return but we hope it will be sooner rather than later, and there may be some clarity on that later from the Cabinet.  Suffice to say, the industrial relations team within the Department, under the remit of the Minister, has been in continuous engagement with our education partners, namely, parents, schools, boards of management and the unions.  One of the priorities of the Government since the outset of the pandemic has been that children with special needs will get back to school as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#C00500"><p>Last year, there was a programme of supports over the summer.  Is it intended to continue that this year or to provide enhanced programmes that may deal with setbacks in development or where there have been difficulties for families?  What is proposed for this summer?  It is important that systems be put in place.  We are anticipating the summer holidays, which will come around all too quickly.  Children will have had this period during which they have not been in school, there will be a return to school and routine and then it will be the summer holidays.  What proposals are there in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#C00600"><p>I could not agree more on the summer provision, or the July provision, for this year.  Regression has really adverse consequences for children with special needs and the summer provision is a way for them to reintegrate into a school environment.  Last year, in line with the criteria we used, pupils included those with a diagnosis of autism or of severe and profound learning difficulties, those who were in a special school or special class, those who were transitioning into a special class from early years settings to primary school, those in primary school mainstream classes who presented with Down's syndrome or who were severely hard of hearing or had a severe visual impairment, those who had a moderate general learning difficulty and those with severe emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Approximately 24,000 children were eligible for the scheme and it was its most successful year ever.  It is crucial that it go ahead this year, and it will do so.  We have expanded some of the categories and this year it will be extremely important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#C00700"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for giving us the opportunity to ask questions.  As a parent of a child with special needs, I have the personal experience that has led many constituents in my county of Clare to reach out to me.  They have explained or outlined the various challenges that each family has faced.  The experience is individual and different for every child in every family.  I appreciate that there have been many challenges in this sector, not least in the context of the reopening of schools.</p> <p>  My questions relate to the cohort of special educational needs students who still have not returned to school.  The issue was mentioned in regard to those who are in mainstream school but who are not in special classes.  I had been seeking a little more clarity on that but the Minister of State said she is not sure at this time and that the issue is involved in the review.</p><p>I want to ask specifically about meetings the Minister of State may have had with unions representing special needs assistants, SNAs, between June and December 2020.  For example, can she outline how many meetings took place between June and December 2020?  Are there special needs teachers and other staff in such settings to ensure that measures are taken in the event of schools closing again?  Is there provision there should the case numbers increase again?</p><p> My other question concerns supporting therapists in the school inclusion model and the delivery of wraparound supports mentioned by the Minister of State in the briefing document.  Specifically, it concerns speech and language therapists who have been reassigned to other duties, including contact tracing and testing.  Is the Minister of State in a position to outline the overall position regarding the impact of the reassignment of HSE staff who support the delivery of special education?  Can she outline how the challenge arising from this reassignment will be dealt with?</p><p> Following on from that, regressional behaviour has already been mentioned.  I am interested in how the educational system will be able to support positive changes in respect of regressional behaviour or any other behavioural issues that are now presenting themselves.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Wynne for her questions.  I hope that I have taken a note of all of them but if I have not, she can come back to me later.  There were quite a few there.</p> <p>  First, on contingency planning for the future, since the beginning of the pandemic there has been and is consistent engagement with our education partners at all times, including teacher and SNA unions.  The Department's actions are always guided by public health advice and obviously from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  The Department of Education is a member of the Government task force on emergency planning.  It is also a member of the national emergency co-ordination group, which is the central Government platform for emergencies.  That puts it into context.</p> <p>  There are structures in place for remote learning.  However, it is important to acknowledge, as we all would, that for some students, nothing can replace in-person, in-school education.  That goes without saying.  The Deputy mentioned regression.  One area at which the Department is looking consistently is a post-Covid world and trying to deal with the regression that students have suffered.  Obviously, the summer provision will help students with special educational needs, SEN, in particular.  None of us can escape the fact that many students have suffered adversely in the pandemic.  It is an issue the Department is looking at consistently to see if there is something we can do about it.</p> <p>  On the school inclusion model, we are looking at a wraparound service and a tailored therapeutic support.  It will involve occupational and speech and language therapists, as well as behaviour and crisis practitioners.  It will revolutionise the process for children with special needs within the school environment.  We have secured funding of &euro;2 million for the service this year, and we hope to expand it to two community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  The pilot was based in CHO 7, covering south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  There is funding in place to secure 80 speech and language and occupational therapists and 30 educational psychologists.  We are not going to step on the toes of the HSE in any way and we are working with the HSE at the moment.  This wraparound service is not in lieu of HSE therapy which falls under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a complimentary service.  We are currently recruiting the therapists for this service.  Obviously, the process has been slowed down, to a certain degree, by Covid-19.  We must be careful that the Department and the HSE are not recruiting from the same pool of therapists.  We want to ensure that there are enough therapists for everybody.  I believe that answers most of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#D00300"><p>I am in Leinster House.  Hopefully I have good coverage.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State.  I too welcome her today.  We are all particularly glad to see children with additional needs going back to school, whether it is for education, social needs, routine or inclusiveness.  It is important that we are on the right track.  That is something we need to build on.  I know we are all waiting for the living with Covid-19 plan. However, it is important to provide communication and give correct dates, and ensure that there is no confusion.  I know last time there was a bit of confusion over dates. </p> <p>  I welcome the dates that the Minister of State has announced today because it is important.  Originally, when the schools were ready to go back, we saw that within a few hours of the announcement of the reopening of applications, they were oversubscribed by a ratio of approximately 2:1.  As many parents and children were glad to get back into their normal routine, it is important to make sure that we have communications and that we open them as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Some special education settings have only ten or 12 students.  It occurs to me that partial reopening was geared towards large schools and no autonomy was offered to smaller schools.  The Minister of State might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  I also wish to raise what I am sure is a huge issue for many of us.  Parents have contacted me about SNA allocations.  It has become a huge issue, even for children going to mainstream schools who attend an autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, unit.  At present, I am working on cases from County Carlow.  We need to make sure we have enough units.  I acknowledge this is something to which the Minister of State is committed but at present, even in my area of Carlow, there are not enough places for children who need to go to school, particularly in respect of one school.  We need to find a solution to this issue and I will provide the Minister of State details of the cases I am dealing with to see if she can help me with them.</p> <p>  I also wish to discuss with the Minister of State the issue of school transport, particularly in my own area.  Holy Angels Day Care Centre is a special education school in my area.  The HSE used to insure vehicles for this facility.  It would also provide help in that if something happened with the bus, for example, it would replace it.  However, this all changed in 2009.  Since then, the cost has been borne by the facility.  The cost of insurance surprised me, as it costs approximately &euro;5,000 per year to insure one of these buses.  No additional funding or supports are given.</p> <p>  Last year, Holy Angels had to launch a fundraising appeal to add to the Lotto funding to replace its bus.  This is unacceptable.  However, even these types of issues are not just about the actual vehicle.  Individual seating for each child, which must be replaced by the children using these buses when they grow and move on, costs more than &euro;100 per seat.  Again, that is another cost these schools simply cannot afford.  Funding for escorts for these types of transport is not covered by a section 39 grant.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that.  During the Covid-19 pandemic in particular, schools had to employ additional escorts and funding was not provided.  My understanding is that no extra funding is now being given for escorts for these buses.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this.</p> <p>  The final issue is about school transport.  It is important, particularly for children who are attending mainstream schools.  Buses now pass the doors of homes with children who are in a unit in a mainstream school and who are just not getting on board.  I also the Minister of State to work on that for me.  Perhaps she could revert to me with the answers.</p></speech>

I agree with what she said around communication.  To be extra clear, I am not announcing any dates about the return to school.</p><p>I know that is the intention, but a Cabinet decision is being made today and I can confirm that there will be clarity at that point.</p><p> The Deputy referred to school buildings and smaller schools.  It is important to know that all schools can apply to a scheme for funding for emergency works if they need to reconfigure.  The sum of &euro;75 million was given to all schools so that they could reconfigure as part of the package for the reopening of schools.  It is very important that all schools know they can do that.</p><p> I am the very first Minister of State with responsibility for special education, which is good, because that is shining a light in a big way on this matter for the first time ever.  I was considerably struck by the lack of ASD units.  We are aware of that.  If we look at it in context, there has been a 235% increase since 2011.  This year there will be 1,836 special class places, of which 1,567 will be for ASD.  We are making gains all of the time.  There are supports for schools to open ASD units.  There is a special class start-up grant of &euro;6,500.  We know there is one teacher, two SNAs and six pupils in an ASD unit.  There is a furniture grant of &euro;2,500 and an ICT grant of &euro;6,700.  There are a lot of incentives for schools.  That is something we are working on as well.</p><p> I might ask Ms Mannion to respond to Deputy Murnane O'Connor&rsquo;s specific query on the insurance issue for the Holy Angels centre.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Kearney, has responsibility for the school transport unit so she might be able to give us some more detail on that.  Transport to and from disability services is outside the scope of the school transport scheme.  Ms Kearney will be able to provide some additional information on the school transport issue.</p></speech>

All transport services for special schools and special classes have fully resumed for all children who require those services.  Additional funding has been agreed by the Government for the additional hygiene and cleaning measures that are required on transport services such as PPE equipment for school transport staff.  In cases where we have provided extra services, with the implementation of 50% social distancing on post-primary services, we have provided funding for the employment of additional school bus escorts as well.  If Deputy Murnane O'Connor sends me and email, I will follow up on her query.</p> <p>  Regarding her query on buses, am I correct in saying that it is a mainstream bus but that it is a child with special needs who requires the service?  Again, all of those services resumed yesterday but if there is a specific issue, I would be more than happy to follow it up.  If the Deputy can email me the details, then I will do so.</p></speech>

The current allocation is frozen at the moment due to Covid, but schools can apply for additionality.  No school is losing an SNA at present.  The Deputy might be aware that we secured 1,000 additional SNAs this year so we are up to 18,000 in total.</p></speech>

That is great.  It is also great to be able to ask questions today.  The matter has been discussed a lot by the D&aacute;il and in the media, but I hope the committee can bring a unique focus on rights.  The Minister of State mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the outset.  Inclusive education is included in the convention but unfortunately, as we all know, that right has not been met, especially since Christmas.  We are all aware that the reality is that online learning is not suitable for most students who attend special schools.  In light of that, I welcome the return of classes and schools.</p> <p>  Families need absolute assurance on any delays or disruptions such as those that happened in January.  I will not go into transport because Deputy Murnane O'Connor touched on it sufficiently.  It probably goes for most areas in rural Ireland but parents and support organisations in my constituency of Cork South-West are concerned about the absence of services.  For example, in my constituency, people must travel for up to two hours to access basic essential services such as speech and language therapy.  The people who are availing of the service cannot stay in a closed space for a long period, so a two-hour journey becomes much longer.  They could be travelling for an essential service that takes 20 minutes, such as speech and language therapy.</p> <p>  In response to a question from Deputy Wynne on the plan to revolutionise services, the Minister of State referred to speech and language therapy as one of them, but she also referred to south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Is it just in those areas?  How was that decision made?  How were the areas chosen?  At the moment it is basically a geographical lottery for services such as speech and language therapy.  How was the decision made on where the revolutionary programme would be rolled out first and last?  Is geography considered in those decisions?  I ask the Minister of State to prioritise that question and if she has time, I have a similar question about wraparound supports.  What will the roll-out be for such services in rural areas?  The Minister of State referred to recruitment for speech and language therapy.  Is that just for south-west Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow?</p></speech>

I am aware that online learning is not suitable and that is why we have been prioritising trying to get those with special educational needs back into the classroom.  At least 50% of special schools are back.  As the Deputy said, it is not ideal that it is not 100% yet, but it is a start.  We also have special classes back.</p> <p>  On waiting times for assessments and the two-hour journeys, people often confuse me with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disability.  My remit is the school environment itself, so that would not fall under my area of responsibility.  However-----</p></speech>

The school inclusion model was a pilot project we did with 150 participating schools, 75 preschools and 75 primary and post-primary schools in those areas that I mentioned, Wicklow, Kildare and south-west Dublin.  That was only one community health organisation area.  In the budget last year, I secured money to be able to extend that to the nine community health organisation areas.  The plan is to try to roll out the programme in the coming years.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how it is decided where the next expansion will be.  Cork is a particular area of concern for the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is a very high-density area and there is a lack of places.  We have to do a lot of joined-up thinking there.  Cork may well be a runner but, obviously, I cannot say that.  The NCSE will be consulting with local SENOs on the ground and the building and planning unit in the Department to try to ascertain where the capacity is needed now and in the future from a demographic perspective.</p><p>It is not just about now; it is about the future also.  We have a five-year forecasting model in place to try to pin that down.  The officials can correct me if I am wrong, but I hope that this year we will be able to establish where the next two community health organisation areas will be.  Speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and so on will then be provided <i>in situ</i>in the school setting, in addition to whatever HSE therapeutic service children are benefiting from.  The service will complement the therapeutic service.</p></speech>

Is that part of the decision-making process for the next nine places?</p></speech>

It is not a HSE service.  It is separate.  It will be within the child's school environment.  It would depend only on how long it takes for the child to travel to the school.  Geography will make a difference.  In some pockets, such as south Dublin and Cork, there is a greater lack of places and assistance than in other areas.  Other criteria will also be taken into account, for example, how many children need the service.  There are some areas where the need for services is not as acute as in other areas.  All of those considerations will be taken into account.</p></speech>

Parents are raising a number of issues with me, one of which is contingency planning.  We had the initial lockdown last year and when the children went back there was the summer programme.  Parents are of the view that there was no contingency planning at that time for further lockdowns.  We saw this coming to the fore in January when the services were supposed to open but did not open.  Contingency planning is required in all aspects of Covid but particularly for special educational needs.  What kind of contingency planning is being done now for this year so that if another lockdown were to occur, we could see that there is a plan in place?  We have enough experience now to know what to do and how to do it.</p> <p>  Many parents have also told me that there has been very little real engagement with them.  While organisations may speak on behalf of parents, we find that parents themselves are not involved in the system.  At one of the first meetings of this committee, someone stated - I cannot recall who it was - that the lack of engagement by the Department on children with special needs and their parents had created a lot of problems.  That was probably last July or August.  At that time, the parents asked that this would not happen again but it seems to be happening again.</p> <p>  I welcome that there will be 1,200 additional school places for next year.  That is fine.  I am, however, concerned about the reassignment of staff involved in special educational needs to contact tracing.  Are all of them back doing what they should be doing?</p> <p>  Given that remote learning is very challenging for many children, why do we insist that they engage in remote learning?  This question keeps arising.  Children have a high and a low where they are in school one day and not in school the next day.  We need to get this right.  It is not easy.  We all agree that we do not have a reference point for this.  However, many parents are very angry because they are not being listened to.  I ask the Department, the officials and the Minister of State to place more emphasis on that aspect to try to make sure parents feel they are part of the solution.</p> <p> How will children catch up?  What plans are being put in place to enable them to get back to where they were previously?  It is fine to sending children back to school but they need additional help now.  Is this being planned for?</p></speech>

I know this has been an extremely difficult time for families and children.  Contingency planning is important.  It is wrong to say there has not been any contingency planning as there has been.  There is weekly engagement with all of our education partners and updated guidance on remote learning.  Remote learning is not ideal but there is no choice when the child is not back in an in-person environment.  This is why we put forward the supplementary in-home provision which will provide five hours per week over a four-week period - 20 hours in total - to try to supplement that.  This can be provided at evenings and weekends, as I mentioned.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that the Department makes decisions with its education partners, boards of management, schools, and parents representative bodies, based on public health advice.  It is not just one person making a decision.  There are many constituent parts in the education sector and we must bring everybody on board and give everybody confidence to move forward.  Obviously, people have concerns and those concerns must be addressed.  I meet AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, Family Carers Ireland and many parental representative bodies on an ongoing basis to make sure their voices are heard.  It was very important to me, as the very first dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for special education, that the voices of children with special needs would be heard in a way that they had not been before.  I believe they have been now.  Proof of that is the fact that the special schools and special classes are open.  Obviously there is more to do.</p> <p>  We spoke about regression earlier.  The Department is very aware that there has been regression.  We have the summer programme for next year.  We also have the supplementary programme and we may be in a position to expand that.  That remains to be seen but suffice to say, I will be doing everything I can to ensure we assist those children as best we can.</p></speech>

She has a very tough job in particularly challenging circumstances.  I am pleased that she has been such a strong advocate for families of children with special needs.  It has been a really tough time for them and it was not helped by all the false starts.  We all agree on that.  It is positive that they are now back to school, albeit not full time.  They are in the right place and getting the supports to which they have a right, as Deputy Cairns said.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Canney's comment that special education is an essential service.  We need to make sure we are protecting it in advance of any other potential curve balls that may come at us in the future.  I hope we will not be back in lockdown again but no matter what comes at us, we must, as a Government, ensure we protect this essential service for our most vulnerable children.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister of State has done a great deal to get all the parties involved in talks to get children back into classrooms.  It is unfortunate that children with special needs are not back at school full time.  The Minister of State stated it was her intention to get special schools back to full capacity as soon as possible.  What is her timeline or target for achieving that?</p><p> I welcome the commitment that was made to Senator Seery Kearney on the summer programme provision and thank the Minister of State for the information that she shared with us on that.  It will be hugely helpful when it comes to us playing catch up in terms of the lost resources that these kids have had in the past year at this stage.</p><p> I am interested to learn about the new special classes that are coming on-stream.  In the last budget we saw an increase in resources for new special classes.  It was on foot of that the Minister of State had written to 39 schools in the south Dublin area.  Can she give us an update and are there protected timelines for that?   </p></speech>

However difficult this has been for all of us, as public representatives, for the families of children with special needs it has been immeasurably more difficult and challenging for them.  That is what motivates all of us, even everybody on this committee, so that we can be a voice for them.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to timelines and deadlines.  What I can say about special schools, and obviously subject to the Cabinet making a decision on it later, it is likely that they will move to 100% in early March.  That seems to be the indication but I add the caveat that it is a decision that the Cabinet must make.</p> <p>  On section 37A, we wrote to 39 schools last June and 14 of them were withdrawn on the basis that there was consideration of their representations, submissions and there were on-site inspections.  Those 14 schools would not have been taken off the list unless there were very extenuating valid and exceptional reasons that they could not facilitate a special class.  The schools often genuinely do not have the space, particularly in high-density areas.  Ten schools remained and they have received a third notice that was issued on 14 December of last year.</p> <p>  Since the introduction of section 37, 21 additional special class cases have been confirmed and there is a potential for another 66 special class cases by September 2021.  For the first time I secured a specific commitment from the building and planning unit of my Department, when I was recently appointed, concerning every new school.  Sometimes I think that the significance of this has not got the attention that it should because it is a really big decision that the Department made, and the right decision.  One might ask why was the decision not made before but at least it has been made.  I secured that every school from now on will have special facilities and special education needs, SEN, rooms unless local circumstances dictate otherwise and that there is no need.  That is a really big commitment because we want to get out of a situation where we are perennially trying to scramble for special class places.  The forecasting model will help as well.  As the Deputy will know, we announced the opening of Scoil Colm in Crumlin that will help towards the development of special schools as opposed to special classes.  There have been a lot of positive developments but obviously we have a huge amount of work still left to do.               </p></speech>

I refer to a ten-year-old in an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in Cavan.  He has an occupational therapist report that recommends a laptop with the very specific software of Englishtype junior and Clicker 8.  However, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, has refused to recommend this to the Department, which I think directly contravenes Article 24.2(e) in that the supports this child needs are being denied.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the role of a SENO. Should it be to ensure that the educational needs of children are met or somehow safeguard the Department in terms of spending money?  I ask because this is not the only instance but one example.  Perhaps I can personally raise the issue with the Minister of State after this meeting, if possible, to further the process.</p> <p>  Children in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and, indeed, elsewhere are forced to travel out of their areas to attend schools that meet their needs whether that is a special school or an ASD unit.  Earlier Deputy Higgins mentioned the section 37A process.  Under that process schools are asked to indicate if they have space for a unit.  I know that many schools have space but they do not want to countenance having a unit in their school so are not indicating that they have space.  Can the process be strengthened to ensure that all schools seriously consider having a unit in their schools?  My colleague, Deputy Chris Andrews, has raised the issue of the lack of special class places and ASD unit spaces in the south Dublin area, which is very stark.  The Department spends hundreds of thousands of euro every day transporting students from their localities to schools that are perhaps half an hour or an hour's journey away.  That money would be better spent providing additional units.  As the Minister of State knows and we all know, we need additional units in schools but many schools have refused to countenance this.  Is the Minister of State working directly with, say, the Catholic patron bodies?  Many of our schools still operate under a Catholic ethos and many of our schools that have units are community or DEIS schools, but many of the Catholic schools are not.  Has there been an increase in the number of schools that will include a unit?</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that all new builds require an ASD unit.  Will that be sufficient to meet the need?  I would love all siblings to attend at the same school, where possible, but if there is not a unit or special class to meet the needs of those with additional needs then that may not be possible so new schools might be needed.  I am in contact with Enable Ireland that has said it has been inundated with the number of new assessments being requested.  That indicates, in terms of planning for the future, that there will be a huge need for more units at both primary and secondary schools and, indeed, for services post-secondary school as well so a lot of planning is needed.</p> <p>  The forecasting model has been mentioned.  What is the latest National Council for Special Education, NCSE, prevalence rate?  In 2016, it was 1.55%.  Is there an up to date figure available?  It is 3.3% in the North so there is quite a difference, which I wonder about.</p> <p>  Will Down's syndrome children be included in the summer provision?  I ask because there was some confusion concerning that last year.     </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#G00400"><p>I will do my best to answer the many questions asked and the Deputy might please let me know if I do not.  Down's syndrome children were included last year and they will be included this year.</p> <p>  Arising from the comment about Deputy Andrews, I recently met representatives of Autism Equality Dublin Bay on the lack of special class places in Dublin 2 and 4.  There is a process outside of the section 37A.  The National Council for Special Education liaises and engages with schools on special classes and all of the time outside of the section 37A.  The section 37A process is a very valid mechanism and has its benefits but it should only really ever be used as a last resort.  However, I will use it if I have to.  There will be 1,200 places next year.</p> <p>  Deputy Tully mentioned a particular ASD unit.  Earlier I mentioned that there has been a considerable growth of 235% since 2011.  There will be 189 ASD special classes this year and that is out of 197 new special classes in total.  As I said, there will 1,200 special class places but 189 of those are for ASD pupils, 12 are early intervention, 113 are primary and 64 are post-primary.</p> <p>  The culture and ethos of a school is really important.  It has been hard to determine, I think historically, whether it is simply a lack of places or whether schools do not want to take a class.  That culture and ethos is changing slowly.  Obviously we try to encourage patron bodies and other organisations and schools to voluntarily open a special class where it is needed rather than trigger the section 37A mechanism, which we only want to do where we absolutely have to.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the technology, I think, for a ten-year-old boy.  There is an assistive technology scheme.  Some &euro;100 million has gone into that.  There are ICT grants available for schools as well.  The SENO can liaise through the NCSE, which, in turn, engages with the Department if there are any particular issues.  I can certainly talk to Deputy Tully about that particular case off-line another time if she wishes.</p></speech>

The Minister of State and I spoke on Friday during my Commencement matter.  The Minister of State is well aware of the families that are struggling more than ever, and behind closed doors much of the time, with their children with special needs and additional needs.  I will not repeat the valid and important points around technology and transport other members have raised.  With regard to the 50% capacity of special needs schools, is it possible to get an update on when they will return to 100%?  Will it be in line with the mainstream schools?</p> <p>  Will there be a sector-specific educational, social or even medical study done of the impact of school closures and the not-full opening of the special schools and classes looking back on all we have learned?  Going back to what Deputy Canney spoke about, how do we catch up?  Is there a plan on how we will catch up?  How will we assist families whose children have regressed so badly?  How do we increase the supports of children with additional needs?</p> <p>  I certainly am always learning in this pandemic.  It has highlighted the areas where we all need to learn as a society and how people with disabilities have been affected disproportionately.  We have to learn and move on to a rights-based approach to our disability services.  That, I suppose, is the aim of this committee.  It is to implement the UNCRPD.  How does the Department learn from the pandemic?  Is it the case that special needs schools and classes need to be reclassified under law as essential services to make sure that they remain open?</p> <p>  Finally, the Department of Education funds the National Parents Council.  Is it possible that the Department would fund a dedicated parents council for the parents of children with special needs and additional needs, or has that been thought about?  We all are aware that children with additional needs and special needs have specific and different needs from mainstream children.  Such an advocacy group for these families would be welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#H00300"><p>I thank Senator McGreehan for her questions.  Of course, another advocacy group could be formed.  Parents form them all the time.  There are many different parental representative bodies and groups already.  I do not see any reason another cannot be set up by the parents at any time.  It would not be something for the Department to do as such but I understand what the Senator is talking about in terms of a point of contact for parents.  We liaise with parents all the time.  I suppose another role of the NCSE is to liaise at a grassroots level with parents of children who are struggling with their needs and, indeed, the other advocacy organisations I mentioned earlier, AsIAm and Down Syndrome Ireland, and other representative groups.</p> <p>  In regard to the 50% capacity returning to 100%, I will welcome the decision when it happens.  Hopefully, it will happen sooner rather than later.  As I said earlier, it will be subject to Cabinet approval but we are hoping that it will be in early March.  It will be an important development for students in these schools, because they have the greatest level of need, if we can at least get them back to a full routine and a full structure.</p> <p>  In terms of regression, as I mentioned earlier, the summer provision will help.  That is a practical support.  There are other supports that we give from a financial perspective but that is a practical support.  The summer provision is primarily about the children but it also allows some sort of respite for the families, particularly when they have had extended periods at home looking after their children.  I must emphasise the supplementary programme also because that is a radical new departure for the Department.  It never existed previously.  It is one-to-one home support which will supplement any other learning they are getting.  It is five hours per week for four weeks, which is 20 hours.  Any unused hours can be used by 30 April, including during the Easter holidays.  There is scope there for families.  It is open to all students in special schools and in special classes who are those with the greatest need.  That should be of assistance also.</p> <p>  Lastly, in terms of it being an essential service, it is something I considered.  The reality is providing education is an essential service.  The difficulty is that it is not only the Department that makes the decisions.  It is everybody who makes the decisions and until all concerned are assuaged, there is no reality in going back.  The Department and everybody else takes its advice from public health advice.  The Deputy is correct that it is an essential service.</p></speech>

I have three different areas I want to get to if possible.  First, for those students who are not in a special class but who are in a mainstream class and receive resource hours, could the Minister of State outline what supplementary supports such children, for example, a child with a visual impairment or a deaf child in a mainstream class, are in receipt of?</p> <p>  Second, I want to return to the issue we talked a little about today, namely, early intervention and the lag that we might experience due to Covid.  The Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, report, which I am sure the Department is aware of, which outlined issues around unmet needs included a concern around access to early intervention.  Due to Covid disruption, there would be a significant cohort of students who may age-out of early educational intervention.  This is partly because referring a child for an assessment of need with educational issues is hampered by a difficulty as regard the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, in that some of the Act's provisions have not commenced.  I understand that overlaps a little with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's area but it also relies on school principals to do much of the referring.  The report states some of those gaps are being met by the use of the National Educational Psychological Service.  My questions in that area are as follows.  What actions are the Department taking to address the issues with and access to that early educational intervention?  What are the plans as regards children who might age-out of it due to the disruption due to Covid?  In this committee, we talk a great deal about the optional protocol, but that report also outlines that there is a lack of a robust mechanism to complain or raise concerns around issues when it comes to referring for educational early intervention.  Could the Minister of State speak to that, perhaps around what we could put in place to allow parents or the schools to report on it?</p> <p>  Could we get a brief update on those children in secondary education who are facing into the junior certificate or leaving certificate, and the supports that might be in place for them?  I am particularly thinking of those students would have been struggling with online learning already and how that might interact with State examinations.</p></speech>

They are called special arrangements or reasonable accommodations.  There are, therefore, supports in place for children with special needs who are doing the leaving certificate this year.  The junior certificate does not apply this year.  I am not sure if the Deputy mentioned the junior certificate but she may have mentioned the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  While remote learning and not attending school are not optimum for children, there are supports in place.  I mentioned these earlier and they include the supplementary programme, which will provide significant help.  This involves in-home tuition and takes place on a one-on-one basis in the evenings or at weekends.  Other than that, updated guidance has been given to schools on some of the issues that children will need assistance with.  There are key themes in the guidance documents around the role of schools, teachers and school leaders working with children with special educational needs on all of their needs.</p> <p>  It is important that schools reach out to parents and let them know what is available.  There has to be regular engagement with pupils and students.  There is a blend of guided and independent learning and tasks.  There is two-way feedback between the home and school and supports for students with special educational needs.  We are looking at focusing on special education teaching hours for students who are not going back yet.  I also mentioned the summer programme.</p> <p>  On early intervention, while this issue is not under my remit, I have raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, the concerns the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

Other members covered a number of the issues raised with us in emails by parents of children with additional needs.  They have expressed to us their immense frustration and told us of the terrible impact the prolonged school closures have had on their children and the regression they have seen.  They are seeking clarity and certainty about schools reopening and classes restarting.  They are also looking, as the Minister of State knows, for a commitment that there will not be any more on-off school closures.  I know the Minister of State has already responded on some of those issues but I would like to get greater clarity on dates and to ensure that once schools open fully - and we appreciate that special schools are already open - that children with additional needs will be able to stay in school and there will not be any more on-off approaches.</p> <p>  I ask specifically about a Labour Party proposal for a catch-up for children scheme.  We have proposed that the Government allocate &euro;100 million to structured and targeted interventions so that once schools reopen and we are, hopefully, moving out of Covid restrictions, we will need to first establish precisely what the impacts of prolonged school closures have been for children.  We must then enable structured interventions at all stages, for example, additional tuition for children whose literacy or learning has fallen back or who gave regressed in other ways.  We have seen a similar scheme in place in the UK.</p> <p>  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, announced a welcome plan this week for the reopening of pubs and nightlife after Covid.  We need to see a similar plan to address the impacts on children of prolonged school closures and the losses of everything else, such as sport, extracurricular activities, over the course of the pandemic.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies in England has suggested that the costs have been immense for children.  We have not seen anything like the level of discourse we need on that in Ireland.  I have been attending some webinars organised by the Children's Rights Alliance, which have referred to that issue but we need to see more intervention from the Government to address it.</p> <p>  I make an appeal on behalf of one specific group of parents and children I met earlier today, namely, those involved in Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland.  There are children, young adults and older adults with this condition across Ireland who have many needs.  I promised the group that I would raise in particular the needs of children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus who are seeking to access education.  There has been a real difficulty for many children in this situation who not only require SNA support but also require additional physical support such as nursing support, which has typically been provided by the HSE.  Can the Minister of State confirm that a scheme is in place to meet both the physical needs of these children, in addition to their need for an SNA, and their need to access education?</p></speech>

On the on-off approach, as the Senator described it, I cannot give any guarantees about anything because the Department takes its advice from the public health authorities.  I cannot give confirmative information about dates either.  I said earlier that the Cabinet is meeting today and there is an indication that special schools will go back to 100% capacity in early March.  That is the extent of my knowledge because I am the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion and my I am limited to that area.  The other decisions are not made by me.</p> <p>  On a catch-up scheme, one of the reasons we put in place the supplementary programme, which will be hugely beneficial, is to provide for the catch-up that children with special needs, in particular, will badly need.  Practically every member of the committee has mentioned regression.  It is a huge issue for children without additional needs, never mind for those with additional needs, and we are conscious of that.  We will probably be in a position to expand that supplementary programme at a later stage.  If it is the case that schools have to close before the end of this term or in the next term - we hope that will not happen but cannot be sure - it may well be of assistance then.  We also have the summer provision under which every child receives a progress card.  These progress cards are given to the school and when the children go back to school their teachers then know what skills they have and do not have.  That should be of significant benefit to them.</p> <p>  I understand what the Senator is saying about spina bifida and hydrocephalus and she is right that the nurses' list is provided by the HSE.  We are developing a nursing programme through the school inclusion model at a cost of &euro;1.3 million.  Hopefully that will be of assistance.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will probably think I am following her at this stage because I have been plaguing her in recent times.  I have a number of points and questions I would like to raise rather than giving a speech.  I am seeking clarification on a number of issues from the Minister of State and her officials.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the negative impacts all children, particularly those in special education, have experienced during lockdown and Covid.  Has there been any analysis of that in the Department or has any report been drawn up to analyse the empirical data and the impact in order to quantify that regression?  If such a report exists, could the Minister of State elaborate on it and, if one does not exist, is it worth giving consideration to compiling one?</p> <p>  In the case of students who, for health reasons or due to underlying health conditions, choose not to return to special education in the coming weeks, will the Minister of State clarify specifically what supports they might receive?</p><p>The Chairman mentioned in his opening comments that we are reasonably well catered for at primary level with ASD units and special education provision, but when children hit second level many parents speak of the delivery of supports almost falling off a cliff.  I recognise the massive investment that has happened over the last decade, to which the Minister of State alluded in her opening remarks.  The numbers of teachers, SNAs and ASD classes have dramatically increased.  Obviously, there is a massive demand there and I am concerned that we are not catering for it.  Deputy Cairns and Senator McGreehan mentioned facilitating ASD units.  What is the Minister of State's policy in that regard?  I can only speak about Cork county and city.  There is one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000, which has three secondary schools and not one ASD unit.  New schools are being asked to provide ASD units but existing schools have to pick up the slack and if they are not willing to do that voluntarily we have to consider a change in policy or direction.  That is just one example of one suburb in Cork with a population of 20,000 and no ASD unit in place.</p><p> My final question relates to school transport and buses.  We have a particular issue in the Cope Foundation in Cork, where buses provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann are facilitating three schools on one campus.  Those children go into their bubbles in class and remain in them, but as soon as they come back out to the buses, three cohorts of students go on the same bus.  Will the Minister of State, or one of her officials, clarify if that is still supposed to be happening?  I do not think it is.</p></speech>

We will consider putting together a report but at the moment we are dealing primarily with getting all our children with SEN back to school.  That is the priority right now but it may well merit some sort of report.  I do not believe in having reports just for the sake of them but if we felt it would achieve something and we could learn from it into the future, it is something we would consider.  I thank the Deputy for raising that.</p> <p>  Regarding supports for children who are not back in school at the moment, the supplementary programme I mentioned provides one-on-one teaching outside of school hours and at weekends.  The inspectorate also has a Covid-19 helpline, which is available for schools.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has published a document on supporting the well-being of students with SEN returning to school, which is being revised and is a very comprehensive resource.  People can contact NEPS psychologists or the NEPS office directly because the well-being of children with special needs is crucial at the moment, more so than for other children.  The NCSE has a dedicated phone line and the NCSE adviser will support SEN access during this period.  Special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are also available to support parents where children are experiencing challenges in returning to school.  Those supports will be important.</p> <p>  I will call Ms Kearney in a minute to answer the Deputy's question on the Cope Foundation transport issue.  He and I have spoken many times about Cork.  The NCSE is aware of 20 children in Cork who are not in school and who require a special school place.  They are currently availing of the home tuition scheme.  Some 116 children in the Cork area have a recommendation for a special school placement but the majority of those are currently in a special class placement.  There is much engagement going on between the Department, the NCSE, school management, the Cope Foundation and the patron of Scoil Aislinn about expanding - or not, as the case may be - to provide further places in that area.  There were a number of meetings last autumn, as the Deputy knows, and a further meeting with the Cope Foundation is planned as well.</p></speech>

We have provided reassurances that all services are operating with additional hygiene and other measures in place.  It is not logistically possible to provide separate services to separate schools and that is true throughout the country, not just with regard to the Cope Foundation.  There are currently over 2,000 vehicles operating on the special needs scheme and there are simply not enough vehicles, drivers or school escorts to provide separate services to every school.  However, all services are operating with additional measures in place, in line with public health advice.  Where those measures are in place but parents prefer not to use the transport, we have offered the option of a grant instead.  All services are operating in line with public health advice and with those additional measures in place.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has already outlined the steps the Department is taking in the area of regression and the supports being provided for children with special educational needs in order to get back to school.  One of the key messages is that the Department is acutely aware that being out of school has an impact on all children, but has a particular impact on children with special educational needs.  In returning children to school, getting those children in special schools and special classes back has been the priority.</p> <p>  As regards regression, when schools reopened in September, the Department worked very closely with stakeholders to provide guidance documents and supports to schools about how best to provide for children on their return to school and to support any learning loss that had been identified.  There are over 13,000 special education support teachers across our school system and children with special educational needs have learning plans that identify their particular learning needs.  Those teachers have worked closely with the class teachers and the special education teams in the schools to ensure that children who had particular challenges on return to school could be best supported by the allocation of those teachers to the children who most needed them.  That, supplemented by the programme the Minister of State has identified as the supplementary programme and our summer programme, is what we can do currently to support those children in the area of regression.  As the committee has clearly identified, this is an area of which we are acutely aware and we are working very closely with the stakeholders to get everyone back.  Once they are back, we are targeting learning loss in particular.  Members will also be aware that when children first returned in September, our strategies were very much about settling back in, targeting areas of particular loss and picking up on key skills to allow children to bed that in before they moved on to building on that learning.  That will be the focus again when children in special schools, special classes and mainstream schools return.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#K00700"><p>I missed a short period in the middle of the meeting so these questions may have been dealt with.  I want to talk about the issue of choice.</p><p>We have discussed the importance of ensuring those who need that direct education are able to return to school but I am wondering about a related issue in terms of choice where there are children with a disability, for example, in families which may have a high-risk member.  In many cases, the priority for the family is that the child return to school, but there are situations where the family wants to access remote learning to keep the connection with the school with a long-term view to moving back there, not moving to home schooling but looking at remote linking with the school over the next few months.  There is a concern about children being marked absent in those circumstances.  The problem is it seems to be very much on or off.  One is either in or out of school, either home schooling or in full education.  Have measures around, in certain situations, providing the option of remote learning on a temporary basis for those who seek it been looked at?</p><p> The Minister of State may have addressed the other issue.  It is around an enhanced summer programme with additional supports.  How do we look to ensure that, over June and July, we make up for lost time and try to enhance that programme?  If the Minister of State would talk a little bit more about that, I would appreciate it.  We have mentioned the issues around testing and so forth for special education staff.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

On children with high risk, in primary school there are designated teachers who will ensure continuity in learning in relation to the schools.  It is sort of home tuition to a certain extent.  Post-primary pupils are matched with appropriate subject teachers who will teach either in person at home or using technology, or maybe a combination of blended learning.  The local educational centres will also help in relation to that.</p> <p>  I mentioned the summer programme and the categories earlier on.  It will go ahead next year.  Some 24,000 children were eligible last year and I imagine it will be as big a success next year because it will be extremely beneficial for those children.  It will be enhanced in any conceivable way that we can.  All those progress report cards will go to the school they will be going on to and that continuity of learning, because of the regression these children will have had, should help in a big way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#L00300"><p>It was specifically not where the child is high risk but where there is a high-risk family member.  It is a challenging situation for families.  The system accommodates the child who is high risk but I refer to where, for example, they have a sibling or family member with health conditions.  Additional supports are needed in those situations and they seem to be falling between the cracks somewhat.  We had situations back in autumn where children were marked absent while the school was trying to accommodate remote learning.</p></speech>

If they have concerns about their health risk in the workplace, it is an anonymous consultation, their health conditions are assessed and they are advised whether it is safe to return to work or not.  They can ask for more information or even have the assessment reviewed.  That should be of benefit.  I am not sure if Ms Mannion wants to add anything to that but that is my understanding of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#L00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  On the issue of children living with family members who are high risk, we have talked about the need for children to be back in school and accessing the benefits of the school system.  In those circumstances, the Department believes the best thing is for those children to return to school to access the benefits that the school system brings.  The key messages for those schools and children is that once the control measures are in place, it minimises the risk of transmission in those children.  The best thing for those children is to return to school to have the benefit of the school provision and to put in place the mitigation measures to minimise the risk of transmission.  We are aware that is a difficult decision for families dealing with the competing risks in a family situation.  Part of the reason we are supportive of those children returning to school is the fact that this virus is going on in society and the world for a long time and those children are missing out on their educational provision by not being in school.  We are trying to work with those families but the overall position is that it is best if they can return.  We will support them to return safely as best we can.</p></speech>

Schools, of themselves, are safe environments and that has been consistently said by Dr. Ronan Glynn and others.  International evidence shows that child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission of Covid-19 in schools is very uncommon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#L00700"><p>This might be an area where a more nuanced approach is warranted.  I believe that in 80% to 90% of situations expediting the return to school is absolutely the best and most important thing but I know families who are worried they will be pushed into an all-or-nothing situation.  I am worried that we may have families, including families where children have special needs, who are falling out of the system because of the difficult choice the Minister of State has described, in terms of weighing it up.  There may need to be thought about potential customised solutions in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021022300002#L00800"><p>I will put two points to the Minister of State in relation to the school transport section.  I, for one, as a public representative have encountered some difficulties over the past number of months in relation to school transport and people opting for one aspect of school transport, such as the taxi, then seeing it does not work out for their circumstances, changing to the grant-based model and having huge difficulty in engaging with the Department on it.</p> <p>  I and many public representatives have been dealing with the Department on a long-running issue.  It is where a student with complex and special needs opts for a school thinking it the most appropriate for their needs at the beginning of their school journey.  The student finds out that school is not appropriate for him or her and switches to another school after much consultation, then find they are doing well in that school and it is the best environment for them.  There is some issue in the Department's regulations stating that, because it was not named at the time of their first application, they cannot be granted funding or support for transport to the second school, even though it has been universally deemed by psychologists and everybody else as the appropriate setting for the student.  There needs to be flexibility on that.  I cannot understand why it should be the terms from six or seven years ago that determine whether the family can avail of school transport.  In many instances, one or other of the parents would have given up their job to become the full-time carer.</p><p>There is a major issue with no places being available for pupils entering second level education and with children of 14 years of age whose primary schooling might have been delayed because of illness and other issues.  There needs to be some flexibility in this regard also.  My suggestion for the Minister of State is that, rather than having hard and fast rules on difficult and challenging cases of people with complex medial and educational needs, there should be a lot of flexibility in the Department.  I can follow up with the Minister of State on the specific cases because I do not want to go into them in a public forum.  There needs to be a lot more flexibility.  Many public representatives and I have tried with might and main to resolve issues faced by parents and children but to no avail because of the strict interpretation of rules within the Department. </p></speech>

He absolutely may follow up with me if he wishes.  Flexibility is important but there is obviously a policy that needs to be followed closely.  The specific transport issues the Chairman mentioned are under the remit of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, but I can find out the information for the Chairman and come back to him.  On the transition from primary to secondary school, there are practices in place in schools.  A designated teacher from a post-primary school may visit the primary schools to discuss issues and share information.  Specific information is available on open days for post-primary schools.  There are also dedicated induction activities during the first week of term.  There are organised meet-and-greet sessions for parents of first-year pupils to share information.  The National Council for Special Education also has guidelines on transition.  The Department provides continuing professional development, CPD, for staff regarding special educational needs.  We can, of course, revert to the Chairman of the transport issue if he does not want to get into detail in a public forum.</p></speech>

It is a matter we can consider in the coming weeks.  It is a new scheme.  It is voluntary for families and staff.  It is open to all students in special schools and classes for those with the greatest need.  The tuition is for five hours per week over four weeks, amounting to 20 hours.  We certainly can consider that proposal.</p> <p>  The Chairman was talking about flexibility.  Many schemes in the Department have been in existence for a long time and some have not.  We are always trying to evolve, improve and make things better.  If it were felt that it would be in the best interest of the child to have the scheme available in the school, as well as at home, it would obviously merit consideration.  I thank the Deputy for bringing it up today.</p></speech>

We look forward to further engagement on the challenges that exist.  There are many challenges in the area of special education and the pandemic in particular has shone a light on them.  Major efforts are being made right across the country, particularly regarding classes that opened on 11 February and yesterday morning.  We must compliment the people involved, the front-line staff who have been doing great work.  There are challenges we have to meet, however.  We will be engaging with the Minister of State further and we would like to have another meeting in the not-too-distant future on certain aspects of special education.  I thank the Minister of State for participating in the meeting today.  We look forward to engaging with her further on the areas under our remit.</p></speech>

I am joined online by my colleagues, Professor Rose Anne Kenny, Professor J.B. Walsh, Dr. John Faul and Dr. Martin Healy.<br/><br/>There is now an extensive body of international research showing the protective role of vitamin D against Covid-19 and supporting the need for population supplementation at higher doses than those currently recommended.  For example, very large background studies pooling data from dozens of individual trials have described an approximately 10% reduction in risk of respiratory infection among people taking vitamin D supplements, and a more than 50% reduction in risk among those with low vitamin D levels to begin with, especially if taking supplements daily.  Therefore, there is very robust evidence that vitamin D protects against respiratory infections in general.  That is not in question.<br/><br/>Since May 2020, geographic studies have shown that Covid-19 incidence and mortality are higher in countries that are far away from the equator and in countries with confirmed low vitamin D status.  Furthermore, the population groups who are most likely to be vitamin D deficient are the same groups who have suffered the worst effects of Covid-19.  These include older adults, those from black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and those who are obese or who have pre-existing diseases, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  The unifying characteristic of these different groups is that they are all much more likely to be vitamin D deficient.  It is also clear that the pro-inflammatory blood profiles seen in vitamin D deficiency foretell the aggressive, overwhelming so-called cytokine storm that has claimed the lives of so many Covid-19 patients.<br/><br/>Long before we had any data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D levels and Covid-19 incidence and severity, we already had strong evidence to support the likelihood of such a relationship.  From May 2020, data showing a direct relationship between low vitamin D status and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe disease and death began to emerge.  These studies included work by Dr. Faul in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, which clearly showed much higher ICU admission rates in patients with low vitamin D levels.<br/><br/>Are these relationships causal?  There are now several studies published showing lower rates of ICU admission, ventilation and death in those given vitamin D during their admission.  There is also an unpublished public health initiative in Andalucia, Spain, which has demonstrated a remarkable reduction in Covid-19 mortality since vitamin D supplementation of vulnerable older adults started there in mid-November.  Yet, despite the now dozens of positive studies including tens of thousands of participants, there has been no policy change in Ireland to advance what we believe to be an extremely low risk, readily implemented, cheap and potentially highly effective intervention to mitigate this public health crisis.  While some have called for randomised, placebo-controlled trials to prove definitively the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and reduced risk, these are now ethically untenable, they are often imprecise and they are wholly impractical in the current crisis given the time required to execute them properly.  They are also unnecessary.  One need only think of the spectacular success of the workplace smoking ban to realise that not every effective public health intervention requires a placebo-controlled RCT behind it.  As Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO stated early in the pandemic:</p> <blockquote> 	Be fast, have no regrets.  You must be the first mover.  The virus will always get you if you don&rsquo;t move quickly.  If you need to be right before you move, you will never win.  Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management.  Speed trumps perfection. </blockquote> <p>My colleagues, who the committee will hear from today, are not just the top clinicians in the country, they are people of international stature in their specialist fields.  Just as importantly, though, they are leaders who have had the integrity, the moral courage and the ethical compass to pursue this issue and to advocate for policy change in this area which will protect the Irish public.  They have weighed the pros and cons of changing current policy on vitamin D supplementation and they are in unanimous agreement that the benefits of a new policy will far outweigh the very minor costs.<br/><br/>We are very privileged to share with the committee today this information that has the potential to save many lives over the coming months, but we also must recognise that we are all standing in a moment.  As domain experts, we can provide the committee with the information and the context, but the political decisions and recommendations which flow from today&rsquo;s meeting must be the right ones, and the policy actions into which they translate must be delivered swiftly and decisively to alter the trajectory of this pandemic and to save lives.  The imperative to act quickly and courageously has never been more profound nor the rewards greater.  What we are asking of the committee today is leadership, the leadership required to enhance vitamin D policy as a central element of our living with Covid-19 strategy, and to steer us a better course out of this crisis.</p></speech>

As members are attending virtually from their offices and, therefore, cannot see the clock to monitor their speaking time, I will try to advise them when they have a minute remaining.  I ask them to stick to their time allocations to facilitate all members' participation in the meeting.  It is a difficult meeting to manage so members should bear with me if I cut across people who are speaking.  Our first questioner this morning is Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>

I have several questions.  How does one know the use of vitamin D is optimal for a particular individual, if somebody was to ask me that tomorrow morning?  Is there a possible downside?  SARS-CoV-2 infection was referred to, so could we have more information on that?  With regard to the condition known as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, where the immune system attacks the nervous system, would a supplementation of the immune system lead to a greater chance of that condition occurring?  I happen to know of at least five people who have suffered from that condition in the past two years.  It is supposed to be a very rare disease, but as I know of maybe five or six people, it is not as rare as was thought.  Those are my opening questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#B00100"><p>Who wishes to answer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Daniel McCartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#B00200"><p>In respect of the first question, vitamin D supplements are optimal.  In respect of neurological disease, there is much evidence that suggests there is an advantage in optimising vitamin D status.  We have data from geographic studies, laboratory studies and observational clinical studies where we look at people who have SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluate their clinical course.  Latterly, we also have information coming from intervention trials with vitamin D supplementation so there is much evidence there that suggests that at least in the context of immunological problems that could predispose somebody to worse infection, vitamin D confers an advantage.  Is there is a down side?  I will bring Professor Kenny in on this.  There are certainly situations where one needs to be careful with vitamin D but for most people, this is extremely safe.  I will bring Professor Kenny in to talk more about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Rose Anne Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to respond.  In respect of his first question, there are no symptoms of deficiency as such, unless the vitamin D deficiency is very low, so the Deputy will not know whether or not he is deficient as I speak to him now and I certainly do not know by looking at him.  However, in the TILDA study, it was found that 60% of middle-aged adults and older persons in Ireland have insufficient vitamin D in winter.</p> <p>  There is no downside to taking vitamin D up to levels of 4,000 international units.  Our request and recommendation is for 800 to 1,000 international units so that is the next thing.  It has not been reported that Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a side effect of taking vitamin D.  Whether or not Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is associated with severe deficiencies has not been reported to my knowledge.  Immunity is certainly much lower generally speaking if someone has insufficiency or deficiency of vitamin D.  There are immune underlying causes of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome likely.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James Bernard Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#B00500"><p>I would add to what Professor Kenny said.  The safety of vitamin D is well recognised.  She said that we recommend 800 to 1,000 international units.  That is what we give to our bone patients but it is recognised by the Institute of Medicine that safe levels can be up to 4,000 per day.  This is really to emphasise what Professor Kenny said.  In addition to the recent longitudinal study with which Professor Kenny was involved and which she quoted to the committee, we  also have the study involving 36,500 people in the Dublin metropolitan area published last August that showed that 70% of people living in the Dublin metropolitan area, Kildare and Wicklow are insufficient or deficient in vitamin D during the winter, which is a significant percentage, and 30% are insufficient or deficient all year round.  When it comes to people in the Indian community at whom we have looked, only 17% of them are sufficient and that is the same throughout.  They do not change in summer or winter.  That is very important.</p> <p>  We know also that some people who develop Covid-19 get neurological problems.  We have seen this in young children who have problems walking.  Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome was mentioned.  There are neuropathies and, as we know, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a post-viral-type neuropathy so there are main neuropathies.  This is not to say we have strong evidence that vitamin D affects that but we know the severity of disease with people who get Covid is more severe among those with very low levels of vitamin D.  It is important they have vitamin D normalised a long time before they get Covid.  One does not shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.  We are still waiting for the evidence that this may be of value but we know that people with the severest form of the disease have the lowest levels of vitamin D.  We have seen this in the BAME community.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Faul" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#B00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for an astute question.  The effects of vitamin D are essential.  It is a vitamin, which is a vital amine.  It is required for someone to be alive.  The original studies, which we cannot do in humans, were done in animals at the turn of the century and involved withdrawing animals from sunlight and nutrient vitamin D.  One of the problems with human studies is that even if we tell people not to take vitamin D supplements, if they go out in the sunshine, they will get vitamin D.  Dr. McCartney said that what is done in animal studies would be unethical in human studies.  If one withdrew animals from sunshine and gave them a particular diet such as that the famous single-grain experiment, which involved giving animals either corn, oats or wheat, they would not survive.  The animals who did the best were those fed corn.  It was worked out by scientists at the time - Steenbock <i>et al</i>in Wisconsin, details of which I can share with the committee - that it involved ultraviolet radiation of the food itself.  Even irradiating the food with ultraviolet light let the animals survive and thrive.  If one did not do this, the animals would be infertile and would not thrive.<br/><br/>The effects of vitamin D are thought to be beneficial in humans.  In fact with regard to the entire cereals industry in the US involving companies like Kellogg, Quaker Oats bought the patent for irradiating cereals so it could say there was vitamin D supplementation of its cereals.  As the members are aware, Quaker Oats is a well-known cereal manufacturer in the US.  It was based on that scientific knowledge that vitamin D is good for us and people should take it on a daily basis.  <br/><br/>Regarding the question about Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, I agree with my colleagues that we do not have enough data on that.  What we can tell the Deputy is that in the case of animals, on whom we can do experiments, animals that are vitamin D-deficient or vitamin D knockout mice have enhanced autoimmune encephalitis, an immune response that leads to a form of neurologic disease, which is the classic model.  We would guess from the models of animals that it would be worse if one was vitamin D-deficient.  Obviously, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is uncommon and is very difficult to predict but that is what we would say.  <br/><br/>We would also say that multiple sclerosis is similar to vitamin D deficiency and has been associated with it.  I can send the members papers on this.  If someone is vitamin D deficient, he or she is much more likely to get multiple sclerosis, which is a very similar type of neurologic disease to Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome.  I know it is not quite the same syndrome but it is a very similar type of neurologic disease that is affected by the immune system.  I do not think fears of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome should push us off giving vitamin D supplementation to our patients.</p></speech>

We have identified a number of groups that are particularly susceptible to vitamin D deficiency across the population.  This is really a whole-of-society problem and requires a whole population response even though we know that vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in our older adults, BAME communities and certain other communities.  Even in young people, it is extremely prevalent.  About 50% of our young people aged 18 to 39 have low vitamin D levels at this time of year.  It is across the population, which is why it requires a central intervention from the statutory health authorities.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Dr. McCartney.  If it is possible, I ask him to answer them first.  I appreciate others have different fields of expertise, but if everybody answers the first questions that are put my ten minutes will be up.  I want to understand where we go from here and what the HSE needs to do, which is the most important part of this meeting from my perspective.</p> <p>  I want to get a sense of the issues.  In his opening statement, Dr. McCartney said there is an extensive body of international research showing the protective role of vitamin D.  He then discussed geographic studies which have shown that Covid-19 incidence and mortality are higher in countries far from the equator and in countries with confirmed low vitamin D status.

A study of 500 patients from Chicago, 71 of whom tested positive for Covid-19, revealed that a person who was deficient in vitamin D was 77% more likely to be SARS-CoV-2 positive.

Obviously, it is a difficult time for everybody.  When claims are made that we can reduce mortality &ndash; I am not saying those claims are wrong - they have to be peer reviewed and evidence-based.

C&oacute;rdoba is in Andalusia.  It was a small study of 76 Covid-19 patients.  The patients were divided in a 2:1 ratio, such that 50 of the 76 patients coming into hospital received vitamin D in an activated form, that is, a reasonably high dose quite early in their admission on days 1, 3 and 7.  The other 26 patients received standard care but no vitamin D.  The study followed the patients over the course of their admission.  Of the 50 who received vitamin D, just one person, or 2% ended up in ICU.  Of the 26 who did not receive vitamin D, 13 ended up in ICU and, unfortunately, two of them died.  There was a huge difference in terms of ICU admission, which translated to a 30 to 35-fold difference statistically in the likelihood of ending up in ICU.  The public health-----</p></speech>

It is not a substitute for all of the other public health measures, such as the vaccine roll-out and so on.  This would be an additional measure.  When people are at the end of their tether and in a difficult space, we want every and any option to be on the table.  I certainly would.  Dr. McCartney is arguing that this would be an additional measure.  Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Dr. McCartney said:</p> <blockquote> 	... the political decisions and recommendations which flow from today&rsquo;s meeting must be the right ones, and the policy actions into which they translate must be delivered swiftly and decisively to alter the trajectory of this pandemic and to save lives. </blockquote> <p>I do not see many recommendations in his opening statement.  I presume he wants to flesh those out in the context of this conversation.  He says he wants to see action, interventions and solutions, so I invite him to use the remainder of my time to spell out, as if he was talking directly to the HSE or the Minister for Health, the immediate courses of action he thinks need to be taken by our public health specialists, the HSE and the Minister.  What policy actions does he recommend?</p></speech>

We think that a recommendation and explicit guideline for adults in the Irish population to supplement 20 to 25 mcg per day, or 800 to 1,000 units per day, is absolutely essential.  We also feel that higher supplementation may be required under medical supervision in at-risk groups, such as people from the BAME communities, people who are overweight or obese, which comprises 60% of the adult population, and older people or people in nursing homes, in particular, who have notably lower vitamin D levels than the rest of the population.</p> <p>  The other question that may arise is whether we give vitamin D free, as is happening in the UK, to specific at-risk groups.  Do we supplement people in nursing homes, prisons or other long-term care institutions where their vitamin D levels are likely to be compromised?  There are a number of discrete populations which can be supplemented, such as, for example, people in nursing homes.  We know that half of the mortality observed in Ireland in regard to the Covid-19 pandemic has occurred in these settings.  We think that is a no-brainer.</p></speech>

I would imagine that would be an obvious place to start.</p></speech>

The question of whether to supplement vitamin D for hospital patients is absolutely valid.  It would be a very useful intervention.  They are another group for which there is data to suggest they have lower vitamin D levels than the rest of the population.  For people coming into hospital with Covid-19, I would imagine that might be a beneficial thing if they can convert the vitamin D into its active form quickly enough.</p> <p>  There are other groups which are susceptible.  By definition, a proportion of those attending for Covid-19 testing will be Covid-19 positive and in the early stages of the disease.  It would be very useful to supplement them and provide them with free vitamin D when they arrive at a testing centre.</p> <p>  There are other groups.  We do not know what the vitamin D status is for people in meat processing plants, for example.  We might speculate that their vitamin D levels are low, but it is a high-risk environment.  They might be another group that we could consider.  Very susceptible groups should be under consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James Bernard Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#D00100"><p>To respond to Deputy Cullinane's question, the Department of Health recently mentioned supplementation of 600 international units daily.  We are saying between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily so there is not much difference.  The other reason is that our emphasis is slightly different.  A level of 30 nmol per l is a blood level for deficiency and 50 nmol per l is what we normally take as a sufficient level.  At 30 nmol per l, there is still a level of secondary hypoparathyroid and the body is struggling to raise the level.  We have 7,000 people attending our bone health clinic annually.  We aim to get everyone up to 50 nmol per l or even slightly higher because as people get older, we like them to be at a level of between 60 nmol per l and 70 nmol per l because there is a slight reduction in falls as well.  The Department recommends 600 international units daily to bring a person up to a level of 30 nmol per l.  What we are saying is take between 800 international units and 1,000 international units.  Dr. McCartney spoke of how for 800 international units one might see 20 mcg and for 1,000 international units one will see 25 mcg.  The are written in two ways but we should think of units because they are very straightforward and that is how clinicians think.  Nutritionists often think in milligrams but both measurements are often printed on bottle labels.  Between 800 international units and 1,000 international units daily is simple.  As Professor Kenny says, there is good evidence showing that people go up to 4,000 international units per day.  We do not come near that.  Having said that, I take 2,000 international units a day and I do not apologise for that.  </p> <p>  Fortified milk is one source.  Taking a half litre of super milk provides 400 international units in a day.  Cereals are also fortified.  Other than fortified milk and cereals, there is very little food available that provides vitamin D.  Wild salmon is a source because they feed on plankton but farmed salmon do not get that opportunity and have only one-quarter of the amount of vitamin D that wild salmon have.  That was the other source of vitamin D mentioned.  The limited number of food sources of vitamin D is the reason people are vitamin D deficient.  It is a problem for young people working in factories and hospitals.  Paradoxically, the study found a higher level of deficiency in the 36,500 younger people than in many of the older people.  We can also consider the potential level of deficiency that has arisen in recent times, with people now indoors, whether for work reasons or in environments such as nursing homes.  The study we published recently covered a five-year period.  It showed total consistency every year, with levels increasing in summer, although there was still a level of insufficiency or deficiency of 30%, and deficiency of 70% in winter.  It is a real epidemic.  We have observed the highest incidence of deficiency and insufficiency in the black, Asian and minority ethnic, BAME, communities and seen how they have been so badly struck down with Covid.  These are the kinds of issues that worry us and that is why we are here today.  We are saying this is a simple solution.  It is just giving a bit of sunshine in winter when we do not have any.</p> <p>  Incidentally, vitamin D supplementation is totally safe.  Of the 36,500 people in our study, only 21 patients had a level over 250 nmol per l and all of them had normal calcium.  No one had any side effects.  As regards safety, it is very rare to get high levels unless people are taking, say, 5,000 international units or 7,000 international units daily.  It is very rare to come across that.  People do not do that; they are sensible.</p></speech>

There are several reasons for that.  First, there is data to show they have lower levels of vitamin D than the rest of the population.  Second, they will comply with the recommendations because, being healthcare workers, they see the value of doing that.  Third, they have a very high occupational risk through their contact with people who have Covid-19 infection.  For all those reasons, we view front-line healthcare professionals as a particularly useful group to supplement with free vitamin D.</p></speech>

I had some IT problems at the beginning of the meeting so I apologise in advance if any of the points I raise have been covered.</p> <p>  I am concerned that there is no clear advice and no recommendations from NPHET on vitamin D supplementation.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this in recent months, most recently a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister told me that the existing guidance on vitamin D, which was updated in November, advises adults over 65 years to take 15 g per day for bone and muscle health.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Health did not inform me of any advice in relation to Covid and the role of vitamin D in supporting a strong immune system.  The reply went on to say that NPHET had considered this matter in January and agreed that efforts should be made to increase awareness of existing guidance and that adults spending increased time indoors, etc., are also recommended to take a vitamin D supplement.  The Minister is saying that a small amount of vitamin D supplementation is recommended for bone health and NPHET is repeating the advice and saying the recommendations for vitamin D are being incorporated into wider messaging on Covid.  I have not heard that wider messaging from NPHET - I do not know if others have - but it is really important that we get that messaging very clear.  What engagement, if any, has the group had with NPHET?  This issue needs to be pursued actively by the committee.  We have seen how NPHET, while it is doing great work, can be a bit behind the curve.  It was certainly behind the curve on face masks and ventilation and it seems that is also the case with regard to the role of vitamin D.  That is a matter the committee will take up and pursue with NPHET.</p> <p>  Is there a country that the group would hold up as the best model in relation to the importance it attaches to vitamin D in the context of Covid specifically?  Is there a difference between taking vitamin D fortified foods and taking supplements?  Which would the witnesses recommend?</p> <p>  On nursing homes, it seems there is a perfect opportunity to ensure that cohort of older and vulnerable people are taking the recommended amount by way of supplements.  What is happening with regard to nursing homes and what engagement have the witnesses had with, say, Nursing Homes Ireland or the sector generally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.599" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Daniel McCartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#D00400"><p>We have not had any formal interaction with NPHET, although we know there are people on the team who are conversant with and understand the area of vitamin D.  That is well worth pursuing to see if we can get better interaction there, particularly on messaging.  While direct provision of vitamin D among the population might happen in due course, these supplements are very cheap and readily available.  If the public get a clear message that they should be supplementing at X dose in the current context, they would follow up on that.</p> <p>  I will talk a little about Finland.</p><p>Certainly they have done very well on food fortification and supplementation.  We have seen the effect of this in terms of population with low vitamin D levels.  We know Finland has got many other things right in terms of public health policies and health protection.  I do not think it is any coincidence that Finland has shown not just the lowest mortality rates for Covid-19 throughout Europe but also some of the lowest incidence rates.  They are quite considerably lower than most other countries.  This is a country to follow if we can but we are some way off food fortification.  It is not something that will be done this month or this year as it is something that takes a long time to do, so supplementation is the answer.  This goes into the next question on whether fortification or supplementation is required.  At current levels of fortification, which Professor Walsh spoke about in answering the previous question, we cannot reach sufficient levels of vitamin D intake to reach optimum blood levels for immune health.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Rose Anne Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#E00200"><p>I thank Deputy Shortall for her question.  The bottom line is that it would be very valuable in the context of today's discussions if NPHET did more than recommend raising awareness with respect to vitamin D and if there was a much more secure recommendation along the lines we have been discussing with respect to vitamin D.  Individuals in NPHET are aware of the value of vitamin D and the science behind it but we have heard nothing consistently solid from NPHET in terms of a public statement with respect to this.  To give committee members an idea of how difficult it is to get sufficient vitamin D from foods, there was one Norwegian study where participants ate salmon for five days a week for a considerable period and despite this were unable to reach the sufficient levels we are discussing this morning, which is 50 nanomols per litre and above.  It is very difficult to get it from food alone.  We do not get it in Ireland from sunshine at this time of the year or, indeed, during most of spring and some of autumn.  This message needs to get out there.  I say this because I have heard scientists speaking on radio saying there is no need to supplement because people get sufficient from food and sunshine in Ireland.  This is very incorrect and it needs to be said.</p> <p>  Some people ask whether we should be measuring vitamin D levels in everybody and then we would know.  Given the high levels of insufficiency in Dublin, as we speak, at 70%, and 60% in the country generally, it is not practical in the midst of a pandemic.</p></speech>

She has been tremendous.  With regard to food fortification, I want to add to what I said earlier and to what Professor Kenny said.  I mentioned the only two foods that show some degree of fortification.  These are fortified milk and cereals.  With regard to ordinary milk, cows are no different from humans and do not get much sunshine either in winter.  It takes 40 L of ordinary milk to equal 1 L of super milk so there is a significant degree of fortification in it.  Half a litre of super milk has 400 units and there are also cereals that will bring up people's levels.  If children take fortified milk in the morning, they will get some supplementation but it takes a long time to build up.  It is not an insignificant amount, as people can imagine, but other than this there is not really much fortification.  Most farmed fish will not get much vitamin D either.  This is very important.</p> <p>  We have all been in communication individually with individual members of NPHET, almost all of whom we know quite well.  They know of our concerns.  What they say is we must wait for the randomised controlled studies of the intervention of vitamin D but the trouble with this is we would have to give a large population enough vitamin D for a year and have another controlled population not being given vitamin D.  It would be like giving one group parachutes and not giving parachutes to the other group.  This is what we are speaking about.  We are not speaking about something that will do harm.  It is something that has been proven to be effective.  The only reason we do not have sufficient levels is because of the fact we live here.  With regard to fortified food, the US and other places have reduced incidence of severe rickets.  I still get people coming in with severe bone disease and osteomalacia in the Irish culture.  This is the reality.  There is a huge instance of deficiency and insufficiency in the Irish community.</p></speech>

Very briefly, partly the problem with Covid is that it is new.  All of this did not exist two years ago.  We are all learning as we go along.  Many of the recommendations that NPHET might have made last November are changing all the time.  I hope that as the science catches up with the information that is out there we will know more and more.  We are beginning to learn that more supplementation is better.  To back up what my colleagues said, because of the lockdown we have even less sun exposure.  None of our patients with respiratory illnesses are going on sunny holidays, which are good for them.  They are in lockdown and they cannot get vitamin D from the sun.  For this reason alone we should be increasing the supplementation.</p></speech>

It is a fascinating discussion.  It seems that vitamin D is the new vitamin C in some ways.  It all points towards us all taking it.  Is there a link or are there discussion papers on vitamin D deficiency and depression among those who suffer from seasonal affective disorder?  The vast majority of the prison population in Ireland and other countries are men and the vast majority do not get any daylight as such.  Has there been a study on deficiency among this population?  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.  What do the witnesses say with regard to general recommendations on vitamin D?  Should everybody take it?  Could it be prescribed in the same way as folic acid is to pregnant women?  Could we generalise prescribing vitamin D?  What do the witnesses recommend to the Government with regard to vitamin D?  For instance, the VAT could be removed from vitamin D in particular.  A country such as Iceland gets very little daylight at certain times of the year.  How does it counteract deficiency?  If I get this right, vitamin D is sunshine and light.  People who live in Mediterranean countries have a better climate and there is much more sunlight and warmth.  Is there a correlation between Covid in these areas and deficiency in vitamin D?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Daniel McCartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#F00100"><p>I will answer some of the Deputy questions in reverse order.  Regarding the general recommendations, we would like a recommendation for 800 to 1,000 units for all adults in Ireland with the potential for higher doses in specifically vulnerable patients, that is, older people, people who are carrying extra weight or who are obese or overweight and people who have darker skin.  There should also be direct provision of vitamin D supplementation to healthcare workers, the institutionalised elderly and our communities if possible, with nursing homes a priority.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about countries that do things differently.  There is a geographic difference in vitamin D status.  We see it.  Generally, vitamin D status is worse the further away one gets from the equator.  There are exceptions, though.  For example, in Italy and Spain we see much poorer vitamin D status than one would expect because people avoid the sun.  They go in away from the sun during the daytime and their levels are lower for that reason.  We also see much higher levels in some Scandinavian countries because their governments have been proactive in putting in place robust food fortification programmes and very well-communicated messaging on vitamin D supplementation, so they are getting it right.  Finland's population has very good blood vitamin D levels and very low levels of infection and mortality from Covid-19.  Norway and Sweden are also doing well on food fortification.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the prison population.  I would absolutely put that population in among the vulnerable people who are much more likely to be vitamin D-deficient.  The UK has said it will provide free vitamin D supplementation to the prison population there over the winter months this year.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Dr. Faul to respond to the Deputy's question about depression and seasonal affective disorder as they relate to vitamin D.  I see Professor Kenny wants to come in on that as well.  Perhaps Professor Kenny would go first, actually.</p></speech>

Those are just our Irish data - there are other studies - but that is very pertinent.  I will leave it at that because others would like to speak.</p></speech>

There is a trick with latitude.  I worked in Palo Alto, California, for a long time, which, I can tell the committee, is very sunny.  Many people there, particularly those who work long hours indoors, are vitamin D-deficient merely because it is so sunny that they stay out of the sun all the time.  We have seen this in the Covid pandemic, with ordinary workers in China and factory workers in Ireland and across Europe indoors all the time, not getting any sun exposure and not taking supplements because this is the economic group that is, unfortunately, hit hardest by this kind of pandemic.</p> <p>  I support what Professor Kenny said about depression.</p> <p>  As for the prisons, the Deputy talked about studies, but I would not recommend doing a formal study of prison inmates.  I think that would be unfair and possibly unethical, but giving vitamin D supplementation to help them would be very worthwhile.</p></speech>

That is just down to their diet.  They eat predominantly fish, seal meat and so on, which has high concentrations of vitamin D.  That is really the reason their vitamin D levels are okay.  It is diet-related, not sun-related.</p></speech>

Based on the publicity in recent months, I started taking vitamin D at home recently.  I have been taking Seven Seas capsules for many years as well as vitamin C so I hope I will be immune to all the different conditions.  I can afford those things, thankfully.  There are many more disadvantaged communities where families cannot afford supplements and perhaps would not have the level of disposable income to be conscious of these things.  Therefore, any actions that could be taken for these communities would be important.  Would that be worth investing in for the sake of the health of those who cannot buy supplements?  I also have high cholesterol and I take tablets for that, as do many people.  When the doctor takes my bloods during regular check-ups, I often get results relating to liver function and so on.  Are vitamin D levels routinely taken by GPs for any age cohort?  If not, should they be?  Is it easy to do so?  Is it easy to get a test analysed?</p> <p>  Secondly, Covid can impact the lungs and breathing.  Does vitamin D have any other positive roles in other conditions in keeping people fighting fit?  For example, we have not had the winter flu this year, thankfully.  Obviously, that is related to Covid and all that has gone on in that regard.  Could vitamin D be beneficial in keeping people fit enough to fight a winter flu?  Is there any evidence for that?  We are talking about the long term, but should milk or certain foods be fortified?  What engagement with the food and drink industry has taken place?  What would it advocate in that regard?</p></speech>

The evidence from all the studies that were pooled together - 42 randomised trials involving almost 48,000 subjects - clearly showed a significant reduction in acute chest infections, be they viral or bacterial, with regular, daily maintenance supplementation but not with intermittent high-dose boluses.  This, we proposed, may be why there is confusion out there among academics about vitamin D.  Giving bolus doses appears to have a different effect on the pathways involved in metabolising vitamin D from daily supplementation with it, but it does have a positive effect, if taken daily, on general bacterial and viral infections.</p></speech>

I wish to refer to the requesting patterns he asked about.  It is interesting that in the past GPs did not really request vitamin D that much and there was no great demand for it but, in the current climate and with Covid and many of the issues surrounding vitamin D in the media, requests for vitamin D have gone through the roof.  Practically every patient who goes to a GP now will ask to have vitamin D added to his or her test, even though GPs would not normally do so because they would look at the patient and, as someone said earlier, one cannot tell by looking at the patient whether or not his or her vitamin D level is low.  If the patient walks in, sits down, stands up and walks out, his or her vitamin D might be okay, but the issue of the Covid connection with vitamin D and other issues have driven vitamin D requesting significantly higher, so we are now measuring far more vitamin D than we did in the past in GPs' samples.</p></speech>

It has been looked at in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in detail in large studies which showed that it is protective, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who respond better after an exacerbation if they are vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D is supplemented.  Cystic fibrosis is a particular problem because they have malabsorption of vitamin D.  It is routine for cystic fibrosis patients to take vitamins A, D, E and K on a continual basis because of malabsorption.  Without vitamin D supplementation they do worse after an exacerbation of cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>  In fairness, we would not be here to talk about asthma, COPD or cystic fibrosis.  It appears to be a specific thing for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency has a powerful impact.  That is what we are stressing.  I do not think we are here to say that if we give vitamin D supplementation it will cure all ills and fix everybody with every respiratory condition but it is crucial in the current pandemic because of the lack of resources, lack of ventilator beds and the crisis in the hospitals right now.  If we can reduce the severity of people's disease, and it must be remembered that pneumonia is the number one killer in Covid and it is taking up our ventilators and people are in hospital for long periods of time, and if vitamin D supplementation can help that I believe we should do it.  Within the area of respiratory conditions Covid appears to have a very specific problem in terms of vitamin D deficiency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Daniel McCartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#G00200"><p>Could I make a quick comment?  To follow up on what Professor Kenny said, there are other health benefits from vitamin D apart from this well-established reduction in and risk of respiratory infection.  We are seeing it in testimony from Professor Carlos Camargo in Harvard University.  Professor Camargo is perhaps the world authority in this area as it relates to respiratory infection and vitamin D.  In a large meta analysis, which Professor Kenny referred to, of 48,000 patients they discovered that when they parsed this and looked just at people who were getting vitamin D supplementation on a day-to-day basis rather than these large bolus doses, there was a 25% reduction in risk of acute respiratory infection.  On that basis alone and on the assumption that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not differ in any huge way from these other acute respiratory infections that would be included in that, we could argue that we should be supplementing vitamin D.  There are other benefits also.  Some studies suggest, for example, much lower cancer rates in people who are vitamin D replete over time.  I refer to osteoporosis and also heart failure, which is responsible for one in four accident and emergency admissions in this country.  In all the areas of cardiovascular health vitamin D seems to be beneficial.</p> <p>  I would like to touch on the affordability of vitamin D also because the last two members, Deputy Kenny and Senator Kyne, focused on that.  We see approximately half of the rate of supplementation - this is in young women, and I have done research in this area - in people in the lower socioeconomic groups.  Anything we can do, therefore, whether that is a VAT exemption for vitamin D or any other intervention we can do to make it more affordable would be very beneficial.  We have to embed it into the culture so that, as one of our colleagues mentioned, it becomes well known across the population like folic acid supplementation in pregnancy, for example, but any assistance in terms of affordability, particularly at this time, would be very useful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James Bernard Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#G00500"><p>Further to Senator Kyne's question on levels and what Dr. Martin Healy said also, a huge number of people are coming in and requesting certain levels of vitamin D but in fairness to the HSE website it states that we do not need those levels.  We know that it is safe.  It is like if one is thirsty one takes a drink of water or if one is hungry one eats a bit of bread.  We do not need it.  We know that it is extremely safe.  As we re-emphasised in our study of 36,500 people, we did not have an existential level.  From that point of view, therefore, the level we are recommending of 800 to 1,000 international units is totally safe and will bring people up into normal levels.  That is all it will do, and one can take it.  In winter time, 70% of people of all ages in the Dublin metropolitan area will be deficient in vitamin D, and there is not too much difference with the rest of the country, but all they need do is take it.  We only do levels in other people if they are required in particular cases but, ultimately, it is not an essential point.</p> <p>  I dealt with the issue of fortification of food already.  We know that Finland has done so and where it has done that it has made a difference in the severity of rickets and the severity of cases.  Even with fortification we have not got over the insufficiency levels that we have in Dublin.  That is okay.  As I said, GPs can prescribe vitamin D so that is something.  People have medical cards and that would help to get over the cost issue.  The GPs can add it to the prescriptions of people with GMS cards but people must be aware of the fact that GPs have that power.  For others, it is very cheap to buy not only in a chemist but even in a supermarket.  Good quality vitamin D is very readily available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#G00600"><p>I thank all the witnesses for an extremely informative discussion.  Even though I was always aware that vitamin D was good I did not realise how important it is.  I think it was Dr. Daniel McCartney who spoke about the importance of getting out the message, particularly in this very difficult time, about the importance of vitamin D.  We need to focus on getting out that message.</p> <p>  It is essential that we introduce a fortification and supplementation policy urgently to combat the deficiency in the hopes of saving people from experiencing more severe Covid-19 symptoms.  Last November, we were aware that the UK introduced free vitamin D supplements to those who were at risk of Covid.  People could apply to the NHS for free daily supplementation.  We might need to look at introducing a similar model, particularly for those who are at risk and also for members of society who are more likely to suffer from vitamin D deficiency such as the elderly and people with more melanated skin.</p> <p>  I am aware of the growing evidence and reports that study the correlation between iron and the efficacy of the vaccine.  One very interesting study came out this week from Professor Luke O'Neill at Trinity College Dublin.  He spoke about iron and the immune system and I want to ask about that.  We know iron is a mineral that we need for all things in our bodies but our immune system needs iron also.  The very compelling evidence shows that iron deficiency makes vaccines less effective.  Should we be planning to supplement iron as well as vitamin D in the fight against Covid?</p></speech>

We know that iron deficiency is very common in the Irish population, particularly in young women.  We know that around 50% of young Irish women do not have sufficient amounts of iron in their diet.  The research I have conducted with the Coombe Hospital suggests that about 3% to 4% of those women when they present for their first antenatal visit in early pregnancy have frank iron deficiency.  That is worrying because it has an impact on the outcome of those pregnancies.  There are other reasons, apart from the immunity aspect, that are important in terms of iron nutrition across the population.</p> <p>  I am aware of Professor O'Neill's study and perhaps Professor Kenny will comment on it too.  A number of nutrients are suspect across the Irish population so while we are talking about vitamin D today, Dr. Healy for example will tell us that magnesium is a very important nutrient in terms of biologically activating vitamin D in the body.  A proportion of people have low magnesium levels in the population, including people who over-consume alcohol, some older people and hospitalised patients.  That might be an issue as well.  Zinc and selenium are also important nutrients for immunity.</p> <p>  To focus in on vitamin D and iron, we see a high prevalence of deficiency in vitamin D right across the population, in men and women, young and old, among immigrant populations and populations of Irish ethnicity.  Vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous but I take the Senator's point that iron deficiency is an issue that needs to be addressed among our female population in particular and also among our elderly.  Professor Walsh and Professor Kenny will also have a view on that.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that we do not often see iron deficiency in men.  It is not often that one would see such a nutritional deficiency.  Obviously with malabsorption syndromes iron deficiency would be a feature but in the absence of malabsorption syndromes, the ordinary run-of-the-mill person, apart from pre-menopausal or pregnant women, will not run into this problem.  In fact, if a person is iron deficient, it is very important to look into it and exclude things like bowel cancer and other cancers that cause a person to lose iron.  When we meet patients with iron deficiency, we focus on whether there is an underlying medical cause for it.  We ask whether they are passing blood in the urine or rectally.  These are the issues we examine and the focus must be on that.</p> <p>  Professor O'Neill's work in Trinity is very relevant and others have also shown us that iron and other elements are an important part of optimising the nutritional response.</p></speech>

We measured a lot of nutritional elements in the initial SARS outbreak.  At that time we had no idea what was going on with Covid-19, who was susceptible and who was not.  We measured iron in great detail, including ferritin, which is an acute-phase reactant related to iron transfer and iron saturation.  In people who were very sick with Covid, iron deficiency was not a significant factor whereas vitamin D was very much an eyebrow raising factor.  We have measured it in detail.</p></speech>

Are there consequences for people who take too much vitamin D?  I know the recommended level is between 2,000 and 4,000 but when my sister was in the US, for example, she used to get vitamin D supplements of 10,000.  If people take too much, what are the consequences, if any?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Daniel McCartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#H00500"><p>That is an excellent question and one that is very pertinent to the discussion today.  This is really why we need explicit guidance for the population on vitamin D.  There is lots of justified discussion on the role of vitamin D in immunological health as it relates to SARS-CoV 2 and what we need from the Department of Health are explicit guidelines on the appropriate level of supplementation so that people do not over-supplement and put themselves at risk.  We heard today that a number of agencies including the European Food Safety Authority, the Institute of Medicine in the US and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in the UK, are all unanimous that oral intake of vitamin D up to 100 mcg per day is safe.  We have very large population studies of people who have been supplemented at 50 to 100 mcg over extended periods of two to five years which have shown no instances of toxicity.  Professor Walsh's work is also relevant.  Of the 36,000 people whose blood levels were evaluated in the Dublin region over the past five years, only 21 had levels over 250 nanomillilitres per litre and none had high calcium levels in their blood, which is the tell-tale sign that one has too much.  Vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare.  One can encounter it in some clinical conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lymphoma and other granulomatous diseases but those hazards, or potential hazards, with vitamin D will be telegraphed to such patients by their primary physician.  I will hand over to Professor Kenny who may want to comment on this further but overall, vitamin D supplementation is a very, very safe and effective intervention.</p></speech>

It would not be prescribed for daily dosage.  I am sorry that we are moving from micrograms to international units because it can be confusing but when we talk in big figures, in thousands and tens of thousands, we are talking about international units.  I would echo Dr. McCartney's point that we need explicit guidelines for that very reason.  Rare as vitamin D toxicity is, we do need NPHET to make an explicit recommendation and to provide guidelines.</p></speech>

Are there any similar countries doing it better in terms of public health interventions around vitamin D?  Is there anywhere we can learn lessons from and possibly replicate?  </p> <p>  I wish to develop on the conversation that the witnesses had with Senator Garvey earlier about their engagement with NPHET.  Have the witnesses made formal representations to NPHET?  Have they presented to it?  What has been the level of engagement to date?

Someone else may be more aware but I have not heard anything more than that this has been made public.  We also have a number of issues with that report.  One of the first recommendations is: "In the context of COVID-19, advice has previously issued recommending that individuals that are self-isolating or unable to go outside should consider supplementation."   In the context of everything we have discussed, the committee can see how inadequate that statement is.</p></speech>

Perhaps we as a committee might look at writing to NPHET to get a view of where it is on this.  Clearly, the Government will take its advice from NPHET so influencing NPHET is extremely important.</p> <p>  I have another question.  It has been put to me by a couple of pharmacists, including a pharmacist I am friendly with who was a member of this committee in a previous Oireachtas, that vitamin D really should be distributed by pharmacists free of charge and that that is the ideal situation.  Has the consortium a view on that?</p></speech>

While we can look at targeted provision to specific groups, we have seen from our discussions today that this is a cross-population issue.  In the absence of food fortification, vitamin D provision to people through the pharmacy network would be appropriate but it should be particularly focused on some of the at-risk groups.</p> <p>  To pick up on the Senator's previous point on safety, it is really important for the committee to understand that while we have been talking about food, it has never really been the primary physiological source of vitamin D.  Most of the vitamin D humans get is physiologically contributed by sunlight exposure.  We therefore find ourselves at an interesting juncture in human evolution because we all decided to move indoors 30 or 40 years ago and vitamin D levels have really dropped because of that.  Proposing food, at least natural food, as an intervention here is not really going to be effective.  We may get somewhere along the line to adequacy by developing more coherent and effective food fortification policies but we must recognise that in the absence of sunlight exposure it is very difficult to add sufficient amounts to food to make a manifest difference that will get people up to the blood levels required for immunity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James Bernard Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#J01300"><p>If we are looking for a country that could be an example here, Finland would be a good one.  Before Finland went into food fortification only a third of the population was vitamin D sufficient.  By 2011 that figure was 90%.  The good thing about it was that when they measured, the average level was 75.9 nmol/l.  That is exactly the kind of level that would be optimal.  Therefore, we have a country which became proactive with the fortification of food and did not run into any toxicity levels either.  They are the kinds of things which are crucial.  It can be done and done safely.  Going back to what Dr. McCartney said, the sun is where a person will get 90% of his or her vitamin D.  Twenty minutes of exposure to a person's hands is all that is really required to keep a person optimised.  However, in this country we do not get any vitamin D from the sun from October to April.  It does not happen.  Even the little bit of sun that is out there is very low in the sky, and hence food fortification.  Vitamin D is stored if a person gets a lot of it but there is a limit to how long that storage lasts.  That is why we in Ireland have 70% insufficiency or deficiency levels in winter time, as mentioned earlier.  That is why supplementation in tablet form of 800 to 1,000 units per day is important for people if they are not getting a very comprehensive food intake, which we know the majority of us are not.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-23a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021022300002#J01600"><p>I just have a few additional questions.  Firstly, what would be the consortium's explicit guidance to the population on the level of daily supplements they should be taking?</p> <p>  Secondly, given the data the consortium has provided showing 70% of people, especially in Dublin, are vitamin D deficient, how long would it take a person taking their daily dose to sufficiently build up his or her immunity?</p> <p>  My third question relates to a point Professor Kenny made earlier which I did not fully follow.  The other day I happened to meet somebody who was coming from having his prescription filled for a monthly capsule.  I was surprised by this as I had not come across monthly capsules.  Has the consortium a view on daily, monthly or weekly supplements?  Is there any difference?  Furthermore, is there any difference between tablets and capsules?</p> <p>  I will finish by making two points.  The point about wild versus farmed salmon is very interesting and certainly news to me.  There are not many people who have the opportunity to eat wild salmon these days.  It is thus important to get across the message that people are not getting vitamin D to any extent from farmed salmon, which is standard.</p> <p>  The other point is positive.  I was in a Boots branch recently stocking up on vitamin D for myself and my family and I had difficulty getting it at sufficiently strong doses.  The shop assistant told me it is flying off the shelves and they cannot keep it in stock.  This is a very good sign.  People will often just vote with their feet; they can be very sensible about being active in maintaining their own health.  Of course the point has been made by many people that much of the population does not hear those health messages because they are not coming out clearly enough.  Equally, much of the population is not in a position to afford it.  We must therefore be very clear that there must be Government intervention as well as strong public health advice.  I would appreciate it if those few questions could be answered.</p></speech>

We also had data pre-Covid relating to people aged 50 years and above.  The prevalence of supplementation for vitamin D pre-Covid was 9% and the majority were women.  During Covid, it had increased by a further 14%.  That looks like 23% coverage.  I suspect it is higher now over the past number of weeks because there has been further publicity.</p> <p>  There is emerging data that taking large bolus doses, possibly even monthly, may not have the same beneficial effects as more regular supplementation.  It is new data and needs more work.  I personally would not be comfortable taking a bolus dose once a month instead of more frequent supplementation.</p></speech>

Nursing Homes Ireland sent a recommendation to all of their nursing homes to ensure nursing home patients are on vitamin D supplementation.  If they were not, one would generally double up the daily dosage for a number of weeks until such a time as one is satisfied the levels are within the range one wants and then continue with a lower dose of daily supplementation.  That is the guidance that Nursing Homes Ireland has provided.</p></speech>

In other words, one should take 2,000 international units a day for two months and then reduce it to 1,000.  That would be a reasonable recommendation.</p></speech>

While 75% of them were vitamin D deficient when they were sick, when we told them to take supplements and gave them prescriptions for a period of 1,000 units a day, 35% were still deficient at the end of it.  It was better but not great.  Obviously people forget to take the tablets.  When we asked them afterwards, they were not quite clear that it was important.  They said they took them for a little bit but then forgot.  The levels would go up after two to three weeks but even six months later people tend to forget.  That is why the messaging has to be important, strong and persistent about vitamin D supplementation.</p> <p>  How long does it take to improve one's immune system?  Generally, we would say that if one impacts one's immune system severely - for example with a high dose of steroids - it takes about three months for one's lymphocytes to recover from that.  If one has, say, a death in the family, then three to six months later one gets shingles, it means one's immune system is hit in some way.  We think the same is for recovery.  When one tries to boost someone's immune system - say, the person comes off chronic steroids - one's immune system only really recovers three to six months later.  It is at least three months.  That is why there is an urgency about getting supplementation into people now because time is moving on.  The commonest thing that our patients are asking us is why were they not told this last year as it could have saved so much trouble considering it takes months to build up one's levels.</p></speech>

The witnesses are saying there is no real downside to taking vitamin D.  They are also asking for the opt-out model, particularly for nursing homes.  Their figures suggested that one in four of us are vitamin D deficient, particularly in winter.  One cannot really overdose on vitamin D.  It was suggested there would be clearer messaging coming from NPHET.  The committee has invited NPHET to come before us and we will raise with it the whole issue of vitamin D.  We will also have the Minister for Health.  Again, we can look at that.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about a dosage of 800 to 1,000 mcg a day.  The point was made that many people are actually being proactive about their own health and shelves being emptied of vitamin D.  While people are acting on this themselves, we need that public messaging and explicit guidelines.</p> <p>  Vitamin D is one of the building blocks of our immune system.  Several years ago, the view on cancer was that one's immune system was not really important.  We know now from evidence that it is vital and our immune system breaks down cancers every day.  We all have cancers in our systems which one's immune system breaks down.  It is important having one of those building blocks in relation to that.</p> <p>  Is there anything else the witnesses want this committee to look at?  We will make recommendations.  Vitamin D deficiency is common across all age groups in the Irish population.  Up to 47% of 18 to 39-year-olds are deficient.  Up to 60% of 50 to 59-year-olds are deficient and 64% of over 80s with 80% of those in nursing homes.  That is the evidence of the importance of nursing home residents getting vitamin D.  Up to 94% in dark skin or Irish BAME, Black, Asian and minority ethnic, communities are vitamin D deficient.  The groups with the highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency are those with obesity, dark skin and the older population, the very groups with the highest risk to Covid-19.  The witnesses pointed out recent studies have also shown the significantly lower risk of ICU admission and deaths among Covid-19 patients who were supplemented with vitamin D.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses want to reiterate any of these points?  Is there anything they want to ask of the committee?  We all accept there needs to be clear messaging.  Will someone do a summary?</p></speech>

In that case, 70% of people among all age groups we are seeing in winter do not have sufficient vitamin D.  This is the case across the entire Dublin metropolitan area.  That is a simple figure.  Professor Kenny's work with the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, shows a similar result for the whole of Ireland.  That is what we are talking about.  We should talk about sufficiency.  At this point in time, only 30% of the Dublin population has sufficient vitamin D and it is no different for the rest of the country.  This is the case across all age groups.</p></speech>

If it occurs, it causes an elevation of the calcium level.  It is as rare as hens' teeth, however, and certainly should not guide this important public health message in this context.  We are here because of Covid and vitamin D has an added value in the context of the Covid pandemic.</p></speech>

People who have such conditions would be under the care of a doctor anyway and this doctor would advise them.  There is also an issue for people who have kidney stones but their problem is often with excess calcium intake.  Such people would also have to be monitored.  All of these people would, however, be aware of their conditions.  I repeat that even the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and others have said that the crucial thing is to measure is the excess calcium or vitamin D in one's blood.  We did not find this among the 36,500 cases.  That is important.  It must not be forgotten that what we are recommending is 800 units to 1,000 units.  As people have repeatedly said, internationally up to 4,000 units a day is considered safe.  We are not going near that.  We are way down at a fraction of that.  The Department of Health has recommended 600 units for deficiencies but we are saying that 800 units to 1,000 units would give people sufficient vitamin D, defined as a rate of 20 nmol/l or more.  There is not a lot of difference but that statement must be put out quite positively.  This has been done in Finland and elsewhere and is now being done in the UK.  We must come out strongly to say that we need to optimise not only our bone health but also our immune system.</p></speech>

There is a condition called hypervitaminosis D.  People who have this condition have excessively high levels of vitamin D in their blood.  This is not caused by eating vitamin D supplements but the processes about which we were talking such as sarcoidosis, some lymphomas and so on.  The classic example is sarcoidosis.  This is an inflammatory condition where the body creates an enormous amount of vitamin D and it is not regulated by calcium in the blood.  Normally, calcium in the blood stops this.  It is not regulated, even locally, by vitamin D levels.  It is an automatic production of vitamin D by inflammatory tissue.  The treatment for it is steroids and anti-inflammatory therapy.  Just for clarity, the hypervitaminosis D about which one hears and which can be toxic is not caused by eating supplements but an underlying condition.  If the underlying condition is treated, it goes away.  We have many patients with sarcoidosis but we give them vitamin D supplements.</p></speech>

It can take a while.  This is the case when using the commonly available vitamin D supplement, vitamin D3.  There are other supplements which act faster but they are only used in acute situations such as in the ICU when a person's level must be increased very quickly.  When one takes a supplement, one may be anxious to see if one's levels have gone up, but a repeat test cannot be carried out within three months.  One must wait three months before a repeat test can be carried out for the level of vitamin D in the blood.  This is because of the way vitamin D is handled in the body.  It takes a while to get to what is called a steady state.  It takes a minimum of three months and sometimes longer.  While it is inappropriate, we often see requests for vitamin D testing two weeks after supplementation has begun.  This does not give an accurate picture.</p></speech>

There are certainly lamps for SAD.  These use white light at specific wavelengths which are higher than those of the ultraviolet B, UVB, radiation associated with vitamin D.  Even though there is a crossover between SAD and the depression associated with vitamin D deficiency, the remedy with regard to light therapy may be quite different.  The UVB radiation to which one must be exposed to synthesise vitamin D has a wavelength of 290 nm to 315 nm whereas the white light associated with better outcomes in people with SAD is higher at about 400 nm.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I know people who use such lamps in the wintertime and they find them very beneficial.  Scientifically, I do not know what amount of vitamin D people absorb.  People do find solace in them because the lack of light in the winter months can have a detrimental effect on people's well-being and sense of life.  Some people do find them very beneficial.</p></speech>

There is good research behind that which suggests that melatonin is suppressed by the exposure of the back of the eye, the retina, to that white light.  It is very well established that the physiological response to that white light is responsible for some of those better outcomes in persons with SAD.</p> <p>  I would like to follow up on a number of questions or issues raised in summation.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised the issue of opting in.  Under the UK scheme, even though, in theory, vitamin D supplementation is being provided free to 2.7 million of the UK's most vulnerable citizens, it is being provided on an opt-in basis.  That is an example we should not follow.  It must be operated on an opt-out basis if we want supplementation to be effective for vulnerable groups, such as people in nursing homes, our black and minority ethnicity, BAME, communities, our front-line healthcare professionals and people arriving to test centres.  We cannot rely on people having the knowledge to know that they need vitamin D and to take the appropriate action.  It needs to be provided on an opt-out basis.</p> <p>  The other issue I will raise is that we have borrowed a lot of the guidance from the UK in this area and a lot of the evidence our statutory agencies have reviewed in this regard has also been from the UK.  That evidence has focused on musculoskeletal health.  It is really important that the committee understand that the thresholds for blood vitamin D that must be achieved for some of these skeletal benefits are much lower than those to be achieved for immunological function, including for defence against Covid-19.</p><p>Were NPHET to review this evidence, we would need a specific review of the evidence on immunological health as it centres on Covid-19.  Reviewing the evidence of vitamin D in respect of musculoskeletal health does not bring us any further along.</p><p> The other thing to realise here in the context of that information is that the randomised control trials that many people have requested and that we would all like to see in this area may never happen.  Professor Kenny will say that the biggest of those studies is in C&oacute;rdoba in Spain where some 1,000 individuals have been targeted.  They are on 300 at the moment after the elapsing of nine months in that study and may never reach the 1,000 patients.  </p><p> We cannot wait for those randomised control trials. There is a model or paradigm called the Bradford Hill criteria for causality and the evidence that we have in relation to vitamin D and Covid-19 already meets those Bradford Hill criteria.  These are the same criteria that anti-smoking interventions have been based on, which as we said earlier have been very effective.  </p><p> Finally, on the issue of our population, we mentioned obesity.  Obesity affects approximately 60% of our adult population, who are either overweight or obese.  The dosage of vitamin D one requires if one is overweight, that is a body mass index, BMI, of between 25 and 30, is about one and a half times what a person of ideal weight would require to raise their blood levels by the equivalent amount.  When one gets into the obese category, that is a BMI above 30, then one may be looking at a dosage of about two to three times to achieve the equivalent level of increase in the blood.  Even though 20 to 25 mcg per day may be sufficient for most of the adult population to reach the required threshold for immunity against Covid-19, there is a significant proportion of the population who will require supplementation at higher doses than this, including people with darker skin, our nursing home residents, older adults, and some other vulnerable groups old as well. </p><p> That is all I really have to say but as a group we will be delighted to engage with NPHET if that opportunity arises and to furnish the committee with any further information that they require on any of the issues that we discussed today.</p></speech>
